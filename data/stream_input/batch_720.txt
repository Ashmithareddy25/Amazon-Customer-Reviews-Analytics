B00031TXBI|5.0|John Frusciante makes yet again another great album.  There is something about his music and playing that instantly resides within your soul.  The music is real; it has substance.  The songs have a way of existing in you.  It is really a pleasure to listen to Inside of Emptiness.  Some songs rock (\\"What I Saw\\" or \\"666\\") while others soothe (\\"I'm Around\\" or \\"Interior Two\\").  The great moments on IOE are \\"Look On\\" and \\"Scratches.\\"  These two are definite must hears and two of the greatest songs ever written.  \\"Look On\\" has some beautiful melodies and very emotional minute plus guitar solo.  However it is the rhythm guitar behind the solo that really transfixes me.  Just a stunning chord progression.  \\"Scratches\\" is a great song that is performed perfectly.  Not a bad song on the album.  Only greatness can be found.
1594489505|5.0|This book was a beautiful read.  It was definitely different from the usual books I read.  The locale, the history, the politics are out of the norm that I usually read.  I highly recommend it.  You'll be surprised by it.  It's a tragic tale of family, friendship and love.  Absoloutely beautiful.
1400063515|4.0|Ultimately, deep down inside us all, we know that we are only human and that some events only serve to highlight our flawed understanding of our time here on Earth.     In daily life however, we rarely are able to reflect on the uncertainty of existence because we have agendas to meet, people to reassure or please, responsibilties and all sorts of pressure to deliver the daily bread, not to mention our grand design to achieve our desires which causes us to look in to the future with anticipation of the realisation of our dreams. None of this is a recipe to help us anticipate the unexpected or highly improbable.    This is why a book like Black Swan is a vital tool to anybody searching for greater understanding. This is a book that will challenge you to re-appraise your paradigm and demonstrate some of the many ways in which we drift away from the reality of life as it is, as opposed the the life we imagine.    A great tool for the sceptical empiricist!
1596912855|2.0|An extremely quick read with some minor wit and humor.  But overall, there was not much for any of the characters.  The communication, interaction and relationships between all the characters are all a little lacking.
1582701709|5.0|This is a book everyone in the world should read and read now. It explains so much about ourselves and the world around us and what we are truly in control of. It is simply amazing! A must read. And I have also watched the DVD version of it. You just go back to reading over and over again.
6302378648|4.0|This is a great thriller! Great acting from the four leads, but especially from DiNero! A spectacular performance. In the climax scene on the river, the actors really work for their bucks. Also great directing, and some good writing, despite a few plot contrivances that initially get hidden by the actors who create so much believability. Each character is unique and compelling--no one is completely good, which makes them all the more believable. The girl who plays Nolte's teenage daughter was exceptionally good portraying teenage angst, sexuality, and parental rebellion. This version is by far 100% more compelling and absorbing than the original one with Robert Mitchem. It has to be seen several times to appreciate the tremendous talent displayed here.
B000N3AWDE|4.0|I love listening to Celine sing in French. I already have a favorite song or two, as these blend one into the other without a clear break.  I wish there was a way to have an English translation though.  I have Canadian friends who understand spoken French but not the written, so they are limited help.
B000SQJ2SC|5.0|This album is a classic. It is what Hip-Hop should be. Great production, great lyrics without a heavy emphasis on the \\"cryme time\\" talk (drugs, crime, guns, etc.). You can listen to this album from beginning to end without skipping a track.
B00000D9TK|5.0|This is probably my favorite of Celine Dion.  Perhaps because we were staying near Quebec City.  We would listen to it while driving in the countryside.  Her voice is so unique, and powerful.  Yet gentle. #7 Papillon  and #11 Tous les blues sont ecrits pour toi  are my favorites.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|listen to the album a few times and the genius of Knoplers lyrics mixed with his uncanny way of blending the most beautiful arrangements of notes really comes out.  I enjoy all the songs on this recording. Like Brothers in Arms, many songs bring tears to my eyes.  Thank God for Mark Knopfler
B000I5X81K|5.0|This is the best one yet.  \\" You are Loved\\" tears me up.  I think of my daughter when it is sung.  Perhaps it speaks to you, too.  I love listening to it.  OVER AND OVER.
B000002UAU|2.0|In 2003, Rolling Stone declared \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"  the best album ever made.   \\"...Sgt. Pepper formally ushered in an unforgettable season of hope, upheaval and achievement: the late 1960s and, in particular, 1967's Summer of Love. In its iridescent instrumentation, lyric fantasias and eye-popping packaging, Sgt. Pepper defined the opulent revolutionary optimism of psychedelia and instantly spread the gospel of love, acid, Eastern spirituality and electric guitars around the globe.\\"    You know, that's a nice sentiment, but when you actually stop and listen to the songs, it's really a paeaen of conservativism.   notice:    -the very concept and first song (an old time  Salvation Army type band Paul's grandparents might've listened to with glee)  -\\"She's Leaving Home,\\"  a sad song about a runaway told from the abandoned parents' perspective --  are we actually sympathizing with parents whose kids are ony their way to San Francisco?  -When I'm sixty four, a terribly cute song about fidelity and suburban middle class life (whatever happened to Free Love?)  -Lovely Rita, a pop song about having a crush on a law enforcement officer - of all people!  -Good Morning Good Morning, which could be the theme song of a kids' 7AM cartoon show.    then there are other songs on the album, like \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" and \\"Getting Better,\\"  which certainly aren't revolutionary, and just aren't that good.     And Within Without You, while it may add the Eastern Spirituality aspect of hippiedom to the album, is far from George Harrison's best sitar song.    In the end, I think the critics who praise this album so lavishly are really lost in nostalgia.  Sgt. Pepper has come to represent something it really isn't, an era, a feeling, a certain way of thinking and living and making music.     Still, I think the Beatles made the songs that represented the Summer of Love and hippiedom/psychedlia.  They are just scattered across several albums.   Let's pull them together, andcall it, for lack of a better title,    Sgt. Pepper Remixed    1. Sgt. Pepper    2. With a Little Help from My Friends  we'll keep the first two songs, because they establish the whole band-being-another-band scheme, and there was something about hippiedom that said you could be someone totally different than who you'd always been.    3. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds  aren't we being revolutionary?  We haven't changed the first three songs.  Maybe this is what the critics listen to, and then start writing and stop listening.   But what would the Summer of Love be without Lysergic acid diethylamide?      4. Instead of Getting Better, Across the Universe  I've always thought this is the song that's supposed to come after Lucy.     5. Instead of Fixing a Hole, I am the Walrus  Don't fix the hole, Paul, pass through it, like John did.     6. Instead of She's Leaving Home, Yellow Submarine  Stop mourning the runaway, and let's have some fun imagining a cool place we could live, with lots of other people.     7. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite  this gets to stay, being such a wonderfully trippy mix of Victorian circus and pyschedelia.    8. Instead of Within Without You, Love You To  This is George's best sitar song.  Hands down.     9.Instead of When I'm Sixty-Four, Strawberry Fields Forever  SFF almost made the album, and is the natural counterpart to 64, as they are both nostaglic reflections on Liverpool.  That was Paul's, this is John's.     10. Instead of Lovely Rita,  Revolution  ditch the cop, and bring on the revolution.     11. Instead of Good Morning Good Morning, All You Need is Love  was there ever a more optimistic song?  And if you like that cacophany of barnyard animals at the end of \\"Good Morning,\\"  All You Need\\" has a simliar mess at the end.     12. Sgt. Pepper reprise  see #1's reason.     13. A Day in the Life  OK, this may be the best song to end an album ever.  And it is the right mood - the sendup of everyday, 9 to 5 life, the paranoia (was it Paul in the car?), the way one thing dissolves into another...  it's pretty much perfect.        Now, that just might be the best album (n)ever made.
0634022296|5.0|First off: excellently selected chords. The guy shows you exactly which chord shapes and fret positions they are using in each song. The Beatles sometimes used the same chord (ex:D) played in open and barre position within the same song. Makes a difference.     Second: ALL songs in the correct key! Fire up the cd player and play along! If they tuned a semi- or full tone lower, you'll know with this book. Really fun for skipping around from song to song. Much better than so much of the free stuff on the Net!    Third: all lyrics are there.    I wish there were books this great 40 years ago when I began picking!    A simple book with no tab but still a great reference. The Beatles employed many cool styles ... you'll get your rhythm chops down well with this one. Plus you'll be learning some of the best popular music ever written. Timeless tunes. Higly recommended song book at a bargain price. Nab it now and keep it for life.

B00006LLNV|5.0|I purchased this CD already a fan of the movie it complements. In addition, Frida is one of my favorite artists. I also speak Spanish. Anyone in this situation could surely love the soundtrack. If you have purchased the CD without at least having seen the movie or having some knowledge of Kahlo's work, I'm not sure how much you'll be able to truly appreciate it, but it's a beautiful collection of music nonetheless. The soundtrack combines the music of older stars(Chavela Vargas)and new talents (Lila Downs) with many new compositions that, in the movie, augment the colors of Frida's paintings, and when heard on their own make one think on motifs ranging from sunlight to death. Salma Hayek (who plays the title role)sings as well, adding her hearty voice to the Mexican musical canon. The songs themselves are mainly folk, mixing mythology (La Llorona) with revolution.
B00007K02F|5.0|Jane Eyre is my wife's favorite book. Although not my favorite, it is high on the list. What has made it a four-star book for me is the over-dramatization. Sometimes the characters seem just a little too dramatic to be real.   This version of the movie addresses that problem. The drama is toned down just enough to make the characters completely believeable. The acting is great and the chemistry between Jane and Rochester is excellent.   I have seen several versions of Jane Eyre. This is easily the best one. (Do not ever watch the George C. Scott version)!! This is the only time I can remember saying the movie is better than the book.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the first release from what has become my favorite band. Listening to Syd's songs and the bands arrangements on this album in Mono was a rewarding experience. The packaging and remastering of this album were done with much love and care. While I do agree some historical notes and recollections from this time would have been nice its been talked about in detail for 40 years. This was Syd's one true album with the band and what a gift to have. Lucifer Sam, Bike, Matilda Mother and Flaming our fueled with his image filled lyrics and for the time wildly inventive playing. Pink Floyd went on to do bigger and better things but this album is a lasting testament to a brilliant musician whose music really does shine on.
1400063515|3.0|Mr. Taleb's book is quite entertaining with the wealth of anecdotal situations he addresses.  He focuses his analysis on particular examples that confirm the theory that random events control the course of history.  Nevertheless, the little history he quotes is his autobiographical reference is inaccurate. On page four he states, \\"Both sides of my family came from the Greco-Syrian community, the last Byzantine outpost in northern Syria, which is now called Lebanon...We originate from the olive-growing area at the base of Mount Lebanon--we chased the Maronite Christians into the mountains in the famous battle of Amioun, my ancestral village.\\" All historical records, including one written by a man from Amioun, Mr. Chedid Al-Azar, describe the battle of Amioun as a victory of the Maronites over the Byzantine troops in which the two Byzantine generals, Murik and Murikian, were killed. How did this battle become a chase of the Maronites into the mountains? Mr. Taleb is not doing himself or the reader a favor by bringing to historical facts his tortured soul about his identity. Lebanon has been a country since 1943, and Mr. Taleb, who was born in it and educated by it, seems not to accept its presence. If similar distortions run into his chosen arguments and quotes from authorities, I have trouble believing the veracity of his conclusions. It is also disconcerting to observe his incessant bashing of the French education he received in a French lycee which has been the foundation for his erudition. This would certainly fit into the paragraph, \\"A New Kind of Ingratitude\\" prominently displayed in the prologue. Is Mr. Taleb arrogant, ungrateful, and also deceitful?
B000UX6THK|3.0|And to be fair to the audiences at the time who stopped watching in droves towards the end I don't really blame them. I am a huge Lynch fan and I really enjoy the episodes Lynch directed, but after awhile watching other directors ape Lynch while the writing meandered in an overdose of mood over any plot development at all was more than enough for me.<br /><br />Truly I just look at all this as backstory for the amazing Fire Walk With Me.

B00005JLR2|5.0|Look--for those of you who want to know, this movie is great.  And do you want to know why?  Here it is:     Great Drama.     Great Characterization.     Great Story.    All the things that people have complaints about--especially the neo-retro combination--don't matter, because it's all serving the great character relationships and drama that's going on.  Every scene in there that has the great acting and animation that has always been the basis of Disney.  If you can't enjoy the scenes between the Captain, Doppler, Arrow, Scroop, Ben,  Silver, and Jim, I don't know WHAT you're doing watching movies.  Look--don't put a big X over this on your list of movies to watch in the future.  Whatever flaws it may have, they are MORE than balanced out by the great storytelling and direction of those Disney standbys John Musker and Ron Clements.    If you want a solid, wonderful movie, try this.  You won't be disappointed.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|The phrase in the title came from one of the three homeless characters when they found a baby in the trash, but it also applies to anime fans and this film. There are not many cases in this genre in which you can watch a story that has the effect this one has on the feelings of the viewer. I do not pretend to be an expert on anime, far from it, but the only anime production that had a similar effect on me was [[ASIN:B00006HAWP Grave of the Fireflies]]. Just the mere fact that \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" can be put in the same echelon as that masterpiece should be telling.<br /><br />When an unlikely trio of homeless people finds a very special Christmas present, their world is shook in ways in they do not think possible. Thus, a bitter old man, an ex-drag queen and a teenager with a grudge towards her family embark in a quest to find the parents of the beautiful baby girl they found in the trash. The story starts out slow, but it gradually draws you into it, until you are hopelessly hooked. Little by little we come to understand the facts that led the three characters to their current situation and we are mesmerized by their search, which leads them to interact with an array of characters that range from desperate to happy to be alive.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the graphics of this movie, but you need to understand that these differ from the common benchmark for the genre. In the film we get drawings with a good amount of detail in the main characters and in the background when it is close-up. But the general background and people that are not as relevant to the story are drawn with a lot less details. I interpreted this as a way to highlight what is important, but different people will have different interpretations for its purpose. Another aspect that surprised me is how good the tone of the voice of the different characters blended with the mood. I have seen many anime films in which the voices of the characters are a monotonous high-strung dialogue, and this one is not like that at all.<br /><br />This is a movie that portrays the worst and best in human nature, and many layers in between. Therefore, there are portions that are heart-wrenching and others that are uplifting. It definitely has all the components of a great dramatic story. There is even humor sprinkled throughout the story, helping alleviate the mood at times, but not detracting from the seriousness of the plot. Simply put, this is a masterpiece that you cannot miss.t at all.    This is a movie that portrays the worst and best in human nature, and many layers in between.

Having read this I now try to arrange my day so that I can spend half an hour a day in my garden with my cat just doing nothing but observing nature and thinking the thoughts that come to mind.  I recommend it to everyone.
0060763892|4.0|James Rollin's books definitely keep you guessing. I think though that the storyline can be somewhat formulaic, though. His books always sacrifice one major character and its a complete surprise. I wish for once noone was sacrificed, so I could be surprised. I don't know. For entertainment purposes, his books are great.
B0007P0XNC|1.0|The recording quality is so low that it seems as if it was transferred from an ordinary VHS and dubbed in English. Even the original soundtrack is not avaliable! It's an awful edition, which only leaves me feeling that I have I thrown away my money.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Silence of the Lambs is one of my all time favorite movies.  I really liked and was impressed by Red Dragon, but this film is one of the best!  I missed Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, at first, but Julianne Moore's portrayal was excellent!  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Anthony Hopkins, again as Dr. Hannibal Lector, was superb!<br /><br />This movie started out with a scene that was powerful and lured you into the rest of the plot.  F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling is placed on restrictions and has to more or less take on finding Hannibal Lector after his escape.  She meets his only survivor and fourth victim, Mason Verger (a wealthy pedophile), played by Gary Oldman, because he reported he has more information on Lector.  Verger is severely deformed from maiming himself at Lector's request.  Verger is a bit odd and this only adds to the excitement of the movie.  Lector is hiding out in Italy. An Italian cop who overhears agent Starling's request for a tape, decides he wants to capture Lector himself to claim the reward.  Things go worse for Starling and she has to turn in her badge and weapons, pending an investigation.  At this point she is drawn in to find Lector.  The rest of the movie is so action packed, I didn't even realize that this is over 2 hours long!  This has plenty suspense, action and gore, yes, gore!  Watch it and enjoy this it is a fantastic movie, but would you except anything less from Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore?
B000E41MS6|5.0|As a kid, I couldn't sit through the old Doctor Who series - it was too cheesy. I only watched the new series because I really like Christopher Eccleston. I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the show. The acting was terrific, the special effects excellent and the scripts were outstanding. There was wonderful character development, especially for the Doctor and Rose,but also secondary characters also. The plots were clever and I especially liked how there were connections that ran through the series (and actually into series 2 and 3 despite a new doctor). The series was thoughtful, complex and very emotional - particularly \\"Fathers Day,\\" and the two parters - \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" and \\"Bad Wolf\\" and \\"The Parting of the Ways.\\" I geninuely felt bad when Eccleston's Doctor regenerates into David Tennant's Doctor. I've enjoyed the following two season which I think are a much more mixed bag than Season One. I recommend it very highly.

B00005JPWF|5.0|Yes, I can objectively say this is the best film I've seen all year, and its ending, if you are a feeling person to any degree, will stick with you for a long while. Even as I sit here typing this review, I am moved by the closing five minutes and the story that led up to it.<br /><br />Despite a few shots of full body nudity and a few scenes of foul-mouthed discourse, I found 'Into the Wild' to be almost a holy experience, as if God was somehow accentuating the risk of wanderlust, as well as its difficulty acquired reward, while at the same time showing us that true living consists of the relationships we forge. That's the feeling I came away with, and this feeling can be attributed to Mr. Sean Penn, the director of the film.<br /><br />Penn brings to life the tragic tale of Christopher McCandless in a way that I doubt even the best in Hollywood could manage. He takes Krakauer's book and molds a film that somehow waves its petite hands at Hollywood's big brother blockbusters and defeats them with ease. My God, what a wonderful film, and a soundtrack that beautifully augments the film! Penn captures both the beauty of McCandless' trek across America and the sad, horrifying realization he comes to in his final moments.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly than anything else, Penn pushes the human relationship to the forefront and defines love by an ability to forgive those around us. This point is stressed by McCandless himself as he realizes the lesson in his desperate and lonely final days.<br /><br />Seize the chance to watch an Oscar winner before the legions of Saw fans realize it even exists. If you do, you will witnessed one of the great films of our generation, and perhaps one of its greatest, most tragic and profound stories.

1582701709|1.0|I was disappointed that a book of this nature would refer to \\"postitive thinking\\" and getting what you want out of like would boast that a 4.5 million dollar mansion as a positive accomplishment in life.  How materialistic!  Not only that but it was unrealistic and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I'm not one to fall for hype.  Nor do I much care when an artist gets negative reviews.  I got my own mind, so I judge for myself.  I've been playing this album in my car all the time, and I have to say, I really love it.  The songs are just very catchy tunes with very accessible melodies. I hear the criticisms about the sound quality.  It bothered me too the first couple times I listened.  I prefer a more crisp-sounding record myself.  But after a few listens, I have to say I don't notice the problem anymore. All I hear are great songs. I think this is my favorite Springsteen album.  In fact, I'm sure it is.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|THis is such an awesome show. I live in an area where they don't carry The CW so I have to wait for the DVD's to come out. I couldn't wait for the Second Season and when it finally come I was so impressed. It's not the same story regurgitated from the First Season, it was fresh and new. I sould recommend this as one of the best season 2 DVD's out there. Can't wait for Season Three.

1594489505|4.0|A nice follow-up to Kite Runner.  I hesitated to buy this after being disappointed with a few other follow-up books to big successes(remember the awful follow-up to Angela's Ashes?).  You won't have the problem here.  This is not derivative or duplicative of Kite Runner.  It is a very different story that is well written, compelling, an interesting in a different way than Kite Runner.    The book begins with a lot of well-constructed detail.  THe first 1/3 of the book is very richly constructed and highlights what a great writer and storyteller Hosseini is.  The last 1/3 of the book seemed to gloss over a lot of the historical backdrop.  As a result I had a harder time understanding the context of the story.  It devolved into more of a romance novel, and it seemed a little like he was rushing to tie everything up neatly.  I finished this last week and frankly can't remember how it ended, though I can remember the first half of the book very succinctly.    Overall, this is not a diffucult read, and it's informative and entertaining.  The strength of the book is the political backdrop (as in Kite Runner).  Once he stops caring much about that, the book becomes more of a common relationship story and loses some of its unique appeal.
037571457X|5.0|Set against the backdrop of the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War, Persepolis tells the autobiographical tale of young Marji (Marjane Satrapi) in the unusual form of a graphic novel. The simple yet uniquely stylistic art has an appeal all its own, and the story is at once affecting, infuriating, and irreverently humorous, revealing the human side of Iran rarely glimpsed by most Westerners. Through Marji's eyes, readers gain the unique perspective of a child caught up in her country's sudden upheaval. At first, she is absorbed in the excitement of the largely Marxist revolution, staging spirited \\"protests\\" in her parents' yard. Her elation at the revolution's success, however, turns into horrified consternation as Iran is overtaken by religious fundamentalists who imprison a beloved uncle and drill Marji and her classmates in daily school-wide funeral rites in honor of the rising numbers of war martyrs. Things are worse for the denizens of the poorer neighborhoods; the 14-year-old son of the family's maid is given a plastic key at school, which he is told will get him into paradise if he is \\"lucky enough to die\\" on the battlefield.  In spite of the surreal crescendo of tragedy that surrounds her and the repressive atmosphere that weighs upon her, Marji maintains an impertinent sense of humor. When the dour schoolmarm lectures her on the importance of covering women's hair in order to discourage immoral behavior, Marji retorts \\"If hair is as stimulating as you say, then you need to shave your mustache!\\"<br /><br />Persepolis is an appealing, engrossing novel that presents a painful history and the irrevocable, spirited humanity of those who endured it. It provides a valuable counterpoint to the one-dimensional portrayal of Iran and its people that fill Western media.
B000000WG4|5.0|I vividly remember hearing this when it first came out, and it made a huge impression. I went out and bought everything Oldfield had ever done - right back to early Kevin Ayers. Nothing was as good, although the later Ommadawn matched Bells. Buy it - this still sounds wonderful.
B000001DYD|5.0|Rid Of Me 5/5, I heard a live version first. It was compelling, at first I was dissapointed with this, but after listening to it, I was very happy with it 'Lick My Legs, I'm On Fire, Lick My Legs, I'm Desire.\\"    Missed 5+/5 This song is really good, nice mid-tempo song, different, but I love it.     Legs 5+/5 This song is frigging awesome. I really love as much as Missed.    Rub 'Till It Bleeds 5+/5 This is a really good song, sounds kind of dirty and mean (in a good way).     Hook 4.5/5 This song is nice, not quite up to par with the first four, but still a good song.    Man-Size Sextet 2/5 Ehhh...just doesn't do it for me.    Highway '61 Revisited 4.5/5 Nice song, like the music and words (note: Cover song, orginiated from Bob Dylan).    50ft Queenie 5/5 Fast-Paced Rocking Song!!! Love it (I believe it was also the first single).    Yuri-G 5/5 Another Fast Paced Rocker.    Man-Size 4/5 Now this is a much better version of the song. Screeching vilons in the other one just don't work.     Dry 5+/5 Possibly my favorite on this CD. Its a freaking awesome song with the lyric 'You leave me dry'.    Me-Jane 5/5 Yet another fast paced rocker...    Snake 5/5 It is a song that I assume is based from the bible (about Adam and Eve), short punky, in-your-face song.    Ecstacy 4/5 Nice song, a pretty good closer to a freaking awesome album.    This was my first PJ Harvey album, it is simply brilliant. Just a great heavy rocking album. When Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea is in the mail, I'll be very excited. Then I'm buying Dry next!!!

0393327655|4.0|After nearly 800 reviews, there's just not much more that can be said about the content of this book.  I personally found it thought-provoking and refreshing.  I'd like to review it from another point of view, that of readability.<br /><br />Of course, the book is readable in the vocabulary and sentence structure sense.  It is an academically rigorous book, so the demands on the reader are quite high.  However, any moderately educated person should be able to get through it and understand the argument it presents.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book is a perfect example of a trend I've noticed recently.  Part of its academic seriousness derives from its structure.  The 237 pages of text are followed by 62 pages of notes and 28 pages of bibliography.  The bibliography is very welcome, because it allows any interested reader not only to check the author's facts, but to trace his argument back through the sources.  The bibliography suggests many months of reading on this subject.<br /><br />It's the notes that bother me.  They total more than 25% of the length of the text, and they are not really \\"notes\\" in the sense that most of us were taught research-based writing.  That is, they don't specify the page numbers of quotations and the like.  Rather, they are mostly just added text.  The question is, why didn't Harris simply add the paragraph or two in each note into the body of the text?  As it is, reading the book is a process of reading a paragraph, flipping back to the notes to read the extra text that belongs with the paragraph, returning to the text, and so on.  I found it increasingly annoying as I read on.  Harris is certainly not alone in structuring his book this way, and it's a trend that I wish no one were following.<br /><br />In summary, I thought the book was very valuable and well worth reading.  Agree or disagree with Harris, the reader will have much to consider after reading his argument.  However, I found reading the book to be an annoying chore due to its structure.
B000U7169M|4.0|the reaping was wickedly good. i don't know what's up with all this negative talk it's been getting. i saw nothing but positives. overall it was a good film. not bad, or lame or whatever. i found it to give me the creeps a bit if you really think about it, and it was interesting. the whole 10 plague deal. i thought it was very good. the way they explained it and created it. good show. i guess it all just depends on your personal taste obviously, but i know what i like and i sure liked this one. it's about this woman who use to be a minister, but after a tragic loss she's lost complete faith and turned her back on belief. well, her theory is that for every miracle there is a scientific explanation, and that has become her lifes work. that there is an explanation for everything, until she goes to a small town named haven where wierd things have started and continue to happen. this is where the 10 plagues come about. she doesn't believe at first, but little by little her belief is returning. the whole town blames a young girl who looks innocent, but has these devil eyes. very wicked looking. we ask is it Gods work or is the devil at play. well things get worse, everybodies on the verge of hysteria. and the only sensible solution they can come up with (the town folk) is to kill the little girl. well, then katherine (the woman) must find out the truth, what is the cause, does an innocent child die or is she really at fault. every step of the way leads her to the truth. an unexpected truth, that she will have to face it and all the while her life and her sanity are both in danger. very well written, great story, and well acted. captivating and brings it all. hilary swank, great actress, and she carries the whole movie beautifully. she's strong and determined and that bleeds through in the film. the little girl did a good job as well. the whole concept was a bright one and no matter what, i thougt this movie was tight.
0596009208|5.0|I have read a lot of programming books, but rarely do I read them cover to cover. They are usually too lengthy and only suited for reading individual chapters as a reference.<br /><br />This is my second Head First book (I bought Design Patterns first and now also have Servlets/JSP) and it is fantastic. There are several hokey tricks that are very effective at getting the point across for me as a person that learns much better by using diagrams.<br /><br />It also drives points home with subtle repetition. I say subtle, because it always rephrases the concept with each iteration. This is also a key to how it is so effective, because when we communicate, we often get into a rut of repeating the same thing over and over to someone even though they can't understand it. Rephrasing will often remove the mental block.<br /><br />I tore through the entire 650+ pages in two weeks while doing all of my other regular stuff. I haven't had to write an app in Java in over 6 years, but I feel very well equipped now. I intend to get as many Head First books as I can find.
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|It's hard to believe that Bruce Willis's wisecracking NYPD detective John McClane has been absent from the big screen for a dozen years. With this blistering fourth installment of the Die Hard series, Willis seems to be laying claim to the \\"last man standing\\" title in the action movie genre. Which is appropriate, because almost twenty years ago, Willis and director John McTiernan (who returns as producer on this one) practically invented the smartass tough-guy action flick with their spectacular Die Hard, a film that promised--and delivered--\\"Forty stories of sheer adventure!\\"    In the original, ruthless villain Hans Gruber (played by a suave, menacing Alan Rickman) and his Eurotrash henchmen took over and terrorized an L.A. high-rise to loot the Nakatomi Corporation's heavily guarded vaults. Like clockwork, everything went according to plan--except for one thing they didn't plan on: Hard-boiled New York police sergeant John McClane was in the building. McClane was visiting the City of Angels on Christmas Eve to salvage his marriage to wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who had accepted an executive position on the West Coast to advance in the corporate world. When the goons started taking hostages, McClane started taking back the building, playing a bloody game of cat-and-mouse with Gruber and his gang.    What made Die Hard an unexpected smash hit was McClane's sheer style. The sardonic cop hunted down the criminals and picked them off one by one, tossing off sarcastic one-liners and four-letter words while laying waste to the building. Audiences thrilled to this rollercoaster ride of a movie, not only for its spectacular action scenes, but also because it didn't star a muscle-bound hero like Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Willis's McClane was a regular working stiff, a guy who made up for his lack of brawn with quick-witted common sense and uncommon resourcefulness, persevering when all options for survival seemed exhausted.    As he raced against the clock to rescue theskyscraper's occupants, the no-nonsense McClane didn't have time to go by the book. Half his battles were against LAPD and federal bureaucrats who did little except to dither and throw procedural roadblocks in his path. His combination of decisive action and impudence resurrected a distinctively American hero type--a throwback to Humphrey Bogart's wisecracking detective Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon and Clint Eastwood's supremely insubordinate San Francisco cop, \\"Dirty Harry\\" Callahan. By movie's end, McClane had destroyed half the Nakatomi Tower, killed all the bad guys, saved the day, and won back the girl. What more could we have asked for?    Die Hard's premise--\\"the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time\\"--has been copied numerous times since, in such movies as Speed and Passenger 57. It's become so formulaic, in fact, that when the third installment in the franchise, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, was released in 1995, the pairing of Willis with Samuel L. Jackson came off more like Lethal Weapon 3-1/2 than a sequel. The fine line between action and comedy, navigated so deftly in the first two films, veered too much into silliness in the third, with the racial-tension subplot between the two leads undermining whatever suspense the movie aspired to build. That, plus Jeremy Irons's hammy performance as Hans Gruber's vindictive brother Simon, made for an anticlimactic motion picture.    Thankfully, with Live Free or Die Hard, director Len Wiseman delivers a genuine edge-of-your-seat action movie of the kind that's been missing from the big screen since Willis still had a head full of hair.     This go-around, John McClane is back and badder than ever. He's still a formidable S.O.B., still serving On The Job in New York, still barely staying on the wagon, still divorced, and still estranged from the kids. That estrangement doesn't stop him from tailing daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at her Rutgers campus in the dead of night and forcibly removingher boyfriend from her parked car when the fellow gropes too far below her neckline. (Not that McClane really needed to--Lucy's tough enough to enforce her own borders.)    He gets a call to drive down to nearby Camden and serve a warrant on suspected computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and bring him to FBI headquarters in Washington. Just as he's about to pick up his man, McClane gets pinned down in a hail of machine-gun fire from unknown assassins and barely manages to extricate Farrell.    So the action begins. And the action doesn't let up for almost two solid hours. By the time the two get to D.C., we learn that Matt is one of eight hackers who had been recruited to write code for a mysterious employer with (unbeknownst to them) nefarious aims. Once they served their purpose, everyone was slain--except Farrell.    As the sun rises, it's the Fourth of July--and all hell breaks loose. The nation's transportation infrastructure goes haywire as all traffic signals turn green, causing cars, trucks, buses, and trains to collide. When McClane arrives to transfer his prisoner to FBI computer-security agents, he realizes that Farrell is the only one who grasps the method behind the madness grinding every metropolitan area to a standstill.    \\"It's a fire sale,\\" Farrell explains to McClane and FBI agent Bowman (Cliff Curtis). \\"Everything must go.\\" He means an Information Age equivalent of 9/11, with cyberterrorists taking over government computer networks and crippling America's transportation, financial, and public-utility infrastructures.    In time, the pair discovers that the meltdown is the megalomaniacal revenge plot of übergeek Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who used to occupy a spot high up the Department of Defense food chain. For years, Gabriel had warned DoD officials that America's computer-network security was vulnerable. To prove his point, he had used a laptop to shut down NORAD. Rather than being given a commendation, though, Gabriel got thepink slip.    Left to his own devices, technological dinosaur McClane wouldn't have had the savvy even to begin to hunt down the elusive Gabriel. And left to his own devices, wan hacker Farrell probably couldn't have beaten one of his own collectible action figures in a fair fight. But, thanks to the division of labor and the time-tested sidekick plot device, this temperamentally mismatched team is unstoppable.    Charging through a rapid-fire series of action scenes, McClane is a human battering ram, taking out the bad guys and giving techno-wizard Farrell time to hack into the system and try to undo the damage. What a stroke of casting genius to pair the cantankerous McClane with the Mac Guy from Apple's TV commercials, in order to figure out the cyber pirates' next moves and head them off at the pass!    This is a nearly perfect action picture, and just in time, too: I thought they forgot how to make 'em like this. For a movie so preoccupied with computer Armageddon, it eschews over-reliance on CGI special effects, opting instead for a stylized, yet gritty, look that never overwhelms the real with the virtual. Simon Duggan's adroit camerawork and Nicholas De Toth's editing hit all the marks, reasserting the brutal aesthetic of the original as the visual standard for action films.    Like Bruce Willis's forthright portrayal of John McClane, Live Free or Die Hard is refreshingly Old School. McClane is a situational hero, not the mythological \\"One.\\" There are no Matrix-style shots of him plinking bullets out of mid-air as he suspends time through Zen-like mental focus. In many ways, this is the anti-Matrix. When Asian siren Mai Linh (Maggie Q) puts her kung fu moves on McClane, the camera doesn't pan 360° as the two fighters go into Praying Mantis poses. Our hero just dusts himself off, gets behind the wheel of a Ford Explorer, revs it up, and slams her across the room and down an elevator shaft.    Shortly after he launches a police squad car airborne in order totake out a helicopter, he and Farrell find themselves back on the road. Still shaken after being fired upon by Gabriel's henchmen, Farrell asks the seemingly detached cop what it's like being \\"a hero.\\"    \\"You know what you get for being a hero?\\" McClane fires back. \\"Nothing. You get shot at. Get divorced. Eat a lot of meals alone. Your kids won't talk to you. Nobody wants to be that guy.\\"    \\"Then why do you do it?\\"    \\"Because there's nobody else to do it, that's why,\\" he replies.     That's a real man's answer. Only a naïve boy would set out to do heroic deeds; a man has the wisdom to know that true heroism is revealed when trying circumstances put character to the test. To a cop, being a hero means more than just showing up for work; it means seeing the job through. In the tradition of the best action heroes, John McClane does the dirty work most people can't or won't do.    Like last year's Rocky Balboa, Live Free or Die Hard bookends admirably with its original. More than the previous two sequels, it captures the timeless spirit of the lone \\"cowboy\\" with a score to settle.    At one point, Gabriel smugly mocks McClane: \\"You're a Timex watch in a digital age.\\" But when he takes McClane's daughter Lucy hostage, he learns the hard way that McClane is also a ticking bomb.    Yippie ki-yay, Mo' Fo's!
B000F8O35U|5.0|The only thing that I don't like about these Disney DVDs is that they're all SO expensive!!!<br /><br />Some new DVDs are 15 bucks, but the Disney ones are always 19 bucks +. I don't understand it. Can't a kid buy a Disney DVD for 15 or so bucks anymore? Guess that answer is NO.<br /><br />Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid\\" mostly takes place in the sea.<br /><br />Ariel, who is 16, is very stubborn and headstrong, and disobeys her Father, King Triton at every opportunity.<br /><br />She's lovely though; smart, curious and representing for the pretty, red-heads. :P<br /><br />She meets the dashingly handsome prince, Eric, and falls head over heels. She even makes a \\"fatal\\" deal to give up her sweet, uplifting and downright beautiful voice to the treacherous Witch of the Seas, Ursula. But that in turn, gives her a chance to love a human...But was it worth it?<br /><br />Once she gets legs the story seems to lag (just a bit) but one of the highlights was how excited she was to see Eric's world she's been dreaming of for a while. She gets to command a horse and carriage, gets the wear a dress for the first time and embarrasses herself many times. For some, this part will be a true highlight.<br /><br />The movie is more or less enjoyable from start to finish.<br /><br />I'd recommend any kid to watch this unless they have a short attention span.<br /><br />Not as good as The Lion King or Shrek, but better than Pocahontas, Toy Story and Ice Age.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />End note: Part Of Your World is a breath-taking experience and alone boosts the score considerably. Very moving and emotional.

The sardonic cop hunted down the criminals and picked them off one by one, tossing off sarcastic one-liners and four-letter words while laying waste to the building. Audiences thrilled to this rollercoaster ride of a movie, not only for its spectacular action scenes, but also because it didn't star a muscle-bound hero like Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Willis's McClane was a regular working stiff, a guy who made up for his lack of brawn with quick-witted common sense and uncommon resourcefulness, persevering when all options for survival seemed exhausted.    As he raced against the clock to rescue theskyscraper's occupants, the no-nonsense McClane didn't have time to go by the book. Half his battles were against LAPD and federal bureaucrats who did little except to dither and throw procedural roadblocks in his path. His combination of decisive action and impudence resurrected a distinctively American hero type--a throwback to Humphrey Bogart's wisecracking detective Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon and Clint Eastwood's supremely insubordinate San Francisco cop, \\"Dirty Harry\\" Callahan. By movie's end, McClane had destroyed half the Nakatomi Tower, killed all the bad guys, saved the day, and won back the girl. What more could we have asked for?    Die Hard's premise--\\"the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time\\"--has been copied numerous times since, in such movies as Speed and Passenger 57. It's become so formulaic, in fact, that when the third installment in the franchise, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, was released in 1995, the pairing of Willis with Samuel L. Jackson came off more like Lethal Weapon 3-1/2 than a sequel. The fine line between action and comedy, navigated so deftly in the first two films, veered too much into silliness in the third, with the racial-tension subplot between the two leads undermining whatever suspense the movie aspired to build. That, plus Jeremy Irons's hammy performance as Hans Gruber's vindictive brother Simon, made for an anticlimactic motion picture.    Thankfully, with Live Free or Die Hard, director Len Wiseman delivers a genuine edge-of-your-seat action movie of the kind that's been missing from the big screen since Willis still had a head full of hair.     This go-around, John McClane is back and badder than ever. He's still a formidable S.O.B., still serving On The Job in New York, still barely staying on the wagon, still divorced, and still estranged from the kids. That estrangement doesn't stop him from tailing daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at her Rutgers campus in the dead of night and forcibly removingher boyfriend from her parked car when the fellow gropes too far below her neckline. (Not that McClane really needed to--Lucy's tough enough to enforce her own borders.)    He gets a call to drive down to nearby Camden and serve a warrant on suspected computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and bring him to FBI headquarters in Washington. Just as he's about to pick up his man, McClane gets pinned down in a hail of machine-gun fire from unknown assassins and barely manages to extricate Farrell.    So the action begins. And the action doesn't let up for almost two solid hours. By the time the two get to D.C., we learn that Matt is one of eight hackers who had been recruited to write code for a mysterious employer with (unbeknownst to them) nefarious aims. Once they served their purpose, everyone was slain--except Farrell.    As the sun rises, it's the Fourth of July--and all hell breaks loose. The nation's transportation infrastructure goes haywire as all traffic signals turn green, causing cars, trucks, buses, and trains to collide. When McClane arrives to transfer his prisoner to FBI computer-security agents, he realizes that Farrell is the only one who grasps the method behind the madness grinding every metropolitan area to a standstill.    \\"It's a fire sale,\\" Farrell explains to McClane and FBI agent Bowman (Cliff Curtis). \\"Everything must go.\\" He means an Information Age equivalent of 9/11, with cyberterrorists taking over government computer networks and crippling America's transportation, financial, and public-utility infrastructures.    In time, the pair discovers that the meltdown is the megalomaniacal revenge plot of übergeek Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who used to occupy a spot high up the Department of Defense food chain. For years, Gabriel had warned DoD officials that America's computer-network security was vulnerable. To prove his point, he had used a laptop to shut down NORAD. Rather than being given a commendation, though, Gabriel got thepink slip.    Left to his own devices, technological dinosaur McClane wouldn't have had the savvy even to begin to hunt down the elusive Gabriel. And left to his own devices, wan hacker Farrell probably couldn't have beaten one of his own collectible action figures in a fair fight. But, thanks to the division of labor and the time-tested sidekick plot device, this temperamentally mismatched team is unstoppable.    Charging through a rapid-fire series of action scenes, McClane is a human battering ram, taking out the bad guys and giving techno-wizard Farrell time to hack into the system and try to undo the damage. What a stroke of casting genius to pair the cantankerous McClane with the Mac Guy from Apple's TV commercials, in order to figure out the cyber pirates' next moves and head them off at the pass!    This is a nearly perfect action picture, and just in time, too: I thought they forgot how to make 'em like this. For a movie so preoccupied with computer Armageddon, it eschews over-reliance on CGI special effects, opting instead for a stylized, yet gritty, look that never overwhelms the real with the virtual. Simon Duggan's adroit camerawork and Nicholas De Toth's editing hit all the marks, reasserting the brutal aesthetic of the original as the visual standard for action films.    Like Bruce Willis's forthright portrayal of John McClane, Live Free or Die Hard is refreshingly Old School. McClane is a situational hero, not the mythological \\"One.\\" There are no Matrix-style shots of him plinking bullets out of mid-air as he suspends time through Zen-like mental focus. In many ways, this is the anti-Matrix. When Asian siren Mai Linh (Maggie Q) puts her kung fu moves on McClane, the camera doesn't pan 360° as the two fighters go into Praying Mantis poses. Our hero just dusts himself off, gets behind the wheel of a Ford Explorer, revs it up, and slams her across the room and down an elevator shaft.    Shortly after he launches a police squad car airborne in order totake out a helicopter, he and Farrell find themselves back on the road. Still shaken after being fired upon by Gabriel's henchmen, Farrell asks the seemingly detached cop what it's like being \\"a hero.\\"    \\"You know what you get for being a hero?\\" McClane fires back. \\"Nothing. You get shot at. Get divorced. Eat a lot of meals alone. Your kids won't talk to you. Nobody wants to be that guy.\\"    \\"Then why do you do it?\\"    \\"Because there's nobody else to do it, that's why,\\" he replies.     That's a real man's answer. Only a naïve boy would set out to do heroic deeds; a man has the wisdom to know that true heroism is revealed when trying circumstances put character to the test. To a cop, being a hero means more than just showing up for work; it means seeing the job through. In the tradition of the best action heroes, John McClane does the dirty work most people can't or won't do.    Like last year's Rocky Balboa, Live Free or Die Hard bookends admirably with its original. More than the previous two sequels, it captures the timeless spirit of the lone \\"cowboy\\" with a score to settle.    At one point, Gabriel smugly mocks McClane: \\"You're a Timex watch in a digital age.\\" But when he takes McClane's daughter Lucy hostage, he learns the hard way that McClane is also a ticking bomb.    Yippie ki-yay, Mo' Fo's!

B000VNMMRA|5.0|It's hard to believe that Bruce Willis's wisecracking NYPD detective John McClane has been absent from the big screen for a dozen years. With this blistering fourth installment of the Die Hard series, Willis seems to be laying claim to the \\"last man standing\\" title in the action movie genre. Which is appropriate, because almost twenty years ago, Willis and director John McTiernan (who returns as producer on this one) practically invented the smartass tough-guy action flick with their spectacular Die Hard, a film that promised--and delivered--\\"Forty stories of sheer adventure!\\"    In the original, ruthless villain Hans Gruber (played by a suave, menacing Alan Rickman) and his Eurotrash henchmen took over and terrorized an L.A. high-rise to loot the Nakatomi Corporation's heavily guarded vaults. Like clockwork, everything went according to plan--except for one thing they didn't plan on: Hard-boiled New York police sergeant John McClane was in the building. McClane was visiting the City of Angels on Christmas Eve to salvage his marriage to wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who had accepted an executive position on the West Coast to advance in the corporate world.

B000P2A256|4.0|A sad journey through the heart and minds of Adam Levine and the band.<br /><br />I listened to the samples here once I heard Makes Me Wonder a few times on the radio and on tv. I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I was shocked at how they \\"changed\\" and thought they needed to get \\"back on track\\".<br /><br />Thank goodness something last month told me to give them a shot because I liked Wake Up Call once it became a single. I'm SO glad I bought the CD this time around! It's almost as good as Songs About Janes, if not on par.<br /><br />Sure, the soulful Rock tunes are long gone, but the pop-laced rock tracks here are very thoughtful and interesting like the last bunch were.<br /><br />I adore Little Of Your Time which is too short, and Nothing Lasts Forever, Wake Up Call, Better That We Break, Makes Me Wonder, Can't Stop and Goodnight, Goodnight as well as Not Falling Apart. (:<br /><br />If I Never See Your Face Again (laid-back beat, but slightly forgettable) 4/5<br /><br />Makes Me Wonder 4/5<br /><br />Little Of Your Time 4.5/5<br /><br />Wake Up Call 4/5<br /><br />Won't Go Home Without You love the semi-descriptive lyrics. (The taste of her lips; I'll NEVER get over...) 4.75/5<br /><br />Nothing Lasts Forever basically takes the hook from Adam's part in Kanye's Heard Em Say and plants it here. 5/5<br /><br />Can't Stop heavier than the other songs. Little Of Your Time is close though. 4.25/5<br /><br />Goodnight, Goodnight pleasant mid-tempo. I hear it at the grocery store I work at a LOT. 4/5<br /><br />Not Falling Apart typical Maroon 5. But is that bad? Look at the score. (: 4.5/5<br /><br />Kiwi one of the tracks I didn't like much at all at first. I guess it grows on you if you let it. I mean the more it plays the more it becomes tolerable and listen-able. Decent riffs at the end... 3.75/5<br /><br />Better That We Break very solid. I listened to this one over and over again one night. Must be the production. Nope. It's the lyrics. Listening to it now. (: 5/5<br /><br />Back At Your Door not the best track here and goes because it's kinda slow and putting it at the end was not smart. 3.75/5<br /><br />Cover Art: B<br />Inside Art: B-<br />Songwriting: C+ (not to much new here. still heartbreak after heartbreak and few songs about getting over that.)<br />Vocals: C-<br />Vocal Acrobatics: D-<br />Production: A- (Not Going Home Without You and Nothing Lasts Forever are probably some of the best produced tracks in a while by them.)<br />Length: A+<br /><br />51.5 ÷ 12 = 4.291666666667<br /><br />4.29 stars.<br /><br />Overall: B<br /><br />Love Maroon 5 and this CD continues to prove why.

Wonder why you are so insecure about your job; why the politicians keep pushing these free trade pacts even though everyone knows they only help corporations make more money and allow the corporations to exploit the world's populous by having them work for less and less; why New Orleans has been abandoned (at least the areas previously filled with ordinary people; why the times feel so cruel, harsh, and Dickensian? Are you still trying to figure out why after Osama Bin Laden attacked us, we invaded Iraq?  You don't know why we have to cut the social spending in the Federal budget but increase the spending for the military/industrial complex and why so many ordinary americans are losing their federal jobs to private contractors? Read this book and find out why.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jones's third album features her fantastic singing and songwriting abilities; and just one listen proves she's quite a talented artist.<br /><br />The CD track set starts with \\"Wish I Could;\\" this song is about losing a boyfriend to war. The arrangement for guitar is beautiful and simple enough for Norah's vocals to remain squarely in the spotlight. Love the sound effects to create the illusion that there are two Norahs singing part of this song! \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" explores a woman's feelings to spend time alone with her man if only for a little while. The musical arrangement bolsters Norah's delivery of this fine ballad. Norah sings \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" like the pro that she is!<br /><br />\\"Until The End\\" features Norah singing in a highly polished style; and the fine musical arrangement shines like gold! Norah sings of how she needs to be her own woman and not imitate another who isn't truly happy. \\"Thinking About You\\" explores the end of a love affair as Norah delivers this flawlessly; love those drums and percussion! I predict that you will like \\"Thinking About You\\" very much.<br /><br />\\"Broken\\" features Norah singing her very best; and \\"My Dear Country\\" allows Norah to express her regret that our country didn't elect someone she wanted to be elected. \\"My Dear Country\\" has a splendid piano arrangement; and Norah sings this without a superfluous note! How's about that musical interlude on \\"My Dear Country?\\" Great!<br /><br />\\"Little Room\\" lets Norah express that her room is a safe place for her to be with her man; the melody bolsters Norah's performance and I think you'll enjoy \\"Little Room\\" very much.<br /><br />The liner notes include the lyrics to the songs with some pretty awesome artwork. The quality packaging impresses me.<br /><br />Norah Jones turns in another great performance with her third album entitled Not Too Late. Hopefully Norah will continue to entertain us as only she can for many decades to come.<br /><br />Thank you, Norah!
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is amazing. it requires your full attention and might not be as interesting to those who are not interested in the subject. It is very inspiring and deffinatelly worth purchasing. id watch it several times
B000005DQR|5.0|This album is completely genius in every sense of the term. I have never heard a more original album ever. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that it was all sampled. Shadow is amazing.

B000SO7OM0|5.0|A brilliant live album dvd combo, great to hear some of the songs from her early albums, and perhaps a better live album than paris and toronto...  (I wish she would come to NZ again)
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This album starts of with Nikki Sixx talking about an extremely low point in his life.  No album I have ever heard starts off on a bad note, but this one does.  This album has balls and such brutal honesty that it is amazing to hear it.  I think Nikki Sixx really wants to help people with this album and I think he will succeed there.  This album is the soundtrack to The Heroin Diaries book, so it get's pretty heavy and could be considered a 'real life' concept album for heroin addiction and recovery.  There are some fantastic songs on this album that take you from the lows to actually being inspiring.  If you were looking for something different to listen to than all of your other rock albums then this one is going to be completely different than anything you have heard before, but at the same time will be one of the best albums you have ever heard.

B000SO7OLQ|4.0|Fast, riff oriented, vocals like Death Angel, style like Bay Area Thrash bands; especially like Dark Angel, Death Angel, Vio-Lence. Beware: It is not metalcore. It is Thrash! Not like it is 1st class, but definately good.

B000KX0IOA|1.0|This film earned Oscars, as did Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, but I'm frustrated with the copy I received; it comes on 2 DVDs, and try as I might, there is no way I can access the movie on the 2nd disk.  The movie does NOT end at the end of the 1st disk.  I clicked on everything that was clickable, but nowhere did I see \\"Movie\\" or \\"Play movie\\" to click on; only on all the extras, which I clicked too, in case one would lead me to \\"Play movie\\". No luck.  Am disgusted.  That's why I gave it only one star.  Otherwise, it deserves 5.  Hope you have better luck.    Subtitles are available.
B000244EMO|5.0|Predator has achieved though all these years a cult status, due this intriguing, absorbing, bloody but extremely effective sci fi. To fight against an elusive who invisibly displaces from wrench to wrench and is capable to detect (as the snakes do) the human being through a formidable thermal sensor, will convey the viewer to a very engaging portrait of devastation in the middle of the jungle.<br /><br />The final confrontation may be regarded as one of the most extraordinary ones in the history of cinema.

0743298039|1.0|If you loved Jane Eyre and Rebecca, avoid this book.  It's hackneyed, poorly written, boring, full of overused cliches.  Going by the rave reviews, I bought a hardback copy when it first came out and was really disappointed.  Of course, I didn't care for Deep End of the Ocean or Lovely Bones so that may give you an idea of my tastes.    However, if you like Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel, this is right up your alley.
B0002234LS|4.0|I watched this movie for this first time a few years ago when it was initially released on DVD.  As a horror movie, I felt it fell flat.  It featured lots of building up to scares that usually were not that noteworthy.  The ending surprised me and I concluded that because I knew the twist at the end, I felt that I would never be able to enjoy watching it again.<br /><br />And that's where I was wrong.  This movie gets better upon follow up viewings, especially noting the duality in meaning to everything Shooter says.  The scene where Johnny Depp accidentally smashes the mirror is a thing of beauty.  This is a great psycho-traumatic thriller and I highly recommend it.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|THE BAND: Mark Tremonti (guitar & backing vocals), Myles Kennedy (lead vocals & guitar), Brian Marshall (bass), Scott Phillips (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 13 tracks clocking in at approximately 59 minutes. Included with the disc is a 5-page foldout containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, and thank you's. The CD is enhanced - featuring a 5 minute in-studio behind the scenes video for your PC. *Upon initial release, Best Buy offered this album with 2 bonus tracks \\"The Damage Done\\" and \\"New Way To Live\\" (bringing the total listen to about 68 minutes). Recorded at Blackbird Studio (Nashville, TN) and Studio Barbarosa (Bavon, TN). Label - Universal Republic Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Blackbird\\" is a solid hard rock album. In my opinion, harder overall in feel than their debut. Only one single has hit the airwaves (\\"Rise Today\\"), but it's still early in \\"Blackbird's\\" existence. Alter Bridge's debut, \\"One Day Remains\\" (2004), had several hits - \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"Find The Real\\", \\"Broken Wings\\" (and one semi hit with the title cut) - which made it pretty radio accessible. However, \\"One Day Remains\\" also had several filler tunes. Where I don't hear 3 or 4 bonafied singles (per say) on \\"Blackbird\\", I do hear solid track after solid track. \\"Blackbird\\" is a more cohesive and polished effort. The heaviest tracks include the quick paced opener \\"Ties That Bind\\", \\"Coming Home\\", \\"One By One\\", perhaps the two hardest tracks on the disc \\"Come To Life\\" (with a shredding guitar solo) and \\"White Knuckles\\". All are catchy tunes that get your blood pumping. The slower tracks include \\"Before Tomorrow Comes\\", \\"Watch Over You\\", and two of my favorites to date, \\"Brand New Start\\" (more great solo guitar work) and the title track. The bonus tracks are solid and worth the search - \\"The Damage Done\\" is heavy mid-tempo cut, while \\"New Way To Live\\" is a slower paced melodic gem featuring some great guitar work. In 2007, gone is Kennedy's old band Mayfield Four, as is Tremonti's Creed. Without drawing any attention to Scott Stapp (and a \\"where is he now?\\" kind of statement), it's clear to me that Alter Bridge has risen to the challenge (4.5 stars).Without drawing any attention to Scott Stapp (and a \\"where is he now?\\" kind of statement), it's clear to me that Alter Bridge has risen to the challenge (4.5 stars).
1401201911|3.0|In this Elseworlds take on the Superman, the \\"what if?\\" proposed is if Kal-El's ship had crash landed on a ranch in the Soviet Union.  I expected Superman's personality would have been altered considerably, but he is pretty much the same character, just with everything around his being radically different.    Not to say that history is completely re-written here.  There's still a Metropolis and a Daily Planet where Lois works, however she is now married to Luthor.  A major portion of this story concentrates on Luthor and his battle against Superman to keep the US communist free.  Luthor has the most interesting character development out of the cast of characters here.  You could ever argue that he is the story's protagonist.    Other familiar faces pop up in guest roles from the DC universe.  Wonder Woman is pretty much unchanged.  There is a new take on Hal Jordan's Green Lantern, and my favorite, Batmankoff.  For an Elseworld's title, Mark Millar does a pretty decent job of deciding what to keep from the Superman mythology and what can be played with.  Not everything makes sense exactly, but being that its a stand alone story, it grants itself creative license.      The artwork is pretty great.  It suits the style of the story and is never ugly or boring.  The colors are always eye pleasing as well.  I enjoyed the sketches in the back showing the other possible redesigns for some of the characters.  That's all in the way of features though.    If you're a fan, you'll probably get something out of it.  It's a creative re-imagining of Superman and there's plenty of action and historical fiction weaved in as well.
B00005JPRT|5.0|I'm not one to normally write reviews, however I saw this movie back in July and still think about it constantly. I'm only on this site right now because I was curious to when the movie is going to be released on DVD. I just signed up to be notified, as I will be purchasing a copy for myself and for the person I saw the movie with.    I could go on and on about everything I love about this movie but instead I'll just say that this movie has a way of touching you emotionally that you won't expect. I went into the theater just expecting it to be yet another movie but it wasn't. It's a love story that anyone can relate to because the people involved are coping with real issues that get in the way of being with that one special person.    And the music... wow. Just... wow.
0307387178|3.0|Well written by the author but it comes across as deep research into wandering minds who think the world owes them a living.  Meaningless material and not a real story with substance.
0143038419|5.0|This book was wonderful, and an easy read.  There are so many wonderful gems through out the book regarding life philosophies. The story made me laugh and cry, and inspired me to look beyond as to what I need to change in my life in order to keep my life fresh, fun, and moving forward.  I recommend this book to all women!
0307387178|4.0|This is a detailed account of a young man's journey, as imagined and actually replayed by the author, with a \\"been there, done that\\", feel.    Jon Krakauer got into Christopher McCandless' mind as to why this \\"walk alone\\" person searched the unknown wilderness - -From this account, I believe he was looking for his own soul.
1400063515|5.0|Taleb takes aim at those (especially in the financial markets) who predict the likely outcome and how we in society rarely examine the unpredicted. He argues that knowing the future is unknowable. He has covered this topic before in his 2001 best-seller, \\"Fooled by Randomness.\\" Overall an interesting book.    I also highly recommend the book [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]]; you won't be disappointed.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Anyone who knows me knows my unwavering devotion to this film.  In fact it was this film that introduced me to the man I now consider a god among men so it will always hold a special place in my heart.  That aside though I can honestly say that `Gladiator' is a masterpiece of a film, from start to finish, utterly amazing to witness.  It is far from your generic action fair for it manages to embody the audience with emotions which for the most part find themselves nonexistent in films of this nature.  This of course is a result of the iconic performance by Russell Crowe who breathes so much life and realism into Maximus.  When Maximus falls to his knees to kiss the burnt feet of his beloved wife and child my body was flushed with chills for I felt his pain, his sorrow and his fear.  I think it's safe to say that Russell Crowe earned that Oscar fair and square.<br /><br />I've always been drawn to epics of this nature.  The swords and sandals type war films have always intrigued me and I can honestly say that I have yet to see one that reaches the grandeur that is `Gladiator'.  `Gladiator' tells the story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, one time general to the Roman army, as he battles in the gladiatorial arenas just waiting for his chance at revenge.  Maximus' life was going well for a time.  He was leading the army to victory (as is seen in the opening battle sequence), earning the respect of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and in effect earning the right to return home to his wife and son.  Before he can return home though he is given a privileged assignment by the Emperor, an assignment that ultimately causes Aurelius' son Commodus to kill his father and order Maximus' execution.  Not just that but he goes as far as to order the murder of Maximus' wife and son leaving him with nothing.  Maximus of course escapes his own death only to uncover the extent that Commodus has gone.  With a broken spirit and a wounded soul Maximus collapses in the desert only to wake up a slave being trained for the coliseum.  When Maximus hears that Commodus is holding a gladiatorial event in the honor of his late father he sees this as his golden opportunity for revenge.<br /><br />What Ridley Scott has done here is create for us a beautiful and intoxicating story of love, betrayal, devotion and revenge.  As `Gladiator' unfolds we watch the story of a man and his plight, his determination fueling our interest.  We become invested in this man and his relationships.  We develop our own loathing for Commodus (thanks in part to Joaquin Phoenix's fantastic performance) as well as our deepest sympathies for his beautiful sister Lucilla.  Lucilla becomes an emotional catalyst for the film in areas being almost the only mediator between Maximus and Commodus, as well as the members of the Senate against Commodus' rule.  Lucilla once loved Maximus herself but now she needs his help more than ever to help carry out her fathers wishes of handing power over to the Senate.  Lucilla has a lot at stake though.  Not only is she risking her own life by deceiving the Emperor but she risks the life of her young son Lucius who's taken a liking to the gladiator known as Maximus.  Lucilla also has to detour her brothers sickening advances towards her in hopes of spawning a perfect heir.<br /><br />Russell Crowe delivers one of the most powerfully moving performances of his career (I'm still sticking by his `Insider' work as his finest) and definitely turns out the most impressive performance of the given year.  As Maximus he delves deep into his character (doesn't he always) and gives the audience a reason to watch.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a spot on portrayal of the evil Commodus.  He perfectly captures the immaturity within Commodus' every move and that lies behind every motivation.  Connie Nielsen is wonderfully reserved as Lucilla.  With her restrained performance we can see the underlying emotion within her each and every step.  The supporting players also deliver on all fronts.  Oliver Reed is hilariously entertaining as Proximo and Richard Harris is effective as the dying Marcus Aurelius, but it's Djimon Hounsou who really shines here.  With his moving portrayal of Juba, a fellow gladiator, he brings to us a glimmer of hope amidst the doomed affair.  It's no wonder this man is a two time Oscar nominee already.<br /><br />As wonderfully effective as the cast truly is there is no star like the amazing cinematography.  With each and every passing of the camera lens the screen illuminates with detail unlike any other.  The Italian country side is gorgeously captured, the Roman Coliseum (as digitally remastered as it is) is fantastically accurate and the set designs are breathtaking to say the least.  What I found amazing was that each and every actor looked dignified and authentic, which is hard to do when you're running around in togas and fighting in sandals.  Nothing looks cheesy but everything looks as it should and carries the feeling of weighty authority that it deserves.<br /><br />I'm sure there are plenty of individuals who will find fault with this film but this is one of the only times where I wholeheartedly agree with the Academy in their choice of best film of the year.  `Gladiator' is, in my humble opinion, the best film to be released in 2000, and in some areas the best film to be released in the past decade.  It's one of, if not my favorite film of all time, but even I will admit to the biased love that is my undying devotion to Russell Crowe as being the main reason I say that.  Whether or not you worship this film as much as I do I'm sure you at least have to agree that it is, above all else, stunning.d is hilariously entertaining as Proximo and Richard Harris is effective as the dying Marcus Aurelius, but it's Djimon Hounsou who really shines here.

1594489505|5.0|This was a must read after I finished the Kite Runner. Hosseini's storytelling put me through a wide range of emotions all very powerful and I am not a sappy novel reader.

B00005NB8K|4.0|The Southern California band The Doors were a big hit around 1966-1971. The band ended when singer Jim Morrison flew to France to pursue a different career and shortly later died due to his ongoing drug abuse.<br /><br />I'm not old enough to remember The Doors. I hail from the later era of Judas Priest and Metallica. The first time I ever heard of The Doors was when my much-older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, &#34;The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills.&#34; Yeah, I thought the name was pretty ridiculous until I discovered Jim Morrison's reasoning behind it:<br /><br />There is what is known<br />And there is what is unknown<br />Inbetween are the doors<br /><br />Needless to say, I stopped laughing. Another thing that won my respect for The Doors was their song that was used in the opening of APOCALYPSE NOW, which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, that is, not that Frankenstein &#34;Redux&#34;). I didn't know the name of the song so I bought their &#34;Best Of&#34; album hoping to find it but unfortunately discovered that it wasn't on there. Anyway, this &#34;Best Of&#34; album was my first exposure to their music other than APOCALYPSE NOW and their hits that were regularly played on the radio. My first impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone but themselves. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits.' And over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting voice. Anyway, I'm more of a fan of their more artistic songs like &#34;Riders on the Storm&#34; and &#34;The End&#34; as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of &#34;Light My Fire&#34; or the goofy charm of &#34;People are Strange&#34;?<br /><br />I've only seen Oliver Stone's THE DOORS (1991) twice, including a recent viewing. The film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal pain through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted all the surrounding monuments with graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.<br /><br />So THE DOORS is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final five years of existence, an image of wild excess and abuse. Because of this, I was left with a pretty bad impression. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents at the altar of drug & alcohol idolatry.<br /><br />This is only part of the truth, I discovered. Thankfully I watched the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disk &#34;The Road to Excess&#34; wherein one of Morrison's sweethearts, Patricia Kenealy, the guitarist Robby and another guy give the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while generally true, aren't &#34;all that happened.&#34; They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, sweet, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was &#34;the most influential person I've ever met.&#34;<br /><br />In addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man and is itself worth the price of admission.<br /><br />By 1971 Jim realized that an inaccurate image was created around him, the natural byproduct of his fame. He sought to destroy this image by fleeing to France and starting a new life as a writer and filmmaker. Unfortunately Paris was decadent and he wasn't allowed to come clean. He was too famous. He couldn't escape the shackles of excess and consequently died because of it. Both Jim Morrison's life and the film are a pitiable portrait of self-destruction. What a waste of incredible talent.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: The picture is very good in a groovy kind of way. Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and very important to the success of the picture in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award, to say the least. In any event, if you're in the mood for something that will capture that late-60s counter-culture vibe THE DOORS is the film to see (next to the documentary WOODSTOCK, that is). It's mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and naturally features The Doors' music throughout. Unfortunately it offers a very limited and unflattering impression of Jim Morrison. That's why it's essential that the viewer also watch &#34;The Road to Excess&#34; on the second disk.<br /><br />In this documentary, by the way, Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: &#34;To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison.&#34; Huh? Another one is: &#34;The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom.&#34; Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess led straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.<br /><br />CONTENT WARNING: Unless you're a total doofus, anyone choosing to view a film like THE DOORS knows that it's probably going to try to capture the 'free-love' drug culture of the late-60s. Hence, there's a lot of female nudity and overt sex & drug scenes. If you can't stomach this for whatever reason, stay away.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: The film itself: B+ The &#34;Road to Excess&#34; documentary: ANeedless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man and is itself worth the price of admission.

B000002UAU|5.0|I belive that this Beatles' album just shows how the band evolved from songs such as \\"She loves you\\" and \\"Love me do\\" to a much more mature music (don't get me wrong I love all the early songs), but albums such as \\"Pepper\\" just show how great were the four guys together. Let´s just move to the time this record was being recorded...no computer no digital stuff and yet all those crazy and fantastic ideas became true.    I am a Beatles fan since I was 13 years, I've been listening to their music and I can tell you I can never get bored with this album, every single time I hear it I can get to find new sounds, new things that always attracts me more and more to the fantastic world they created.    This is a great album, and although years later the Beatles themselves said that this was a concept album as far as \\"With a little help of my friends\\" I do believe it sounds very conceptual as the reprise of \\"Pepper\\" is placed at almost the end of the album just before \\"A day in the life\\", this is such a great ending that it makes you feel the whole thing is a unit.    Listen to it and enjoy!, and for all those who think this is an overrated album, I guess you just don't want to admit it....they were, are and always be one of the greatest rock bands in music history....their influence is still noticeable and that's they will remain for all the generations to come...
B000SM7QUC|5.0|While most reviews are overwhelmingly positive,  it blows my mind that there are a fair share of poor reviews of this album.  This is the best album of the year!!!!  I don't find it all that dark.  A lot of the songs are very melodic and uplifting.  The spoken word sections are creative and fresh.  Not just another rock album,  but a journey.  All of the songs serve a purpose,  and there's not a filling song in the bunch.    Nikki's book also had a big impact on me as well.  I've never taken drugs.  But I decided to take a weekend,  and read it in just a couple of sittings.  Staying up all night,  having some beers.  Staying up with diet Coke.  Reading that book in my mini SIKKI state was really cool.  The book gave me a glimpse of what it might have felt like to experience that type of nightmare.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Note for note , the album that defines prog rock. Not a wasted moment , not a wasted note. The music holds 30 plus years later
B000WC3864|5.0|Yes, Folks, it's the 665th time \\"Evil Dead\\" has been released on DVD (not counting the 282 on VHS). However, I'm still holding out for the *next* version, the 666th one. Now *that* will be *the* version to buy!!! Until the 667th of course...
B0000C7PRY|4.0|Gee this release pretty much solidifies the fact that Mr. Morse was Spock's Beard. I will continue to buy the Beard's stuff , hopefully it will continue to grow after Morse's departure...but this release makes me wonder. A fantastic blend of all that made that band great. Okay , he's a Christian mow , how many other releases have you overlooked lyrics on because of talent? Great disc...period.
B000VI04HK|3.0|The 2-disc CD portion of this collection is worth the price alone, however the live DVD was a disappointment.  The material on the DVD is a track-for-track carbon copy of the material on the CD's...no problem there, though it would've been nice to have had some bonus material included.  The problem with the DVD is that theres a pan or cut on every beat which makes for quite a frenetic viewing experience.  Guess thats the latest in cutting edge, artsy film school technique...made me nauseous though.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Yeah , nice sequencing. Great songs. But really , can ANY music collection be complete without every album from the Beatles ? Maybe if you weren't around for all the fervor , but I can't even listen to the \\"red and blue\\" comps from vinyl days of yore. There you go.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|Aside from being one of the Clash's arguably best albums, this is also one of the best all-time rock and roll albums.  If you are just getting into the Clash, get this one.  It is a perfect blend of rock, punk, reggae, country, and swing.  London Calling combines everything into an album no rock and roll fan should be without.  My personal favorites include \\"Brand New Cadillac,\\" \\"Hateful,\\" \\"Rudie Can't Fail,\\" \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" \\"Lost in the Supermarket,\\" \\"Clampdown,\\" \\"Koka Kola,\\" \\"Revolution Rock,\\" and \\"Train in Vain.\\"  Every song on this album feels like a hit, yet only \\"Train in Vain\\" and \\"London Calling\\" were, albeit nominal hits only.  From the cover of Paul Simonon smashing his bass in anger to the last twangy notes of the \\"secret track\\" of \\"Train in Vain,\\" London Calling epitomizes pure rock'n'roll.  The Clash were hot and tight, at the peak of their career, and the album they produced during this time exhibits those qualities.  The rest of this particular package is worth the extra money.  The first disc is the album (two vinyl records squished onto one CD), the second disc is demo work, on which you can see the beginnings of the great songs, and the third disc is a DVD which includes an excellent documentary about the process of making London Calling, as well as some of the best live clips of the Clash performing such standards as \\"Clampdown,\\" and \\"Train in Vain.\\"  Interesting note about those two videos - pay attention to just how loud Mick Jones's guitar is - you can barely hear Joe playing at all!  This album changed my life, and I hope the same happens to someone else someday, too.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|Okay,, the subject matter is \\"controversial\\".So what ? The music's the thing. Hard , heavy , very entertaining. Take the lyrics for one person's thoughts / opinions and ENJOY the quality of the musicianship.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Why do we have to wait so long for this amazing dvd-s to appeare.I sat and enjoy it to the end,and then I wish it was more.For full 5 stars the comments between song should have been gatherd in one place on the dvd.Fun to here about Linda Rondstardt and June Carter.A good investment.
B00065MDS6|5.0|Track 5 (or side two , from days of vinyl gone by) is CLASSIC prog. Experimental and melodic at the same time , while incorporating extended musical passages from instrumentation not normally found on a prog recording. (Trumpet ?????) . As good a side of an album as anything Crimson.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I ran into this series quite by accident and what a treasure it is.  This show has intelligent writing and storylines, excellent acting, great editing, and great music.  I am a discerning and critical TV/Movie watcher and particularly skeptical of the sci-fi genre.  But you don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this series.  It's about family relationships, growth, fears, and hopes.  It's really far above the usual TV tripe.  My recommendation:  buy the series and watch the ongoing TV show.  You won't be disappointed.
B00009UW0N|4.0|It's weirding watching Halloween so many years after it first came out since audiences have gotten a little bit more used to certain things. What was edgy and outright terrifying then seems rather tame now. Not that Halloween isn't a badly made horror movie; in fact it's rather impressive given its budget (300,000) and its shooting schedule (less than a month) but at the same time it didn't chill me to the bone like everyone said it would. Maybe the 1978 version of me would've found this frightening but now, it's just really good.<br /><br />Dr. Sam Loomis finds out his patient for several years has escaped from the hospital and is on his way back home. Arriving in the town of Haddonfield, he builds an obsession with high school student/babysitter Laurie Strode who keeps seeing him around staring at her or following her in his car. The man, dubbed \\"the Shape\\", continues to harass Laurie and her friends and Laurie has to stop him, even if, as Dr. Loomis says, he's just plain evil.<br /><br />For me personally, this is the kind of film where I appreciate its contribution and staying power to horror rather than love the film itself. At times the film focuses too much on \\"the Shape\\" following Laurie around and while creepy in and of itself, after awhile you feel like \\"alright already, he's following her, we get it\\" but audiences then probably found it unsettling and there's probably people nowadays that feel that way too. It's also, thankfully, not that gory, going for more of an atmosphere and tension to keep you on your toes and luckily, it's well-done.<br /><br />The other part that makes the film work so successfully is the music. While at times I felt it was overused, I couldn't knock it completely since it's so eerily catchy that it's just pointless to complain. The other is Jamie Lee Curtis who's quite good in a non-showy role and the whole idea of \\"the Shape\\" is familiar although he's effective. But like a lot of horror movies, the rest of the characters, aside from Donald Pleasance's character, are just simply bodies to stick knives in so they don't really feel like full characters but we can't all have deep characters all the time.<br /><br />This film, like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th can be partially blamed for the total formulaic and lazy approach to horror but the originals are always the best and here it's the same thing.character, are just simply bodies to stick knives in so they don't really feel like full characters but we can't all have deep characters all the time.

0743277457|2.0|I have to agree with the previous reviewer. The title and author both intriqued me. I was familiar with Josh Waitzkin and thought it was really interesting that he bacame a martial arts champion after his success at chess. I was very eager to read this book and hoped it would be  insightful. I found myself wanting to like the book but in reality its just not that good. It is mostly his biography and all the things he has done including his accomplishments and disappointments. It could be called \\"The Art of Work\\" because basically he has the ability to spend thousands of hours on various chess and martial art techniques. He obvioulsy is not married, does not have kids and has plenty of money to take lessons from every conceivable master at whatever he wants to learn. It also helps to live in NYC where everything is available. I think it is more a case of someone who has always had an unbelievable ability to concentrate and focus. He said he could do it even at six years old. I got sucked in by the title. I guess it worked I bought the book. His competitivness makes me wonder now if he had authors and freinds give great reveiws on Amazon to help him sell the book!
B000F48D3C|5.0|I first saw BHD because I am a Ridley Scott fan. When the \\"incident\\" in Somalia actually happened, I could not bring myself to watch the news footage. The movie somehow put it on a level that made it accessible to me even though the pain was intense. Definitely on a par with \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Disney restored this classic perfectly.  Since getting an HDTV and HD DVD player, I've found that most of my standard DVDs do not look so great...however, this one looks beautiful.
B000VH3FV8|3.0|I agree with the other reviews.  It's good for the average fan but not die-hards like me who know what the rare songs are like \\"the thrill I'm in\\" should have been included here and the liner lists that \\"there's only you\\" was previously unreleased.  On CD maybe but I have the vinyl version of the song on the soundtrack to the movie \\"made in heaven\\". they should have included the remix to \\"I know\\" where he did completely new vocals and melody. Speaking of which, don't get excited about the alternate version of \\"Anyone who had a heart\\". It's lackluster. It's more like a rehersal. This doesn't even have his duet with Janet Jackson.  I would have saved money if I had just downloaded the songs I don't already have and paid 99cents per song.  It would've been less than the cost of this box set.
B000U7169M|5.0|I am not understanding the bad reviews being dished out onto this film. In fact, I almost didn't watch it because of them. I am so happy that I opted to ignore the negative hype. I enjoyed this movie immensely! Swank's character had been dealt a faith destroying event in her life and became a witch-hunter of miracles. God brings her back by giving her the real deal. This was just a fantastic movie and I do not want to spoil it for others by saying too much. Just please watch it without the influence of the bad reviews.
B000002VCQ|4.0|I have to agree that this is a five star album, being her best.  But there is a reason I am giving this CD 4 stars.  Hasn't anyone noticed that The Greatest Love Of All is not the version that was on the original LP.  The version on this CD is the same song we always hear on the radio.  The version on the original LP had a more simplistic feel, with soft piano chords and Whitney's voice brilliantly displayed.  This original version from the LP is FAR SUPERIOR to version on this CD, or the greatest hits collection.  Again, those versions of the song are the radio version.  You have my word I am not lying to you.  Actually, the LP version did appear on the original CD release from the 1980's.  Mastering is one thing (as this CD really has to be remastered as well as the second album, both her best works), but not having the original version of a song that was released on the album is another.  It's time to remaster the album as it was originally released, and to make everyone comfortable, put the radio version as a bonus from the prettiest female singer of 1980s and 1990s.  Thanks for reading, Joseph
B000002UZ1|5.0|I was born in '65. So i am a second generation fan. I had stolen certian singles and albums from my older brothers. But thier impact was still fragmented being so young. I sat listening to Lennons \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" one lazy late afternoon, and had no idea this guy was a Beatle! But it was these collections, \\"62-66\\" and \\"67-70\\" that made them accessible to me. It was like hearing a number one song, one right after the other. Thier music changed so dramatically in 6 years that a young listener can get confused with the different variations in sound. It's a little tough for some to go from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". These compilations help smooth out the transition.     My original copies are long gone, and i don't own them on CD(i do have EVERTHING else though). But The Beatles have brought such love and happiness to my life, and this album was thier original love letter to me.
B000SM7QUC|3.0|This is a pretty accurate soundtrack to the book.  The music is very dark and some of the lyrics really paint the picture of Nikki Sixx's life as a heroin addict.  There are a few songs that I really like, but most of them are just too sad to listen to.
B000002IGP|1.0|You know there is something wrong with the music world when you listen to Ratt. This album doesn't hold the test of time. No shock when it comes to Stephen Pearcy's talentless screeching vocals and Demartini's boring riffage. Don Dokken and George Lynch might have to give them lessons:    1. Wanted Man - Nobody wants Stephen Pearcy. More Ratt lies!  2. You're In Trouble - Your ears are in trouble when they hear this crappy song.  3. Round And Round - Round and Round, Ratt's career went nowhere and I'll tell you why: they suck!  4. In Your Direction - Yep, in your ears. Be sure to cork it when you listen to this song.  5. She Wants Money - Who doesn't? Pearcy is a genius!  6. Lack Of Communication - You can tell by listening to the music  7. Back For More - back for more crappy songs!  8. The Morning After - yeah, your ears have a nasty hangover after listening to this album  9. I'm Insane - No Stephen, you're talentless.  10. Scene Of The Crime - Yes, this CD is the scene of the crime. Finally, Stephen grasps the concept of Ratt!
0743486285|3.0|This book makes me feel sick.  It turns my stomach to think that people are actually willing to put themselves through such torture.  My sister is a heroin addict and after reading this book, I kinda get the idea of what her life must be like.  It's odd that they don't see it as a problem, that it just becomes \\"normal\\" life, and it's even odder that they don't get help to get away from the drugs.  Well done to Nikki for finally connecting the dots and making his life a life worth living, and thank you to him for letting the world see what not to do!  This book really opened my eyes to the life of an addict.  It's well written and very descriptive...almost to the point of repulsion.  If you want to keep your kids off drugs, then read them this book as a bedtime story!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great concept, great characters, great humor, and great storylines.  This is one of those shows that both my husband and I adored, and that's rare.  We have the DVDs of course, but it's so sad there'll never be any new episodes. I grieved when this series was canceled.
B000HIVQLW|5.0|I have to give this 5 stars because there is no such thing as Floyd music that isn't 5 stars in one way or another.    While it is certain almost every Floyd fan will have some nit to pick with the choices in this selection, it is far better than most compilation albums.    Lonnie made a very astute observation:    \\"I think it is a nearly bizarre truth that there is almost no such thing as bad Pink Floyd music. There is weak Pink Floyd music, and Pink Floyd music that is difficult to appreciate. However, Pink Floyd at their worst is still musically a force.\\"    I agree 100%.    One thing this CD will do is create more Floyd Fans.  If you buy anyone their first Floyd Album, it should be this one.  It will almost certainly press them to buy other works.    Some would argue that DSOTM would be a better choice.  Maybe Wish You Were Here.    Maybe... But I don't think so.  This CD set gives a well rounded representation of what Pink Floyd is, and given that Pink Floyd is a complex group musically, this is a good thing IMHO.    I just realized this is for a \\"Special Edition\\".  I have the original 2000 release.  What are the differences?
0385751060|4.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas  By John Boyne    The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a historical fiction novel that involves friendship, and growing up. Bruno is a nine year old boy growing up in Berlin, Germany in the 1940's. His father has a very important job, and is quite wealthy. Bruno is oblivious to everything his father does in his job; all he knows is that he is working for a brilliantly wealthy man named \\"The Fury.\\"    Bruno and his family are forced to move; so that, his father becomes more powerful in the eyes of his boss. Bruno is devastated, and has no idea what to do with himself in such a horrible place. One day, he comes to a fence, not just any fence, but the one in his backyard, and there's thousands of people behind it. What would be so important about Bruno's father's job that made the whole family move? But most importantly, why are there so many people behind the fence, and why do they seem so far away?    I had a great time reading The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, and I couldn't put it down. I had to read a few parts over just to get the full impact and meaning of it all, but I loved this book because it was touching and really made me think. Great for all ages but perfect for the people with a tender heart, and a love for history. It kept me guessing until the very end. It was a shocking heart breaker, and it defiantly opened the door to more thoughts and ideas.   ~AJ
B00000DGUY|1.0|Dire Straits were a very talented band who made some decent music.  Unfortunately this collection leaves off two of their strongest songs, \\"Skateaway\\" and \\"Industrial Disease\\" (three, if you count \\"Solid Rock\\") - and even more outrageous is the editing out the second verse of \\"Money For Nothing.\\"  No warning on the label?  Big-time cave-in to the evil forces of political correctness!<br /><br />A better introduction to the band would be to just buy the album \\"Making Movies.\\"  They haven't made a decent greatest hits collection for Dire Straits, and they probably never will :(
B000ICLRJ8|4.0|I bought this movie because I just love the opening scene where the F18 tryes to get rid off two sam's. In HD is even better. I recommend it very much.
074356619X|5.0|I purchased the book and the CD's together. I couldn't put the book down!Since I read it so fast, I feel the CD's are a reinforcement,plugging in the areas where the written word didn't impact me. I listen while driving, and find new things in the content all the time. What a delight to listen to. I'm finding things are coming to me,actually without that much effort on my part. I've NEVER been SO conscious in all my life! It's commanding that we live a full life in all areas, to evolve into our higher self. Definitly gives you the how and why and the ability to get into the flow and act on our instincts. I can't stop telling people about this!
0143038419|3.0|The beginning and the end of the book was interesting and was a fast read.  The middle of the book, when she was in India was way too slow to read and did not hold my interest.
0345494997|5.0|It happens every day:  two individuals fall in love, though each is married to another.  Secrets are discovered, lives change, families are broken apart.  But when one of the two is a local celebrity, the affair also makes daily headlines.  What must Life be like when you are true to your heart, but the whole world seems to be conspiring against you and your partner?  Why must your every move be broadcast to the American public?<br /><br />This fictionalized account -- for we'll never know the complete real-life particulars -- documents the relationship of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney.  Mamah is a dutiful wife and mother of two, a University of Michigan graduate and a socially active and intelligent woman.  When she and her husband decide to build their own house in Oak Park, Illinois, they hire local architect Frank Wright to design their prairie-style home.  In the process, Mamah and Frank begin to spend time together, sharing meaningful conversations that turn into something quite different.  Frank is married and has six children of his own, and his wife refuses to grant him a divorce.  The two lovers travel to Europe and eventually return to settle down near Wright's first home in Spring Green, Wisconsin.  While Frank focuses on architecture, Mamah writes and translates Swedish feminist philosophy into American English.  They see their children from time to time.  Discounting some financial difficulties, they seem to have created an idyllic existence together.  For a time.<br /><br />I toured the Taliesin grounds (but not the residence) in Wisconsin, in the late 1990s.  I vaguely remember being told about what happened there in 1914, but only in general terms.  It's such a beautiful place -- too restful to be associated with such a horrible tragedy.  Now that I have read \\"Loving Frank,\\" I'd like to go back.  That trip will be more contemplative than my initial visit was.<br /><br />This is a powerful story, told in satisfying prose.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|\\"Pursuit of Happyness\\".    This is a true story and one of the best movies I have seen in the drama category.    All women should watch this movie and think of their husbands because this is (a dramatized version of) what most men go through in life in the struggle to make a living and be successful (although in real life the ending is not always this happy).    All young adults starting out in the working world should watch this movie as this is a fine example of work ethics, dedication to the job, and good manners.    All parents should watch this movie as this is a fine example of how to (try) to balance work life with bringing up a child and spending time with the family.    All children should watch this movie to understand and appreciate what their fathers go through to bring them that (often taken for granted) plate of food on the table.     All men should watch this movie to know what it means to \\"take it like a man\\".
B00005JPRD|5.0|As quite a few reviews show, if you love this film, you'll *really* love it; if you loathe it, you'll *really* loathe it. Since I've already seen it twice, and I'm ready to see it again, you can place me firmly in the first category -- I haven't been as transported & moved by a film since \\"The Fountain\\" (which evoked similar love-or-loathe responses in viewers). It does require the willing suspension of glib cynicism, which I suspect may be a sticking point for some ... but if you're willing to open your mind, and your heart even more, you'll be amply rewarded.<br /><br />The plot is simple, as it should be: a thread woven through the lives of several characters, which carries them through the major events of the 1960s. The richness comes in the evocation of the times, in the countless little details whirling around the characters. And most importantly, when all is said & done, this is a love story, beautifully & movingly told. If you've ever felt the intense emotions expressed in these gorgeous songs, then you'll identify with Jude & Lucy, Sadie & JoJo, and all of their friends. Not just romantic love, either, but genuine love of others as brothers & sisters, all of us together in this confusing, exhilarating world.<br /><br />So -- are there awkward moments, or scenes just a little too precious for contemporary tastes? Of course! But that really doesn't matter, because one of the hallmarks of the 1960s was a willingness to take ridiculous chances, to risk looking foolish, or even to fall flat on one's face. I'm glad Julie Taymor took similar risks here, because it helps to capture the sensibility of that time, a sensibility which led to tremendous creativity & innovation.<br /><br />And it's not just about that time. The questions of needless war, of demonization of the Other, of intolerance & a fear of change, of mistrusting the imagination -- aren't these just as potent today as they ever were? But while the film is definitely on the side of the counterculture at its best, Julie Taymor doesn't hesitate to show how even the best of idealistic intentions could go into dark places, as with some protesters moving on to bombs. A paean of peace & love, it's also well-acquainted with grief & despair.<br /><br />Fittingly, the movie ends with the anthem, \\"All You Need Is Love,\\" a song that's been dismissed by some as a hopelessly naive & dated flower power artifact. But I'm reminded of something George Harrison once said, when he was asked if love really *is* all you need -- he replied that even if it's not *all* you need, if you don't have it, then what good's the rest?<br /><br />Yes, it's a shimmering, sunlit cloud of golden nostalgia in one sense ... but it's also a reminder that there's more to life than fear & darkness, that there's hope even in the midst of madness & chaos. And in that sense, it's very much a contemporary film, with a vital message.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|What a great movie.  It had very well done action sequences, outstanding effects, and a believably frightening view of the future.  The Abu Ghraib references in the refugee camp were far to heavy-handed and jarring, however, and took me out of this carefully crafted work of art.  Luckily, the suspenseful last 1/2 hour reeled me back in.
075640407X|5.0|I enjoy fantasy and lower-end sci fi, I'd say that I more dabble in it than voraciously devour the genres.  A number of my friends roll their eyes when I tell them about the latest Richard K. Morgan or Jim Butcher book that I read, and laugh when I tell them that the books are interesting, enjoyable and well worth the time.  With The Name of the Wind, I have finally found a book that I am confident that they will all like.  The character development is truly incredible, like few other books that I can think of.  I felt so close to Kvothe as he struggled through his days of living in the street, actually welling up a number of times due to the strong emotion I felt for him.  I grew upset with his rash behavior, his foolish pride, his failure to see what the consequences of his behavior would be.  He was like a real person to me, someone I really cared about.  The story was exciting, fantastic, and felt so real.  I was sorry to finish the book.  I look forward to the next.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|This newest body of work from James Blunt is just as addictive as his debut album, Back to Bedlam.  There's no way to choose a favorite song off the album.  Each has its own unique power and voice.  James and his band have done it again and created something special and amazingly wonderful to listen to in its entirety!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Enhancing the visual effects takes nothing away from the original shows. There were many times when I was first watching them that I was all too aware that something was a prop rather than something \\"real\\", like a styrofoam rock bouncing down a hill. The enhancement if anything will allow you to focus more on the story and less on the bad visual effects. And just to make everyone aware I grew up in the 60's and 70's watching these shows and I am actually excited to see them in a more \\"realistic\\" light. I don't think this will ruin them or diminish my \\"fond\\" memories of a consumer product that was created for the sole purpose of making money for a TV studio, cripes it's a TV show, not a religion.       It reminds me of back when Turner started colorizing B&W films and everyone started freaking out about how he was ruining the artistic vision of the movie. Well sorry to rain on all of your parades but those movies weren't shot in Black & White to be artistic you simpletons! They were shot that way because that was all they had to work with, or it was very early on in the days of color and they couldn't afford to shoot in color. They wanted desperately to shoot color, other mediums were already in color and they were working hard to bring color to the movies.      This is the same thing here. They didn't make the planet's landscapes out of cheesy paintings because it looked good. They did it because it was what they had to work with. Same goes for the plastic models on sticks and strings. And there was nothing less artistic than control panel of cheap toggle switches labeled with a DYMO gun. Move on and embrace the beauty of HiDef CGI imagery, heck it may be like finding religion all over again!
0439882826|5.0|This book is a strange and wonderful surprise.  Easily the best Star Wars classic sage tie-in of the 30th anniversary year, 2007.  This is a unique labour of love to be sure, and perhaps the most inspiring and creative piece about the Holy Trilogy that I have ever seen in a book form.  In fact, I would even go so far as to say perhaps the best book that I have ever read.  Seroiusly, I read this book with my 4-year old son together, and we savoured every page, every fold-out, and every flap.  If you do read this book with a child, read it slowly and enjoy the one-of-a-kind surprises that are waiting behind every handcrafted door.  For collectors, I would buy an extra copy or two beacause this is also a beautiful collector's item.  Save one for later, you never know when you might want an extra copy as an incredibly special gift.  I expect to be reading this book many, many more times.
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created a parallel Earth where Richard Nixon never resigned, Robert Redford ran for President and Costumed Vigilantes were good and evil...and very, very real. \\"Watchmen\\" plays out like a genuine novel in that there is a terrific story being told amongst the stunning art work. So much so, that the dialog could easy function as a standing novel.<br /><br />By now, must know of the plot. In short, the old crew of Vigilantes are being killed or driven into exile, the world is teetering on the brink of nuclear war, and the surviving old heroes must sort it all out. The cast of characters are brilliant, from Rorschach to Adrian Veidt as they deal with the all too modern topics of terrorism, treachery and governments who lie to force agendas. Despite the plot being set in the 70's, this could easily be New York City 2007. The twists are wildly imaginative, and the plots within the plot are all solid. I particularly liked the kid reading the comic book who spent his time alongside the Newspaper Vendor/Chorus character.<br /><br />Just as brilliant are the narrative bridges, made up as excerpts from books, magazine articles or business transactions. These color the story in ways the artwork couldn't, and texture the characters. This was the series that redefined an art-form, and continues to influence. Even the TV show [[ASIN:B000QDLSR0 Heroes]] nodded towards this work when they made Skylar a watch repairman. Titles like [[ASIN:1593074212 Frank Miller's Sin City]], [[ASIN:1569714029 300]] and Alan Moore and David Lloyd's [[ASIN:0930289528 V for Vendetta]] were born of \\"Watchmen's\\" impact. You want to see when the modern graphic novel exploded? Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' \\"Watchmen\\" is where to start.
0743486285|5.0|I grew up listening to Motley Crue religiously.. Followed stories of the band very closely. Of course I knew of the extensive drug and alcohol abuse.. but had no idea it was as bad as it was.. especially for Nikki.  This book allows you to see first hand, the struggle that went on in Nikki's mind.. day by day.  Great read for anyone, Crue fan or not!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Excellent sound, but bulky and has a long curly cord, which can be frustrating if you're commuting with them. Otherwise, I would recommend them.
0805079831|5.0|It always seemed strange to me that the more aid a poor country gets, the poorer they get. Read this book to understand why. Journalist Naomi Klein takes us behind the scenes to show us why the rich nations of the world, led by America, are able to use \\"disaster capitalism\\" to \\"shock\\" a poor nation into submission. And how these rich nations use \\"aid\\" (via the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) as a means of coercion to bring entire economies to their knees.<br /><br />And if these countries do not welcome the \\"aid\\" that these organizations give then, or if these countries do something that the rich don't like, then those poor countries are \\"shocked\\" into submission and thus weakening them into giving up their economies.<br /><br />Consider what happened when Iran tried to nationalize their oil fields in 1951. Consider what happened when the Dominican Republic tried to take back their fruit industry from American ownership in the early 60s. And what happened when Chile tried to do the same in 1972. And consider how these countries were \\"shocked\\" into submission later.<br /><br />The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein gives a fuller understanding about what is happening in the world today.
B00002MZ12|5.0|Beautiful, enchanting, simply magical. I have become and will stay a huge Alanis admirer only thanks to this album. No other album ever came close to this one, the unplugged atmosphere and emotions it induces are overwhelming at times. Alanis gave her best here, singing so honestly, so pure, she often leaves me spellbound by the depth she is able to reach within. It is a shame the video was never realeased officially, since this album does not cover this stunning performance in whole.
B000CNESU8|5.0|This film was released in 1976. When it came out, most mainstream journalists thought they were merely watching a satiric & comedic farce. But now 31 years later, they (and we) know that what we were watching then was a  warning from Paddy Chayefsky (screen writer) and Sidney Lumet (director). Sadly, it was a warning that was largely ignored.<br /><br />Every time I see the scenes of \\"The Howard Beale Show,\\" I can't help but think that, back then, such antics were considered unthinkable. When actress Faye Dunaway enthusiastically talks about the concept of \\"reality-based television,\\" such concepts were unheard of back then.<br /><br />But now...<br /><br />Just watch this film and then turn the TV onto Fox News. Just watch this film and think about the \\"reality TV\\" shows that proliferate all over the dial. And please listen to Ned Beaty's speech on \\"the shape of things today\\" and how \\"There is no America! There is no Democracy. There is only IBM, ITT and AT&T...\\" Then you'll begin to understand that this film isn't just about the death of network news as we knew it then, it's about the birth of the Corporate States of America that we know now.<br /><br />This film is a classic.
B000002H97|5.0|make no mistake about it --- this is the album you will cherish forever as a metal and Metallica fan! Classic!
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|Dexter is the best thing on television today, but the DVD release is marred by the fact that Showtime continues to release heavily over-compressed DVDs that look like they were transferred to VHS then copied to DVD. It does look good on my old low-def 7 year old TV, but it's blurry, choppy and has a considerably annoying combing effect on my PC. It's not as bad as Huff (which is nearly unplayable on my computer), but pretty much every other DVD I own plays and looks great on it.    I give the show a definite 5-star rating, but the horrible Showtime transfer gets a big fat zero. What were they thinking?!
B000067IW0|3.0|For the price I paid through Amazon Marketplace, I really can't complain.  The film is of very poor quality (scratchy, dark in spots, and twice the picture looked as a VHS tape might when the picture \\"warped\\") but watchable.  I didn't need a pristine print; just one that was watchable and this one was sufficient.  My only major complaint is that the information on Amazon's product page (obviously taken from the information on the box) is that the DVD's running time is 82 minutes.  In actuality, it is 66 minutes.  So are 16 minutes missing from this print?  Did I get the entire film?
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Yeah, I know, few will agree, but the movie is deeper than the plot implies. I liked it in the theater, but I really liked in on DVD. A psychedelic masterpiece.
B000HIVQBC|2.0|In my opinion,  SOFAD is Depeche Mode's best album.  Many don't feel that way, but this album grabbed me when I was a teenager and has never let go.   (yes, I had heard Violator and Music For the Masses before I heard this)  I also think it has aged better than any other DM album.  So 5 stars for the album itself.    So why the 2 star rating?     Reason 1.  The remastering on the original album is sub par - I can barely hear an improvement.   To be honest,  I think all they did was turn up the treble on it,  maybe its just my ears    Reason 2.  B-sides on the DVD?  What were they thinking?  I'm sure you could find some complicated program online to rip the b-sides for your ipod(Fair Use, they should look into it)  But its not worth the trouble    Reason 3. The DVD was interesting,  but it just seems like a depressing 20 minutes of the band and producers whining about how the album turned out and how they couldn't get along    The 5.1,  its alright,  but that wasn't the big reason I bought it.  I'm just glad I bought it used,  so I paid a fraction of the new asking price.  At least now I know not to waste my money on the rest of the remasters,  just doesn't seem to be worth it.  Shame on them for putting out such a bad product (though it is still better than the Talking Heads fiasco from a few years ago)
0385302320|5.0|I have read VOYAGER, the third book in the OUTLANDER series, twice. I have also listened to the unabridged audiobook (Recorded Books) read by Davina Porter several times. I never tire of the story.    In VOYAGER, Jamie and Clare's daughter Brianna is a young woman. Clare has recently learned (at the end of the second book) that Jamie survived the Battle of Culloden, and she risks returning to his time.    Jamie and Clare reunite, but immediately a series of events sets them on another adventure - this time to the West Indies. Nephew Ian (now about 14) has been kidnapped. Jamie, who feels responsible for the kidnapping, sets out to find him.    Readers of the LORD JOHN series will encounter him again in this book. He's aboard another ship, which seeks Clare's help because of a sickness on board. But once the captain learns who Jamie is (still an outlaw), he takes off with Clare still aboard.    The 3 - Jamie, Clare and Lord John - meet up again in the West Indies, where Jamie becomes embroiled in a murder. His Chinese servant is the prime suspect. Lord John is the governor.    Jamie and Clare leave the island only to be shipwrecked. They end up in South Carolina, which sets them up for their next adventure in THE DRUMS OF AUTUMN.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Great movie.  I loved the meshing of the story lines.  Definitely entertaining.  Characters are often quirky which adds laughter to the intensity as the drama builds.
B000059GEH|5.0|This is a great movie - very funny and very well done.  Beautiful people and beautiful scenery and beautiful clothes.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|There is nothing bad to say about this movie or the fact that it is a blu-ray. it is amazing and that is all
B000SQFC18|5.0|Phenomenal movie, in story, acting, and production. Easily in my top 3 of last year. This edition is limited to just 1 bonus feature, a hour and a half behind the scenes \\"making of\\" that's pretty rad. It's nice to see Innaritu return to the excellence that he had in Amores Perros.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The collection is great, it arrive just in time and Amazon always answered any questions I had regarding this product
B0007CNXUK|5.0|When I first started watching this movie I was using it as background noise while I cleaned. To tell the truth I just wasn't that interested in how Peter Pan came to be. But it was the only movie left in the house that I hadn't watched so I threw it in. I'm not a real big movie buff, so I wasn't expecting much. (movies do so little for me)    Within about thirty minutes my cleaning stopped, because I couldn't hear what Johnny Depp was saying. Ten minutes later I was entranced. I have never had \\"feelings\\" for a movie before. This movie was sheer bliss. I laughed. I cried. I give it two thumbs up! Rent it. Buy it. Be blown away.
B00009P1O2|5.0|In 1986 i went to see Queen at wembley on the Friday...Now thanks to Queen and the dvd people i can watch highlights of that Concert & this the whole of the Saturday gig in fantastic 5.1 surround sound and vision..Queen live was always an event and now re-live at all again..Forever Queen rock!!
B000UX6THK|5.0|I've got good news.  The definitive collection of arguable the greatest television series ever made, and inarguably one of the most influential.  If you don't know much about it... that's all for the better.  It is inconceivable that you wouldn't like it (unless you don't get it).      The show took the world by storm, but was ended prematurely.  However, we are given a compact 30 episode collection of perfection.  From the slow and moody beginnings to the brilliantly manic and frightening ending, this box set is going to be a perfect piece.  There is not a bad episode, and the packaging and special features look top notch.  I don't think I've ever been this excited for a DVD set before.    If you do not know much about this show, just know that it is your average murder mystery, soap opera, comedy, horror, drama, surrealist, musical.  It has everything anyone could want, and the most compelling narrative I've ever witnessed.  I knew nothing about this show when I first saw it, but once I was hooked I realized this was a gift from the heavens.      If you're a large David Lynch fan, then this show has the perfect showcase styles that make his films so compelling.  If you are not a David Lynch fan, then this show is perfect for you because it is toned down and different enough to appeal to those unappreciative of his personal styling.  There's no way around it.    If you love art, if you love storytelling, and especially if you love film (and even if you hate television) then you owe it to yourself to be exposed to this masterpiece and important part of American culture.  Twin Peaks is worth it's weight in gold.    Let's Rock.
0618526412|4.0|As far as an enjoyable reading experience, I preferred Dawn Powell's Dance Night, which is about a similar time and place.  But there is no doubting the power of this book.  It follows several intertwined characters -- a cafe owner, a young puberty-aged girl, a drunken socialist agitator, a scholarly black doctor... And a kind, mute young man, almost Christ-like in the way he is perceived by others and who is at the very core of the tale.  Each of these people are defined by a special vision that is at the core of their lives -- they are driven: for knowledge, for art, for mankind, for freedom and respect, for love of another.  To some degree, I found the story contrived despite its gritty, unforgiving realism -- almost like a mathematical formula.  But after a while I stopped thinking about that contrivance and was gripped by the story itself.  It is clearly a product of the Depression and the threat of War and the social and racial injustices of the 1930's, so it helped me to experience that time.  The protagonists in this story are all so driven by, and truthful to, their inner visions, it made me think: What is my vision?  And am I truthful to it?  As flawed or limited as each the central characters are, each became admirable as the story progressed -- each supremely driven by love and caring in their own way.
B00000JR2A|5.0|The progressive zenith, led into by The Hurting and Songs from the Big Chair, Seeds of Love is my favorite of the TFF albums.  This has so many works that still hold up 20 years later.  Advice for the Young at Heart is one of my all-time faves.  Curt's melodic voice was really at a career peak, and married the production collaboration Roland brought, makes this a quintessential album to own.  Unfortunate they would never repeat its beauty.
0452286751|4.0|Rand has a few great ideas about the course of history being influenced by great men and women. I happen to believe this is correct. 95% of the population add little to the advance of humankind. In the workforce I have seen key people out perform ten coworkers.<br /><br />What I have not seen is a woman who prefers rape as Dominique does or a capitalist too good to compromise to make a profit (Roark). Rands' hate of the little people, \\"the second handers\\", and their miserable little lives and her avoidance of empathy, humor and even children makes her a misanthrope of the first order.<br /><br />The \\" Virtue of Selfishnes \\" by Rand is a much cleaner and shorter approach to understanding her core belief that when we act in our own self interest its better for the individual and society.
0061122416|1.0|What a lot of utter overblown empty nonsense. The very story is stolen from a well-known folktale (\\"The Treasure\\"); the characters are mere game pieces with absolutely no intellect or emotion (particularly the woman, who has no qualities except that she is beautiful, which we're supposed to assume is enough --blech!); the only quality of suspense is created by the author's failure to explain anything in ways that can be understood by curious, intelligent, thinking readers; and the writing is just abominably bad! What do people see in this book??? Is there such craving out there for spirituality that this insipid fluff is even acceptable? Please look eslewhere for guidance on life; you'll find it in any novel worth it's paper. I'd give it no stars at all, if Amazon allowed that.
0593055063|2.0|The book started out interesting enough. The author started going quickly. After I got further into the book and realized that these characters were very flat and making errors along the way that made no logical sense in the real world, the one question that kept going through my mind was \\"Is this book over yet?\\". I found myself skipping ahead pages at a time knowing that I am not missing much of anything.     I recommend skipping this book. It is a disappointment and does not keep the reader engaged.
B000NA2776|4.0|This is a great album. I bought it because of Grace Kelly but honestly all of the songs are great.
B000067J1H|5.0|In \\"Fight Club,\\" Edward Norton plays a man who is completely dissatisfied with his life. He begins attending support group meetings in an attempt to fill the void. Along the way, he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a messed up girl who's also working the support group system, and Tyler (Brad Pitt), an eccentric yet admirable soap salesman who helps Norton's unnamed character form a fight club, where men get together and release their aggression by beating the crap out of each other. Eventually Marla becomes involved in a dangerous affair with Tyler, and the fight club phenomenon catches on as more men join the group and branches of the club start popping up all over the country. Norton's character finds himself trapped in what appears to be a hopeless situation, and then a shocking revelation near the end of the film turns everything upside down.<br /><br />Yes, this film is violent, which is why a lot of people don't like it. But \\"Fight Club\\" is absolutely brilliant, with a unique plot, fantastic characters, and a perfect mixture of depressing, horrifying, and hilarious moments. This is a truly unconventional movie that deserves many accolades, and it's a lot of fun to watch.
0525950079|5.0|Wow, wow, wow. What a terrific read. No, it isn't \\"War and Peace\\" or \\"Ulysses,\\" just a good, old fashioned story. Follett is at his best (and that's pretty durn good). It's a whopping thousand pages long, and I devoured it in a weekend. My rear end may hurt, but I had a great time. \\"World Without End\\" is a worthy successor to \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"
B000P0J024|5.0|Years and years ago, before cars had CD players, a friend of the family lent us her CD copy of the Traveling Wilburys.  I remember the afternoon my Dad taped it.  But most of all I remember all the many times we listened to that tape on our many car trips.  Sadly, the tape finally wore out and the Wilbury albums fell out of print for so many years.  Luckily my Mom was able to get me a second hand copy of one for Christmas in 2005.  And I still have it, though my sister was jealous of me.  Thanks to the reissue of these first rate albums I now know what to get her for Christmas.
B000V698WE|5.0|There are classics. This is one of them. Freakin' amazing - nothing but bare soul laying on the line, worship, reverence, and real life.     Words escape me.
B000NA28I4|4.0|Tell me one thing: Why are people so obsessed? I mean, movies are movies. Who cares what the deeper meaning is? Who cares if it's similar to other movies? I don't! I mean, sure, this wasn't the best movie ever, but it was pretty good. The cast was great and it followed the book as best it could. There's been like a billion movies made, so obviously they'll start to look alike sometimes.     Maybe you didn't like it. Fine! That's your opinion! Just don't go on about how you didn't like it because it was like star wars or something. Sit back and enjoy the show. Stop worrying and whining about stuff that's so minor and stupid. I mean, if you were sent to make an Eragon movie, could you do any better? I think not. Suck on that.
1582701709|1.0|Sure it has some good common sense insights...being grateful, treat yourself like you expect others to treat you, etc.  But overall it is totally unrealistic.  Don't worry about the HOW?  Please!  I'm sure the author knew exactly how she was going to make a ton of money by selling this book that basically uses age old ideas and re-packages them.
0920668372|5.0|Having begun to read these reviews while looking for a copy for friend (I'll always keep the copy we read to our daughter when she was a child) I was stunned to see people describe this book as \\"creepy.\\"  Never in all the years we read and discussed it did that idea ever occur to us.  In fact, we always perceived the concept to be transcendent to the actual storyline, the testimonial of a parent's pure love throughout the trials & tribulations of childhood and beyond.  Likewise, the fact that it was a boy rather than a girl was never an issue, since parental love is pure regardless of gender.  Somehow, the fact that I was so touched by this story seemed to always touch my daughter, too.  And yes, I made up my own melody to it, that I remember to this day.  Maybe it IS more an adult story than a kid's book, but let your child feel YOUR joy while reading, and ultimately understanding the intensity of parental love.  It is forever.
B0007M22TI|5.0|If you ever get the opportunity to see these wonderful ladies live... DO IT!!  I did.  These ladies are absolutely amazing and stunning!  I saw the PBS special and I never thought they could be better.  However, the PBS special doesn't even compare to seeing them live!!  I am buying the DVD.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's half of Grindhouse \\"Death Proof\\" is by far one of his funnest films to date. The first half of \\"DP\\" has got to be one of the coolest homages to the ultra bad drive-in b flick, with it's ridiculously bad xxx movie dialog, it's disregard for any standard movie format and it's super grainy & jumpy cinematography & editing. The second half turns into a colorful 70's style action flick filled with nothing but great cinematography & pure road rage. Great film.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|What can one say about Annie Lennox that hasn't already been said?  Just listen to any track -especially \\"Big Sky\\", and hear vocal brilliance.  Her singing overall is superlative.  These are probably the most varied and most beautiful vocals she's ever done on one album.  The writing is also quite good. It's been almost 25 years since Sweet Dreams, and Annie's voice still thrills like no other!  In fact, I think it's gotten better.  Buy this cd now!
0440241901|5.0|Oh my goodness - this book was hilarious.  I often found myself laughing outloud!  Very entertaining, and I would recommend it.
0974872407|5.0|It is a great book and I am very happy with Amazon service, they were even quicker than expeted..
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This is by far one of the best films of the decade.  Morgan Freeman delivers a superb narrative and the picture excels in many aspects of film making. Steeped in symbolism, the film leaves us with plenty of memorable quotes.     As Andy plays the letter duet from The Marriage of Figaro, Red narrates:     \\"I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are better left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and it makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you, those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream. It was as if some beautiful bird had flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free.\\"
0805079831|5.0|Like Klein's previous tome, No Logo, this book is exhaustively researched, compellingly argued, and impressive in its breadth and depth. Right wing nutbags will call her a socialist, propagandist, and whatever other epithets they can conjure to scare their uneducated and heartless base, but this is simply a diversionary tactic. Klein's examination of economic shock tactics (and their physical cousins, ECT and torture) are so heavily documented and fact checked that anyone with human(e) emotions would find it difficult to undermine her assertions or deny their veracity.     This book is the very definition of good, solid reporting. To doubters, Klein's claims may seem far fetched, but she connects the dots in a way that the mainstream media just can't seem to do.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|The review by W. Scott Heitman pretty much sums up the album in the best possible light.<br /><br />To say that this album was a disappointment is an understatement. We have all patiently waited for the next non-remix album for too many years and our patience did not pay off. This is not the same sound from the first two albums. When I played it the first time, I thought it was going somewhere with the traditional no-lyrics intro piece and then the second and third tracks hinted at something more to follow, but instead the album meandered off onto some dark and gloomy path with shallow vocals and little substance to the lyrics.<br /><br />At this point, all we can do is hope that a remix of this album yields something for the mainstream LP fans to enjoy again.<br /><br />I also gave it 3 stars because there is some musical talent here, just not the display of that talent I was hoping for.
0446698326|4.0|This book was a love story about true love and not so much about romance.  That's what I liked most about it.  I found myself pulling for the girl even though  it was written in first person from the guy's perspective.  It showed how important it is to not rush into making decisions on a whim because the choices we make impact our lives forever.  I especially liked the love relationship between the father and son and the tender moments they shared together reminded me of my dad and me.  I liked the book and it was a fast read.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that the author gave away the ending right in the prologue so I knew how it would end from the beginning.<br /><br />-Karen Arlettaz Zemek, Author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\"
0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor is one of the best books I have ever read. This true account is more compelling and heart-wrenching than any work of fiction could ever attempt to be. A story of American valor, fortitude and complete selflessness in the face of pure evil and hate. The men in this story rank right up there with America's truest patriots. Thank God that we have men this brave to protect us from the bad guys. Another hero of this real-life story is the Afghani village elder's son - who forever sacrificed his ability to return to his home in order to save Marcus's life and who went on to assist the US in finding the Taliban. With men like Marcus, Mike, Axe and Danny on our side, good will overwhelmingly triumph over evil. Thank you Marcus for telling this story.
B00005R62K|5.0|A little perspective is in order.  This album came out in 1978, folks.  This was before Iron Maiden and Metallica even existed....and this was Priest's fourth album.  This is a building block album for subsequent metal greatness.  Only the most avid Priest and metal fans don't underestimate this album.  This is a must have if you are a metal fan, every song is a keeper.  I particularly like \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" and \\"Heroes End\\".  Songs like \\"Exciter\\", \\"Stained Class\\", \\"Better by you, Better than me\\" would be the best songs on any album by any other artist of that era.  If you're a younger person that came on board during the Ripper, or late Halford era, do yourself a favor and go back into Priest's catalog for Stained Class, (Sad Wings of Destiny too).  Take it from a fan that's followed this band for 30+ years.  Buy it.
B000T2PRF2|5.0|If you are a Diana Krall fan or just like vocals of the Great American Song Book, you will thorougly enjoy this CD.  This is truly her Very Best.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This is the best blues-rock album to come along in years. Joe B can do it all and he struts his stuff on this one. Just unloads on every song. Nothing fancy, just a tight rythem section with Joe screamimg over the top on lead/slide guitar.   Do what you need to do to see Joe live. He brings incredible energy to his shows.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|If you like music, you will love it with these headphones.  The overall listening experience is excellent.  I have tried Koss and Bose, but these Sony MDR 7506 are the best.  The highs are clean and clear; the lows forceful without distortion and the midrange carries through it all with quality the way the musicians meant it to be.  These headpphones are comfortable with a coiled one-sided cord that stays out of the way.  They are light enough to wear for long periods of time.  Included is a leather case to store.  The headphones fold up and are of high quality throughout.  The cord is built to last and is fastened in several places to ensure that it will not pull loose from the ear cups.  I highly recommend these to anyone who loves to hear music the way it was produced and played in the studio.
B000WSJNWQ|5.0|When I saw the billboard that advertised this movie, I assumed it would be boring. I was wrong. This movie is worth watching. You are basically getting a look at what the U.S. does with suspects, not criminals, of terrorism. The story of the young man who decides at the end to blow himself up is something that needs to be addressed as well as the whole extraordinary rendition practice. Torturing people to produce information that will save lives is something that needs to debated by the UN. Thats right, they already thought about it and came up with The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Torture is illegal within the United States and is illegal if practised by American military personnel anywhere at any time. Thats why we let Egypt , Syria , and Yemen do it for us. I have a friend who is currently in a secret prison in Sana, Yemen and he has never committed a crime in his life. His name is Anwar Al Awlaki and you can google him to see more info.     We need to clarify with 100% accuracy that people who murder innocent people, regardless of what their intensions are, is not part of any religion including Islam. The SOB's who said you will go to hell if you dont fight the Zionists in jihad ended up killing their own man when he couldnt complete the mission. This is the mentality of the people we are dealing with. They have no problem with killing their own brothers or parents if that will help in their cause. The Quran does not sanction what these madmen are doing. It does not say you can kill anybody, so long as it is helping in the cause of Islam. It doesnt say you cannot commit suicide, but if a situation presents itself where you can kill the enemy by killing yourself, then go ahead and kill yourself. No, it says you cant kill yourself 4:29 and it says you cant kill innocent life 6:161, 17:33. It also says \\"and let not the hatred of others to you make you do what is wrong and depart from justice.\\" 5:8 I hope and pray that we can come up with solutions to solve our problems without murdering or torturing people.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|What the hey...great title!  Great album.  From mariachi horns (Conquest) to bagpipes (Prickly Thorn to Sweetly Worn and St Andrew This Battle Is In the Air)!  From the grunge of Rag and Bone to the southern blues of Effect and Cause!  There is no genre for this!  I hear Led Zepplin, The Black Crowes, Bob Dylan, the lyrical genius of Warren Zevon, and a Nashville influence rolled into one musical masterpiece.  Whoever thought someone singing sooo off key would sound so...so refreashing (Conquest)! Thank you, White Stripes for doing what you do.  It's good to know there is still creativity alive and well out there!  This is what rock's all about. Now I must go out and buy five other albums! (I can't help it, this shows my age...cd's and downloads will always be albums to me!)
B00026YO36|3.0|I bought the album for the the songs \\"Wedding Dress\\" and \\"100 Days\\", which are amazing songs.  However, I havnt found much else on the CD that I find myself liking very much.  Not bad music, just not my personal preference.  Still Recommended.

B000SZLSB2|4.0|Having lived and rocked through the 70's, I would have to say James Blunt has captured the essence of 70's soft rock better than anyone!  Anything here would definately be heard on the radio while preparing to go out to the clubs in the 70's, not in the clubs! I'm thinking Art Garfunkel, Bee Gees, Dan Fogelberg.  Either Mr. Blunt did his homework quite well, or he is an old soul!  Lyrically, this is not a great album.  With the exception of Same Mistake and Annie, with it's biting, nasty overtones, nothing will jump out at you.  However, this is not a bad album, in fact, I think it is a very smart move.  He knows his audience, he gave us something that we haven't heard in years, and he did it better than back in the day.  What's strange, is that I would have never considered buying something like this in the 70's, but for a mellow trip back in time, give it a listen.
038533348X|5.0|It has been a while since I read this book, but its one of those that stick with you, making you think about it for years after.  Vonnegut crafts his novel about a new compound discoered that could destroy the world.  The cast of characters are regular folks entrusted with this dangerous substance.  How everything goes down will leave you reading this whole book in one sitting.
B000N6TX22|4.0|I first heard about Children of Men through the film magazines.  At first, it would get mentioned in a list of upcoming films, then the lists of upcoming films with interesting premises. Finally, there were whole articles about it, about how the filmmaker was doing something unique and interesting and that the plot (people can't have babies, man has to escort the first pregnant woman to safety) was where the film took off into a superlative experience.    I can attest to this. Children of Men is amazing. The best parts are the details of this dystopian future where despair has permeated everything. Britain is the last bastion of civilization, a place where everyone knows there will be no one left alive in a century and that everything anyone does is doomed not only to failure but to be forgotten and buried.     The cinematography was unreal. In one place, there is a single scene shot inside a car. It is done in 1 take and it is breathtaking. How is it possible for so much to happen in a single take would be amazing. I'd have thought the filmmaker got unbelieveably lucky, except he does it AGAIN later in the movie and does it even better in the middle of a full blown battle scene. I wish I could italicize the last sentence. This movie may represent the best example of telling a story using the full filmmaking palette that I've ever seen, a directorial command unseen since Orson Welles' Citzen Kane. That sounds pretty high faluting, except that I think I liked Children of Men better.     The actors do a terrific job. Michael Caine pops up, as does Julianne Moore. Both are more than competent but the movie belongs to Clive Owen. There was some noise a while back about Clive being the new James Bond, the role that ultimately went to Daniel Craig. It was a great movie...which may have been greater with Clive in the part.    Last, the marketing campaign for Children of Men was really not well done. I read movie magazines all the time. I don't think this movie should havebeen this hard to spot...it was one of the best movies I've seen in years.     Oh, and before I forget...ROSEBUD.
B000001DVD|5.0|these guys really know how to but out the music, great from start to finish.
B000002MT0|4.0|Prince's audience is so vast it's almost impossible for him to please them all with one album now.Some songs some don't like are the same songs that others love.  With that said, this is how this album was for many.  To me this is the dark side of Prince, really dark and honest.With the exception of that Race song, this cd is a classic to me b/c to me Prince's best music are his honestly sad songs played in minor key.  Come-is a song where Prince is begging for a girl to, well...It is a very long song where different instruments and his moaning take over as he directs a girl on how to please herself and him.It is a funky little song, sung in his \\"Little Corvette\\" voice.  Space-Prince sings in his \\"Damn U\\" voice and falsetto. This song is about him imagining him and his girl spending forever in outer space, in each other's space.  Space in this song is about nothingness and yet a place at the same time, as he says \\"Do you want to go? Up where the tears flow.Up where the lives go\\"To me this is a love muse poem, very poetic.The instruments give the song an astro-type sound of swirling swooshes and soft beats.  Pheromone-\\"319\\"voice. Probably one of my favorites on this cd.Prince starts this song of describing how he's drawn to this girl by describing what he sees.All of what he sees is taking over his senses.Some of what he sees is impending doom of the revelation,some of it is sex, then in the end we find out we're talking about characters and we find out in the end of the song it is a murder scene of a man chasing a woman to kill her and Prince is the narrator.  Loose-is a very fast-tempo dance beat.It is a good beat.Prince shouts in a singing voice similar to \\"It\\" song from SOTT.  He's giving directions to his dance partner on how to respond to the beat.It's actually a good song, for a techno Prince beat.I dare you to play this song before you go to sleep. It won't happen.  Papa-Honestly, one of Prince's best songs ever.He tells the story (talking and singing) of himself as a child getting beat by his father, while his mother watches.In the end he says \\"don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me.\\" This is a slow rock and roll song with the guitar leading.  Race-a very preachy song that doesn't make for good music.He's trying to hard lyrically to send a message by rapping.He shouldn't rap.  Dark-Falsetto.Prince moans how dark and lonely he feels since his woman has left him in the dark.\\"sun up in the sky is just a shining. Instead I'm lost in my shadow of pain.\\"He sings curses to the woman that has left him in his trademark whine and hex falsetto.It sound honestly, like he's musically trying to curse the woman with his voice.  Solo-arguably the best falsetto ever.You can't tell where the falsetto begins and his voice ends.Very poetic.Only a harp plays as he sings in like an empty room.He describes how solo, and so low he feels.  \\"So low, the curb looks like a skyscraper.\\"Very sad song, it ends with the words \\"my name is noone.\\"  Letitgo-\\"gunfires, everybody hiding except for me. Better off dead, if I can be alone.\\"This song is about him rising from out of his dark cloud of loneliness and realizing he has  to let all those feelings go in order to feel something new. \\"I'm ready for the rain.\\"Compared to other songs on this cd, this is sadly a celebratory song with a catchy hook.It's sang in one of Prince's deeper voices.  Orgasm-well, it's just that.Interesting way to end an album where you're claiming you're death.    Couldn't do an instrument song for song and this will probably be the last  song for song I do.It takes to long.Oh, I did this review having not heard this cd in over four years.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|The new one by iced earth is great!  I like the direction jon and tim are taking.  There is definately some progression over the last album, although this could be due to Tim Owens having more time to complete the vocals.  The only problem i can see is that this album is best enjoyed after a few listens, and by listening strait through.  All of the songs flow together.  Some people might not like that, but i do.

1400079276|4.0|I am a fan of Murakami and I read already most of his novels. I liked Kafka on the shore. It took me on its waves on a fantastic magic ride and lead me to a safe shore in the end. I agree that sometimes in this novel, Murakami gets carried away with his imagination (ex. the personnages of Johnie Walker and the KFC colonel were a little too much for me :-)) but in a whole reading it was a intellectual and spiritual pleasure.However, I want to point out the surprising didactic aspect of the novel. Maybe because it deals with a 15 years old boy it has many didactic messages along with the plot. Like the discipline and gym exercises that Tamura does, his reading and music tastes also the other characters have a lot of didactic sayings - I did not mind that but I wonder if it was done intentionally (maybe there was a request of the education ministry to write an educating novel for young generation :-)) - there is a lot more to talk about this novel but that needs a lot of time and space (a reading club maybe) so in the meantime I wish Murakami to keep on his wonderful work because I enjoy a lot reading it.

B00008DDXL|4.0|Of all the series that are out on DVD this was the last one I needed. It's not my favorite (GOF), but it's amazing compared to the first movie. This series just gets better and better as the story continues.
B000NA77YO|3.0|As a strictly Dio-Sabbath-years fan, I had read Tony Iommi's statements that the new songs on this album took them back to the Heaven & Hell days; after hearing it I strongly disagree.  I think the three new songs fall more into the Dio category of music as opposed to the Dio-Sabbath category.  These songs sound like something that would have come off of Dio'd \\"Lock Up the Wolves\\" album and wouldn't really belong on a \\"Heaven and Hell II\\" album.    The first tracks on the album you have all heard before, and there is really no reason to buy this album except for a live version of Children of the Sea.  If you are going to spring for the album just to get the new songs, don't expect too much.  \\"The Devil Cried\\" is probably the best of the three, a long slow Dio-esque dirge that tells a good story.  Other than that, I think you can stick with what you already have in your Sabbath collection and save some money.

B000063JDE|4.0|Blue Velvet is a film that takes you in a lot of different directions.  It's a mystery, a love story, a thriller, a sexual intrigue piece, but, above all, it's David Lynch.    David Lynch has always had a way with infusing unsettling images and intriguing storytelling ([[ASIN:B000056BP1 Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me]], [[ASIN:B00062IVM6 Wild At Heart]]), but this may just take the cake.    Even with this, the film feels incomplete.  As if DAvid Lynch wanted to make a three hour film delving into every facet of these individuals'd lives but settled on shorting it to comfort the audience.  With the number of themes/storylines being touched this definitely should have been a tad bit longer.  But it's still a masterful and downright enjoyable film.  David Lynch has a way with images.    There's only a few updates to this disc.  There's a featurette or two, and deleted scene stills, among very few others.    In the end, you mostly love or hate David Lynch, but you still can enjoy his contrbutions to the film industry.    Highly recommended.
0143038583|1.0|I'm a dairy farmer. I read the book for my book club.I'm the only person involved in agriculture in the club.Michael Pollan is a journalist selling a book and he plays fast and loose with many facts (One example. Mc Donald's doesn't use butane  on it's packaging..how does he get away with that???). Somehow that doesn't seem to bother many people as long as they can beat up on the industry that has actually (not figuratively) kept them alive.He uses the term \\"industrial\\" when he refers to large agriculture, as if industrial is a dirty word.The industrial revolution brought us out the dark ages and gave millions of people jobs.Nothing's perfect and industries including agriculture need supervision and controls.That's society's and government's job.Agriculture in the United States has done what has been asked of it and much more.Our food is safer and cleaner and cheaper than it has ever been and now every accident or contamination incident is blown out of proportion.Small scale farms cannot feed the US..mainly because short of forcing people at gunpoint to go back to Grandpa's farm ( and time)few people want to work on farms.We know we try to hire people to milk cows.Michael Pollan is a joke to Ag.Policy experts.He's selling books people.
B000H309P6|5.0|This is the point of demarcation for Peter Hammill between fronting Van Der Graaf Generator, and embarking upon what has become his voluminous solo career. As such, the listener will discover elements of both within the confines of this release. Though much of this album was recorded by Peter at home with his (then) newly acquired tape recorder and mixer, studio wizardry abounds! As the soundstage swirls around you, you'll notice Peter's VDGG bandmates appear and add colour & texture to the livelier numbers, only to vanish as Peter attacks the introspective ballads with guitar and keyboard, then all reappear to mount an astonishing no-holds-barred full-out assault with \\"(In The) Black Room / The Tower\\", foreshadowing Van Der Graaf's 1975 reunion opus, \\"Godbluff\\".  The bonus material, though of inferior sound quality, is of interest, as well. There's plenty here to please anyone who appreciates the effusive 'excesses' of either Van Der Graaf Generator's sonic cacophony or Peter Hammill's ebullient vocal stylings. For you, the adventurous, buy with confidence-and ENJOY !
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown has everything.  Great direction, great acting, great script, star power.  It's all there.    One of the greatest, and last, film noirs.  It's not like any noir before it.  Jack Ncholson's character Jake Gittles has a very different dynamic than the noir characters of past.  He's...for lack of a better word, human.  That's part of the film's charm.  The memorable script and artful direction help contribute.    Paramount has never been known to be wonderful DVD companies.  At least be glad to get an anamorphic transfer.  But there are some extra interviews on this disc.
B00004RH1E|5.0|These bits and the holder are great for drills. They don't hold up with impact drivers into hard wood so well. They are better than most bits in this regard, but there are impact rated bits for these applications. If you have a drill/driver or use your impact driver in softer woods, these will do the trick. If you need tougher bits these are not them.
B0000062GK|5.0|I became a vicarious Satch fan at the age of 13 when my parents purchased this CD shortly after it was released. Always in heavy rotation on our home stereo, this CD opened my mind to the power and beauty of instrumental hard rock.    Now I've become a Satch fan in my own right; I finally got my own copy a few months ago. As I've expanded my musical library and learned more about music in general through both playing and listening, I keep coming back to Satriani (this CD particularly) with ever-increasing appreciation. And before I go any further, let me say that I'm not an awe-struck guitarist, but a drummer.    I consider this CD to be Satch's best hard-rock CD. It may be a bit lacking for fans who most enjoy the jazz and blues side of his music, but I still consider this CD as an outstanding representative of the intricacy, depth, character and GROOVE of jazz and blues music -- just here it's mostly in a harder setting.    The first four songs are a killer package. \\"Up In The Sky\\" is an explosive, up-tempo track that seems to soar thru the sky like \\"Surfing with the Alien\\" but with urgency; \\"House Full of Bullets\\" is a rumbling power-blues song with miles of groove; \\"Crystal Planet\\" has probably the best rhythm section playing of the entire CD, as well as a relentless climax; and \\"Love Thing\\" gives the listener a break in a smooth, sometimes heartwrenching ballad.    Other strong tracks include \\"Raspberry Jam Delta V,\\" which is the ideal song to run to on a sunny day, the heavy and driving \\"Ceremony,\\" which, at the 2-minute mark, features the impossibly-fast shredding that Satch is known for, and \\"Time,\\" which is among his more psychadelic and proggy songs.    This CD has earned a spot in my top-ten CDs of all time. I doubt it will ever be bumped off the list.
B000002GBB|5.0|If you're a fan of early Van Halen, you know what I'm talking about. The defining record for this lineup, but not nearly as appreciated as it should be. John Panozzo is one of the great underrated drummers in rock history.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Other reviewers have said it best, this movie is \\"style over substance\\".  What did I think of it personally? It was slow.  The first half of the movie starts off OK and you are thinking you are going to really get somewhere.  But then it drags and drags.  The conversations are not witty filler here, they are all the movie has to offer and drawn out like they are they are no longer entertaining.  We meet plenty of characters but most don't matter and honestly they are all disposable.  The only saving grace in this film was Stuntman Mike himself, who was genuinely enjoyable.  The other faces could come and go.  The only action in the film is a couple of gruesome scenes 30 mins into it and then a car chase about an hour in.  The ending leaves you going \\"huh? that's it then?\\".    I'm a fan of the whole grindhouse experience but as a movie standing on its own merits there really isn't much to DeathProof.
B000VI04HK|5.0|The CDs:<br /><br />I have listened to the CDs in my car where I could give them my full attention.  Overall I'm impressed with the performances.  I think the show makes a good case for the quality of the material on R.E.M.'s last studio CD, \\"Around the Sun\\".  \\"Around the Sun\\" was ignored by many critics, and maligned by many fans of the band for being too low-energy.  When you hear songs from \\"Around the Sun\\" played live however, they are so good it's almost as if the band's earlier material has to live up to the adult perspectives in the songs from \\"Around the Sun\\".<br /><br />I thought the concert was great overall. The only songs I found uninteresting played live actually were a few things written much earlier in the band's career, things you would expect to smoke live, like \\"Cuyahoga\\" and \\"The One I Love\\".  I think the band is more comfortable and energized playing their newer material than rehashing hits from the Bill Berry days.<br /><br />I'd give the CD 4 and a 1/2 stars for the quality of the performances and for not including too many of the band's old hits.<br /><br />The DVD:<br /><br />Years ago I bought an R.E.M. concert video called, I believe, \\"Tour Film\\".  It was almost unwatchable.  A typical song on \\"Tour Film\\" had a video spliced together with footage from different shows.  When you watch bands play on a show like Austin City Limits (a show I love), you feel like you're onstage with the band, or in the front seats.  \\"Tour Film\\" made me feel like I was watching a set of disconnected images.  I have only watched select tracks from the new \\"R.E.M. Live\\" DVD, but I can say the new DVD is more watchable than I remember \\"Tour Film\\" being anyway.<br /><br />(I have a \\"So You'd Like To...\\" guide to R.E.M. on Amazon for anyone with an interest)
B000M4RG42|4.0|For 70,000 Marines, the battle for Iwo Jima was more than the turning point of world War II.; it was the defining moment of their lives. Clint Eastwood's epic shows the truth of war; that soldiers fight for their country, but that they die for their friends. This movie tells the story of the men who where credited with raising the flag and the politics that was used to generated money for war bonds.
B000LC55F2|2.0|Well acted, with beautiful photography, settings, and costumes.  An interesting story with compelling plot twists.  It is also a mystery, and I was trying to guess the answer all along.  I figured out the suggested answer to the riddle half way through, but I reasoned that that couldn't be the real solution because it was so completely implausible, and also impossible.  When it turned out the answer I guessed and discarded was the real trick of the story, I felt cheated.  I thought I was watching a quality drama, and it turned out to be an elaborate and overly-long joke with a punch line that was not clever or funny.<br /><br />If it was science fiction, then it should have had just a bit of reality to base the premise on.  If it was historical fiction, it should have been accurate with regards to the actual times it protrayed.  If anyone had told me the ending, I would not have bothered to watch it.  In fact, I wish I had known the cheesy ending so I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up that it could be a great film.  So, here is a SPOILER to save like-minded people from having to sit through a story that betrays its intelligent beginnings:<br />The competing magicians goad each other to dangerous extremes until one of them hires Tesla to create the ultimate magic trick, which turns out to be science.  Tesla invents a machine, based on high voltage AC, that creates a duplicate of any object or organism, which materializes about a hundred yards away.  One of the magicians uses this new science to create dozens of copies of himself, and he kills all the copies.<br /><br />This is wrong on so many levels that it is an unforgivable end to a promising film.  First, it implies that all science is a form of magic with no logic to it; this does a great diservice to actual science, which is already misunderstood by far too many people.  Second, even if the science portion of the story were remotely plausible, killing dozens of clones of yourself would simply be ludicrous.  Why not just make one copy and then keep performing the trick with your exact double?<br /><br />All of the good work of the story that makes comparisons between illusions, entertainment, and relationships is completely wasted with the ending, which is intended to be earth-shattering and profound but turns out to be silly and annoying.  We are supposed to have our minds expanded as we question the true nature of reality.  Had the movie used actual science, it might have had a chance of succeeding.  And that is the main problem of the film: it suchers you into thinking it will deliver the profound truth and then you find out you've been conned by charlatans.  And not in a good way.e copy and then keep performing the trick with your exact double?

B000BEZPQE|1.0|Ever wanted to listen to Slipknot live?<br /><br />No, neither have I.<br /><br />But judging by the cover of this album, at least 6 people have.<br /><br />No, no. In all seriousness Slipknot aren't THAT bad. They just don't deserve anymore than 1 star. Their music is that perfect blend of metal that appears edgy and cult, yet is supremely accessible and predictable. I hear people say the band is misunderstood, or misdirected or mis-whatever. But the message \\"People=SH**\\" seems about as direct and understandable as can be.<br />They do have a very good drummer though.

0316067598|5.0|In late June 2005, Marcus Luttrell was a member of a four-man U.S. Navy SEAL team on a special mission to kill or capture an al Qaeda/Taliban leader in Afghanistan's Hindu Kush mountains. What his team encountered and what they did was the setting for the book. Marcus Luttrell, the lone survivor of that mission, described in great detail why that single mission resulted in three Navy Crosses (two post-humously) and a post-humous Medal of Honor.    This book is much more than just a combat record of the heroics of four true American heroes. Luttrell's blunt and direct language vividly explained how SEALs are trained for, deployed to, and employed on some of the world's most dangerous battlefields. Luttrell's personal accounts throughout the book also described warriors' love (SEAL-to-SEAL, warrior-to-warrior, of country, for the military, and within warriors' personal and extended families) and hate (al Qaeda/Taliban/terrorists towards the United States, and U.S. warriors towards the biased liberal news media) relationships.    Today, October 22, 2007, Luttrell's best friend, Lieutenant Michael Murphy, U.S. Navy SEAL, was post-humously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroics as described by Luttrell in this outstanding book. When my six-year-old son is old enough to read and understand this book, I will encourage him to read it so he can learn what true American heroes are all about. I encourage everyone to do the same.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Usually when you buy a CD, it's usually 1, 2 maybe 3 songs that you like and the rest are blah...OR---you buy a CD and the music has to grow on you after you've played it 5 or 10 times!  I have to say, I love this CD!!!   The very first time I put the CD in, it put a smile on my face!   You can tell that this was put together with some thought to it and not slapped together just to make a CD.   Hats off to you Annie---I'm enjoying and loving every song on the CD!
0316010669|3.0|I bought this on the back of reading Malcoms really interesting \\"The Tipping Point\\" book.     Blink is worth a read, however you are left with the feeling that its all a little padded out to compensate for what really could be a much shorter book. There are some good insights into the way people unconsciously make decisions about things.     Some of the more interesting studies quoted explain how a high percentage of corporate leaders are taller than the average person. And how every extra inch in height can equate to about an extra $1,000 in salary. The goal of this book is to try to explain why these kind of things happen. It seems we all subconsciously make decisions based on predefined perceptions.    Some ideas it this book really overlap with NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming). If you have read anything about NLP then I think you will see the overlap.    People really should rely a lot more on their gut feelings with things as this book proves. Even though you may not know why you have a gut feeling about something this gut feeling comes from your subconscious evaluating and making decisions. The most powerful thing you can do, I believe, is try to be a bit more aware of your first gut feeling about things, it is easy to not pick up on them.
0393317552|3.0|Jared Diamond is a multiple-carat writer that could have been better cut. His book is both ludicrously ambitious in its goal and thoroughly pragmatic in its approach: to tell the history of the world of the past 15'000 years, with a twist. The twist being his angle on things we thought we'd heard before. Like for instance the way the Spaniards overtook the Inca Empire, which Diamond makes boil down to habitat, climate, square mile per person and geology, rather than culture, religion, races or other sophistications. Civilization, for Diamond, is the consequence of many natural and physical causes he's arduously trying to figure out. Arduously, because he sometimes takes 30 pages to demonstrate something the average reader I am already realized after one paragraph. The academic that Diamond is shines through the thinker he's striving to be. Reading GGS is arguably as thought-provoking as \\"Why I ate my father\\", without the humour though.
0812932293|5.0|I have to say I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. It is not a typical business autobiography. In fact it sometimes reads like a novel, I mean how many business entrepreneurs have cheated death on at least 3 occasions I can think of, have flown at 200mph in a ballon in the upper atmosphere, have sped accross the Atlantic in a souped up speedboat, or worked with some of the biggest bands in the world (The Rolling Stones etc).    It is hard to believe all Richard has achieved. It really makes most other entrepreneurs look like amatures! Some of his stories from the 1970's are particulary funny!    Well worth a read.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly will leave you wondering if anyone at Fox had ANY brains when they canceled this wonderful show.  The storyline is unique, the acting is top-notch, and the special effects are first-rate.  The only disappointment is that it ends!  This show should still be in production; it makes you wonder what kind of idiots make decisions about what to keep and what not to  keep.  One word of advice: the first couple of episodes are somewhat confusing, but by the third episode, you will be able to relate to the characters, you will \\"get\\" the premise, and you will be hooked.  Don't forget to order the sequel movie \\"Serenity\\", which ties together some of the loose ends.  VERY highly recommended!
0061122416|5.0|On the surface, this is a story about a simple shepherd boy named Satiago who goes off in search of treasure, seeing the world and having many expieriences not many shepherds get the chance to have.    If that is all you get out of this book, you have completely missed the point.    You see, Santiago first learns of this treasre through a recurring dream, and an old king named Melchizedek tells him to pursue this dream-it is God's plan for the boy. To live this dream out, he must follow the omens-which are pretty much God's language. Along his journeys, he will meet a crystal merchant who believes it is better to simply dream of your potential, an Englishman who belivevs evereyone has control over their own destinies, and an alchemist-who teaches the boy many things, including how to turn himself into the wind.    I throughly enjoyed this book. It pretty much said that when you follow your dreams, nothing can stop you. And when you follow God's plan, you might just see the world on your way tho accomplishment. I agree with this message, and found the book very inspirational. The sentence structure is a bit on the simple side, and I think this might have something to do with the translation from Portugeese to English. One of the limits of not being fluent in Portugeese is that we can only ttruthfully read this book's essence. However, I found the essence astounding-and definitely recommend this book to anybody who has ever had a dream.
B000005RDY|5.0|i like hard rock selectively - i generally buy compilations unless - there are superlative individual albums - like paranoid or machine head or led zep 2.    i bought this collection over getting bandolier individually and was pleasantly surprised.     superlative!!!    breadfan, in the grip ... (what a dramatic riff at the end), napolean bonaparte, parents are all standout tracks!    i think the band would have been more successful if they had been lucky to find a great guitarist - like page or blackmore or iommi or rhoads.    when i bought this this was pretty much the only disk i listened to for 2 months! and predictably i tired of it (as you will with any album). but for that two months it was great.    i enjoyed it so much that i bought an extra two for a couple of friends - it seemed the natural thing to do given that the cd was so cheap.    i now occasinally listen to this and enjoy it.    get it man!
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is destined to be regarded as one of the greatest writers of our time.  I hesitated to pick up this second novel of his because the description on the dust jacket was so similar to that of his masterpiece, \\"Kite Runner.\\"   I feared a formula novel, this time with females as protagonists instead of males. To my relief, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" turned out to be a beautiful, original story, as inspiring and thought-provoking as its predecessor.  In it, Hosseini brilliantly and subtly imparts to Western readers an empathy for our sisters in Afghanistan, enabling us to understand choices they make in their lives that, before reading his book, were unfathomable to us.

B000UJCALI|5.0|All the reports about the film being released as the 119 minute version are false. The Special Edition is 144 minutes, as it should be.<br />That said, Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\" is a great film, it's always been a great film, and will always be a great film, no matter if it's full screen like the previous DVD releases or matted/widescreen like the Special Edition. Shut up and buy it.
0743486285|5.0|Amazing book that is incredibly hard to put down; total page-turner.  Freaks a person out that someone can so much damage to themselves and live to tell about it.  Thank God because Nikki is unreal and has a great story to share!!
0743486285|1.0|The idioticly melodramatic title to this book says it all.  Mr. Sixx is just as shallow as the songs he writes.  He should have the sense to know that  calling your memoir \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" is a glorification of the drug that will inevitably lead others to try it.  The old get addicted and become a hero when you've cleaned up routine is tired and outdated.  This book sucks, just like his drumming and his band.
0385493800|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors, and I think The Testament is one of his best books.  From the shocker of a beginning of The Testament to the last page, Grisham's descriptions of alcoholic Attorney Nate O'Riley's reluctant boat rides up the Paraguay River into the Pantanal of Brazil in search of the mystery sole heir of a multi-billion dollar estate all bring vivid images into the minds of the readers, and keep one riveted to the book.  I keep waiting for this story to be made into a movie as so many of his other books have been.  If it was kept true to the book....My opinion:  It would be a blockbuster! [[ASIN:0385493800 The Testament]]
0553805460|2.0|When I first heard of this book I was very excited and could not wait to read it.  Unfortunately, this book has been very disappointing to say the least.  It is poorly written with such terms as \\"Loamy Loins\\" I mean who really speaks that way.  I know of no New Yorker that has ever used that term let alone anyone else. The stories are far fetched and unbelievable.  I thought I was going to get a thoughtful insight into one of walls Streets Great minds (albeit a criminal mind); instead I got crude stories from a drug addicted egomaniac.  Don't waste your time or hard earned money.

0792163710|5.0|Merely the best western ever made,far superior to its Oscar winning predecessor \\"High Noon\\".The film did win an Oscar for best cinematography,undeniably valid, but a rebuff to the picture itself.Director Stevens,per usual, seems able to attain top quality from everyone. First, Ladd's height is increased to a whopping 5'6\\" through the use of 2 inch boot inserts. The aging Arthur (why she never won an Oscar may be for Claude Rains and Cary Grant to answer) is perfectly cast with Van Heflin, and Jack Palance sets new standards  for an evil western gunslinger. Add 9 year old Brandon DeWilde as an impressed young devotee of reformed gunslinger Shane, two brutal barroom brawls, several incursions by the local bad guys, the climatic barroom showdown, and a heart wrenching finale, and all you have is ,well, my opening sentence.

1595141715|5.0|In my 33 years of being a librarian, I've rarely experienced the buzz and excitement that this book has generated, Harry Potter notwithstanding!  I picked up several autographed copies of it last night, in anticipation of the author's visit to our school and to a local bookstore today.  I thought I'd skim it to get an idea of its contents...well, there's no way to put it down.  I tried.  More than once.  Jay Asher has the remarkable ability to write from both the female and male points of view.  Thirteen Reasons Why grabs the reader instantly--it's well-written, it's perceptive, it has elements of a psychological, Hitchcockian(?)mystery/thriller.  The reader is left to ponder the power of words, rumors, and innuendo; adults will be reminded of their teen years (and people they'll never forget) and teen readers, too, will identify with one or more characters.  I won't recount the storyline, since the professional reviewers' synopsis will suffice.  I will emphasize that this is a MUST READ, no matter what your age!  Just start reading it at a reasonable hour, because putting it down isn't an option!
0307341550|3.0|I almost gave up on this one about 25 pages in, for the same reasons others have hated it. A VERY unsympathetic protagonist and unrealistic depiction of small town life and teenagers. For lack of anything better to read I stuck with it, and it turned out better than I thought. There are reasons Camille behaves the way she does, and it's actually rather brave of Flynn to depict such a messed up, apparently unappealing lead (esp. a woman). So kudos for that. For the story itself -- it  would  be a good airplane or beach read.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Alter Bridge's second album is absolutely outstanding. Its better than their first and also better than anything they did under their old name of Creed. It combines good lyrics with face-melting guitar to create an amazing Rock album. Not alternative, not grunge, not any of that rock/rap combined stuff... just straight up guitars, drums and a guy who can sing. If you're a fan of good Rock who hasn't heard of Alter Bridge or have heard of them and haven't bought an album yet, buy this CD! Its more than worth the money and will definately sell well.
B000MV8ABS|1.0|\\"If this one doesn't scare you...You're Already Dead!\\" goes the tagline for Phantasm and, well...I must be dead.  Even viewing this movie in bed...in the dark...ALONE...wasn't a creepy experience.  I can remember being TERRIFIED by images of the flying metal sphere from the TV commercials for this movie as a child, so I braced myself for finally confronting some of those childhood fears.  Turns out, just like with \\"It's Alive\\", I had nothing to fear at all.  Touted as one of the \\"scariest movies every made\\", this movie is extremely laughable, and about as scary as Mister Roger's Neighborhood.  If the horrid, tacky 70's fashions and musical \\"score\\" don't get you, the excruiciatingly bad SFX will.  The death spheres are designed, apparently, to drill red paint, followed by Kool-Aid, out of people's heads.  Nobody is drving the hearse!  Well, unless you look through the windshield into the driver's seat!  Add a ludicrous, big rubber fly on steroids, an ending that makes NO sense whatsoever (It was all a dream?  OK, then WHY did the dream suddenly become real?  Or is THAT all a dream, too?).  If you like truly GOOD horror movies, AVOID this train wreck at all costs!  Anybody want to buy a VERY slightly used copy?
B000JFXTHC|5.0|Here we have -again- an exquisite product, as all made about Enya, again luxuriously finished, again a detailed item. The red velver case with gold stamped logos and titles is just precious.

B00016POFE|5.0|Really enjoy the DTS mix. Don't really know why, but my cheap Toshiba carousel player could not handle the surround mix. It would keep switching from DTS to  Dolby Pro Logic, sounded like an old LP skipping a grove. It was time for a new DVD player so I went with the OPPO 970 and it plays the DVD perfectly.    Sounds like a cross between Pink Floyd / YES and several other newer musicians.

1582701709|5.0|I've heard of this book from some friends few months ago, and I watched the first 20 minute of the Secret DVD on YouTube with them. I got so interested in this LoA, so I searched a lot of information on internet and watched many videos about it. But like many of readers here, I was very skeptical about this and it is just so commercial and I didn't believe in the LoA.     For the last few months while I didn't believe in the LoA, my life was suffering so much from depression and loneliness that come from being in a foreign country by myself. I desperately wanted to find way to change my life. Nothing ever worked. Then I came back to have interest in the Secret. I began to read this book from the bookshop nearby and then after I started to read this book, so much hope and belief came within me. I've never thought of buying this book, coz I thought that all this book was saying is that \\"Visualize what you want and you will have them.\\" I was like how is it even possible? What kinda rubbish is that?     But as my last hope to desperately wanting to change my life, I purchased this book few days ago, and am determined to make this LoA work for me. And although I haven't manifested anything very amazing yet, a lot of changes are occuring within me. I realized how important it is to keep out my negative feelings and thoughts, and forcus on good things in my life and think about what I really want and feel good about it. As I try to really practice it, I have been monitoring most of my thoughts, and within these few days already my interpersonal relationships are improving and I don't feel that desperate loneliness and depression anymore.     I believe in the LoA, and I made my mindmovie and am watching twice everyday. For those who think this book is all rubbish, I recommend that maybe you should at least try this first, and then if it doesn't work for you, then complain. I don't think there is anything to really lose by applying what this book is teaching into real life.So what is the point of blaming this book and the author even before you really practice it?    Anyway, although the amazing magic this book is showing us doesn't manifest to us, it surely changed most of my negative thinking pattern and feelings, and even only for that, this money I invested for this book is so much worth it. I've read tons of self-help books and none of those books were anyway near to this book in changing my thinking patterns.

6305841861|5.0|First of all, let me say that this movie isn't for everyone, especially those who don't understand Sam Raimi's intentions. If you're looking for a straightforward horror movie, then you completely missing the point and probably will not like it.    If you can enjoy a movie that blends genres into a single amalgamation of entertainment, then EDII might be right up your alley.    At best, Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is a tongue-in-cheek work, a riff on the genre as well as a showcase of director Sam Raimi's love of slapstick humor, directoral prowess, and willingness to torture lead actor Bruce Campbell.    Oh, but there's blood. Hundreds of gallons of it. Easily as much as the first movie, and it's more well-done thanks to the budget. Decapitations. Gore. Screams. Laughing lamps and deer heads. Greg Nicotero's effects, as usual, are great.    Much of the fun in watching EDII:DBD is seeing the horrors that the main character, Ash (played by B-Rate genius Bruce Campbell), endures. He's alone for nearly thirty minutes and carries the action with a wide-eyed naivete that is almost maddeningly endearing. His physical comedy is unmatched and the one-liners made him semi-famous.    A remake of the first movie, Evil Dead II should be viewed with the context in mind. It is as well-done as any 80s horror movie with twice the wit and gore simultaneously.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|A few years back one of the brothers from Oasis (the one that is a complete jerk) said that System of a Down was the Worst Band Ever and that he wondered if it was a sign of the apocalypse that a band this bad could be popular. I hate to agree with a jerk, but he has some very valid points on this topic.
0743201140|4.0|I read this after it was mentioned and lauded at a conference I was at, and am very glad I did.  I have talked with several people about this since I've read it, and it's prompted me to sit down with one employee to review his strengths and career paths within our organization that would help him fully utilize what talents he has.  While I agree that there does not seem to be a lot of specifics about exact steps to implement these ideas, frankly I've found that a lot of the time when there are exact steps they don't fit the management model we have anyway.      I have also been thinking about the implications of this book as a mother of a pre-teen daughter, and the concern I have with self-confidence issues as she enters the mysterious world of teendom.  While there is a book (by another author, forward by Buckingham) coming out Feb 2008 that seems to talk directly about kids ands strengths that I will get and read, in the mean time I think that several of the lessons are very applicable to understanding and raising teens.  Rather than spending time and energy  - and creating frustration - by working on creating a talent that isn't there, instead as she gets older we'll work on focusing on the talents that are there and ways to work around, compensate for, etc. weaknesses.  That does not mean she doesn't have to do certain homework (!), but it will mean that the way we approach studying, getting projects done, and activities at school will be focused on playing to her strengths; hopefully building these skills to support her strengths will only help her as she moves on in life.
1878424602|5.0|This is a pocketbook guide--about the size of a 4\\" x 6\\" photo with 96 pages, so it's a quick read.  You could slip it in your pocket (guys) or purse (ladies) and take it with you on the bus, to the office lunchroom, or wherever and you will probably want to re-read it many times.  Introductory comments claim that \\"within its pages are the secrets to making all your dreams come true.  It is based on natural laws that govern all of creation. . . \\"  They also claim that \\"these are the same principles that nature uses to create everything in material existence\\".<br /><br />The natural laws/The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success are listed as:<br />1) The Law of Pure Potentiality--our essential state is pure consciousness with all possibilities and infinite creativity and is not separate from our spiritual essence.  Mr. Chopra explains what the Law means in several pages and then summarizes with how you can experience the Law [the correct way].  In this instance, you can experience this Law by 1) connecting with your spirit daily, as in meditation, 2) practicing being nonjudgmental and 3) communing with nature.<br />2) The Law of Giving and Receiving--giving and receiving is about the flow and exchange of energies.  Give love if you expect to receive love, and so on.  Give freely with an open heart.  Giving does not have to monetary.<br />3) The Law of Karma or Cause and Effect--action and the consequence(s) of that action--conscious choice-making.  Make choices that will bring happiness.<br />4) The Law of Least Effort--our actions should be motivated by love, not by power and control.  Accept people as they are.<br />5) The Law of Intention and Desire--within every desire are the mechanics for its fulfillment<br />6) The Law of Detachment--give up our attachment to the outcome of our desires.  Attachment is based on insecurity and fear<br />7) The Law of Dharma or Purpose in Life--we are spiritual beings who have taken on physical form to fulfill a purpose and to serve others with that purpose<br /><br />Of course, there is far more in this booklet than my quickie review of it.  As explained in number 1, above, Mr. Chopra gives a detailed explanation of each Law, then explains the proper way to experience the Law.  I believe this to be an excellent little book with really good information.  You will find many of today's respected spiritual authors talking about the same concepts, because, as I believe, these concepts are right on target.  Living these concepts and working with your spirituality can help provide you a great deal of joy and peace.<br /><br />Namaste'there is far more in this booklet than my quickie review of it.

B000R5N1MC|5.0|To clear up for some people, like b. Trout, who would rather write an idiotic review instead of reading just a little bit, this is the \\"Collector's Edition\\"  It comes with much more than just the 5-disc movie feature, but also special packaging for collectors.  The stand-alone package is also available.  Which still includes the 5-discs (not just one disc) with a standard price, if not a fantastic one!  Not only can you get this great deal for a legendary film, but you can also choose between Blu-Ray and HDDVD!  4 options total!      Fantastic job fulfilling the needs of many fans to celebrate this timeless classic.  I really hope that there's a metal briefcase under my Xmas tree this year.  That \\"one-star\\" review should be removed and b. Trout should be banned from the internet for one month.  Never ever \\"1-star\\" Bladerunner.  Never!

B000MXPE74|4.0|They are almost too easy to like and that's what happens. I made it a habit to be lightly buzzed (like a bee)when I listen to what is new bands for me. I buy the CD and give each a fair chance to do their thing, to see what they got to offer to this my little world of music loving, talent searching and tunes hungry. Always open for what is out there just as long as it is above the mediocre pool that has been in existence from day one. There are lots and lots of groups, everywhere I see or listen to lots of different sounds. The Fratellis impressed me with their particular style, it is almost like music from the past but with an original twist. The band is tight, vocals pretty good and lo and behold: One friendly Old Lady that I know was listening to Costello Music and she started getting in hyper drive, which told me that these guys were hitting all the right notes for her. She is otherwise very sedated and very seldom changes this demeanor but with the Fratellis blaring at almost full volume (she is kind of deaf so it is a must to crank it up!)she was having a Ball! I liked that as well. Not the fact that an old woman is rocking out but that this kind of music brought that in her. 4 Stars for the Fratellis \\"Costello Music\\". Nice addition to my reinvigorated collection of music!
B000002GQH|5.0|It's hard to believe this was recorded at the edge of the end of the 60's.  Wow... talk about talent and super song spinners.  This is absolutely worth a place in anyone's musical library.
B00005JPKE|3.0|This movie is different from many others, it does not glorify war.  You really get to see the story of many of the Japanese who fought and died defending those islands, and ther perspective was very interesting and unique. I rated this movie 3 stars for a few simple reasons: most of the dialogue it's in japanese, this makes it hard to follow and get involved. Also I felt that the portrail of the Japanese soldiers was maybe too sympathetic. I heard from my father who actually was there,  that they were far more fanatical than portrayed.
B000TIO4Z0|5.0|To quote Tony Locantro in the booklet, Callas is the prima donna assoluta for now and all time. Her life itself was like a great Romantic opera, he said, a story of triumph, drama, and, finally, tragedy. But her art and life are too well known to discuss here.<br /><br />What is left is, apart from the legend, the voice, of which fortunately a lot is recorded. This set has all the studiorecordings she ever made with EMI. Individually these records would add up to a lot of $$ to buy, so this set is wonderful. It comes in a nice box, and in compact paper cases. Of course, EMI could have made this set look more fancy, but then this atrractive price would not be possible I guess. It is all about the music in the end, and the quality of the cd's itself is superb. This set has I believe the latest remasters from Abbey Road Studio's, so it does not get better than this. It also comes with a good booklet, and extra info in pdf format can be downloaded at callas30.com<br />Get this set, whether you are a fan, or just thinking about giving opera a try, since, as in art so seldom happens (apart from Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Caruso and La Callas), this is undisputed the best opera can get when it comes to a female voice. All that on 70 cds for almost nothing, what more could one want? Great EMI, hope a similar set on all live performances will follow?
B000I0QK74|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase. It is exactly what they said it was.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I've already seen this movie a few times, and I'm quite a bit older than the intended fan base, but as far as movies go, especially tv movies, HSM2 really did a decent job at capturing kids' imagination. And even after the vanessa hudgens scandal, I still think that this is a truly outstanding movie from Disney that will go down as a Disney classic in the years to come.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|A minus; A to A plus if you dig fantasy (A lad promises to bring back a fallen star to his clueless and petulant love interest; the star is in a magical land; turns out the star is a girl and everyone wants the star b/c she holds special powers) (Impressive cast and some key/funny roles for De Niro and Pfeiffer especially) (based on the Neil Gaiman novel though the movie is better).
0316776963|4.0|Splendid, silly and sensitive. I really enjoyed the wit and melodious nature of this one. Sedaris at perhaps his finest - at least for my book shelf. The themes he creates are always carried out very easily from essay to essay, chapter to chapter. His words lift off of the page in such description in this book that really set the quickly-changing scenes and acheive bursts of laughter with continuous humor. His best work in my eyes so far.
B000FJGWBM|5.0|Incredible film, very unique, one of the best I have ever seen (and I have seen many).  Can view multiple times and see new things.  On the scene where we see Sammy Jankis sitting in the hospital, does anyone notice the brief flash of Shelby Leonard in the chair!  Leonard is Sammy Jankis, his wife did not die from the Attack and she killed herself!  This film is brilliant!!!
B000VI04HK|3.0|The CD alone is a very good live CD. The eclectic mix of songs spanning three decades is fun, exciting and moving. The handful of songs from their Around the Sun album are actually IMPROVED in this live album - made me appreciate some of the songs I kind of dismissed on the album in '05. What's the Frequency, Kenneth? is perhaps at its best version - faster tempo, rockin' and fresh. Most of the true rock tunes here are played faster and more force, which is super. It's a very, very good live CD. But as compared with what most of us R.E.M. fans were hoping for, it's just not quite great. Maybe one or two more really rare songs that we'd never hear on a CD (i.e. Stipe singing a capella or a good 'ole cover song) would bump this up to an A.
B000I2J0VK|5.0|Kubrick's films are all unique and thought-provoking.  This final entry into a brilliant career is a psychological masterpiece, with elements of voyeurism and controversy. The theme is that of psychological infidelity and how it affects the main character, played by Tom Cruise.  From the moment his wife describes a fantasy she had at a hotel years before concerning another man, Cruise propels from one encounter to another, each becoming more and more dangerous. Several times, Cruise barely escapes bad situations as he wonders the seedier side of New York. Drugs, HIV, prostitutes, pedophiles, Masked Balls, this film has it all. It also has symbolism (notice the use of color) and a great cast of beautiful people including Nicole Kideman, LeeLee Sobieski and Julianne Davis. The story threads around a prostitute named Mandy Cruise meets at a party, who has \\"ODed\\" in his married friends bathroom.  Later he encounters her at a Masked Ball, where a sex orgy is underway. Faced with getting an unrated film, Kubrick inserted shadows and Masked figures hiding all of the sexual activity for the Theatrical version. It plays well, leaving the viewer to their imagination. Having viewed the unrated edition, the removal of the CGI figures does not make the scenes any more erotic, and the viewer may prefer the hidden feel as imagination can be more compelling than seeing the action.  The use of music and color is very erotic and artistic.  When Cruise blows his cover, the viewer never knows if it was for play or real, as Mandy sacrifices herself for Cruise's release.  I thought the morgue scene was very touching, that Cruise genuinely cared for her and wanted to save her.  At the end, Cruise ultimately finds that imagined infidelity may be worse than the real thing.  If you are looking for something different, I highly recommend 'Eyes Wide Shut'
0064400557|5.0|I bought this book for my 6 year old daughter. She LOVED it! Its was a great chapter starter book for her. This was a good way to make sure she was truly understanding what she was reading. It engaged her she really enjoyed the story. Afterwards we watched the movie =) GREAT BOOK!
B000P2A256|3.0|Having heard Maroon 5's best songs on the radio, I was disappointed in this album.  It would have been better to just download the most popular songs from iTunes.  I was hoping that the work would all be as good as the most popular songs.
B000H30B2C|5.0|King Kong is a well put together movie (both the movie itself and the 3-Disc Deluxe Edtion DVD).  State of the art special effects, great characters, action, drama, comedy, and Peter Jackson's directing.  Easily his best movie since 'Dead Alive' (a.k.a. 'Braindead').  Jackson stayed true to the 1933 original that he loved so much by remaking the movie with today's technology.  He even used some of the same lines and action sequences from the original (albeit with a little flare).  While some may see this as laziness, I see it as Jackson's homage to the one movie that inspired him to be a filmmaker.    Some reviewers have had a problem with the casting.  I couldn't disagree more.  Firstly, Naomi Watts is one of the greatest actresses of all time.  I enjoy anything and everything she does.  She can say so much with her face, which is important in this movie as her part (Ann Darrow) is light on dialogue.  Her character is extremely important because she has the most interaction with Kong (our title character) and we learn a lot of what is happening with Kong through her.  Although the filmmakers did such a fantastic job with the special effects and motion capture that Kong himself is also very good at expressing his feelings (sans any dialogue,of course), a lot of which is due to the multi-talented Andy Serkis.  Jack Black is fantastic (he's the character you love to hate in this movie) and Adrian Brody is good as always.     I have to mention that so far this may be one of the best DVDs in terms of special features that I have seen so far.  It's not the only one that has hours of behind the scenes material, but it is the only one that I have been able to watch all of those hours without actually getting bored (many thanks go to Jack Black for this).  The cast and crew really had a great time shooting this movie and it shows.  And as a bonus all of the special feature footage is shot in widscreen so you don't have to adjust the ratio on your TV.    So, if you like monster movies: watch this movie.  If you like Peter Jackson: watch this movie.  If you like Naomi Watts (if anybody doesn't I want to talk to you): watch this movie.  If you like crazy action, including giant apes, dinosaurs, giant insects and slugs, etc.: watch this movie.  I would like to personally thank Peter Jackson for making this movie.  I will enjoy it always.
B000002UDB|5.0|This is my favorite Beatles album. They took the psychedlic influence up a notch from Sgt. Pepper's. It is incredibly creative and experimental. This album came out just months after Sgt. Pepper's. Can you imagine that in this day and age when artists routinely take 2-5 years between mediocre albums? Then they followed it up with the White album several months later. Amazing! Like most of their albums, there are plenty of hits but nothing bad on the album. Oh how this brings me back to my own summer of love in 87 when I enjoyed the same substances that heavily influence this album.
0060536977|5.0|This novel is well worth the reading/listening time!  I learned a great deal and highly recommend it.
B000002U82|4.0|Another amazing Pink Floyd Album, but Meddle, A Saucerful of Secrets, and Piper at the Gates of Dawn were all superior, reflecting a more psychedelic influence. This album is more of a mid 70s rock style, which is obviously great for the genre. Fortunately they ended on another amazing note with The Final Cut. Anything after that isn't really Pink Floyd.
B000UNYK76|5.0|Immagine in Cornice is by far the best Pearl Jam DVD to date.  It gives a great side of the band that we've yet to see.  The only thing that comes close to this is an hour special I saw on Eddie Vedder spending a few days at Laird Hamilton's home (it was on HDNet or Mojo, I forget).  The song selection has so many of my favorites and I'm glad to see songs like Blood and Alive finally make it on a cut of a DVD release.  I highly recommend this to anyone remotely interested in the band.
0143038419|5.0|What a brilliant communicator, marvelous, entertaining, fresh, thought provoking! It is amazing how a person can be so original in expression, and at the same time be such a stereotypical example of the breed!! The book is an adventure in information binging, born of an affirmation deficit. Very helpful in understanding the type, a veritable SUPER WAL-MART of coping mechanisms. So well worth the read. Sure hope she finally got fixed!
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is truly one of my favoites.  This book will teach the reader more about themselves than about to characters.  While it would be easy to read this book in about 2 hours, I enjoyed reading a few pages or a chapter at a time - then letting the ideas sink in.  I have bought about 10 copies a year for the past few and hand them out to friends and clients.
0767827902|3.0|Though I remember well when this movie first came out, I only saw it for the first time just recently. Having grown up in a very small Wyoming town I can relate to the story and think it did a good job of portraying life there. Filming in black and white added to the authenticity of an old movie, but that feel was unnecessarily compromised by a few glaring discrepancies. The first thing I noticed was that the beat-up old pickup Sonny drove around in was a mid-to-late 1940s model, and would have only been five or six years old when the movie took place. Okay, so it had a very hard five or six year life, but it sure looked like the 30+ year old truck that it actually was in the early seventies. Another thing was the hair length on the boys. I am sure a lot of  poorer small town kids skipped a haircut now and then, and those who wanted it longer had it styled in a pompadour, though that was more prominent later in the decade. The brief crowd shots showed 70s hair, most blatantly in the scene of the high school band. Jeff bridges probably refused to cut his hair because he wanted to keep his 70s style hair when not filming, but he could have at least compromised at the end and not squandered his credibility. I am betting that a Korean war era soldier just out of boot camp would not be sporting long hair and sideburns. The Army Ike jacket was authentic, but what was with the double set of collar emblems? The studio would not have had to hire a military consultant, they could have just asked anyone who had spent time in the Army during that time to look over the costume. I bite my tongue a lot during a movie out of respect for other viewers, but it is disappointing to have a period piece tainted by little stupid things that could easily have been done differently.              Overall, though, it is worth seeing.
B000002KMY|5.0|I am 44 years old now and I've been listening Hard Rock since I was 16. But I missed Black Sabbath somehow then. They were much better than Deep Purple or Iron Maiden but I didn't know it , pity...
B000SQJ27I|4.0|MAnu Chao's hard to digest. He's definetly an aqcuired taste for most of the people: you either like him or not. Even so, it's easy to anyone in the world to relate to his lyrics, specially for latin americans, that's why he's so popular here.     This album's great. It's so refreshing to listen to something new from Manu. Radio Bemba was great, but with only a few new songs (e.g. Rumba de Barcelona) he left us fans wanting more... and sheesh! hem ade us wait!!    But the wait was worth. La Clandestina is your typical MAnu Chao album, full of latin/flamenco/gypsy/african influences with lyrics that deal with society and political issues.    With all the trash music that's produced today in the music business it's always good to count on artist with something to say.    Favorite tracks: Me llaman calle, Besoin de la Lune, Rainin in paradize.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD. Nikki has done it again - amazing music, amazing lyrics, amazing group. The lyrics are dark and painful, they compliment the book very well, but there is hope in them as well. While I've never had a drug addiction, that doesn't mean there wasn't some way for me to connect to this music. Everybody has something that haunts them, everybody has something they're running from at some point, and I am certainly one of those people. \\"Everybody gets high, low, bruised, sold,\\" right? I've definitely been down that self-destruction path on purpose and I can relate to a lot of these lyrics. The darkness in peoples lives isn't just through drugs. Nikki may not have been aiming for that when he wrote his book and this soundtrack, but he has reached a lot of people emotionally with both, which means none of us are alone in things like this. (i realize this is \\"deeper\\" than a review should prob go, but how else do we thank Nikki? :) I've been a Crue fan for as long as I can remember, Nikki's talent is still there and growing and I hope we get more from Sixx A.m. (more from Nikki, anyway)(actually, I'd like more MC - hint, hint :)
0316067598|2.0|This book is not worth the full, hardcover price.  (This guy is not a storyteller, and the book was written and editted poorly.)  I do not question that this guy is a patriot and a warrior.  I do not question this guy's commitment and service.  If I need something dead or demolished, this guy is my go-to guy.  The story is not necessarily bad... BUT the first third or more of the book is an overly dramatic and self-important account of his childhood and training -- a style that he carries through the rest of the book.  A well-written, big-picture approach to this story would have made it stellar.
B00000J7SS|5.0|A genius at his best. We all know that Miles is one of the greatest Jazz musicians of our time, however, this double album puts him above all other Jazz great. Gotta have this in your record collection
B000W4HJ44|3.0|Hmmmm, so many positive reviews for this film and yet it left me rather underwhelmed. I hated last years' \\"Dreamgirls\\" and especially despised Jennifer Hudson's hideously over-the-top performance, so it was no surprise that I found this weak as well.<br /><br />Primary concern is with the uninspired casting. Where the 1988 film had charm and wit, this one is one big drag joke. Not for one instant can you take John Travolta seriously as a woman, not even in a campy way, and since so much screen time is devoted to him, its a bit sad to see the film lower its' standards each time it cuts to Travolta's idiotic performance.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky has been getting so much good press, but its hard to see why. At best she is an overweight girl who has an average singing voice. There is nothing special about her at all. She lacks that *it* factor that can grab your attention - and lets face it, if watching an overweight high school student with a weak voice running around the streets of Baltimore is your kind of thing, you'll like this. It isn't my bag at all, and I hated it. No one should offer this woman any more roles in the future - she is a total waste of screen.<br /><br />The good? Well you have James Marsden (Cyclops from 'X-Men') in perhaps his best role. He doesn't have a very big role, but he is a fine actor and dancer, and has the screen charisma to set the frames ablaze everytime the machines focus on his face. And what can one say about Zac Efron? I fail to understand his appeal. I've said it before - he is supposed to be 19 years old but looks like a fifty year old woman post cosmetic surgery. This is no joke. How any thirteen year old girl can find someone like him 'hot' is beyond me. When I was a teen, I remember girls around me idolizing Jordan Knight, NKOTB, and Tommy Page, but at least they all looked remotely like men, or boys to say the least. Yuck.<br /><br />The musical score is great, but then again, I would recommend the soundtrack if you liked the music alone. I find that listening to the CD (I have the entire soundtrack on my Ipod) is a much more rewarding experience.<br /><br />Here is an example - I had the soundtrack for a full two months before I saw the actual film. Imagine my disgust when the opening track, \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" burst onto the screen with a plain-jane Nikki Blonsky fatly jumping pavements in what can only be termed an uninspired miasma of cliched film-hell? Disgusting. I'll stick to my soundtrack, thank you. It was quite a task watching these beautiful numbers done so poorly on screen.<br /><br />I have to give kudos to the only two people here who actually shone - Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah. Now these are two women who deserve to lend their talents to better films - I agree - but over here they had a few good songs and their segments seem infinitely more superior to the madness that are the other scenes. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if they chopped out the ludicrous John Travolta scenese and re-released this, I just might want to watch it again. They should also cut out Blonsky while they're at it. Or just remake the whole thing again. But I digress.<br /><br />Bottom Line - This was a huge disappointment for me, a lover of the soundtrack. When the best thing about a film is the guy who played Cyclops from X-Men, then you know you aren't faring very well. Better luck with the next musical adaptation boys. And please don't cast Travolt a or Blonsky in that one and mess it up.ning to the CD (I have the entire soundtrack on my Ipod) is a much more rewarding experience.

B000NVIXFK|2.0|..to like this, I really did. These guys are truly great but there are just very few real songs here. The playing is impeccable and I like the intstrumentals, but where is the melody? The best Rush tunes at least had some semblance of melody, but now that Geddy sings with little of the range he once had, the vocal lines are just straight and flat.    50 percent of this is pretty good, the other half, well, it's boring.

B000654YRY|4.0|This is a great show!  I give it 4 stars because I want to see the show in its entirety released.  I know they were promoting their current album on this tour, but I know for a fact that many songs were left off of this DVD, and since this is the last tour Dire Straits did, it would make sense to release a DVD with every song performed.

B00012QM8G|4.0|This film was and still is a revolution in our approach of the Shoah, the Holocaust, the extermination of the Jews during the second world war. It reveals in shocking images the tactics used by the Nazis to capture the Jews, here in Poland, in order to seize their possessions and to transform them into slaves. In each city of some importance all the Jews of a region were compelled to regroup and live entirely within the militarily controlled limits of a ghetto.<br /><br />Then the Nazi Party imposed the election or appointing of a Jewish Council to manage the ghetto, that is to say to implement the orders from the Nazis. Then some businessmen, essentially industrialists came to provide the Jews with work and there the Jews became consenting even if forced slaves and later on the ghettos will be liquidated and forced labor camps will further transform the Jews into inmates forced to work for the businessman and kept in order by some SS unit.<br /><br />The value of the film comes from the fact that the industrialist concerned in Krakow, Schindler himself, comes from previously independent Czechoslovakia and is a member of the Nazi party with important connections in Berlin that gives him the upper hand even on the SS. It is unluckily slightly difficult to believe it since the connections are not brought within our knowledge. Who could in Nazi Germany be more powerful than the SS?<br /><br />The film will show how much money this man was able to make with that slave labor. Real fortunes that enabled him to double his political influence with financial corruption. But there it shows how the Jews from the very beginning (the order to go and live in the closest ghettos) right to the very end (either their being sent to Auschwitz to be gassed or being saved and freed by Schindler) will always disbelieve the worst news they could get and always believe in some kind of higher order that will either sacrifice them or save them, that order being from another dimension of time and space. Is it divine, is it a God, is it some kind of cosmic force?<br /><br />No one knows which one, but it is a force against which you cannot do anything. You have to submit and survive if it so pleases this force. This submissiveness is never questioned and hardly contrasted to some Jewish individuals, and only individuals, who would have thought of resisting, or at least escaping. No matter what happens, they sing a song of lamentation or a song of thanks, but they were reduced to a herd of cattle and they submitted to that fate. It is pathetic to see how Schindler's Jews do not protest against any violence or whatever. They just, on arriving in Auschwitz, call the name of their &#34;Nazi Master&#34;, Schindler himself.<br /><br />They have been reduced to being Schindler's herd. The vision is absolutely disquieting, disturbing, sickening. That definitely is the worst part of such a war. And that absolute alienation is constantly brought back by any war, be it in Palestine, in Lebanon or in Iraq. That's were the film is poignant and at the same time finds its limit. The film avoids all other types of exterminated group, ethnic or not, because all these other groups produced another attitude: rebellion, refusal, fight, struggle. It is also important to see that even in Poland, even in these ghettos, even within these Jewish Councils there was some refusal, rebellion, even a rebellion in the name of freedom in spite of it meaning immediate death: better die than submit to the final degradation, alienation, internalized victimization.<br /><br />Stephen Spielberg hence does not reflect the whole historical truth but favors one approach only. That explains why the film feels as having aged with time and the end definitely becomes morbidly sentimental: love and gratefulness for the one who made them slaves and only saved them because they were his property that he bought with the money they produced. He is only saving his own possessions, like a rancher would protect his herd. The ending thus is too positive to be acceptable. If the Jews had been able to massively move into rebellion, resistance, guerrilla warfare or even plain warfare, the war could have been different.<br /><br />We are speaking of more than two million Jews just in Poland. To run down such a human wall you need time and quite a lot of tanks and planes. Hence it does not bring in any profit but cost a tremendous amount of money. Could Hitler have afforded it without having to cut some further actions short? A beautiful black and white film but that only shows one side of the picture.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUacceptable.

Our discovery of self, what makes us happy, determining what we want our life to be and how we want to live is not age-related or age-determined.  Everyone, male/female, younger/older will gain great insight from this book because, simply put, it's all about deciding what you want and taking the steps to get there.

0891419195|5.0|I was first aware of this book when it was published (without little or no fanfare) in 1981. A few years later, Sledge was interviewed by Studs Terkel for his Pulitzer Prize account, \\"The Good War.\\" Since then, his book gathered steam. Paul Fussell singled it out in his book \\"Wartime,\\" and John Keegan said in his book \\"The Second World War,\\" that the book was \\"haunting.\\" Now the book is regarded as a classic and rightly so. I read it in 1995 and while Sledge's prose may not be as polished as a professional writer, it's his total honesty the keeps you going. To me, this was the best kind of writing, it's written from the gut. It also seems like a personal excorcism, a way to purge the demons and tell people of what he saw and what we, our country lost in this war.<br />Ken Burns was right to select Sledge for his documentary, \\"The War.\\" Though the extracts they use makes Sledge seem bitter. Reading the book it seemed to me that he was proud of his service, but haunted by the terrible things he was forced to endure.<br />Also, read for what Sledge doesn't say. His friend Sam Phillips (also in Burns' \\"The War,\\") said, \\"We never took a prisoner.\\" Sledge says the same thing. One can only assume the worst in a war where life was regarded so cheaply.<br />This book should be required reading for Political leaders who are so callous to send young men to war so quickly over so little.
0805079831|1.0|The \\"Financial Times\\" reviewed this book and called it \\"dishonest\\". It basically makes connections which are not there. One example: blaming the Russian destruction of Grosny (Chechnya) on Milton Friedman, instead of on Russia. Another example, stating that the Hizbollah attempt to take over Lebanon is basically a revolt by the 'poor' against the neo-liberal world order. Constantly, Ms. Klein attempts to bang the square peg of reality (power politics, Islamic fundamentalist imperialism) into the round hole of leftwing theory. The FT basically accuses Klein of making all kinds of highly unlikely connections, which in reality, do not exist. They also state that the work is \\"deeply flawed\\".

The book is not what I had expected and that is why I can't give it a 5 star. I've read Krakauer's books before and I am somewhat familiar with his writing. This books talkes very little about what Chris' fundamental state of being...yes we know what he believed in...his great disdain of his parents...his constant pursuit of the truth...but there was a lot missing in this book.<br />When I purchased the book I was hoping to get to know the person on the movie screen more than just a mere review of his overall life...I was hoping for a (somewhat) biography of Chris McCandless...but the book fell short on this. Some of the chapters were full of the authors own personal experiences, while they are facinating they are not what I was hoping to read...and not the reason i was intrigued to by the book in the first place. I think the author could have done a better job talking to more people...who knew Chris...or maybe wrote more about his family and his relationships with the people who knew him.<br />I loved the movie...and enjoyed the book. However, when I turned the last page I wasn't captured nor did I feel like reading it again, but I'll probably buy the movie so I can watch it over again.

Yet it happens every day. Much of the time we are provided information about it, some of the time we aren't, but all of the time we should be forever grateful there are people of this magnitude operating all over the world on our behalf.
0307387178|5.0|I loved this book and the story of his odd adventure. I always wanted to run off to Alaska also. So sad that his death was probably avoidable if only he had prepared himself for the unforgiving environment.
0143038583|5.0|I purchased this book spontaneously at the airport bookstore for a recent 15-hour flight from Chicago to Delhi, primarily driven by the intriguing title (I used to be a vegetarian).   It captivated me right from the very first few pages where Michael Pollan started narrating the contemporary agro-food industrial complex principally built around, believe it or not, a single crop known to us as golden Corn.    His well researched and written treatise on the business of food and how it affects our culture, health (scourge of high fructose corn syrup and other corn derivatives), economy, and environment covers the entire spectrum from large agro businesses and food processing companies to sustainable \\"grass based\\" farms to modern day version of hunting and gathering in northern California.      You should NOT read this book if even one of the conditions apply: (1) you have nothing to do with food (2) English is your third language (3) you do not have to deal with modern society (4) you do not enjoy books which combine journalism, science, and exceptionally good writing.    In other words, go ahead and get hold of this book (even if you have to sacrifice your dinner money) and it will be one of the best culinary decisions you would have ever made.    Pollan is primarily a journalist with a gift for both researching and penning down his thoughts.   He well crafted prose reflects his careful and detailed understanding of the subject (which is food: whot it comprises, how it is grown/collected/hunted, processed, distributed, eaten and how it impacts our health, well being, and nature).   Like a true journalist, he personally investigated many interesting aspects of food for this book.   This led him to the large farming fields in Iowa where over the past few generations agriculture is now dominated with mechanized corn production, to slaughterhouses in Kansas where corn, animal waste and antibiotics fed cattle (which biologically evolved to eat grass and not grains) are raised in appalling conditions and sent to their \\"processing\\" in a fast moving pipe line.   (Some of the details are rather disturbing and may force you to raise deeper questions, if not becoming an instant vegan.)      The second part of the book, dealing with sustainable farming, is most appealing and revealing.  Here Pollan visits a grass-based farm in Virginia where cattle, chicken, grass, and humans create a sustainable cycle of life and provide a profitable production of tasty, fresh, and chemical free produce and meat for local consumption.   Preserving his experiential credentials, Pollan finds himself rotating cattle over natural grass fields, gathering \\"happy\\" chicken roaming around in picturesque Shenandoah valley, and then also butchering some of them in a transparent and humane fashion (no one would let you inside a slaughter house where the cattle are killed, or some times partially killed before being processed).   You are very likely to start exploring the nearest farmer's market in your suburbia after reading this section.    Pollan also clarifies that not all organic food is sustainable and describes absurdities such as flying asparagus 6000 miles to an Organic super market in the USA.  So the Whole Foods phenomenon is an improvement but not a panacea which not all of us fully realize!    The last section of the book focuses on hunting and gathering with all its moral and ethical complications.  Pollan cites some well regarded writers who have philosophized hunting of all subjects.   He takes us on a wile boar hunt in the Sonoma county near San Fransisco which is followed by one of the best short description of wile mushrooms and collecting them in Berkley and the high Sierras.    Similar to the first two sections, this section also culminates in a grand meal utilizing meat, fruits, vegetables, and fungi personally collected, processed, and cooked by the author.    The Omnivore's Dilemma, however, is not a cook book on what to eat or how to eat and does not specify another dieting fad (even though it does literally covers many exotic dishes and their recipes).   Instead it analyzes the reasons behind the rise of modern agro-food business, why it inproperly thrives in the name of efficiencies and conveniences, and how it is damaging the earth, health, and eventually economy.   This chemical-based, energy-intensive, and environment-polluting approach has huge implications as China and India undergo rapid development, and if not careful, may blindly adopt similar models for food production, processing, and distribution.    Pollan also notes that similar to the agro-food industrial complex, hunting and gathering is also another extreme and cannot scale to feed the current large populations.    So we are left to form our own opinions on how to proceed (as a producer, processor, and consumer) now that we are equipped with some useful tools built with knowledge embedded in this must have book.  Don't be surprised if reading this book brings out the hidden activist or proselytizer in you!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This was not an easy title to find.Was happy to find it and am enjoying it very much. Independant movies are not always easy to locate for purchase but amazon seems to have the best selection.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is one of those films that will shake you to your core, and deliver its message with a strength that is not commonly seen in today's movie industry. The story develops in East Germany, five years before the Berlin Wall came down. Under the socialist government, the Stasi, the secret police, monitored and controlled its citizens, ruling them with an iron fist. From brutal interrogations using psychological torture, to life-long bans for some people from practicing their beloved professions, the Stasi terrorized most of the population into submitting to the whims of the regime.<br /><br />In this asphyxiating system, Georg Dreyman, a writer that is not confrontational towards the leadership of the party, becomes the target of surveillance, due to the abuse of power demonstrated by Minister Hempf. This party official wants to get actress Christa-Maria Sieland, Dreyman's girlfriend, all for himself and therefore, commissions a Stasi operation to find dirt on the writer. Here is where things get really interesting, because the faithful and implacable Captain Wiesler, who is in charge of the operation, discovers through his surveillance of the couple that the human spirit and love are more important than the strict rules of domination the party exposes. The transformation by this character throughout the movie is insightful and touching, and shows how most people are not able to leave their humanity behind, no matter how much time others spent indoctrinating them.<br /><br />This story shows that there is no need for exorbitant budgets or flashy scenes in order to create a movie of the highest quality. An excellent script and inspiring performances are what get the job done in this film. The slow pace allows for an understanding of how the different situations affect the emotions of the characters, and even though I know that this will turn off some people, I found it worked extremely well with the story. If you are looking for a movie that will stir up your emotions and will leave you thinking after you are done watching, there are not many options better than this one.you thinking after you are done watching, there are not many options better than this one.
B00000AF95|5.0|The highlight of 1984 and Kiss staple 'Animalize' is a great rock record. Every song kicks and the sound quality is good even NOW!<br /><br />This is one of their best CD's. Along with 'R&R Over, Destroyer and 'Revenge'. Kiss had a few throw out ALBUMS, this isnt one of them. A great rock record through and through.

0393327655|5.0|Let us hope that this book is read and understood by millions. The dangers posed by fundamentalist cults of all kinds are as clear and present as global warming, and potentially just as destructive.<br /><br />Do we choose to pursue the great and noble opportunities that now lie within our grasp? The medical breakthroughs offered by our new understanding of the human genome, the exploration of space, the chance to achieve sustainable prosperity for all countries. Or do we choose to slide into a new dark age?<br /><br />The Enlightenment brought the abuses of religious tyranny into focus three centuries ago, and it has brought civilisation huge benefits in terms of individual freedoms, rights, security, knowledge, and comforts. We have never been better placed to apply our knowledge to solving the difficult problems of the world.<br /><br />Ignorance and superstition, the blind enslavement to fairytales that should have expired centuries ago, are intolerant of dissent or difference. When the very act of questioning the patently absurd can be severely punished, the struggle toward reason can be daunting. But it will take an effort from every reasonable person to educate the younger generations that there is a better alternative, that reality is more wonderful than the most indulgent fantasy.<br /><br />Many will not agree with every conclusion in the book. Most of us have experienced peaceful co-existence with people of various faiths. We shouldn't become paranoid. However, the book does encourage us to get our heads out of the sand & be aware of the dangers of fundamentalism in our midst.<br /><br />Best of all, the author does not throw the baby out with the bathwater. There is no need to reject spirituality in order to escape the cults of unreason. There are tried and proven methods of gaining real spiritual experience without the pathological side effects that we commonly see in belief-bound religion.<br /><br />Full marks to Harris.

B000001FQQ|4.0|This is a good rock record. From 'Rise to It' to 'Boomerang' Kiss rocks out with the help of some co-writers. This, i believe, was their stadium rock album. Almost Aerosmith-like. The songs are loose and good. Nothing especially 'spectacular' but consistantly good.<br /><br />Of course this features 'Forever' which was Kiss' biggest chart song (aside from Beth maybe). Michale Bolton co-wrote on it. Kinda slows it down, but it is a good track. Some songs are a bit cheesy like 'Loves a Slap in The Face' (Gene doin 'na na na's) and 'Love me to hate You' (Pauls 'Love' metaphores in overdrive). They are just too pop without hooks.<br /><br />There are some stellar moments though, like the Eric Carr singing debut on 'little Ceaser', The driving 'Silver Spoon', The kick as* 'Betrayed', 'Boomerang' and the cool 'Rise To it'. Even 'King of Hearts' with its poppish backing vocals is rocking. Not many songs co-written by the infamous Vini Poncia in Kiss' catalog can say that.<br /><br />This might not be Kiss' best record, but its far from their worse. If you want those, look into 'Unmasked' and the overtly pop 'Crazy Nights'. Its just a good straight forward, 80's rock CD. The co-writters (D Child,V Poncia amongst others) make for a more pop oriented sound at points. It does have solid moments and the fact is that there are 15 tracks overall and if 4 are throwouts, that still leaves 11 solid tracks. Thus the 4 rating..

B00005MP58|5.0|I initially copied this from the AE televised special. When I found out it was available on VHS I purchased it. I was happy to see it come out on disk. It is one of the best movies ever. It made me a Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehl fan. Both gifted actors. The movie follows the book and one can easily fall into the century, becoming a specator of the events. I wanted to kill Wickham for his dealings with Lydia. All the actors made me believe they took on the persona of the characters. Will look forward to more Austen disks.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|QT may have fallen out of favor with the aging hipsters and youngsters with attitudes but this is DEATH PROOF that he is still ticking despite all the bandwagon haters.  He has seen more movies than you, he does have a great eye and ear for capturing old actors and tunes and making them shine, and his dialogue often makes us feel like we aren't just watching a storyline being driven.  That is especially the case here, the first 1 hour and 10 mins or so is flawless homage, beautiful girls, great tunes, weed, Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike and Michael Parks in an amazing sheriff cameo.  Very entertaining and self indulgent but perfect in setting that bar in the rain ambiance.  Then the second hour where for some reason he drops the entire GRINDHOUSE look after a B/W scene.  I don't know why he didn't leave the grimy film effect throughout the entire thing they are in the same time period and it is off putting somewhat.  If he meant to draw a line between the two halves he suceeded, but the girls aren't as fun to watch until the big finale and it doesn't fly by like the first hour.  I suppose the two halves represent the male/female fantasy viewpoint, and maybe Kurt Russell is really just daydreaming until he runs into the girls in the second half.  Whatever the case the soulful Death Proof would probably bill better as the first half of the intended GRINDHOUSE drive-in  experience with Rodriguez's Planet Terror and Machete trailer as finale.

In fact, I have run across incredibly enlightened and spiritual for-profits, and astonishingly evil (yes that's right, and you know who you are) and destructive nonprofits, some even faith-based!

B000RZIGUY|5.0|Face/Off marks John Woo's first Hollywood movie where he was given complete creative control. While I am not familiar with John Woo's material except the new video game \\"Stranglehold\\" and his movie \\"Hard Boiled\\" (which I felt was mediocre, but suspenseful and interesting), I think \\"Face/Off\\" hit the spot for me and I will definitely check out the rest of his Hong Kong work (rumor has it \\"Face/Off\\" is his only true great American work due to lack of creative control of his other films).     \\"Face/Off\\" begins with terrorist for hire Castor Troy's failed attempt to kill FBI agent Sean Archer, and instead killing Archer's young son. 6 years later, Archer is extremely close to catching him, and he finally does. However, just as Sean Archer is about to retire, he learns that Castor Troy planted a bomb somewhere but Troy won't say where (since he is in a coma). Since only Sean Archer knows Castor so well, he must undergo a top secret undercover mission (that only 2 other people plus the doctors know about). He must have his own face surgically removed and he must acquire Castor Troy's face and voice. After the surgery, he infiltrates the prison where Castor Troy is to go as well as his gang. He acts like Castor Troy very well.    However, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma, and he and his gang force the doctors to give him Sean Archer's face. Unlike Sean Archer, however, he cannot imitate his mannerisms. A whole series of twists and turns occur as Castor Troy is now living in Archer's home, and taking over his job.    The fact that the character of Castor Troy in the film continues to be himself while Sean Archer must act like the bad guy gives both Nicholas Cage and John Travolta the opportunity to be the villain. They both come across as creepy and downright mean throughout the film, and this a true test of acting skills and both pass with an A. And the \\"gun-fu\\" is excellent, especially since both characters had to have been in their physical prime, but it will probablybe one of the best ever seen in a North American film.

Then, I accidentally opened it. So I gave it a try It's not as bad as I originally made it out to be. It has improved since [[ASIN:B00006JO4Q Justified]] and so have his lyrics. I feel that his first album, he complained about his relationship troubles with Britney Spears. I think if he just would stop using that high falsetto voice as much, I'd probably be able to give his music a 5 star rating. His high pitched voice annoys me at times. Who Knows, Maybe I'll enjoy his third album enough to give it a 5 star rating (And no, I am not referring to the re-release of this album as his third) Anyways, this as worth the $8.77 USD I Paid for it.

0375714669|5.0|Like the novel preceding it, Persepolis 2 combines stark, evocative art with powerful storytelling. Unlike its predecessor, however, the story is one of adolescence rather than childhood, and Marji grows from a spunky child into a searching, rebellious, and sharply intelligent teenager. Her parents, concerned about her welfare amid the turmoil plaguing Iran, send her away to school in Austria. There, she meets a group of punks and wins them over instantly with stories of the war. Free from the watchful eye of the Guardians of the Revolution, Iran's moral police, she experiments with sex, drugs, and \\"revolutionary anarchist parties,\\" an exploration that ultimately leaves her in a miserable state and yearning for home. Upon her return, she must cope with the changes that have deeply shaken both her country and herself during her absence.<br /><br />The cheeky humor that peppers Marji's childhood perceptions matures into a cutting wit of which she makes frequent use in pointing out the hypocrisies of both the fundamentalist regime and the radical posturing of her European friends. When members of the religious police chide her for running in public, saying that her movements are \\"obscene,\\" she loudly replies, \\"Well, then don't at my ass!\\" One has to admit that she has a point. Although the story of Marji's return unfolds against the backdrop of constant tragedy, the novel's humor does not seem out of place. In one of the book's most memorable scenes, Marji goes to visit a childhood friend who has been maimed in the war with Iraq. At first, the scene is uncomfortable, as she tries to hide her pity, but the wounded friend breaks the awkwardness with a darkly hilarious joke about the war. \\"That day,\\" says Marji, \\"I learned something essential: we can only feel sorry for ourselves when our misfortunes are supportable...once this limit is crossed, the only way to bear the unbearable is to laugh at it.\\"<br /><br />Persepolis 2 is as unforgettable as the original Persepolis, and stands as a coming of age memoir that is both uniquely Iranian and movingly universal.a coming of age memoir that is both uniquely Iranian and movingly universal.

0743486285|4.0|This book was a train wreck. You can't put it down and look away no matter how disgusted or offended or just pissed off you are.  I hate to admit that I truly enjoyed reading it and learning a certain insight into the mind of someone who can't say no to the drug.  I thought that the explainations/comments from modern day after the journal entries was superb all execpt for Vanity.  Totally don't care who she is now, but her blathering and addiction to God and herself in modern times as opposed to her stupidity and addiction to drugs back then are all about the same crap and waste of words.  This book without all of her gibberish (and I mean the current day crap) would have been a 5 star book.  Most of the BS that she scribbled did not even have a point, add to the explainations of why, who and how, and mostly it did not even really say anything.  She is one of those persons that likes to hear herself.    Nikki Sixx did an outstanding job on this book and I would recommend it to anyone that in recovering or is curious about why people are attracted to the drugs, as well as the emotional experience that drives it all.    My admiration for Nikki Sixx has grown tremedously because of this book.  He has allowed anyone who can read to see who he is, what he has done (good or bad), and in a lot of instances, why.

I really don't have any interest is who is 'right' with the aspect ratio argument, I compared both versions and found that you're missing some of the video image regardless of which version you buy. I took screenshots of both DVDs and overlayed them on top of each other. I found that with the 2001 release, you get the 1:33:1 aspect ratio where the far left and right of the screen image is clipped. With the 2007 release, you get the 1.78:1 aspect ratio where the top and bottom of the screen image is clipped off. You can see what I mean by viewing the 'customer image' I posted, above. The blue border is for the 2001 release and the red border is the 2007 release.    Both DVDs are 'digitally restored and remastered', however the 2007 release is noticeabley brighter and more vivid.

B000RJO578|2.0|I thought this was a pretty lousy comedy and that is coming from someone who did enjoy \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" - and if you're about to tell me that this movie isn't the same as that one, well you got that right buster.  \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is almost like attending a boring work seminar compared the party of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".     Maybe I'm not the target audience because I either didn't see many of the action/cop movies that \\"Hot Fuzz\\" references - and in most cases that I did see one, I don't remember it well enough.  Those movies are fun to watch because they are over the top and everything, but I don't see much point in making a movie that constantly references them.  I'd rather go back and re-watch movies like \\"Point Blank\\" or the Lethal Weapon series than watch another movie who's jokes depend on how well you have those earlier movies memorized.  I don't - and if the same goes for you, I say avoid this one.     And oh yeah, how could I almost forget to mention - there is no reason for this movie to be two hours long, it seems to go on and on forever.

0385333846|5.0|There are two words to describe this book:  weird and wonderful.  You could substitute \\"quirky\\" for weird if you want, because that's what \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is:  a very quirky, oddball adventure through time and space.  And it contains a valuable message if you decide to believe in the Tralfamadore view of things.  I rather like their perspective that because someone was alive at some point then they are ALWAYS living, at least somewhere.  (Though I suppose it's only comforting when you apply that to good people, because that definition also means that Hitler and other evildoers are always living somewhere too.)<br /><br />The novel begins with the author struggling to find a way to tell the story of his experience in World War II as a prisoner of war and witness to the firebombing of Dresden, which took more lives (at least immediately) than the atomic bomb.  He visits a friend and finally turns in a jumbled-up mess to the publisher.<br /><br />This jumbled-up mess is the story of Billy Pilgrim who is (or thinks he is) unstuck in time.  Because of this, his life is in shuffle mode, so to speak, where he randomly shifts from one point in time to another.  At one point he might be standing in a field in Germany during the war, at another he's talking to the Lions club in upstate New York, and at another he's a baby in his mother's arms.  Told chronologically, Billy enters the war near the end, gets captured, witnesses the bombing of Dresden, gets repatriated after the war, marries a large, rich woman named Valencia, has a couple kids, runs a successful optometry business, and gets taken to the Tralfamadore homeworld to be put in a zoo with a porn star.  Billy even sees how he is going to die.<br /><br />If the book were related chronologically and if Vonnegut didn't have such a way with language--his sentences lack poetic prose, but have the same quirky, seemingly random rhythm as the plot--then this book wouldn't have been nearly as interesting.  The way it's jumbled up forces the reader to keep putting the pieces together, although Vonnegut has a tendency to over-foreshadow some things like the teapot incident.  And the style makes reading a breeze because it's very relatable for the average vocabulary--no big words to confuse people.<br /><br />The only real flaw is the overuse of the expression \\"so it goes\\" to mark anytime a person, place, or thing dies.  Wikipedia's article on the book says there are 106 references.  It seemed like many more.  I understand what Vonnegut was going for, but it did get irritating before long.<br /><br />I should warn you, though, that even if the sentences are easy to read, you do need to be the type of reader who can put up with the quirky nature of the book to read it.  So it's not recommended to everyone.  If you're up to putting together a puzzle and like a little sci-fi with your literature, then you'll be fine.  Maybe you won't agree with Vonnegut and the Tralfamadore's view of the universe--maybe you like to believe in free will--but you should still be able to appreciate what a creative feat this book was and what a great author wrote it.<br /><br />That is all.mbled up forces the reader to keep putting the pieces together, although Vonnegut has a tendency to over-foreshadow some things like the teapot incident.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Pretty much all this collector's edition is a way to get Serenity another movie deal and that's it.

So even if you already own the movie, but would like to see a second installment, buy a copy, or get one as a gift for your friends, cause this is the last shot this show will get.

B000000W5N|5.0|The Rolling Stones turned out a mighty awesome album with their release of Sticky Fingers. The album boasts some great music that has stood the test of time; and just one listen proves it.<br /><br />The CD track set begins with their incredible hit, \\"Brown Sugar;\\" this song is about interracial romance during the age of slavery--but it can refer to interracial romance in our times, too. The electric guitar, drums and percussion bolster the number and Mick Jagger sings this perfectly! I know you'll like \\"Brown Sugar\\" very much if you haven't heard it before. \\"Sway\\" has some great electric guitar; and \\"Wild Horses\\" is one of the most beautiful and tender Rolling Stones ballads ever. \\"Wild Horses\\" features Mick Jagger singing of how much he loves his woman. Listen for Keith Richard to join Mick on the chorus of this ballad, too. \\"Wild Horses\\" stuns me with its beauty.<br /><br />\\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" rocks hard with great electric guitar; and \\"Bi***\\" rocks just as hard with great electric guitar and vocals by Mick Jagger. Keith Richard joins Mick again for the vocals on \\"Bi***.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sister Morphine\\" refers to the times people take drugs to forget their problems in life; Mick sings of how he needs morphine because \\"(he's) not that strong.\\" Mick also sings about rehab when he's trying to get clean, too. Listen for some flawless electric guitar and great special effects!<br /><br />The CD ends with \\"Moonlight Mile;\\" listen again for those great special effects and the electric guitar that bolsters the melody remarkably. Mick sings this to perfection and Paul Buckmaster is good on the strings.<br /><br />The liner notes include great artwork and the song credits.<br /><br />The Rolling Stones gave us many, many albums; but Sticky Fingers remains one of their best. I recommend this album for fans of 1970s rock; and people who want a complete Stones collection could never go without this album.<br /><br />Rock on, Rolling Stones!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I love the entire series of Gilmore Girls.  There are some shows better than others, but that is true of any TV series.    I like this show because you go into a fantasy world where a mother and daughter are best friends and if money is needed, there are the rich parents to help out.    TV is for escaping.  The Gilmore Girls help you to escape into a made up town of Stars Hollow, where there is almost always, a happy ending.
B000WSL5Y0|3.0|Short Take:  Eldest Affleck takes creative gamble with dicey directorial debut that does not pay off.    In 1997, at age 25, Ben Affleck shared Oscar-winning writing credit with fellow actor Matt Damon on their original screenplay Good Will Hunting. Ten years hence Affleck returns with Gone Baby Gone (adapted from the novel by Mystic River author Dennis Lehane), co-scripted with newcomer Aaron Stockard. This time Affleck ups the creative ante by using the film to showcase his directorial debut. It's a daring effort but the resulting offering is an only passable mystery crime drama--with a cock-and-bull conclusion--intent on ironhanded audience manipulation.     Romantically involved Boston, MA private detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck, Ocean's Thirteen) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan, The Heartbreak Kid) are asked by the aunt and uncle of four-year-old Amanda McCready to augment the police investigation into the kidnapping of their niece. They believe that Kenzie and Gennaro can finesse cagey neighbors who don't ordinarily cooperate with police.  A likable homegrown product with a baby face, Kenzie knows the downtrodden neighborhood well but neither he nor Gennaro has ever investigated a kidnapping case.  They have the added disadvantage of plunging into the case three days after the kidnapping.  With the clock ticking, the detectives must navigate Amanda's dingy, crime infested Boston neighborhood as Kenzie persists to keep his reluctant promise to Amanda's mother to find her missing daughter--everyone knows that as each minute passes the chances of finding Amanda alive diminish.    What's troublesome about Gone Baby Gone is its feigned use of the audience's natural sympathy for children to elicit emotions about child abduction and abuse.  The preposterous final act--which concedes the real motives for Amanda's kidnapping--offers up child abduction and abuse as red herrings that have no relevance to the storyline.        Surely one of the film's most disappointing aspects is director Affleck's inability to induce a star-making performance from his younger brother. The pubescent-looking Casey Affleck doesn't command the camera, in spite of being surrounded by veteran actors like Ed Harris (as Detective Remy Bressant) and Morgan Freeman (Police Captain Jack Doyle).     The singularly elevated acting performance is by Amy Ryan (TV's The Wire) as the missing Amanda's drugged out, criminally negligent, and profane mother Helene McCready. Ryan delivers an uncompromising performance of objectionable behavior, leaving you to marvel at the degree to which she dares you to maintain sorrow for Amanda's despairing mother.    Rated R for violence, drug content and pervasive language    El-Bo
0061547832|5.0|This is an extremely readable and entertaining book of this type.  I like also that Trump teamed up with Zanker to show that his business and life lessons have relevance to people other than billionaires.  Trump alway has a reliable pantry of illustrative stories, but Zanker's stories are surprisingly good, too.  I won't give it away, but Zanker's story about how he got the NY deli Zabar's owner Murray Klein to teach for The Learning Annex is one of the best in the book.  Kudos to Trump and Zanker on this one.
B00000K19E|4.0|It's true. The series steadily goes downhill with each additional release.<br /><br />When The Matrix made its debut, it was all the rage. And rightfully so!<br /><br />It was revolutionary, it was fresh and most importantly, it was cool!<br /><br />The special effects were usually top-notch and the characters were good, displaying decent acting. My favorite character was played by Laurence Fishburne, aka Morpheus (sp?). He was strong, and strongly desired by the opposing forces.<br /><br />The action was good, but the effects, especially the slow-motion, dodging ones, were off the hook.<br /><br />It was good, but the steam simmered as the series went on.<br /><br />4 stars.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|That isn't to say that there aren't other incredible television series out there which could rival Dexter. There are and they are all on cable, non-commercial television networks i.e. Showtime and HBO with at least one entry from AMC in the form of Madmen! Each of the television shows to which I refer are unique unto themselves and over the top in creativity. Dexter is right at the top of the list for great television. One of the key elements making Dexter so damned good is the characters. Casting really did their jobs when putting this one together. Lt. Maria LaGuerta played by Lauren Velez, is a character you love to hate! There is nothing beneath Ms. LaGuerta, nor is there anything she is not willing to be beneath in order to further her career. She is a political and otherwise whore whose sole motivation in life is to continue her climb up the career ladder. She has a chip on her shoulder and isn't afraid to show it either. It's fun to watch how the others interact with their superior as she manipulates every situation to her own benefit. She takes the idea of a self-serving \\"leader\\" to a whole other level. She is particularly hard on hard working cop Debra Morgan (Dexter's step sister played by Jennifer Carpenter). Morgan loves being a police. Her enthusiasm often shows itself in the form of wide-eyed, child-like excitement. She is good at being a cop and has no other apparent ambitions except to be a better cop and to find someone who will love her. Although she is still a shade of green around the edges, Morgan seems as if she was born to be police.  Everyone likes her as they do her step brother and main man of this series, Dexter. Dexter (Michael C. Hall) and Debra are very likeable people. However, where Sgt. Doakes is concerned (Erik King), suspicions abound about Dex. Something just doesn't sit right with Doakes and he is determined to figure it out. Dexter survives in part because he is alert. He is aware of the potential pratfalls of being a serial killer, and has been trained by his cop step-dad who loved Dexter unconditionally, to avoid them. Indeed, Dex runs his life according to a code and a strict set of guidlines which dictate his actions and which keep him on the straight and narrow. The majority of church going non-killers in our society would be hard pressed to show as strict an adherence to their alleged rule books. For Dexter it is life and death. There is an urgency to his submission. He believes in the code and is constantly checking his actions against it. He considers himself lucky to have a partner in his life. She (Rita Bennett played by Julie Benz) isn't aware of Dexter's hobby. It is downright entertaining watching Dexter maneuver their discussions of mundane things around the issue of his serial killing. Who'd a ever thunk that a series about a likeable blood spatter analyst who moonlights as a serial killer, could be so much fun!  The writing is excellent and the acting is award winning. The only so called weak point is the occasional corny pun that Dexter might think (voiced over by Michael C. Hall as the thoughts of Dexter) but for the most part, even those thinking to himself but loudly enough for the rest of us to hear moments, are poignant and interesting to note. This one has already proven itself addictive and I can see myself buying the DVD sets for each season. The show doesn't seem like it will lose its entertainment value with repeated watchings. And that can only be said about a handful of programs, all of which appear on one of those cable, non-commercial networks. If you like your comedy on the dark side as in black comedy, and your writing smart, you will love Dexter! Commercial television with its incessant product hawkers and stunted creativity will not be welcome in your house again! You will be spoiled!
B000MXPE7O|4.0|I have read that a good actor/actress can express sad, angry, or elated emotions but it takes a great one to express nothingness.  Damon plays his emotionless character to perfection.  Billy Bob Thornton is another that is phenomenal at this type characterization (see 'Levity' or 'The Man That Wasn't There').    I get that some people didn't have the patience for this movie, the first hour is slow and I myself wanted to fast forward through some scenes.  You really cannot for you'll miss several key effects that come up later.  I'm also not a big fan of movies that jump around in time, so be sure and pay attention to the date that pops up now and again.  For these few reasons I took away one star that would have otherwise made this a most favorite 5 star movie to recommend.

0780626966|5.0|I love this series. I waited far too long to pick this up. But, the price was right, so I bit the bullet. I was not disappointed. Well, I was but I wasn't. The movies were, of course, par excellence as expected (since I've seen them all before, some several times).<br /><br />My only gripe, I suppose, is that they saved most/all the \\"extra features\\" for the last disc, and had little by the way of features on each movie disc itself. The movie discs were pretty bare: basically, they only had the movie, a jump-to-a-nightmare \\"feature,\\" as well as actor filmographies for the actors in the specific movies (some of the information was repeated between discs), and maybe commentaries which I almost never listen to.<br /><br />I haven't looked at the final \\"Nightmare Encyclopedia\\" disc yet. Have been spending most of my time with the movies themselves. I assume, however, that it should be good. Perhaps it will make up for the lack of features on the relatively bare movie discs themselves...<br /><br />But, for the movie discs themselves, I love the movies. In this regard, it's a complete \\"canonical\\" series set. It doesn't include the Freddy vs. Jason cross-over. But since it's non-canonical and I already have the special edition version of that, I'm not upset that it wasn't included.<br /><br />Basically, if you love the series, I'm pretty sure you'll love this set (with the minor caveat(s) above).<br /><br />Addendum: Having now looked at the Nightmare Encyclopedia, I can say it's a pretty good disc. It has a number of short interviews (or perhaps it's the longer interview/documentary that's been broken up into short snippets). I had hoped for a lot more \\"behind the scenes\\" footage on various of the movies. Didn't get it. But what *was* there was pretty good/interesting. The \\"Labyrinth\\" is a mildly amusing Myst-esque DVD game feature for an alternate way to access some interviews, production stills, etc. There are also a couple alternate endings to be found.<br /><br />Overall, money WELL-spent!
0143038419|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend and it did take some dedication to move through it. Since I have been to Indonesia, and lived in an ashram for a month long yoga teachers training it was easier. Liz Gilvert's humor and intimate details kept me engaged and took me through to the end. I enjoyed the book overall and would recommend it to all women who have either made their spiritual journey or want to.

B00002MDFA|4.0|Joy Division's 'Substance' compilation is honestly no better for beginners than 'Unknown Pleasures' or 'Closer'. This cd is really more of a collection of non-album singles and b-sides all compiled onto one disc. None of these songs appear on the two studio albums, or the first LP of 'Still', with the exception of 'Dead Souls' ('She's Lost Control' is the 12\\" mix, not the album version). Many of the reviewers complain about the song selection, but there's nothing arbitrary about it at all; this compilation isn't meant to compile favorite album tracks or serve as a greatest hits package (though it does showcase the band often at its best). 'Disorder' or 'Twenty Four Hours' show off the band's prowess just as well as 'Transmission'; 'The Eternal' is just as funereal and icy as 'Atmosphere'. It is a testament to the greatness of this band that their singles, b-sides, and album songs were all of a high quality. A novice to the group should honestly start with the two albums, then move onto 'Substance' and 'Still' to fill in the holes. It's a shame that the 'Heart & Soul' box is discontinued.
0446614459|4.0|This was my first book by David Baldacci; I enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it, The main characters were interesting & well-developed. The focus on Secret Service agents on presidential candidate protection details is a nice touch. However, the plot was a little too complicated & implausible, and there are too many vaguely-defined peripheral characters to make this book a hands down winner. But still an excellent story.
0743496728|5.0|A friend recommended Jodi Picoult to me and after taking a look at some of her book reviews and synopsis's, I knew she'd be an author I might enjoy.  That assumption was happily confirmed after I read Nineteen Minutes.  I immediately went out and bought My Sisters Keeper and The Pact.<br /><br />This book was so gripping that I read it in a few days, which is no small feat when you have a one year old at home!  Amazingly, I found myself viewing this school shooting, and the characters involved, each seperately.  Picoult did a fabulous job at showing us their seperate views, reality, feelings etc.  She even made me sympathize with Peter, the shooter.  This book definitely opened my eyes a bit more about bullying and the roles the schools are playing in this and perhaps what might be able to be done on all ends to prevent these things from happening.<br /><br />Picoult surely has a knack for creating characters you can relate to, that you enjoy and invest in as you are reading.  She also does a great job at developing them.  The story itself flows very well and I think all the pieces of the puzzle fit together nicely.  I enjoyed every page, but couldn't wait to get to the end to see how it ended!<br /><br />I will certainly be recommending Picoult to my friends.  And I am excitedly waiting to read her other books!

B000F9RB8A|5.0|Hustle is a very entertaining and humorous take on the hero within genre.  It's very pretty visually as well, which is a pleasant surprise.  The transfer quality is good as mentioned, so much so that some of the effects don't hold up as well in Blu-ray definition.  This shouldn't deter you from owning this film though if you don't already.
B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell is the hardest artist I know to review.  I've been a fan since \\"Woodstock\\" and collected everything of hers I can get my hands on--including the good and bad tribute CDs.     With most artists, I can write a passing review after the first listen.  I know what I like and generally can support those feelings with some kind of narrative.  Joni's harder--because I have grown into and out of her music as the time goes on.      After a 9-year hiatus, I wasn't really sure I wanted to hear how Joni's voice had changed. My experience with Dionne Warwick's last CD was not positive at all.  I'm glad to say Joni sounds good--yes, her voice has deepened and roughened, but the sound is pleasant and in many ways reflective of her own 'saging'.     \\"Big Yellow Taxi 2007\\" is a spritely version of one of the original Mitchell songs that captured my attention back when we both were much younger.  I had to laugh at the change in one line:    They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum  And they charged the people an arm and a leg just to see them    OUCH!  I guess inflation really IS that bad.      I expected protest songs and Joni didn't let me down, either.  \\"Strong and Wrong\\" says what I've felt about war for many years:    Strong and wrong you win--  Only because  That's the way its always been.  Men love war!  That's what history' s for.  History...  A mass--murder mystery...  His story    \\"Hana\\" is the standout in this collection and the one song aside from \\"Big Yellow Taxi 07\\" that I think will earn a lot of play.  Despite her quiet anger at what's going on, Joni is telling us we can help ourselves if we believe--in ourselves:    Hana says, \\"Don't get me wrong  This is no simple Sunday song  Where God or Jesus comes along  And they save ya.\\"  You've got to be braver than that  You tackle the beast alone  With all its tenacious teeth!  Light the lamp    Probably my current favorite song of this collection is, \\"If.\\"  Joni leaves us with a quiet bulwark of words and song:    If you can bear to hear  The truth you've spoken  Twisted and misconstrued  By some smug fool  Or watch your life''s work  Torn apart and broken down  And still stoop to build again  With worn out tools.
B000URDEB0|5.0|\\"Once\\" set the tone for mastery in symphonic metal. An impossible task to topple. \\"Dark Passion Play\\" follows right on where the journey left off. Jam packed with great melodies and energy that warrants you to get a decent speaker system and turn the mutha up. The instrumentals are first class. I expected nothing less from Nightwish. There is no doubt that Tarja's singing was a major defining characteristic for the band, however, Annette does a great job and she will only improve with time. There is NO other band on earth that can blend symphony with metal like this band can. The special edition disk is great aswell as it has all their songs as instrumentals, which allows you to fully appreciate the classical and band instruments. Some of the songs, I thought, were even better without vocals e.g. Sahara and Cadence of her last breath. The orchestral version of meadows of heaven is outstanding - great piece of music.    Best songs:    The Poet And the Pendulum: A power house of a song. Great use of strings.    Bye Bye Beautiful: This reminds me of wish i had an angel. A top song. Great vocals.    Amaranth: Very catchy. Anette did great. One of the best on the album.    Cadence Of Her Last Breath: ....the sounds of harmonica bliss. Great chorus. (Great as an instrumental song.)    Master Passion Greed: A hard yet good song. The instrumental version rocks.    Sahara: Where did this song come from? Hell yeah! (Great as an instrumental song.)    Last Of the Wilds: Aother Nightwish killer.    7 Days To the Wolves: TOPS    Meadows of Heaven: I would have liked this song to be more melodic but it makes up with great celtic sounds and the instrumentals are again great. Annette goes all out, unleashing hell.    The islander: This song was awesome as an instrumental.
0596009208|5.0|I am teaching a Java Programming class and using this book as my text. The course assumes some prior programming experience, and I believe all of students have that. In fact, most of the students are doing great! I am truly amazed at how quickly they are learning and applying concepts that other Java texts don't even touch or get into.     Personally, I think the content and presentation can't be beat, but at least one of my students has a COBOL / mainframe background, and  he is not adapting to the text. In fact, he said he is used to reading big reference manuals, which this book clearly is not (a good thing). I only mention this becauase the use of graphics, younger people, and the wry, hip slang they use can be a turn-off to some people.    Bottom line: I think it's a great book. It is not for everybody, but then, no book can be. Buy the book, learn Java, and have fun!
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|What happens with two people who find each other as children and deeply fall in love with each other?  A girl from a prosperous family and a boy, a son of a modest carpenter.  When two are separated in order to protect girl's propriety and define clear line between their two social classes, they do not see each other for 15 years.  Eventually, boy finds himself back in Vienna, this time in a role of a train magician and entertainer, while girl is being groomed to marry a crown prince of the Habsburg empire. Chance meeting between the two during the magic show, ignites the flame of the innocent love they once had for each other as young children.  And this is where film looses its pace.  How likely it is  that girl of noble upbringing and upper class would leave it all for a travelling illusionist?  What future would these two have, other than love for each other and no other prospects.  Story of commoner illusionist outwitting a royal soon becomes more a of fable of misguided love and scam where two love birds create elaborate scheme that will allow them to be together forever without ever being found by the royal family, friends or their parents.  While I liked Norton's and Giamatti's acting and their tender German accent, Biel is nothing more but a beautiful ornament in this film.  She is very pretty to look at, but her acting is quite plain.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|Networks often cancel the best shows and leave the ones that truly almost no one cares about on tv for far too long (According to Jim, Two and a Half Men, Will and Grace [seriously, that show went on too long], etc). The good shows that have cult followings, which are the strongest type of following in my opinion, often get the axe, usually because the American public can't think while watching TV, hence America's Next Top Model, Laguna Beach, and every other terribly boring reality show. Veronica Mars is one of those shows that should have lasted.<br /><br />It was witty and smart and to figure out the season long mysteries was a hard task, but the show had amazing talent with show lead Kristen Bell as the snarky Veronica Mars. In season one she was a high school student working part-time as a receptionist at her father's (Enrico Colantoni) PI business. The use of flashbacks created an actual history that most shows never show the viewer. We got to see what happened before and it created a more fulfilling show. Not to mention the supporting cast of Percy Daggs III, Jason Dorhing, Teddy Dunn (absent from season 3), Amanda Seyfried, Michael Muhney and Francis Capra (and later to much suprise Ryan Hansen) created a perfect noir world filled with mystery, murder, and a perfect amount of wit and sarcasm.<br /><br />In season 3, Veronica began her freshman year at Heart College in Neptune, California, which only meant more murder and scandal for the young PI. With the additional cast members Chris Lowell as Piz, and Julie Gonzalo as Parker (and the final additions of Tina Majorino and Michael Munhey as series regulars), the show hoped to bring in more viewers. They also changed the format from season long mysteries to shorter arcs around 7-9 episodes a mystery, but still keeping with a Mystery of the Week theme. This was in hope to bring in more viewers because it was believed by tuning in during a season long mystery somewhere in the middle woudl deter viewers from watching. The episode count was cut from 22 to 20 which threw off series creator Rob Thomas' original vision for season three, but the show still managed to keep it's wit and spark up until the end.<br /><br />Most viewers saw the end coming before the season (and thus series) finale ended, but the devout cult followers held their breath hoping and holding on to their beloved show. The writers and creator did too. The storylines were left open, with Veronica dating Piz instead of fan-favorite Logan (Jason Dohring) after a tumultuos season although it was always assumed the star crossed lovers would end up together after it all, and Veronica's father Keith Mars (Colantoni) was in a heated sheriff race which viewers will now never know the end to. The story line was left open but Thomas had been working on a new direction for the show which would have taken Veronica into the FBI and would have been set a few years in the future from season 3. She was accepted into an internship at the end of the season so the idea was not too far-fetched. However, the network did not go for it and decided not to renew our beloved neo-noir show.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend Veronica Mars, especially to anyone who enjoyed the cult TV phenomenon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, only this time Veronica isn't slaying the undead, she is slaying the criminals that inhabit her wealthy, pristine, and perfect (on the surface) community. The snark and wit and wonderful acting by the cast created an environment that invited viewers in every week. I've converted many people into die hard fans, but I can't take credit for that, it was all the writers and actors on the show. Obviously it would make more sense to watch the seasons in order as to fully grasp the backstory which is woven in throughout the three seasons.<br /><br />Overall, five stars, all the way.de count was cut from 22 to 20 which threw off series creator Rob Thomas' original vision for season three, but the show still managed to keep it's wit and spark up until the end.

B00005JPD0|2.0|Well, I guess it's probably because I have.  Yes, sadly, `D&eacute;j&agrave; vu' brings absolutely nothing new to the table.  I was very intrigued by the trailer and all that I had read about the film.  I imagined I would be seeing something much different than what was presented before me, that's for certain.  About halfway through the film though I began to realize that this was not going to be as deep as I originally thought, and when Adam Goldberg's character Dr. Alexander Denny starts to explain what's really going on I felt my mind go numb and my blood start to boil for it was within those few stuttered sentences that I realized this movie was, point blank, stupid.<br /><br />The film starts with a terrorist attack on a ferry boat killing hundreds of people.  ATF Agent Doug Carlin comes to the crime scene to uncover evidence when he bumps into FBI Agent Paul Pryzwarra who is heading a new branch of the FMI investigations team and wants Carlin's help.  With this new technology the FBI has attained they can watch what happened four days and six hours in the past in order to solve crimes.  They intend to use this technology to uncover what happened with the ferry.  In related news, a young woman named Claire Kuchever was washed ashore moments before the ferry exploded with wounds similar to those of someone burnt to death in an explosion so Carlin begins to speculate that whoever planted the bomb on the boat must have first murdered this woman and left her to look like yet another casualty of the blast.  He insists that this investigations team make Claire their main focus of attention the days prior to the attack.<br /><br />Up until this point I was at least interested.  And then Doug makes an observation about the technology.  He realizes that this must be more than just surveillance video.  Claire can hear them, she can sense them watching her and she can respond to them.  It was at this moment that the film lost me, well, not lost me but lost my interest.  I just really expected them to go somewhere other than the time travel thing.  I really wanted this to be smarter, more original than that.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, it's decent at best.  An actor of Denzel Washington's caliber should know to pick better material than this.  I mean, when you're considered one of our finest working actors you just don't do films like this.  Maybe one or two is acceptable but for every `Malcolm X' Denzel gives us three or four `D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu' type films.  It's sad because when he sticks to his strengths he excels but when he pulls out movies like this it further proves my belief that Denzel is not as strong an actor as so many believe for he needs strong material to elevate his performance.  `D&eacute;j&agrave; vu' is not strong material, thus he falters, as does the rest of cast really.  Jim Caviezel is really the only one in the cast who makes a real impact and that's mostly because he's playing a vicious sociopath who hardly speaks and when he does he's given some creepy fear inducing dialog to joggle.  Val Kilmer is quite chunky here but his character makes far less an impression, and is it just me or does Adam Goldberg always act like he's strung out on coke.  Paula Patton is genuinely gorgeous but aside from that she's not very effective.  Her character isn't really fleshed out much so I blame that on the script.<br /><br />Yes, the script, that stack of paper that is supposed to make a film work.  This script was a stack of paper that ultimately squeezed Denzel Washington into a cubicle called a time machine.  I guess the biggest feeling that I felt when watching this movie was that of disappointment, major disappointment.  I had more faith in Tony Scott.  I absolutely loved his last two films `Domino' and `Man on Fire' and just felt that he would recapture that magic between him and Denzel this go around as well.  Sadly that couldn't have been further from the truth.<br /><br />*I want to make an edit to my review.  I feel that I made an unfair assessment of Denzel Washington's career when I made the comment that I didn't feel he was a strong actor.  After careful consideration this past weekend I realized that my statement is an unfair and ultimately false one.  Denzel Washington is truly one of our more talented actors.  I do feel that he has his niche and when he sticks to his strengths he soars.  When he chooses weak material he seems to get stuck and can't quite rise above it all.  I just wanted to clear that up because after thinking back this weekend I realized that I actually really like Denzel.*n's career when I made the comment that I didn't feel he was a strong actor.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|Clearly If you listen to the CD, and you can find the words to say that it was just okay. Perhaps you are a tad bit tone def, or simply don't know talent when you hear it :) I love this CD from the beginning to the end. I love her accent and soulful melodies. It's different for me in so many ways. She is like a summer rain, and she warms me thru and thru. I hope to hear more from this artist after this album. Please don't fall off in to One Hit Wonder Land Please.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|I dunno.  I was disappointed with *Royale Casino*.  I just felt that there wasn't much action in this Bond movie as compared to others.  It was...well...tame.<br /><br />From what I can understand about this whole Bond series and re-makes, *Royale Casino* is supposed to be the first of the series.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)  So, that pretty much explained why he wasn't a 007 in the beginning and why we didn't see Q.  (How can you have a Bond movie without Q?  At least, they had M but still, where was Q?)<br /><br />Now, I could tell you about the plot but I'm gonna let other reviewers tell you instead.  While I was watching, I couldn't get over that Daniel Craig is James Bond.  That's gonna take a little getting used to.<br /><br />All I can say was that I was disappointed in this particular Bond movie.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it was good but I've seen better Bonds.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age is a band I was introduced to back in college. It was actually this album, Songs For the Deaf, that was released during that time and a few of my friends were buzzing about it. I didn't give the band much of a change back then though. I liked their singles, but something was keeping me from sitting down and listening to the album from beginning to end. Recently, due to the last three QOTSA albums, I've become a pretty big fan of the band and I'm kicking myself for not giving them more of a chance back then. As of this review, Songs For the Deaf is my favorite release from the band. I guess the main thing that kept me from getting into them sooner is Josh Homme's voice. He sings in several different styles and tones and I like it when a vocalist is capable of doing that. It's just at times it sounds like he's not putting much effort into singing. He sounds kind of monotone and his vocals crawl along in certain songs. Sometimes, like with the song, \\"Hangin' Tree,\\" it works extremely well. In my opinion, it sounds like he tries to match his tone of voice to the beat and rhythm to the song. Sometimes it works and sometimes it makes you look forward to the end of a song. That really seems to be my only complaint as I love everything else about this band. The lineup to the band is constantly changing and while that's kind of disappointing on one hand, it's pretty impressive on the other. With new band members, new ideas could be brought to the table. Their sound won't ever go stale. This also leaves multiple opportunities for Homme to work with a lot of musicians and the creative outcome isn't always the same. I think Josh Homme described it best in a quote from him in 2000, \\"It really is more of a musical experiment...It keeps moving and reinventing itself. That way we never get painted into a corner.\\" If you're wondering why this band is getting the buzz that they do or if you've been putting off trying to be a full fledged fan of this band, then this is the album to start with.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I feel Like A Millionaire.\\" There's a certain theme throughout the record. It's like someone is flipping through radio stations and you're just along for the ride. That theme starts here with a thirty second intro. We hear a DJ say, \\"I need a saga. What's the saga? It's Songs For the Deaf. You can't even hear it!\\" That statement alone is so ridiculous, I have to love it. Josh Homme immediately introduces us to how well he can scream. The song is filled with crunching guitars and clapping...of all things. It's actually an incredible combination. The drums almost seem to take a backseat on this song, but don't worry. There's plenty of time for Dave Grohl to strut his stuff later. All in all, a great way to start off the record.<br /><br />The first single, \\"No One Knows\\" is next. There's a pretty solid drum beat that leads those same riffing guitars. Dave Grohl lets loose on the drums during the chorus. The vocals are a good example of Homme's unique singing voice. It's a decent song and a great choice for a single. I just feel it drags in certain parts. The radio station tuning returns in Spanish to close the track.<br /><br />\\"First It Giveth\\" begins with a spastic guitar rhythm. The switch to acoustic guitar during the end of the chorus is a nice touch. The drums are brought to the foreground as you can hear every stomp and crash Grohl pounds into his drum set. Great song. One of my favorites on the record.<br /><br />\\"A Song For the Dead\\" has my favorite intro on the record since it starts with the guitars in the background and some amazing drum work in the foreground. Then the whole band chimes in. Homme introduces us to yet another singing style. It's very raspy. This song is a good example of his tone matching the beat and rhythm of the song. Some pretty incredible guitar riffs occupy the middle, while the drums go off on an incredible tangent on their own. The track ends with those same pounding drums and noisy riffs from the beginning except it's much faster. It's almost as if they're showing off and I mean that in the best way. Another favorite track of mine.<br /><br />\\"The Sky Is Fallin'\\" starts off with some background vocals that remind me of Radiohead for some reason. The song revolves around distorted guitars and what sounds like a lot of cymbals. The vocals go into some new territory as Homme sings in a higher tone than he normally does at times. This song seems a little too long to me. It clocks in at a little over six minutes and just doesn't hook me like other QOTSA songs have done in the past. Radio theme returns with some pretty humorous stuff to close the track.<br /><br />\\"Six Shooter\\" can best be described as a very loud hard hitting song. There's a lot of yelling and it's only a little over a minute in length. It's actually a great song considering its length.<br /><br />\\"Hangin' Tree.\\" Another awesome song filled with raspy vocals. I love the rhythm this song has. The guitar riffs and pounding drums make this song...and record for that matter. It has a good pace. The music is a little fast while the vocals are kinda slow. The track ends with us turning the station to...<br /><br />\\"Go With the Flow.\\" The other single from this record. I usually dislike singles as they're usually overplayed, but I think I could hear this song over and over again and not get tired of it. The piano in this song is an extremely awesome addition that makes me love the song even more. Homme's vocals and Grohl's drumming help wrap this song up into an incredibly good single. The sound of the radio changing stations can be heard again at the end of the track.<br /><br />\\"Gonna Leave You\\" buzzes its way into the speakers. Those same distorted guitar riffs we know so well kick in. Homme sings at that slightly higher tone again and it fits the song well. The song itself just doesn't do a whole lot for me. It just feels like filler. It has a decent beat, but the vocals seem to be lacking.<br /><br />\\"Do It Again\\" begins with chants of, \\"HEY!\\" and noisy guitar riffs. The song is a step above the last one, but still seems to fall short overall. The chorus is a little too repetitive for my taste. It's another decent song that just isn't up to par with other songs on the record. More radio station surfing. Lots of religious stations and songs get skimmed through, which means...<br /><br />\\"God Is In the Radio\\" is next. The drum beat and bass line pave the way for the guitars to chime in. The piano/keyboard parts are very brief. I mean, it sounds like one note being played in the background, but it's a welcome addition to the already fantastic beat to the song. The vocals are sung in a way that fit the song very well. It's like Homme isn't putting much effort into singing. The lyrics are almost just spoken. It's a bit slow, but is bound to get stuck in your head.<br /><br />\\"Another Love Song\\". Homme has such a unique voice and he showcases it here. The drums have a beat that make you want to stomp your feet as what sounds like an organ occupies the background. The guitars sound like they're straight out of Pulp Fiction. Another decent song, but I usually skip it for...<br /><br />\\"A Song For the Deaf.\\" Another track that clocks in at over six minutes, but this time it doesn't waste a note. The bass line during the beginning reminds me of Tool. The QOTSA sound isn't really distinguished until the whole band chimes in. Homme's voice shines yet again. There's weird screaming that can be heard in the background as it jumps from speaker to speaker. It's like the vocals are sung while the background vocals are sung in that raspy style I mentioned earlier. The guitar riffs jump back and forth from sounding distorted to sounding fuzzy. A great way to end the album.<br /><br />The secret song, referred to as \\"The Mosquito Song,\\" is quite possibly the best secret song I've ever stumbled across. They also named their next album, Lullabies To Paralyze, after a lyric in this song. The song is mostly done with an acoustic guitar while Homme sings. I actually really like the lyrics in this song. What sounds like an accordian or maybe an organ chimes in a little later on while a great piano piece occupies the middle of the song. Some horns also make an appearance and some amazing viola work that actually sounds like mosquitos at times. Amazing song overall.<br /><br />While the way Homme sings at times certainly takes away from certain songs, it's also one of the things that makes this album great. That combined with Dave Grohl's amazing skills on the drums really make the third effort from this band straight out of Palm Desert, California my favorite release from them overall. I'd probably rate this album a solid 8/10.be lacking.      \\"Do It Again\\" begins with chants of, \\"HEY!\\" and noisy guitar riffs.

B000OYC7A8|4.0|In late May, 2006 David Gilmour performed at London's Royal Albert Hall in support of his On An Island CD. With him in the band were Pink Floyd's keyboardist Richard Wright, ex-Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera, Guy Pratt on bass, Jon Carin on keyboards, Steve DiStanislao on drums and Dick Parry on saxophone.<br /><br />The show was divided into two distinct parts. The first half featured the complete On An Island album with three songs from Dark Side of the Moon. The On An Island material is perhaps Gilmour's best work in years and highlights include the title song, This Heaven, The Blue, Smile and Take a Breath. The band is joined by David Crosby and Graham Nash for On An Island and the Blue.<br /><br />The second set features much of the standard Pink Floyd catalogue. Beginning with Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Gilmour and the band work through Fat Old Sun, Coming Back to Life, High Hopes and Wish You Were Here. The highlight of the evening is a performance of the classic Echoes with full light show in effect. David Bowie joins in for Arnold Layne and Comfortably Numb.<br /><br />As mentioned before this is Gilmour's best material in ages. Gilmour is having fun on this tour and it shows. All in all this is one of the best concert DVD's of the year. A second disc of extras includes the not to be missed tour documentary Breaking Bread,Drinking Wine, extra footage from the Royal Albert Hall, two making of documentaries, some first performance footage of On An Island and more.  In total you get over five hours of material on these discs.<br /><br />This is a set not to be missed by the Gilmour or Pink Floyd fan and it is a good introduction to the catalogue for the curious.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get it.<br /><br />As a side note I experienced none of the skipping problems that have plagued earlier releases of this disc. Let's hope that that problem is finally solved so that the disc may be enjoyed to its fullest extent.
1401300529|4.0|In addition to tracking the complex military issues of the Korean \\"Police Action\\", this book provides a comprehensive view of the politics and politicians of the time...along with the high level of political  activities within the military services. The only negative is the failure of the author to adequately credit  the achievements of the First Marine Division as a part of the X Army Corps. Also, some of the terminology  describing various military units is faulty. Overall a very worthwhile read.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|The first seven songs are overproduced with the E-Street Band sounding manic. These songs lack decent melodies and contain tepid and poorly rhyming lyrics (Springsteen is no poet). The eighth song \\"Magic\\" is a great song in every respect, one worthy of the Springsteen legend. The one that follows, \\"Last to Die\\" is a powerful anti war statment on Iraq. \\"Long Walk Home\\" which follows is flawed with awkward lines and comes nowhere close to \\"My Home Town\\" on his greatest album, \\"Born in the USA\\". \\"Devil's Arcade\\" has a slightly off putting melody and vocal but is lyrically interesting. My CD has a bonus track \\"When They Broke the Mold\\" and nice folk sounding song about the death of a friend. I would put five other Springsteen albums above this one.

My beloved and I have enjoyed reading it aloud to each other and we even downloaded the book so we can listen to it on our Ipods.  The author's way of describing the different characters that came in to her life at critical times makes me realize that I have had similar experiences and that nothing is accidental.  Beautifully written!

The DVD is in DD and sounds great granted it was recorded in 1988 on the visual side its good a little grainy and i could spot a few lines but it is an old recording and i expected worse it also has two music vids and a short interview with nigel tufnel its only about 5-7 min long but its funny.
B000V801PK|5.0|I have been an Annie Lennox fan since the days of The Eurythmics and \\"Sweet Dreams.\\"  I think her voice is solidly recognizable and her lyrics are strong, thoughtful and complete.  I am particularly a fan of Diva, and a few covers of Medusa (\\"Thin Line...\\" \\"Wait in Vain,\\" especially).

It has elements of the Eurythmics and the best of Diva combined into perhaps the most deliberately crafted and well executed cd this year.

Masterfully produced!<br /><br />None of the tracks get old, many are ready to be remixed and reworked for the dancefloor, but none are filler merely designed to complete a cd. It is as if EACH track is an instant Greatest Hit!  I am not a big fan of the Public Service announcement on one track or the African chants at the end of it, but outside of that, I find myself listening to each detail of every song wanting (and finding) a new element to savor each time.<br /><br />She has done a remarkable job bringing sophistication and intricacy back to \\"pop\\" music, after WAY too many years hearing the novices like Beyonce's overcooked vocals, Janet Jackson suffering through more albums with weak producers, or greats like Anita Baker devolving into essentially piano lounge music (on her last cd) and Chaka Khan breaking no new ground after years out of the studio for \\"Funk This.\\"  Annie's voice is immediately distinguishable, and somewhat unique.<br /><br />I am amazed and delighted the \\"old\\" Annie has returned with such strength and quality.

B000WC39ZY|4.0|I'll start by rephrasing what I said about the last DVD edition    Even the non Special Edition of Boxcar Bertha from the Martin Scorsese Collection was presented in Widescreen , but alas New York, New York was only Letterboxed.    It only included the so called restored version of the film which is in reality only one of three versions released.    If any film is more deserving than The Abyss for a \\"watch it the way you want to\\" DVD release it's New York, New York.    The deleated / alternate scenes included did not represent the differences between the first and third versions of the film, nor do they include the scenes deleted from the first release to shorten the running time for the second run release.    The Laserdisc Special Edition release had more bonus material than was included on that DVD.      Guess we'll have to wait for the Ultimate Edition Boxed set for a truely special edition .

Only 5:35 minutes from a 30 minute segment done for an overseas  release taped November 10th, 2003.    Shame on them.
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|Good Girl gone bad is a good cd with some bad elements.  The strength \\"Please Don't Stop the Music\\" is hard to match!  Great Song, great lyrics, fun, memorable and relevant to most who would seek this artist out.<br /><br />Although some elements of the big hit \\"Umbrella\\" can be annoying, it is undoubtedly a summer song she will be well remembered for, and the video is close to outstanding.  \\"Breaking Dishes\\" is delightful (apart from the somewhat juvenile intro with what sounds like a girls cheerleading squad, which frankly limits the appeal of the rest of the song).  The lyrics are smart, witty and fun.  \\"Rehab\\" is a good effort and \\"Questions Existing\\" is well done if a bit hard to pin down, but I hope she focuses more on the danceable, mixable, memorable, and catchy songs that undoubtedly be her mark on music.<br /><br />However, Rihanna has the potential to break away from the girl pop music that includes the likes of Ciara, Kelly Clarkson and Fergie, and join the ranks of Christina Aguilera, Beyonce, Shakira, and before her unfortunate implosion, Britney Spears, and so many others.  Not that these ladies are the best vocals (Christina being by far the strongest voice), but are really good entertainers where you get your monies worth. [Madonna and Janet Jackson are incredible entertainers, by the way.]<br /><br />In other words, she has the potential to be amazing.  And, although she has had other cds before \\"Good Girl,\\" this one is a good step in that direction, partly because she is expanding her range.  There are a few tracks [\\"Shut Up and Drive\\"] that call into question whether she wants to be a \\"rock girl\\" or a \\"soul girl\\" unless she is managed in such a way that she can do both.  That is a feat VERY few can master (though I am huge fan of New Order).  Pink tried it and had to choose (and still walks the line a bit from time to time).  Gwen Stephani does as well (noting collaborations with Eve).  It, unfortunately may limit her overall audience unless she pics her next writers, arrangers, producers very well.  The team up with Jay-Z is having good results.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A very good cd with some fun and memorable tracks, surpasses many competitors, but needs a bit of direction, focus, and polish.  She is indeed getting better and those other girls are \\"goin' git it!\\"rs, arrangers, producers very well.  The team up with Jay-Z is having good results.    Bottom Line: A very good cd with some fun and memorable tracks, surpasses many competitors, but needs a bit of direction, focus, and polish.  She is indeed getting better and those other girls are \\"goin' git it!\\"
B00005JPWH|5.0|I live in remote Alaska and thought that I wouldn't like this movie because it seems ridiculous to me that someone would live in the wilderness without help, skills, or support from other people who know that place and how to survive in the uniqueness of a place.  That said, I was very impressed with the angle on this story and the respect given to Chris and his choices, the people he encounter along the way, and his ending.  It was nice to see the time evolve by moving back and forth within the course of his life and it was interesting to have narration from the sister.  The pace was great and kept interest throughout, beautiful filming, and strong characterization.  I just hope this movie doesn't cause others to attempt such dangerous adventures without more preparation and learning.  Good job and Thanks for a great show.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Truly one of the best concerts you will see, full of artistic expression, precision and energy.  I could go on but so many others have said it better, this is an incredible DVD/cd of an incredible concert that only proves why after 20+ years at it, Madonna is still on top!<br /><br />The opening combination of \\"Future Lovers\\" and Donna Summers' \\"I Feel Love\\" is flawless, exciting and visually rich.  The remake of \\"Erotica\\" is pure art [the new lyrics, tone and tempo is sublime] and even the erstwhile tiresome \\"Like a Virgin\\" was updated with a fresh new sound.<br /><br />The DVD captures the electricity of the actual concert and is best played loud!<br /><br />Let all of the immitators (many less than half her age) beware, THIS is what you need to aspire to, THIS is what a real pro looks like!  Learn it.
B0006A9FMI|2.0|Ghost in the Shell suffers even more from the same problem I had in the first movie. While the movie is beautifully animated, what has always bothered me about GITS is that the directors are more interested in their technical accomplishments in the animation, than realizing the story needs to be well paced.<br /><br />We are given more Basset Hounds, and long shots of \\"look how much detail went into the backgrounds\\" when the story just lags behind.<br /><br />The plot for the second one is really not as intense as the first movie, so it only magnifies the fact that this movie is very slow. While I don't mind the moments of Batou with his dog I found them endaring, the constant Basset Hound placement can get on your nerves.<br /><br />Sure, they really did do a good job on mixing 3d with 2d animation, though the animation sequence in tribute to the first one lacked some of the life the first one did. It seemed more focused on creating a detailed model, instead of making the model carry some connection to the audience.<br /><br />I found myself falling asleep more often in this movie than the first one. I find that the old Playstation game had the spirit of Shirow's work captured and I hear that Stand Alone Complex also shares the sentiment of Shirow's work.<br /><br />I think the only Shirow movie that has paid attention to being well paced and engaging was the 3d Appleseed movie.<br /><br />Animation is about storytelling with moving pictures. Story pacing and timing is very important. While I don't mind movies that run at a slower pace, it also shouldn't lag. Cut out the technical parts of pan shots of showing the scenery you would cut out a lot of the movie and get a real look at how weak the story is.<br /><br />Also, it's kind of silly to note but people should be rating reviews on their helpfulness on whether or not to buy the DVD, not if they agree with the review. It seems lately people just vote negative to disagree. Even if you disagree does the review help a customer with a buying decision?
0765348276|5.0|In short this is the kind of book I've personally waited for since the \\"Rama\\" series.  Great characters, great story, plausible science, and a very imaginative and well written description of events and places.  Never too wordy, though perhaps just a teeny bit corny in some of the character dialoge, though I have close friends who are much more so, so it detracts from the story not at all.  I am looking forward to \\"The Ghost Brigades\\".  I have also never read Heinlein, but if he influenced Scalzi, then I guess I am going to have to try some of his titles as well.
B00005JMXX|2.0|I watched this with my wife and parents. By the way, I grew up in Alaska so I know COLD. My Dad and I just started laughing at the helicopter freezing up in mid-flight because the fuel started to solidify. My Dad was also an aircraft mechanic and although oil can get sludgy at low temps freezing aviation fuel is almost impossible outside a laboratory. But of course this is explained by some weird new weather phenomena that comes about in a matter of days, apparently.<br /><br />The best part was the United States having to ask permission of Mexico to cross their border. I could almost hear Rik from the Young Ones saying \\"take that, fascist bully-boy!\\" Please. This thing is a politically correct fable from beginning to end. How else could you explain freezing hurricanes being the result of... global warming?
B000B0WO0I|5.0|It's not easy to strip a song down, leaving only what's needed to make a great tune sound even better.  Great guitar, sax, and a little background female vocals sets up a wonderful and magical musical moment with Mick Hucknall.  What a voice!  Nothing simple about it.  The arrangements are so good on every song.  I love the latin flavor brought to some of the songs.  Holding Back the Years is stripped to the basics, and that VOICE!  I was in London in May of '86, on Holiday/Vacation, traveling on my own.  These were pre-internet days, unless you were in the armed services, or Al Gore (had to throw that in), so I didn't know what was up with some of the music that was local, and had not hit the states, or if it had, I was oblivious.  I remember distinctly hearing that voice when I got home, finding out who THAT was and just being  besides myself that I did not go see the band that had a small flyer posted for a concert.  I remeber thinking when I saw the poster, what's a Simply Red?  I found out!    Adair
B00003W8NM|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time back in 2000 after hearing great reviews from my friends and a warning that it was both funny and enlightening. I was blown away by the amount of action and humor contained in this single film. I thought the screenplay was genius about a office worker whose alter ego creates a stress reduction fight club in order to then create an army of followers that threatens the very fabric of society on a worldwide scale. The humor is intermittent with the narrators ramblings one moment then fight club induced crimes the next that left me on the floor laughing uncontrollably. The cast is fantastic especially Edward Norton as he falls continuously into the confusion and deceit of daily life.    I bought this DVD a few months back in order to relive the moments that I enjoyed when first watching it all those years ago. With a crisp picture and great special features this DVD adds to the value that a movie like this entails with its production and directing.
B00006830P|5.0|If you are a collector of music, young, and always wanted to hear more of Bob Dylan than what really bad radio plays, this is THE Essential Bob Dylan CD to add to you're current collection, and begin a new one with Bobby. So much of the great music by great artists is not played on radio.  One has to dig a little.  As one of my favorite Irish singers, Brian Kennedy has said:  Sometimes you have to go back (referrering to traditional irish music) to go forward.  The young, serious musicians out there have probably checked Dylan out.  They know. He can't be ignored.      Adair
B000SM7QUC|5.0|FIRST OF ALL DON'T EXPECT A CRUE ALBUM. IF YOU SAW ALL THE SIDE PROJECTS OF MR. SIXX, YOU CAN SEE THAT 58 IT'S DIFFERENT THAT THE CRUE, THAT BRIDES OF DESTRUCTION AND OF COUSE THAT SIXX.A.M.  IT'S AN ALBUM THAT YOU NEED TIME TO LISTEN, TO UNDERSTAND IT AND AFTER 3 OR 4 TIMES YOU LOVE IT. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, GO DIRECTLY TO TRACK 10 (GIRL WITH GOLDEN EYES), AN AMAZING MID TEMPO SONG, AN AMAZING VOICE, VERY CLIMATIC.  IT'S A GREAT GREAT ALBUM.  ENJOY
B000I2J6K0|5.0|After plenty of tries, this was the one pregnancy workout video I tried that actually got my heart rate up to a reasonable level (but still safe) and might, *just might* have let me break into a slight sweat.      Erin is positive but not perky or gushy about being pregnant.  She covers all the bases:  arms, back, legs, butt, thighs and abs.  None of the moves are complicated - some of them you'd recognize from buns of steel, some from pilates - and she switches them up during the workout so you don't get too bored doing one thing.  It's designed to be done in your home, so you do need a couch, a hard chair or coffee table, and a mat on hand (or carpet).  I really liked that she was no-nonsense and gives short breaks for water so you don't have to pause the DVD every time you need a drink.    I worked out about three times a week before getting pregnant, either running or doing cardio, so I was really looking for something that would make me feel like I was actually exercising.  This video is not difficult, keeps your heart rate below 140, but still makes you feel like you've done something productive.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|because this isn't system of a down its serj tankian.  I was actually very pleased with this disc, I was expecting it to completely different from soad when in reality it really isn't.  I usually don't like it when bands split and then the singer decides to go solo because normally half the time it doesn't work but in this case it does.  although I do wish system was back but I am completely fine with him going solo because I think he did a great job on this disc.  remember the break up is only temporary there doing the kiss thing.  if you want to know the truth behind 9/11 watch serj tankian empty walls video very unreal.  anyway if your expecting this to be soad you might be disappointed but if you come in with an open mind you might actually enjoy this album anyway that was my 2 cents decide for yourself.
B000UJ48U4|1.0|Kubrick's final film is a sad elegy to a gifted, eccentric filmmaker.  The finished film as finally released seems a compendium of too much tinkering and no clear vision.  Potent ideas, symbols, images and sequences never come tegether in a satisfying way.  Much more a vanity production and experimental film from a man who enjoyed the process more than the final product.  Maybe it was a way to hold on to his mortality?  Or maybe it's what the movie is really about.  The ultimate taboo is death itself.  And erotic conflict is the stuff of life.<br /><br />The movie is fragmented and sometimese even compelling. But the spell it promises is never realized.  It is mainly interesting as a biographical footnote to a great filmmaker's strange epitaph.  Cruise is intense but out of his element.  Kidman is incredibly present in all her scenes.  She's an amazing talent.<br /><br />But, for me, the real question is why did this story so interest Kubrick?  Perhaps nothing but the opportunity of making another film and the illusion that he would last as long as it's never finished -- even in the minds of an audience!  After all, for an artist, to be creative is to feel fully alive.  Now it's the audiences responsibility to finish the creative process and bring closure to Kubrick's art. But in the final cut,  that only makes for a bad movie.<br /><br />Note: Early WB publicity promised both the American and uncensored European versions of the film as well as commentaries (one by Sydney Pollack).  These promised elements are not on the 2 disc retail version now available.  What happened?
0307387178|1.0|What a disappointment. Self-indulgent loner commits suicide by burning his cash and wandering into the Alaskan wilderness so that he can punish his parents for something (I'm not sure what). The writing style is disjointed and uninspiring, full of meaningless details about landscapes (who cares) and pathetic characters. The only emotion this book elicits is sympathy for those people who were unfortunate enough to cross paths with \\"Alexander Supertramp.\\" What a waste.
0440238609|5.0|These are really great books, and you should ignore all the \\" not for kids \\" nonsense.  Will kids really understand the full meaning?  I really recommend these.  I wish Philip Pullman had added more to the series.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|My Aim is True was a promising debut, but This Year's Model, Elvis Costello's sophomore effort and first album with long-time backing band the Attractions, is an all-out stunner. Everything on this puppy, from the songs to the performances to the cover art (just look at that sneer!) drips with the aggression, menace, and black humor that have become EC trademarks.     For one thing, the Attractions rule. The band packs a sonic punch that Clover (the group that backed Elvis on My Aim Is True) simply couldn't muster. They've got a raucous, full-bodied sound that bridges the gaps between punk, new wave, rock `n' roll, and even 60s garage rock. Steve Nieve's freewheeling keyboard playing is the ideal partner for the compact snarl of Costello's guitar chords, while Bruce Thomas' nimble bass lines duck, weave, and squirm beneath them. Pete Thomas' drumming lends the appropriate sense of straight-ahead urgency to the whole thing, while giving the proceedings a sufficiently rockin' backbone. Thanks to the Attractions, these songs have a certain bite that was buried on My Aim Is True.    Of course, it doesn't hurt that Costello's songwriting is absolutely stellar, He may look like a harmless fellow on his album covers, but his lyrics are anything but: the guy writes with a poison pen, flinging venom-dipped darts in every possible direction without ever missing his mark. His unapologetic cynicism is matched by his dark sense of humor and deliciously twisted worldview.     All of it comes together on \\"No Action,\\" the album's breathless opener. At just over two minutes in length, it's a juggernaut of warped fifties melodies and pummeling guitars. Costello's vocal is both cheeky and bitter, as he spews forth a series of withering putdowns at some special someone who probably deserves every word of it. \\"Hand In Hand\\" and \\"Lip Service\\" are equally spiteful tales of derailed romance, and \\"Living In Paradise\\" ups the ante with its depictions of wanton betrayal and relentless paranoia- and it has a cheerful, bubbling melody! \\"This Year's Girl\\" matches a leering, halting musical assault with lyrics that take a sharp stab at celebrity culture, and \\"Lipstick Vogue\\" is pure amphetamine sleaze. \\"Little Triggers\\" is a broken doo-wop ballad essaying a crumbling relationship with enough bitter disillusionment to last a lifetime. \\"You Belong To Me\\" is a gleefully sardonic look at male aggression, and \\"Pump It Up\\" is a rollicking party song... with lyrics about the worthlessness of parties. \\"Night Rally\\" is a dark, atmospheric track that sees Costello flirting with images of fascism and revolution. \\"The Beat\\" (possibly my favorite track here) is tale of sexual frustration that brims with raw aggression and nervous energy. I'm also in love with the stunning \\"(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea,\\" which uses a taut, crawling, ska-influenced groove to slowly build tension, while Costello's lyrics are pure claustrophobic sexual paranoia.     So, a masterpiece then. Get it.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|What can be said? Another great show from the creator of Magnum P.I. I regret that I didn't start watching this show until midway through the third season.ell, I now own the first three seasons on DVD, and I'm chomping at the bit waiting for season 4 to come out. Great writing, wonderful characters, incredible directing. As a general rule, I despise most TV, but I cannot say enough good things about NCIS. It's a real standout.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Like the movie, this soundtrack was beautiful.  However, I was dissapointed when I realized that the soundtrack is missing some of the best songs like \\"I Want You(She's so Heavy)\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?.\\"  If you're a true Beatles fan you'll be happy with it anyways.
B0002XDODU|5.0|People who know me think I'm crazy for liking Rammstein.  It's really heavy, really agressive, angry, and in GERMAN! - which I don't understand at all.  So why do I like it?  Because like all good music, it helps me unwind and space out.  I can sleep better on a plane with Rammstein at full volume than I can with Vivaldi or Mozart at low volume.  You just have to get over the heavy sound.  In the end the instruments don't really matter.  It's all about composition and the music's ability to wisk you away to wonderland.  Highly recommended.
B000A5044C|5.0|if you are interested on japanese everyday life, this film is a must! And the cast is wonderfull!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best albums ever, from any band.  Unfortunately not everyone agrees, but that's why Radiohead is Radiohead.  They never wanted to be #1 on the pop charts.  Everything they do is experimental and ground-breaking and heart-wrenching.  Ok Computer, like most Radiohead albums is not a soundtrack for parties and fun times.  It's personal and you need to pipe it through good headphones and actually listen to it without distractions.  Radiohead's music is art in the form of sound, and just like a painting, statue, or movie, it requires undivided attention to appreciate.  Some people will never appreciate it, but I think most Radiohead-haters are just not really listening.
0765350386|5.0|Great book! I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It was a big improvement over Elantris, in my opinion. I'm looking forward to The Well of Ascension and other future novels by this excellent author. Bravo, Mr. Sanderson!
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|The USA stands alone in the Western world with the lack of a free public health system. \\"Sicko\\" - another film in the Michael Moore production line - explores this issue. The film is reasonably entertaining but for a non-American audience not particularly revelatory.<br /><br />Reform of the American health system is incredibly difficult because of the influence of health lobbyists on legislators - and like gun control there is a lot of hand-wringing but little change.<br /><br />Sadly Moore does not make any effort to hear the \\"other\\" side of the story, which could have made this documentary much more interesting.
0553382179|5.0|THIS BOOK IS FOR EVERYONE!  EVEN ORGANIZED PEOPLE NEED THIS BOOK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE UNORGANIZED PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE, AND WHY IT DOESN'T GET DONE.  THIS IS GIVING US ALL HOPE AND THE TOOLS TO DO IT.  AND BRINGING PEACE AND COMFORT INTO OUR HOMES.  WHAT MORE COULD AN UNORGANIZED PERSON ASK FOR?
B000003TA4|5.0|This album single handedly changed rock forever and wiped hair metal off the face of the earth. Every song is tuneful and catchy. Cobain had a simple songwriting philosophy of light verses and heavy chorus' that never ceased to dissapoint. Modern rock radio still plays this album consistantly and it's no mystery why. There are a few idiots out there that will tell you that Nirvana is over-rated, or Kurt Cobain can't sing or play guitar but those people are just jealous cause they could never make an album this good even if they sold their soul!!! This album is so good it should be illegal.
B0000CDJPQ|4.0|I have a useless (to me anyway) Firewire 800 port on my Powerbook.  This little baby lets me connect my Canon digital Firewire 400 camcorder to it through the adapter.  Works like a charm.  My Firewire 250 GB external HD doesn't like it for some odd reason, but I bought it for the camera and other standalone Firewire 400 devices, for which it works well.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it is a small, hard, single piece of plastic.  No wires or parts to get easily bent or something.  Sonnet makes good products.
0374105235|4.0|Emotionally harrowing, this tragic autobiography exposes the hell of war.  As the reader is engulfed in despair, hope hits the horizon. Prepare to be shocked by this unforgettable account of life as a child soldier.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW, i never buy DVD's, but for this series im ready to buy a 100 seasons at once
0670034711|5.0|I loved this book. I bought it after seeing the author on Oprah and loved her approach to life. I was inspired by her desire to search for peace through a spiritual path and her ability to look at herself honestly and with love. Because I share this desire, I felt a special kinship with her from the very beginning. I was sad to finish the book because it felt like I was losing touch with an old friend. I am anxious to read other books by Liz Gilbert.
0316067598|4.0|The 2nd half of this book is very gripping stuff, a real page-turner.    A more apt title for this book would have been \\"My time in Navy SEAL training, and then my time in Afghanistan\\". The entire first half of the book (which in my opinion, is too much) only really talks about Lattrell's Navy SEAL training. While some of it is very interesting, I would have preferred it to be cut down by at least half.    So my advice is... please don't get bored by this book by quitting before the real story begins. It is well worth the wait.
B000RG1FMO|1.0|i was really excited to get this album, but after first listen through, i'm really disappointed. the only decent song on there is \\"stronger\\".<br /><br />sure, there might be some decent lyrics/messages on other tracks, but they're not fun to listen to and they're certainly nothing to rock out to, like much of kanye's other two albums.<br /><br />i'm sorry i bought this album.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|I am a huge Floyd fan, but that covers mostly Gilmour era music with phenominal lyrics by Roger Waters.  So, i dont really classify this as the Floyd but it is a great Syd Barret album.  The childishness of some of the lyrics representing him at his most basic mixed with his freakouts like interstellar overdrive make this a must have.  Great packageing too.  Listen to the mono mix first, i feel that some of its sonic nuances were lost in the stereo mastering.
B000S9VRLO|5.0|Although this French one man band has been known for putting out somewhat melodic and shoegaze-influenced black metal (ala Xasthur, Leviathan, etc) in the past, on this record the metal is turned down to zero.     There are fastly-picked and melodic black metal guitars and even slight blast beats but it still sounds more like an indie rock record. There are NO growled or screamed vocals on this whole CD, thankfully!     So...for black metal fans who are yearning for something a little different...and shoegaze or indie fans who are looking to do likewise, BUY THIS CD!!! I found it to be very refreshing.
038572179X|4.0|I found the first seventy plus pages slow going and long-winded. I persevered (although I was beginning to doubt finishing it) and was glad I had, because it picked up during chapter eight. Actually I think I was shocked back to consciousness by the use of a word that appeared more prominent because of the blandness of the story until that point!<br /><br />Many of us will at some point have experienced the horror of realising that something we've written might fall into the wrong hands (usually a note in class!) and I felt exactly that for Robbie after he realised his mistake! That was the point that I began to actually care about some of the characters - namely Robbie and Cecelia.<br /><br />For me, parts 2 & 3 of the book made up for it's mundane beginning (and pushed it's rating up to 4 stars)<br /><br />The description of the journey through the countryside to Dunkirk, with all the discomfort and horrors along the way, were so realistic, the feelings so acute that I felt I was literally a fly on the wall.<br />Similarly the descriptions concerning the military regime of the London hospital, the horrific injuries of the servicemen and the tireless care of the nursing staff was both absorbing and moving. However, as much as I respected Briony for throwing herself into her nursing and trying to be a better person, I still found her an unlikable character.<br /><br />The final stage of the story, set in the present day, brought the story full circle and whilst the ending left me dispirited, I could appreciate the authors message and the power that an author has in manipulating an ending to any story if they so imagine it.
B000002IJO|3.0|Generally, in my opinion Ratt's albums follow a decline from the beginning of their career to the end (when Robbin died, that was \\"the end\\" of Ratt in my opinion). Now, that's not to say that the albums from the tail end of Ratt's catalog are bad, because they're not. If you like Ratt, all of their CDs are pretty good, but I'd say Dancing Undercover is about their 3rd or 4th best effort, behind the Ratt EP, Out of the Cellar, and Invasion of Your Privacy. Dancing Undercover and Reach For The Sky are both solid CDs, and Detonator is kind of a small step down from those. Crosby was still contributing to the material during this one, and Warren DeMartini's guitar solos are breathtaking as usual. Even Ratt's \\"4th best album\\" is better than most mainstream rock music and worthy of admiration from rockers of any age. If you like the music from the LA glam scene of the 1980s, or are into bands like Motley Crue, Skid Row, Kiss... Ratt's Dancing Undercover is a CD worth checking out. Standout tracks: Dance, Body Talk, Slip of the Lip.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I just purchased a XBOX 360 HD-DVD player along with 300 and they look great together. A must buy!
B000R7HY0K|2.0|***  SPOILERS WITHIN  ***<br /><br />In his previous outings, Quentin showed himself a master of interesting dialogue.  Indeed, I think the opening scene of [[ASIN:B000HC2LEY Reservoir Dogs (15th Anniversary)]] ranks as one of the best in recent film.<br /><br />But here, the dialogue just fell flat.  The subjects didn't interest me and the people talking about them didn't interest me.  All in all, it was 90 minutes of boring dialogue with a reasonably decent action sequence at the end.  If you do go ahead and buy this, save yourself some time and skip right to the action.  But if you watch it full through, don't say I didn't warn you.
B00000JG41|5.0|It just dawned on me that Mr. Bungle's three albums do not have a bad song on it.  That's great to know! While Mr. Bungle still dosen't have enough material to become the greatest band ever (and the genres they do will not make you forget about the actual genre itself)it's great to see a band that made sure that each song never has a dull moment on it.  Thanks Patton!<br /><br />The shade of black and white that engulfed Disco Volante is taken off, revealing a dizzying-yet-warped colorful tone of sun-blasted experimental music.  Yeah, it's definitly more accessible than Disco Volante or Mr. Bungle; It still is trademark Bungle. Great melding of genres and pure catchiness underneath the wacky exterior.<br /><br />In fact, this is their most melodic.  Patton screams less, the band harmonizes more, and stunning pop hooks abound. Retrovertigo and Vanity Fair have no tempo changes, odd mending of styles, or even insane lyrics.  But it's got a Bungle side to it, obviously, it just does, besides Patton himself.  Sweet Charity has the Hawaiin vibe that can't be beat.  Pink Cigarrete is a dark ballad; talks about suicide abound in this, giving it a Patton distinct.  Great parody there.  The Holy Filament isn't that strange, kind of hard to describe, and my least favorite song on here.  Those songs are as normal a Mr. Bungle song can get.<br /><br />Bungle fans won't be dissapointed with the wild @$$ blender of songs.  None of Them Knew They Were Robots and The Air Conditioned Nightmare both lean on older California vibe music and warp it up into something memorable.  Ars Moriendi is one of my favorites, a crazy song with killer hooks (that jazzy part is arguably the greatest moment on the disc).

B000N6TX1S|1.0|As someone who enjoyed reading the book, I found the movie an incoherent mess. I wish the director had followed Hitchcock's example in at least two respects.    Shooting in 15-minute takes (as Hitchcock did with \\"Rope\\") can add a realness, but you have to tell a story that benefits from that realness. Cuaron took a dynamite idea, that a woman is pregnant in a world that has been infertile for 18 years, and diluted it with blunt sermonizing and a series of violent set pieces by an array of factions which even the protagonist admits is confusing. In a bizarre twist, he brought in illegal immigration as his main point of conflict. It would seem to me that if Europe's native-born population was shrinking, as it is now, they would gladly welcome immigrants as bed-pan changers, street cleaners, and bus drivers, as they do now.    In addition, Hitchcock was always more interested in the effect of the threat on people's actions rather than the source of the threat. The reason \\"The Birds\\" were attacking humans was never explained; we just saw how their attack cracked open the veneer of control in the community they attacked. In the same way, P.D. James never explained why women stopped having babies; she was more interested in how life would change when there weren't future generations to pass on the community to. Instead, Cuaron hints that the infertility was caused by pollution, a point reinforced by all those Satanic mills we see as this new Holy Family makes its precarious way to Bethlehem.    Cuaron took a work of science fiction and made it into a polemic. Science fiction works best when it takes a magical element (i.e. a new wonder drug, a new race of beings, some transformative technology) and shows how  that one factor affects everyday human lives. Cuaron seemed more interested in shooting gorgeously bleak cinematography and hitting touchpoints his core leftist audience would appreciate (from the recreation of the Abu Gharib tortures to the \\"No War on Iraq\\" bumper stickers) than in telling the complex story that P.D. James wrote.

B000WCBPOG|3.0|The original Deluxe Edition released to iTunes and Best Buy contained 31 tracks over 2 CDs.  The Deluxe Edition sold here and now available at other retailers only includes 29 tracks over 2 CDs.  \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\\" and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" are missing.    I don't know why this is, but take it into account before ordering.  The soundtrack deserves 5 stars, but the unexplained removal of tracks cuts it to a 3.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|New Jersey teen Daniel (Ralph Macchio) with his mother has just moved to San Fernado California and tries to fit in with his new town. He falls for a beautiful girl (Elizabeth Shue) but gets picked on at school and sometimes out of school by a gang of vicious karate expert bullies called Cobra Kai leaving him bruised and sometimes scarred. Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) is an old Japanese handyman who helps Daniel with his peers and problems as he teaches him the art of self-defense that just might help him even at the karate championship.<br /><br />Entertaining and inspiring drama that became a major hit in 1984 and i could see why! The performances by the actors especially Pat Morita whom got an academy award nomination for best supporting actor are excellent and so is the direction. I love how they actually did some great cheoregraphy in martial arts and there's some humor at times, it's an 80's classic that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />This special edition DVD has very good picture and sound with good extras like audio commentary from the filmmakers and stars, \\"The Way of the Karate Kid\\" multi-featurette, \\"Beyond The Form\\" featuette, \\"East Meets West\\" composers notebook, \\"Life of Bonsai\\" featurette and of course the trailer to this.
0312263511|2.0|This book is all about Cernan and nothing about what  it was like to go to the moon.  The man is almost  completely inarticulate, but what he lacks there,  he makes up for in ego.  You will learn nothing about  the wonder of space flight from this book. I'm going  to follow the reviews of others and read the Collins  and Bean books.
B000UJ48VI|2.0|As much as I appreciate a new release of this classic film, I am at a loss to understand why they would give it a widescreen treatment and not enhance it for widescreen televisions.  All of the two-disc special editions in the new Kubrick boxed set are enhanced, and yet this one (not part of the set, but released at the same time) is not.  If you're a Lolita fan you should stick with the original 1:33 version.  This one will only frustrate you.
B00005RIKD|5.0|I really owe Sting a whole lot of five star plus reviews. THIS is one outstanding CD of 15 songs, each one enirely unique, each one memorable in its own way.<br /><br />Sting's style - has an array of influences, and my favorite are the Middle Eastern notes & style.<br /><br />Favorite Songs from this CD that always bring me joy are:<br /><br />Fragile<br />A Thousand Years<br />All This Time<br />If You Love Somebody Set Them Free<br />Brand New Day<br />Fields of Gold<br />If I Ever Lose My Faith in You<br /><br />His music is extraordinary in person, live as well in 1978/9 at \\"Speaks\\" in Long Island, NY - very down to earth, and super talented. Then in either 1980 or 81, a huge concert in London was spellbinding.<br /><br />Sting's music has been bringing meso much joy -going all the way back to the beginning of (his old band) The Police.<br /><br />There's also intriguing range in this CD - it's music that brings excitement and anticipation with each beat & each verse. I've been listening to Sting for around 30 years - the songs are as pulling as ever.<br /><br />Talent is eternal. Sting IS talent, Amazing and Extraordinary Music.<br />Other timeless favorites by Sting you might be interested in are:<br />[[ASIN:B000002G2R Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting 1984-1994]], [[ASIN:B00001QGQI Brand New Day]], [[ASIN:B000005IL1 Ten Summoner's Tales]], [[ASIN:B000005ILF Mercury Falling]]<br /><br />Either in CD or MP3 downloads, these would all make great gifts for the lucky receiver.
B000TGCR38|3.0|A good yarn for those who want to see a bit about WW2 resistance efforts in Holland.  Cinematography is high quality but the story is over-acted. Not as good as Soldier of Orange made in 1977 and still the standard bearer of good WW2 films made in Holland for audiences beyond its borders.
0670034711|1.0|I picked up this book as part of a monthly club and was excited to get started. Reading the book was difficult, first my disappointment with the author for not sharing the reasons for her divorce but forcing us to decipher the aftermath not knowing the entire story. Elizabeth Gibert's experiences, however real to her, came across superficial and I kept waiting to be moved by her revelations, but wasn't. Only one of the group of 7 women managed to get through the book, the rest put it away and watched her TIVO'd interview on Oprah instead.

B000BTJDGC|5.0|I was born and raised Catholic so to say I believe in what this movie is about is an understatement.  The first time I saw The Exorcist was in the theater when it was rereleased, and I laughed, at almost the whole movie except for the part with the crucifix, which I still think is uncalled for.  But Emily Rose, oh no there was no laughing.  This movie scares the crap out of me.  I have seen it twice and it still scares me, especially the climax in the barn, don't worry I won't spoil it.  Enjoy, this movie is scarey.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I saw this movie for the first time on the SciFi channel. It is so poorly filmed that it could've been a made-for-tv movie. They must have had a very low budget to make it.
006112429X|4.0|One of the most thought-provoking books that I have ever read is Lionel Shriver's \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\". I can't imagine that fifty years ago it would have dared to be published, let alone win the Orange Prize for Literature.     So it's a credit to today's more candid society that Shriver could have written a book about a parent-child relationship that isn't total bliss. Whilst the novel is described as taboo-breaking, gutsy and startling, which means that most people would have had some reservations about the theme of not really liking one's child, the author has excused herself to some extent by making her child a sort of Damien Omen character and that is a kind of cop-out, in my opinion.     What I mean by that is that Eva, the narrator, rationalises her distaste for her son by having him commit a terrible atrocity along the lines of the Columbine High killings. She never liked him anyway and now she can say \\"well, no wonder I never bonded cause he was a potential killer.\\"     The question that this novel asks, of course, is whether Kevin would have turned into a murderer if his mother had loved him. It's the question that all mothers ask themselves. If he has turned out to be less than she would have liked, was it anything that she did? Could she have done anything to prevent him turning into a killer?     As one of the characters in \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" says:-     It's always the mother's fault, ain' it...That boy turn out bad cause his mama a drunk, or she a junkie. She let him run wild, she don't teach him right from wrong. She never home when he back from school. Nobody ever say his daddy a drunk, or his daddy not home after school. And nobody ever say they some kids just damned mean. Don't you believe that old guff. Don't you let them saddle you with all that killing.     Basically this would seem to be the main theme of the novel, is it nature or nurture? Not that there is a simplistic answer to that question since human beings are much more complicated than that. Anyway, it's not a given that \\"good and devoted parents\\" give birth and bring up good children. Also, how many times have we heard about so-called lousy parents having amazingly marvellous children, which would support the nature argument. That is, if one could dismiss the genetic impact of lousy parents.     One could discuss this topic forever and still keep going round in circles.     What was interesting about the novel is how blind Kevin's father was to his son's manipulating character, but on the other hand, children do treat parents differently and play one off against the other. I found Franklin to be a very silly man,but it is wrong to ignore one child's faults and one can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Or can one?     Similarly, Franklin dismissed his wife's misgivings about Kevin's sadistic nature and in the end he paid the price for being blind to his faults.     I must admit that I was taken aback when Eva, the narrator, decided to have another child. Perhaps she wanted to make up for her original disappointment and perhaps she was trying to prove that she could produce a nice child, after all. Eva also said that it would be good for Kevin to have a sibling. Hard to understand why when he seemed to hate everything and would no doubt hate his brother or sister. Not surprisingly that turned out to be a dismal failure too. Besides, the second child seemed so implausible and was perhaps meant to act as a foil for the demonic Kevin.     If there is a lesson to be learned from \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" it's that having a child is one of the biggest risks one can take in life. There are no guarantees that we will like the child or that the child will like his parents. If we do it because we feel we should, or it's about time, or we are bored with our life, we should seriously consider that we may be buying grief. It may be a fulfilling experience or it may not.     If it's not nature or nurture, it may very well be the luck of the draw, with the highest stakes in the world.
B000O75F7C|5.0|What else can I say?<br /><br />I selected this CD as my introduction to Porcupine Tree, as it had been recommended by a few \\"prog-rock\\" friends of mine.  After reading numerous rave reviews for this CD, I dove into it with a cautious, if not cynical attitude.<br /><br />Mid-way through the album, I found myself so lost and so emotionally affected by the music (ie: \\"My Ashes\\", for just one example), that I had to stop playback multiple times just to recompose myself in order to listen with a more neutral and critical ear.  That proved difficult to maintain for any length of time, quite to my surprise.  Finally, I just gave in and let myself become immersed in the music.  When the album ended, I just sat there in a sort of stunned silence, just slowly trying to absorb just what it WAS that I had just experienced.  I think I remained in a quiet daze for at least a minute or two....  until I finally snapped out of it when I suddenly realized just how EXCITED I was ...with ALL of it!  ...With the ENTIRE album!<br /><br />Wow!<br />WOW!!<br /><br />I was stunned, and completely inspired anew.  It had been a long, long time since I'd felt that.<br />My words fall short of doing this music justice, but if I had to choose a single word, it would be:<br />Brilliant.
B000O75F7C|5.0|The only problem with this record is that it over long before you want it to be. SW's production genius is apptly displayed and the the deep textures and melodic layering that is PT is in full regalia. The subject matter is legitimate and relevent, albeit dark (but that's what we've come to expect and respect) Harrison is a madman, a percussionist driven!  Edwin provides his solid skills on the bottom end. Barbieri creates masterful ambiance to add to SW's (with the help of Wesley, Lifeson, Fripp) inspired guitar works. The vocal work is completely fitting and full of the rich harmonys that all PT fans admire. All combine to create  a new genere trancending experience that is a must hear. In short if you are a fan you should not be disappointed. If your not a fan you will be. Catch PT live, they are all that!
1596680296|5.0|If you swear that no book can teach you sock knitting, that you need someone to sit with you for a month and show you how, this is the book that will change your mind.  As observed in other reviews, the instructions and photos are impeccable, but I want to tell you about the layout!  This is among the most intelligently laid-out instructional books I've ever seen.<br /><br />Many other sock books will lead you through the steps:  Step one, cast on.  There follows four pages on how to cast on.  Step two, knit x rows of ribbing.  There follows two pages on how to knit ribbing.  Step three, begin the heel flap.  There follows five pages . . .  you get the idea.  Ann Budd separates the how-tos from the overview, the clear, abbreviated instructions, in which the rhythm of the whole thing is evident -- and you never, ever lose sight of the path.  Struggling with the heel flap?  Refer back to the how-to section where you'll find detailed, SUPERB photos and instruction, then return to the three-page abbreviated instructions and continue on.  And here's evidence of that layout brilliance:  Each such how-to section is confined to a clearly demarcated set of pages (with lots of pix and lots of white space), and is not part of a huge flowing unit of text that covers thirty pages which you must search to find the part you want.<br /><br />Once you've completed a pair of socks or two or three, you don't need to turn back to the how-to section, and -- lo!  You're ready to knit any pair of socks from anyone else's abbreviated instructions (*Sl 1 pwise wyib, k 1; rep from * and the like).<br /><br />Also, because the sock patterns here are classed strictly by gauge (5 stitches to the inch, e.g.), you're not tied to specific brands of yarn.  Handspinners rejoice!  Knit up a swatch of a given handspun yarn, select the page of instructions that matches the gauge and GO.
0465043577|5.0|I am a risk manager. The challenges that Mandelbrot has undertaken both politically, socially and intellectually are breathtaking and highly relevant. I am routinely found plodding through dense math texts, trying to remember my greek alphabet and often hoplessly lost in teh terminology. Mandelbrot does a great service to us all when he keeps the language understandable for the laity and eschews the complex formulas. You can tell that he does not need to sound overly smart because he is overly smart.<br /><br />This book toes together so much history and so many concepts in such an elegant style that it is very hard to oversell the work. I have a hard time imagining a field in which this knowledge is not applicable in some way. And anyone who has even a baseline sense of curiosity will find the interweaving of the many great stories compelling.<br /><br />I would imagine that some math majors will find that the information is somewhat basic, but only if they are exposed to a lox on non linear problems in a complexity theory or econophysics field. For everyone else, this is a masterpiece, an entertaining, accessible masterpiece.<br /><br />Oh, and for any of you who like Nassim Taleb's work, this is absolutely essential reading. I also suggest diving into network and sync theories which fill in the gaps left by Mandelbrot. Much good work has been done since he wrote this. \\"Linked\\" and \\"sync\\" are especially good and accessible.
0307387178|4.0|Why do people push themselves to the extreme limits of safety? Krakauer attempts to get to the bottom of that question as it relates to Chris McCandless's life and death. Was he simply a wilderness-loving idealist? Was he getting back at his parents? What was he really searching for? Krakauer is uniquely qualified to tackle this story, as he has a good bit of experience attempting the extreme himself, including his own youthful Alaskan mis-adventure (which is fascinatingly described in this book).     Hauntingly and memorably written, Krakauer's telling of McCandless's adventures and philosophies will cause the reader to take a good look at him- or herself. Ultimately, however, I don't think Krakauer answers the questions raised by McCandless's life terribly convincingly. For instance, I still don't have a clear understanding of why he regarded his parents with such unabated scorn. I didn't like this book as much as Krakauer's [[ASIN:0385494785 Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster]], but it was valuable, nonetheless, as a thought-provoking, quick read.
B000GCFO08|5.0|I actually seen previews for this in the movie theatres and I instantly thought that it was going to suck big time! But then my mom brought a handful of movies that were on sale at block buster and one of them happened to be Silent Hill so I decided to give this movie a chance. I did in deed play Silent Hill and I got so lost that I just gave up and never really beat the game(But maybe this may make me return back to playing it and this time with a game guide!). This movie kicked butt! I must say that they stood true to the flipping back and forth like the game and the special effects did justice just like the game even though the plot and the situations were changed a little bit to make the movie a bit dramatic I still think they did an awesome job! Unlike Resident Evil movie's which totally derailed from the game and it became it's own movie instead of following the games Silent Hill did justice in just that keeping the fans intrested! I give this movie five stars!
B000WTLDPU|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I didn't have high expectations. The trailer looked silly and I had practically disregarded the movie. Lately, actors of the size of Robert De Niro (who now can do anything they want) have been doing some campy and really bad movies (like Meet the Parents), so not even the big names were enough to interest me.     But then I started reading some reviews on imdb a couple of weeks after the movie got out. A lot of them agreed that the trailer didn't do justice to the film, and that although still not taking itself seriously, the movie somehow shined far beyond expectations. So I decided to give it try, and now I'm glad I watched this movie in the big screen.     For those who haven't seen it yet, the trailer indeed falls short. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro are great, along with everyone else in the cast. The music score is amazing, the special effects are great, and the most important thing of all, the story is funny and it really taps into the best of the best of the fantasy genre.     This movie didn't have the success it deserved on the box office, so please, give it a try. It's not your typical fantasy film, it feels original, fresh, and it really entertains. Since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, some people might consider it campy at first, but the best way to enjoy this great film is not to expect a deep drama (like the Lord of the Rings), but an entertaining fresh film.     Paramount has gone HD DVD exclusive, and for that we now get Stardust released on both DVD and HD DVD. If you have an HD DVD player, Stardust is a must in High-Def. Anyone who saw this movie in the theaters should agree.     Simply put, the movie is a visual feast without compromising the story and it really deserves a chance. Some may find it a little weird film, but Stardust is a sleeper hit that hopefully will get the success it deserves on DVD and HD DVD.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|In the era of Hendrix, Cream, and Michael Bloomfield, Jeff Beck's first release was a landmark album.  Truth (and the superb follow-up of Beck-Ola) showcased Jeff's raw & intense playing and clearly his best Blues ever.  Jeff's discovery of then-unknown Rod Stewart was providencial as his voice was an amazing compliment to Jeff's style; it was totally unique and ideally suited for the Blues. (Too bad he abandoned this direction and instead opted for the 'Do you think I'm sexy/Hot Legs' rubbish).  Truth contains 'Blues Deluxe' which seems to have been plagiarized from the Blues classic 'Gambler's Blues,' but it stands on its own nonetheless.  Although in the same genre as Led Zeppelin's early releases, Truth pre-dates Zep I by six months.  Interesting that both include the great Blues track 'You Shook Me.' The Jeff Beck Group obviously never attained the same commercial success as Zeppelin which  was painfully ironic and likely caused some resentment since Jeff dropped out of the Yardbirds and Jimmy Page continued on with them.  (For nostalgic's sake, check out the 1966 film Blowup which includes a scene near the end with the Yardbirds w/Jimmy Page & Jeff Beck performing 'Stroll On,' until Jeff smashes his guitar &agrave; la The Who.  You can see it on Youtube).

0751517089|4.0|As it turns out, Nick Leeson does not seem to be a terrible guy, although he single-handedly caused the collapse of one of the oldest banks in the world in early 1995, Barings Bank. I just don't understand how he could let the 88888 account continue for so long once the losses started building. Why not confess? What started with some mistakes and an attempt to hide them soon took on a life of its own and grew out of control. Sure, Barings should have had more internal controls and could have monitored Leeson better, but to think that a young kid from suburban London would outwardly forge reports and signatures to cover his trail is unbelievable. It was fraud and he knew it.<br /><br />This book is an interesting account of the collapse of one of Britain's oldest and most powerful merchant banks by Nick Leeson while trading derivatives on the Singapore, Nikkei and Osaka stock exchanges. Leeson recreated conversations and the year leading up to his capture with amazing detail, all of which makes for interesting reading. I was interested in the underlying reasons for the collapse of Barings, and thus, the book did drag on a bit. But once Leeson realized he would be discovered and fled Singapore with his wife in late February 1995, the story really got exciting. All in all, an interesting self-account of how covering one's mistakes will lead to lies upon lies, which, as it did with Leeson, will ultimately lead to disaster.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is a life altering book. I know, it gave me the wisdom and insight to make a complete change in my life...for the better. It is practical and easy to follow. You may get slightly lost in the ancient Wisdom aspect of it, but continue through to it's end and you'll grasp the entire concepts....then read the Companion Book to the Four Agreements for full understanding. It is more life altering than current books like The Secret or The Law of Attraction. It is well written. I think a person who's not had any personal growth counselling prior to reading this book may not grasp the full usefulness of this book. It is deeply wise.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Any Rush album is going to bring wave after wave of effusive praise from fans and the usual sniggers from nay-sayers. The band is like that -- a lot of people know their work and remember the popular tracks, some like it, other revile it, and then there are the true fans who would probably buy a Rush polka album. But I think \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is a remarkable work, not just in carrying forth the tradition of musicianship and thought-provoking work we've come to know and admire from Neil, Geddy, and Alex, but in providing a blueprint for success.    The album is probably not their best from an all-time standpoint, but it stands on its own as a stellar series of songs which pull in influences from not just their own previous works, but works which the band has let themselves be influenced by. You can definitely hear echoes of Cream and The Who. They take a trip across the spectrum of human experience, set it to music, and pull you in with driving beats, pounding rhythms, and variety not found in a lot of albums. I'm also pleased to see so many instrumentals, highlighting the band's musicianship in ways not seen since the days of \\"YYZ\\".    I would recommend this to anyone who is in a current band or thinking of starting one. It captures the rock sound of the current age while at the same time inserting hints of rock past to be carried on. I think this album can simply be regarded as a blueprint for success.
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|I stumbled upon this at the movie room in my gym. I have never even heard of this title so I had no idea what to expect.     The premise is interesting, although a little mind-boggling at times. The plot seems to use the 2 minute thing selectively. I was wondering, Can he turn it off? When he's exploring alternate outcomes, like he did when he was trying to pick up Jessica Biel, does that count towards his 2 minutes? There are lot of unanswered questions and holes in the plot.      Oh Nic Cage, subtlety is not your strong suit. He is so over dramatic. This performance isn't quite as bad as that in the Wicker Man, but it is laughable a times. At one point, a little kid tells Jessica Biel, \\"I think he likes you because of the way he looks at you.\\" Pan over to Nic Cage, who's just standing there staring at Biel intensely. And she seems surprised by this kid pointing out the incredibly obvious!    Biel is okay, with her heaving bosom, but there is not an ounce of chemistry between her Cage. I just kept thinking, \\"Isn't he too old for her?\\"     Julianne Moore proves what a tough cop she is by screaming at everyone and being bitchy. C'mon, was it really necessary to strap Cage down and pry his eyelids open, Clockwork Orange style?    I only got about 1/2 through the movie, but I'm pretty sure Cage will save the day and millions of people won't die.
B000WZAE1I|2.0|Several critics from abroad are giving this movie more positive reviews than negative. After my colleague and I recently saw this film, we were disappointed. We were also somewhat confused; because Stardust is unlike an enchanted, fantasy comedy adventure such as The Princess Bride but similar to the dreadful fantasy genre Eragon; with bad writing, acting and especially the visual effects. This is why sometimes fantasy books--such as Stardust--should stay in bookstore. However, Hollywood had other ideas involving Gainmen's book.<br /><br />Along time ago, in a pastoral English village of Wall, there was a young man by the name of Tristran Thorn (Charlie Cox). He seeks the love of a young woman Victoria (Sienna Miller) and he finally receives the courage to ask her out on a date--something similar happened to his father before he was born. That evening while they are conversing with one another, Tristran shares his most intimate thoughts and affections that he has for her, but she tells him that she seeing someone. As they continue to talk a shooting star flies overhead, Victoria tells him that if his love is so great for her to fetch that star, and he then can have her hand in marriage. Christian fearlessly sets out to retrieve the fallen star knowing that he will have to cross the ancient wall that separates his village with the enchanted Kingdom of Stormhold.<br /><br />Within a short time, he arrives at his destination with the aid of his father's transporting Babylon candle, and he finds the crater that the star made when it fell, but to his surprise the star is a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes). She is in grave danger because the son of Lord of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole) and three evil witches--one being Lamia (Michele Pfeiffer)--require her magical powers for their own diabolical reasons. They are soon lured into a trap by Lamia--by the Inn that she make from her magic--but they escape with the candle and they are transported into the clouds. They are soon captured by the ostentatious--in the closet, Captain Shakespeare and his pirates a board his flying ship. Will they survive from these ordeals that are pitted against them?<br /><br />We first saw this trailer in spring of 2007; we definitely had some uncertainties about this film even though the cast look very promising--Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, and even Peter O'Toole. The direction (Matthew Vaughn) and the writing are a cheap imitation of William Goldman (American novelist, playwright and two-time Academy Award-winning screenwriter) who wrote the script for the film The Princess Bride.<br /><br />Paramount Pictures has been making movie bombs lately, and for the producers, why did they decide to attempt this attribute of film making and as well as obtaining the services of Jane Goldman (a Non-fiction writer of paranormal investigation)? This is a mystery to us and probably to the fans of Neil Gaiman, who wrote this novel. Yes, this movie is almost identical to the novel but probably without the sexual innuendos and Homosexual/transvestite references from our characters; the writing is very choppy and because of this, the acting is one-dimensional. The actors De Niro and Pfeiffer are just a mirror image of recent roles that we have grown accustomed from films reminiscent of: GoodFellas and Meet the Parents, Cat woman in Batman Returns and more currently HairSpray.<br /><br />The technical aspects like set designs/visual effects/CGI look very cheap: especially the Kingdom of Stormhold, the castle, the surrounding country--including the crater from the fallen star. The music composed by and when not being bombarded with this theme, the main track of the film changes to something very similar to the Heroic music of Eragon.<br /><br />Please enter at your own risk because of the unoriginal, sexual innuendos, the \\"no chemistry\\" romance (Christian and the star woman), the fantasy, and finally the poor comedy (the Dry British humor [a.k.a. The Princess Bride].) Bottom line; we are tired of poor writing, even though you have stars like Robert De Niro Peter O'Toole and Michele Pfeiffer you can not always achieve success from a novel; example Eragon.ing, even though you have stars like Robert De Niro Peter O'Toole and Michele Pfeiffer you can not always achieve success from a novel; example Eragon.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|With high school now completely behind her, Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) heads off to college.  In spite of her best efforts, she's stuck in Neptune, attending Hearst College and living at home with her dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni).  As a result, it's really no surprise when mystery and danger find her again.<br /><br />Veronica's well earn reputation and the person who can solve the unsolvable gets her involved in one case after another.  Who is behind the \\"Welcome Wagon\\" and steals new student's stuff?  Who would kidnap a monkey?  And where is the missing member of the board of trustees?<br /><br />Unlike previous seasons, there are two bigger mysteries.  The first involves the serial rapist on the Hearst campus.  And the second one begins when college dean Cyrus O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) is found dead in his office.<br /><br />And we can't leave out her personal life.  Her on again off again relationship with Logan (Jason Dohring) creates problems, especially since friend Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) new roommate Piz (Chris Lowell) is also interested in her.  With all this going on, will she ever have time to study?<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the final season of a show I fell in love with right away.  The mysteries were sharp, requiring concentration to follow every week.  Yet the clues were there.  Veronica has a sharp sense of humor that is wonderful for lightening the mood of the usually dark show.  The relationship soap opera, while at times annoying, never got too bad.  And all the acting was top notch.<br /><br />Having praised it, this is my least favorite season of the show.  And it's not because there were two shorter mysteries and a couple stand alone episodes.  It was because the adult tone, definitely always present, became even more pronounced.  Of course, that's what you'd expect with rape being a subject for half the season.  Even the details of Veronica's personal life made me uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />As a result, I don't recommend this show for young kids.  Older teens and adults will absolutely love this sly combination of wit and noir.s will absolutely love this sly combination of wit and noir.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|The performances on this set are legendary.  Anyone considering buying this set knows the drill when it comes to AC/DC.  I think they're the greatest live band in rock history and this set really captures that.      I don't understand the complaints about the sound quality on here.  I should say that I'm not an audiophile (although I do have a 5.1 surround system) but I think the sound is great.  Sure, some of the earliest clips are grainy and the sound is relatively poor compared to the sonic beauty that we're used to nowadays.  Just remember that some of these perfomances are from 1975 and they were filmed in a high school.  What do you expect?  The terms \\"cleaned up\\" and \\"remastered\\" aren't terms I usually associate with AC/DC.  I think leaving the early clips raw and original gives them a authenticity and intensity that blows me away.  If you're an AC/DC fan don't be afraid of sound issues with this set.  The performances are well worth it.     The extras are great too, especially the rehersals.  Thanks for all of the memories.
B00000DWG6|5.0|I GOT THIS \\"ALBUM\\" FOR MY THIRTEENTH BIRTHDAY, IN 1972(I REMEMBER THE ALBUM CAME WITH A POSTER AND I HAD IT HANGING UP IN MY ROOM FOR YEARS).  I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO IT EVER SINCE, I WILL NEVER, EVER GET TIRED OF HEARING THIS ONE.  IT MAY WELL BE THE GREATEST (AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE FIRST) \\"LIVE\\" ROCK AND ROLL ALBUMS OF ALL TIME.  YOU NEED TO TURN THE VOLUME DIAL ALL THE WAY UP ON THIS ONE. KEITH MOON WAS PROBABLY THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL DRUMMER OF ALL TIME (MITCH MITCHELL MAY COME IN A DISTANT SECOND BUT THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENTIAL HERE).  AND THE REST OF THE BAND (DALTRY, ENTWHISTLE AND TOWNSEND) NEVER SOUNDED BETTER.  WHEN I WANT TO HEAR SOME GREAT OLD TIME R&R, THIS IS THE ONE ALBUM I CAN ALWAYS PUT ON AND NEVER BE DISAPPOINTED. I PROBABLY SAW THE WHO LIVE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE TIMES BACK IN THE 70'S (FOUR STRAIGHT NIGHTS AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN IN '77) AND THIS CD IS AS CLOSE TO WHAT THEY WERE LIKE IN THOSE DAYS LIVE AS ANYTHING YOU WILL EVER HEAR
0812975219|3.0|I'm one of the people who read Taleb's \\"The Black Swan\\" before I read this book (the reverse order of their publication dates) and the thesis is almost identical.    First, Taleb points out several studies that, in total, show that people (even experts) are irrational.  That's no surprise.  He points out that these systemic errors in judgement may also account for certain market behaviors.  Again, no surprise.      Frankly, if you are thinking about buying this book you are better off buying [[ASIN:0470110120 How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of \\"Intangibles\\" in Business]] by Douglas Hubbard.  Hubbard addresses the same sources - and far more - of expert error.  But Hubbard also talks about how to adjust for these errors with proven methods and he makes a much more air-tight case than Taleb.  In yet another contrast to Taleb, Hubbard approaches all problems as if he, too, is subject to these irrational forces and the only defense is to realize it and take steps to offset it.  Taleb seems to fall prey to Hubbard's observation \\"The most susceptable people are those who are convinced they are immmune to these errors\\".
B000K6QIQO|5.0|Rare to CD the real last Beatles album ,released just prior to the bans official break-up . A superb cross section of their career presented on mostly Non Album Singles and B sides . Some Editions even have the Hey Jude album's working tracks ,which complement the original release with Alternate Verions ,Demos of nearly every song on the album ,plus the comical release \\"You Know My Name\\" ! Just an excellent listen throughout!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have had the Swivel Sweeper for several months now and use it practically everyday to clean up my hardwood kitchen floor after the kids. It works like a charm, it picks up crumbs, cat hair, little pieces of paper, cheerios, dust, you name it. I was skeptical at first from reading these reviews, but i tried it for myself and it really does a great job! It beats having to take out the big vacuum or the broom and dustpan. The only complaint I have, which is minor, is that the outside of the sweeper gets super dusty, but it you take a wet cloth it cleans right up. The dustpan is easy to take on and off and the battery holds a charge no problem, just be sure to charget it overnight.  I defintely recommend this product to anyone who has small kids and is constantly cleaning their kitchen floor! I would say it works better on hard floors than on carpet, but still worth buying.
0525950079|4.0|*** NO SPOILERS ***  THIS REVIEW IS SAFE TO READ IF YOU HAVEN'T EVEN OPENED THE BOOK<br /><br />Well, I am one of those people who thought Pillars of the Earth was one of the two or three best books I've ever read.  I've read Pillars five times in total, pretty much once every few years since its initial publication.  Pillars had a certain magical quality - a combination of riveting storytelling, larger than life characters, grand themes of religion, destiny, history, and morality, strong women, love, hate, redemption, and so on.  Naturally, the question on my mind in purchasing World Without End was, since most sequels are bad, could this one possibly overcome the track record of sequels and deliver a reading experience similar to Pillars?  Frankly, every sequel I've ever read for books I loved (case in point: Shogun) left me quite disappointed.  So I was wary, though Ken Follett has provided me so many hours of reading pleasure over the years that I allowed myself to be hopeful.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line.  World Without End is a good book, and worth reading if you loved Pillars.  It is not Pillars, but it's still a solid read.  I will quickly net out the Pillars comparison for those who want to know how it stacks up.  It has lots and lots of interesting history and \\"feel\\" for the time period, which I greatly enjoy.  At the same time, World Without End does not have the same gravitas as Pillars had.  Where Pillars had a handful of charasmatic characters who were archetypes of universal themes of the human condition and who were larger than life, World Without End has a seemingly endless procession of characters who are just life-sized.  WWE has a secret as Pillars did; however, the secret is not a Terrible Secret on the grand scale of Pillars, just one of the many thousands of secrets that have transpired through the ages and been long forgotten.  Where Pillars was about the grandeur and otherworldliness of building a cathedral, WWE concerns us with the utilitarian issue of constructing a bridge - more of an engineering problem than a transcendental challenge.  I didn't care about the characters in WWE in the same way I cared about them in Pillars.  That said, WWE is good storytelling.  I have read ALL of Follett's books, and he spins a great yarn every time; no exception here.  The enjoyment of escaping into another time and place is all here, just like in Pillars, though it's somehow less compelling.  With Pillars I stayed up for three or four nights and missed a day or two of work, because I simply could not put the book down.  This book requires more of a commitment, because it's not that hard to put down.  When I finished Pillars I would've paid 10 times the cost of the book for another 100 pages; with WWE, by the time the book ended, I was done and ready to go back to other stuff.<br /><br />One of the problems with having written the Best Book Ever is that, by definition, the next one won't be as good.  That is the case here.  But is it fair to expect the Best Book Ever to be superceded by the Even Better Best Book Ever?  There is no sequel to Pillars, in the same way that you can't have a second first-love.  There's only one first love; all the rest after that is fine-tuning and possbly recapturing bits and pieces of the initial thrill, but to expect the magic of your first fomance to repeat itself all over again is unrealistic and likely to lead to unnecessary disappointment.  World Without End is a good four star book, and can be enjoyed on its own merit.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  I, like some other reviewers here, found the sex a bit gratuitous. I'm no prude, but I do think it's OK to leave it to the imagination, or just assume young healthy people of the opposite sex will occasionally act like rabbits, without further elaboration each time.f constructing a bridge - more of an engineering problem than a transcendental challenge.

B000VPUIA6|1.0|I'm long sense tired of comecial enterprises trotting out the Beatles' work in a new package.  The intent is obviously commercial and has nothing to do with Paul's or Ringo's income.  I don't know who makes money from this stuff, but I really question whether it could really be considered ethical.    I urge all true Beatles fans to buy the records, CD's and movies as they were originally produced (I have a monophonic vinyl edition of Help in my collection), but boycott this re-release/re-hash stuff.    In short - Don't buy this package!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|The DVD turned out to be better than the PBS special.  No comercials.  Thanks for the decent price.
B00005JPRF|1.0|First, as a giant resident evil fan and someone who plays all games this movie is a HUGE mistake.  It's one thing for it to be a movie with some parts of a game like the first two movies, but this movie is just horrible.  With the first movie getting just a taste of the original game with a whole new story written into it along with the second one allowing Nemesis to be involved for some reason even though he was in the 3rd game not the second.  Finally, this movie is just totally wrong and had nothing to do with any game and allowing another movie to be lined up is even worse.  The new movie has no resident evil touch in it besides the crows and the tyrant which if you play the games you know that the crows don't ATTACK and that the TYRANT is in a totally different game and has nothing to do with this stupid story line.  I think this movie should have been scrapped from the script stage.  If you're going to make a game into a movie do it like Silent Hill and follow the story line of the GAME.  It's not right to do parts of things with your own touch to it cause from my personnal view this movie is garbage.  I wouldn't advise anyone see this movie for any reason unless you follow nothing of the game.  The clones of the main character is just stupid and leaves number
B000VLOKQI|5.0|First, the misses - I wish they would have included full concerts, or at least four or five full songs from the 1970s shows (the way McCartney's new DVD allegedly will). That would have made this perfect.    However, what is here is great. More footage of the Kilburn 1977 show than I thought I'd ever see, to hear how the band supposedly hated the gig/Jeff Stein's footage of that show. We see part of a great, pre-album (almost by a year) version of \\"Who Are You\\" live at Kilburn, with Moon and Entwistle jamming underneath Pete's guitar. Pete sings the chorus by himself (!), even the \\"Who the f ....\\" part, and Daltrey later joins in. It's wonderful to see Moon playing drums on a live version (other than the live-in-the-studio take in \\"The Kids Are Alright.\\" The Who, from the clips seen in this DVD, sounded pretty stinking good at Kilburn. Moon actually looks like he was in better shape and less tired than the 1978 Shepperton footage in \\"TKAA.\\" Don't get me wrong, I love the two Shepperton clips in \\"TKAA,\\" but Moon seems more firey and hits the drums and cymbals faster (and with less effort) on the Kilburn clips. Good footage of Entwistle's crazy fingers on the bass at Kilburn, although  a couple segments don't quite match up with his fingers, but nonetheless, it's great to see 1970s footage of the Ox cuttlng loose on the bass. This happens at the end of \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\" at Kilburn. Unfortunately, we only see the end of the song, but it's great to see John wailing on four strings.   it's also great to see The Who clowning around in the studio while trying to do the backing vocals to \\"Pictures of Lily,\\" and there's a quick segment of Pete laying down the electric guitar for the track.  Clips of the \\"Quadrophenia\\" and \\"Who By Numbers\\" tours are awesome, allthough short like the Kilburn gig. We see Pete holding up Keith Moon (or restraining him?) at Pete's mic stand, then Pete and Roger carrying Moon to his drum kit, and then Moonie collapsing.  Interesting interviews with Pete and Roger, although much of Pete's is lifted from \\"An Ox's Tale\\" DVD and the 2004 interview Murray Lerner did for \\"The Who Live at the Isle of Wight\\" limited theatrical release and special edition DVD version in 2004. The quick segment of Hyde Park in 1994 (or 1996?) was interesting, although no site of David Gilmour.  I'm glad they talked to Kenney Jones, who is pretty much bitter-free, at least in the interviews. He really carries the weight of Daltrey's fueding back then, the world's criticisms of him not being Keith Moon, and the 1979 Cincinatti trajedy where 11 Who fans were trampled to death in a stampede for festival (general admsision) seats.    Maybe they will eventually put out all of these shows in full, someday soon on DVD. Take a note from Deep Purple and Kiss, please, Roger and Pete, and dump all the archive stuff on us. We are waiting.   Thanks for all the great music! Hope to see you on tour again soon .....    P.S. The talking heads segments aren't that bad. They're limited (only Noel Gallagher gets on my nerves, acting as if he's bothered to play with The Who at the Royal Albert Hall in 2000 - what the heck? I'll play fourth banana to The Who anyday!), as if the filmmakers started to include them in the beginning, and then kind of abandoned the idea in favor of interviews with Pete, Roger and file interviews of Entwislte, as well as their siblings and parents. First time I think I've heard Simon Townshend speak (not counting his background vocals live - and lead vocals on the 1996 Quadrophenia DVD)
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Quite honestly, the Springsteen cds I like are Nebraska and Tom Joad. The rest of his ouvre is somehow sonic overkill, emotional histrionics and hamfisted fractured metaphors. There is no doubt that the guy and his team can generate heat, especially in the NYC and North Jersey environs. Up here in the Maritimes, it is a little less convincing, and I don't know that that is always Springsteen's fault. THis one, as with many before it, suffers from too much hype. And I mean really suffers.  I have read a lot of reviews, including the adulating Rolling Stone, and was ready for something transformative. No such luck. It's all about losers from North Jersey wondering where they are in their lives, and while I get it, let's just say this isn't Charles Bukowski.  The one exception is the paean to his friend who has passed away. That hits with a lightning bolt. The songs are all boilerplate Springsteen. Working class, with a farm in the Jersey highlands and a daughter copeting in horseshows, he is still convincing enough. Where he is done a disservice id in both the production and the public perception. It seems his persona as the straightline descendant of Frank Sinatra and Frankie Valli with a Phil Spector aesthetic doesn't, or rarely allows him to get across what he really intends, Born in the USA being the perfect example. Radio Nowhere here has a point about the lack of communication that is undermined by its radio-friendly dance beat. This safe and comfortable E Street bomblast, regardless of the lyrics. And I am not sure Springsteen is capable of expressing it otherwise. Even the Seeger stuff was channeled through a wall of noise. Perhaps it isn't possible to use subtlety and nuance in the same sentence with New Jersey, but then, Bill Evans managed it. Everything else just always seems so over the top, as in \\"Come here, Wendy!\\" All blue collar and no play makes jack.....  Anyway, if you romaticize about the Jersey shore enough and love that honking sax music, this record has it all in spades.  But there isn't a \\"Point Bank\\" or a song about the prejudice of NY cops or even the dismay of a post 9-11 New Yorker on offer here. No doubt the Garden will be sold out for 15 nights. I came looking for magic and felt somewhat fleeced.
B00020X88O|4.0|I have loved the movie Showgirls since the first time I watched it!  Although the director didn't intend it to be, this movie is so CAMPY. It's fun, sexual, musical, fast moving and visually stunning.  I don't take this movie seriously - that the characters and story should be realistic or politically correct.  I think they are realistic enough for Las Vegas.     This movie may not be suitable for Aunt Matilda or for children but for adults - set up the home theatre surround system, get a drink, sit back and be prepared for a fun ride.     This particular box set is okay with the additional items (shot glasses, cards etc.) but not mandatory as just the film itself is all you need.  Have fun!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|for whatever reason the movie didnt do too well in the theaters but once you watch it on blu-ray which is directors cut, you will enjoy it. has tons of sceans that were not in the original theatricl release. must have for all movie lovers.
0553381695|4.0|A Clash of Kings has the same tone, plot structure and generally focuses on the same characters as the A Game of Thrones (the first book in the series). The vibe is the same so if you liked the first book you will likely enjoy this one as well. The character development is the best aspect of this series. Some characters you love, some you hate, some intrigue you, some repulse you but across the board you will feel strongly about all the characters one way or another and that is a testiment to Martin's skill.     After reading a Game of Thrones I noted in my review that the amount and detail of the sexual violence and humiliation directed towards women was deeply disturbing. I suspected that the author had dark issues related to women and seemed to enjoy writing about rape. After reading A Clash of Kings I am now 100% certain that the author gets off on writing about the sexual humiliation of women. (If you thought the rape of the lamb women by Dothraki pillagers was bad in A Game of Thrones just wait and see what Martin has in store for you in this book including the public gang rape of an underage retarded girl by 50 F-I-F-T-Y men. Be prepared to read about women being stripped naked and bent over into stocks 24 hours a day to be raped by countless numbers of men at their leisure). I mean seriously, what type of perverted and damaged mind could come up with this stuff let alone take such obvious delight in writing about it? I took off 2 stars due to the sexual violence in the first book but this time I am only taking off one star because the rape is so ridiculously prevelant and constant and over the top that I am effectively becoming desensitized to it. Seriously if you did a shot everytime a woman was raped, sexually assualted and humiliated in this book you would be drunk constantly and you would not sober up for two weeks after you had finished the book.    I will continue to read this series even I am convinced the author is a misogynistic pervert who is indulging his disgusting fetishes through his books. I feel guilty about it and I feel like I am actively killing a part of my soul by continuing to read these books but it can't be helped. I am invested in these characters now and I can't deny that the series is insanely entertaining.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|In a few words.  The simpliest and in the same time, the most ambicious work of him.y  Experience in movies, for Lynch is playing with peoples´s imaginary all the time.  Thank you Lord for living in the same age of this amazing guy!!!
0143034901|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The character development, plot lines, and overall story kept me guessing till the end.  A love story, a thriller, a tale of interconnected lives.  READ THIS BOOK!
0316067598|5.0|I enjoyed the story very much.  It is well written, and easy to follow.  I had no idea what SEALs go through to qualify to be a SEAL.  The story is based on a recent tragic event. The story touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes.   I highly recommend it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie ! great action and story line. 10/10<br />Get [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] for  insight into the crew and Captain Malcolm Reynolds history.
0743486285|4.0|Really hard book to put down.  Showed that being a successful rockstar is not all glitz and glamour and how easy it is to fall into the trap of drugs and booze like so many musicians before Nikki Sixx.      At times I felt as though I was violating Nikki's privacy as the diary entries are at times extremely personal.    A great read and so glad he came out a better man.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Literally worth five times the price and an equal in it's own way to PULSE, with intimacy and a freer feel offsetting the more minimal lighting (although enormously impressive in its own right.)    As the other reviewers have given an accurate overview I'll just mention one cut, that being \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" which you and I know every second of by heart, it's in our blood.    This performance features David Bowie sharing lead vocals. Now the idea of anyone but Mr. Gilmour taking over vocals on this song is enough to make my hair catch on fire, but THIS WORKS. It actually becomes a Bowie song while remaining a Floyd epoch. It's thrilling, it's almost dreamlike to watch a singer of equal caliber and credibility to Mr. Gilmour share this song and to take it's inherent drama and mystery to another level entirely.    The DVD also points out what a superb disc \\"On An Island\\" is, sadly overlooked by too many Floyd fans for not being heavy enough (man.)    And it's in high def - you can almost reach out and shake Rick Wright's hand.     Extras are top flight, set is an incredible bargain and you'll have trouble turning it off and going to bed. Mr. Gilmour once again proves that he's in a class all by himself, a category of artist of which there is only one.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|There is an other-worldly quality to Loreena McKennitt's music -- so much so that it's startling to see it played live, without studio trickery. It took my breath away.<br /><br />This set includes a DVD and two audio CDs, and everything about it is absolutely first-rate. This is exceptional value for the money. I couldn't recommend it more highly.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Since Malakian is not in this album, don't expect any especially memorable guitar solos. On the upside, since Malakian is not in this album, fans who complain about his voice will have less to complain about in this album.    Compared to SOAD albums, this one is less dynamic, although still insanely creative. It's also less...freaky (no \\"banana terracotta pie\\" on this album). Elect the Dead is more serious and more overtly left-leaning.    Overall, if your idea of great music is Kelly Clarkson (not that she's horrible), don't even bother, but if you're a SOAD fan, there's no reason not to buy this.
B000VD5I94|4.0|I love this movie. I thought the transfer on this disc was very good.<br /><br />But for this price, I truly expected something more than the bare-bones presentation given here. It's more than disappointing -- it's annoying. When the studio finally releases the deluxe edition this movie deserves, I may not be able to bring myself to buy it. Why reward them for treating their customers this way?
B00006RCLQ|4.0|Sorry, there are no fountains of puss and vomit here.  No brain spewage or severed limbs.  No copious amounts of blood or gore in this one either, but this movie still packs a quite a fright.<br />It quickly grabs your attention when a car plunges off a bridge into a river.  There is one lone survivor that emerges from the water, apparently unscathed.  She has no recollection of the accident.<br />As the story progresses you are left wondering about her.  Hallucinations and nightmares begin to manifest, sometimes this woman seems disconnected from reality.<br />Now you'll probably see the ending coming, it's been done countless times by todays horror.  But I'm sure it was quite a shock back then.<br />For this low low price, this is a must own if you're a fan of classic horror.  I don't know if I'd splurge for the Criterion though, but it might be worth it...
0440296080|3.0|The first half of this book was briliant.  I finished my internship 10 years ago (before the rules limiting maximum hours that housestaff can work)and can truly say that it captured the essence of the experience.  That being said, the book jumped the proverbial shark about halfway through the book with an orgy in the intern callroom.  It all went downhill from there.
0345409671|5.0|Memnoch the Devil is in my opinion the most introspective and imaginative novel in the vampire chronicles. Without a doubt, Rice put in her most introspective beliefs and thoughts and blended it into a fascinating tale with Lestat through a dazzling journey of heaven and hell, while providing a very intriguing theory of \\"creation.\\" Whether or not i agree with the details or whether i believe in god or not, it is undeniable that she possesses extraordinary skill in articulating her views without preaching and the tale absolutely drags you in without will, you simply lose yourself in the grandeur of the topics at hand. I believe this is the best book in the series, I waited in the last four books for a \\"conclusion\\" to Lestat's incessant need to understand why he exists and an encounter with the supernatural and deities that he meets in this book. Lestat's final bout of insanity and his recovery in the last few chapters, and for that matter throughout all the book, is an entirely new and most passionate look inside the mind and soul of our beloved character. This goes down in my book, no pun intended, as the best of the series so far (I eagerly await to read the rest in the series but need a break at this point) and for those that criticize the novel for its dogma, I answer with \\"that is irrelevant, you are not a true reader if you do not learn to accept the views of the writer, appreciate the beauty of it whether or not you believe in it yourself.\\" This is a glorious work of art.
1400064287|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining as well as one of the most thought-provoking and informative books I have read in recent years. Chip Heath and his brother Dan examine an especially important challenge to everyone who struggles to formulate and then communicate ideas that \\"stick\\": That is, ideas that \\"are understood and remembered, and have a lasting impact - they change your audience's opinions or behavior.\\" Extensive research indicates that each of us receives several thousand messages each day from various print and electronic media as well as from those with whom we have direct contact.  These competing messages create \\"clutter\\" that is increasingly more difficult to penetrate.<br /><br />Others have already explained why they hold this book in high regard. Here are three reasons of mine. First, the Heaths brilliantly explain how to nurture ideas that will succeed by penetrating the clutter and then sticking in a \\"noisy, unpredictable, chaotic environment.\\" They stress the importance of simplicity (i.e. \\"finding the core of the idea\\"), of surprise to attract attention and then interest to keep that attention, of concreteness (\\"language is often abstract, but life is not abstract\\"), of credibility (hence the importance of verifiable details), of emotion (i.e. making people care), and of storytelling that provides stimulation (knowledge about how to act) and inspiration (motivation to act). The Heaths' own explanation of all this \\"sticks\\" because it possesses the same qualities to which the acronym SUCCESs refers: their explanation is guided and informed by Simple Unexpected Concrete Credible Emotional Stories.<br /><br />Also, I greatly appreciate the Heaths' use of real-world situations that demonstrate why some ideas \\"stick\\" and most others don't. For example, in Chapter 5, the Heaths examine efforts to reduce litter in Texas. The state was spending $25-million a year on cleanup and costs were increasing 15% a year. Efforts to encourage better behavior (such as use of \\"Please Don't Litter\\" signs and roadside trash cans marked \\"Pitch In\\") weren't working because they weren't effective as appeals to emotion. What to do? How and why \\"Don't mess with Texas\\" stuck is best revealed within the narrative.  My point now is that this and dozens of other examples give a stickiness to the Heaths' key points. Again, how they organize and present their material penetrates the clutter that (at last count) 432,367 books on communication offered by Amazon have helped to create...and that number does not include seminars, workshops, CD, DVDs, Web sites, and articles.<br /><br />Key Point: Whether devising a campaign to eliminate litter or writing a book about penetrating clutter, ideas must \\"stick\\" to have any visibility and \\"traction\\" to have any impact. I agree with Thomas Edison: \\"Vision without execution is hallucination.\\"<br /><br />My third reason is an entirely personal one: I like to be entertained while reading a non-fiction book about effective communication. The Heaths share their insights with a light, almost playful touch. They seem to have a robust sense of humor. They not only know their stuff, they thoroughly enjoy sharing what they have learned. And they constantly cite sources that have helped them to increase their understanding of \\"why some ideas survive and others die.\\" Three in particular are worth noting here: Robert Cialdini on the importance of using mysteries to reach \\"a higher level of unexpectedness,\\" Robert McKee on the importance of using curiosity to fill the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns, and Gary Klein on how stories \\"illustrate causal relationships that people hadn't recognized before and highlight unexpected, resourceful ways in which people have solved problems.\\" I highly recommend Cialdini's Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, McKee's Story: Substance, Structure, Style and The Principles of Screenwriting, and Klein's Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions and more recent  The Power of Intuition: How to Use Your Gut Feelings to Make Better Decisions at Work.<br /><br />I wholly agree with Chip and Dan Heath that, contrary to what many people may believe, almost anyone can craft ideas that make a difference. \\"And that's the great thing about the world of ideas - any of us, with the right insight and the right message, can make an idea stick.\\" In this volume, the Heaths share all they have learned about how to do that. To paraphrase Henry Ford, whether you think you can or think you can't...you're right.Intuition: How to Use Your Gut Feelings to Make Better Decisions at Work.

1594489505|5.0|Ever since reading \\"The Kite Runner\\" two years ago, I knew I wanted to pick up another book by this extremely talented writer. It's hard to believe someone who can craft words and stories this well is actually a doctor by profession! Few people in this world have that range of expertise, but thankfully, Hosseini does! If you enjoyed his first book, as I did, you'll love this one even more. His two main characters -- both women, interestingly -- are so well developed that the reader feels like she knows them personally. I was choked up several times during the novel, and I am not one who is usually emotional during reading. This man has quite a future ahead of him. Definitely a book to pick up and savor!
B000TX7B5U|4.0|System of a Down has consistently put out stellar albums year after year and I expected no less from lead singer Serj Tankian's solo project.  This isn't like some other solo projects where the album sounds entirely different than the original group's music.  This sounds like a System album.  It has the creative vocals, the mixture of soft/hard rock present in most songs, the unusual song structures, and well-written lyrics that I've come to expect from any System of a Down album.    Serj's solo project is best compared to System's 1998 self-titled debut.  The music and tempo is similar and the vocals are very close (since both albums have little or no vocals from Daron Malakian).  The music is somewhat stripped down from recent System ablums, very few guitar solos.  He does mix in a fair amount of piano to nice effect, which gives this album a different sound.  The message is more political, and left-leaning, than other System records but it is not heavy-handed.  You can enjoy the album without caring about politics.    Serj has done a great job of creating a personal album without making it too different from his previous work.  Any fan of System will love this album.  Even if you have never heard a System of a down song, hard to believe, this is an album well worth picking up.
B000MGUZM0|1.0|I can easily summarize the unoriginality of this album by sharing an email response I received from the band after emailing their web site. I sent them a note telling them that \\"My Body is a Cage\\" is a stolen song, which it is, and they replied in a defensive manner that conveyed I should mind my own business. Based on the fact \\"Funeral\\" only had one inspiring song (and that it was the first track, making it obviously the only song they had initial confidence in), and based on the fact this album shows even less inspiration, it's safe to say the critics who write positively about these guys are as hip-wannabe as U2 is for opening their shows with a lousy track from \\"Funeral\\". It's too easy to jump the \\"hip\\" Arcade Fire bandwagon, and it's too complicated to start a bandwagon for smart, original indie bands such as Low, Nada Surf, and Secret Machines.

B0002IVN9W|2.0|This album is so overrated, and more frustrating is the fact that the only great song on here is greatly overlooked (\\"Tunnels\\").  I will go so far as to say that these guys will never inspire me again, because any time the first song on your first major album is the only good song on the record, chances are you don't have anything more to offer.  U2 must be trying to act hip by playing Arcade Fire before their live shows.

B00005JKLZ|5.0|I love this movie. I thought it was very well done and I loved the special effects. I really loved the part where the time machine travels 800,000 years into the future. I love watching the geo sequence where you get to see thousands of years passing and it's effect on earth. And I loved the future world as well. It's one of my favorite films.
0783231032|3.0|This movie has many of my favourite comedic actors such as Dan Ackroyd and John Candy. It also has the great Toshiro Mifune who starred in the great Akira Kurosawa classics. There is no real plot to speak of. It is simply a series of comedic sketches loosely tied together. The whole movie seems to make fun of the old Japan - US rivalry and the silliness this paranoia instilled in the population (remember the internment camps?). The film is silly and you have to enjoy silliness (like me) if you're going to like it.

Not only is the movie itself one of the best of all times--beautiful music, witty dialogues, clever social critique, excellent actors--but the special features added to this two-disc special edition help us to gain new insight into the process of making the film and, later, recovering it so that future generations may be able to enjoy it too.
0736063684|5.0|I bought 'Strength Training Anatomy' because I am studying anatomy as part of a massage therapy course and because I wanted to improve my weight training routine. This book brings anatomy to the weight room by showing all the muscles in the illustration of a particular exercise pose and highlighting those that are most highly contracted. It illustrates both free weight and machine exercises, showing you how to get the greatest advantage by simple shifts in position or motion.    For example, with large muscles like pectoralis major, you can vary the bench press by shifting hand placement or back placement against the bench to work different aspects of the muscle. It also relates one exercise to another, such as back lat pull-downs, which help build strength in the back in order to due chin-ups more effectively.    There are 115 total exercise illustrations divided into chapters on arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, buttocks, and abdomen. The book also points out typical weight lifting injuries and how to prevent them.    It is the best overall weight training book I have seen. Fine illustrations, precise instructions, and appealing design. Well worth the price for someone just beginning strength training or the experienced weight lifter who wants to know more about the anatomical aspects.
B000UJ48U4|4.0|The Special Edition is a welcome release simply because it's the unrated, European, uncensored version of the film.  I won't begin to review the film itself except to say that it's probably Kubrick's least appreciated and most underrated film--undeservedly so-- I personally think it's just as brilliant as his other works. See it more than once before you decide.<br /><br />That said, the new Warner release has some flaws.  The disk is supposed to contain BOTH versions of the film (unrated and rated), but it ONLY contains the unrated version (better that than just the rated one!). But the packaging says it contains both, so there's a big boo-boo.  Also, it was originally advertised that the film would contain commentary by Sydney Pollack and someone else-- but there is no commentary on the film (and it doesn't say as such on the packaging... so it must have been decided not to include it for some reason).  Nevertheless, it was originally touted in press releases that it would have commentary that I was looking forward to hearing.<br /><br />After that, the extras a excellent and the movie looks great.  But someone at Warner Home Video needs to have a reprimanding!  :)
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I waited and waited for this film to be released in the US, but no dice. But the DVD is fabulous, the acting is great. This a great representation of the story, next to the Thirteenth Warrior. I saddens me that people are going to see this upcoming piece of CGI trash with Angelina Jolie and think \\"WOW that was BEOWOLF\\" I will tell you know that is not Beowolf, that is an xbox game with actors faces in it. What a shame. The only reason it will do well is because of her.   Back to reality here. Beowolf and Grendel is a great story, the dvd has good features, the realistic nature of the movie is worth the price of admission alone. Gerard Butlers one liners are fitting. The historic accuracy of this film is amazing. I have heard people complain about the size of the horses. That part of the world only had ponies at the time. This movie is a cut above.

0735619670|5.0|This is a great book for all programmers, from beginners to experienced. It covers a wide-range of practical topics on producing better code, many of which have been around for years - but were known only by a select few.    The book is very simply wrtten and doesn't attempt to preach - it just provides lots of practical examples of writing better code. You don't need to read it cover-to-cover, just find what you're interested in and it's there.    Given the demands of today's software development environment, namely high-quality code in ever-decreasing timeframes, I recommend this to anyone who is serious about their profession.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|There isn't a song on this CD that you won't like. I've seen Brandi live twice now and all I can say about that is the only thing you'll like better than this CD is a live performance.    The range and strength in her voice is absolutely amazing - comparisons to kd lang and Patsy Cline are apt. But she's not all \\"torch and twang,\\" this girl can rock.    Seriously - if you only buy one CD this year, buy this one.
0525950079|2.0|Well, take this review with a grain of salt since I only read the first quarter of the book then skimmed to see  what happened to the characters. (sure there's rape, destruction and black plague but trust me its reads like a bad tv movie or daytime soap opera)    Okay (deep breath) first off, I am torn to admit this, and I hate to cap on such a tome of work, but this  book has none of the depth and meaning of Pillars.    I believe every author has 1 masterpiece in him; (Follett, Pillars. King, The Stand. Mccammon, Swan Song.  Steinbeck, Grapes of Wrath. you get the picture.  And Pillars was magnificient.  But this one does not even compare. But I am forgiving and will read Follett again, but you should pass on this one lest it ruin your memories of Pillars.  Either I've changed as a reader or he's changed as a writer. Oh well  If you want believable riveting fantasy historical fiction try George RR Martin's series  Sincerely Bookworm the Villain
0743277457|5.0|I was not prepared for the incredible richness and breadth of detail that Master Waitzkin conveys in his Masterpiece, \\"The Art of Learning\\"...so much so, that in order to glean the most from this book, it should be re-read at least once. As a chess player and martial artist myself (although not nearly at the author's level in either!), I can vouch for the authenticity of his descriptions of both his meteoric chess career as well as his phenomenal internal martial arts achievements. The chapter on \\"Building Your Trigger\\" was most fascinating to me, and I am anxious to apply his techniques and recommendations for achieving \\"the Zone on demand\\". The insights from that chapter alone are worth the price of the book, IMHO. His philosophy of Life and Learning are most profound, and he is proof that they work! I firmly believe that if the reader applies the principles laid out in superb detail by Master Waitzkin, he or she can expect to be enriched for the experience! You will enjoy this fascinating book!
006112429X|4.0|An earlier book by the author of \\"The Post-Birthday World,\\" which I enjoyed earlier in the year.  This is an epistolary novel - letters from Kevin's mother to his father that reveal gradually and painfully the history of their family, a family that we know from the outset has been shattered by Kevin's going into school one day and killing a bunch of classmates and a teacher.   The mom is a woman who was conflicted about having children in the first place, and Kevin is a bad seed right from the start of his life.  He is unloving and cruel to others, and the conflicted mom can't seem to make the dad see that Kevin is not just a normal kid going through phases.  Dad maintains (for perhaps too long to be credible to the reader) that Kevin is misunderstood, or a follower rather than an instigator.  As the book builds to the horrific climax and unveils what happened on that fateful \\"Thursday,\\" it unsettles and disturbs - it makes the reader question the effect of lackluster parenting and whether or not any kind of parent creates a monster.  Kevin seems to spring from the womb already imbued and endowed with evil.  I was totally shocked by the ending - didn't see it coming, and thought Shriver was quite skillful at letting out the skein of plot thread to keep things out of sight until just the right moment.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|The gruff voice is at its finest, the signature guitar prominent but not flashy, the songs subdued and sophisticated. I can't shake the feeling that a number of these songs are leftovers from the Shangri-La and All The Roadrunning days, and so they don't always stand up well to those two fine albums. Still, the MK personality and songwriting style is intact, if a bit repetitive stylistically.    The quality of the individual songs varies greatly. \\"True Love Will Never Fade\\" is good, but uncharacteristically underproduced, unfinished. \\"Secondary Waltz\\" should have remained a leftover. But \\"Heart Full Of Holes\\" (his best vocal ever?), Let It All Go\\" (best song on the album), \\"Madame Geneva's\\" (where does he come up with these ideas?) all stand out. And there is no shortage of his odd but compelling lyrics. In fact, the main attraction of this album is its exploration of unconventional slices of life. So if you're a fan, pick it up and make your own judgement.
0743496728|5.0|\\" In nineteen minutes you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes you can bake scones or get your tooth filled by the dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five.... In nineteen minutes you can stop the world or just jump off it. In nineteen minutes you can get revenge\\"    Revenge is all that was on Peter Houghton's mind when he couldn't  take it any more at Sterling High. Sterling is a small town where you would think violence never happens.  But when bullying gets out of control, a shooting changes everyone's  way of living  in the small town.      \\"What do you think was going through his mind?\\"   \\"What could ever make someone do something like this?\\"  \\" Did my son or daughter have any part of what made him go crazy\\"   These are only a few questions that were running through the heads of the people in Sterling.  When Peter starts shooting up the school, Josie Cormier a teenage girl, in the middle of the school shooting could be the most help for everyone and best witness. The only problem is she can't remember what really happened. Alex Cormier the mother of a Josie must sit on the case as the judge assigned to the case. Knowing that her daughter was at the school and was injured she must try the case fairly and not let her feelings get in the way.    Jody Picoult shows a verity of different emotions in her latest book Nineteen Minutes. Nineteen Minutes is a book that explains that bullying may not tolerated by every student; shows how bullying can change everybody's  way of living in a small town.   When this book goes from having you so scared that you don't want to go back to school, to you being in tears because you  realize what can happen to your friends, family, boyfriends or girlfriends, you know that you have found the right book.    I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a sensitive and caring story about something so real, that could happen to anyone, anywhere.    A lot of people will always be fortunate to never have something so horrible and unbelievable happen to they, their kids or other loved ones. Even though many may be this lucky, you should stop and think about what those people who have witnessed or have lost a loved one because of something that could not be stopped.               Picoult's book had me sitting on the edge of my seat saying \\"What's going to happen next?\\". Once I started a chapter I had a hard time putting it down. I talked about this book every night when I got home because this is one of the best books I have ever read. She is an amazing author and will throw in twists that you would never expect to happen. The way she has some of the things written makes you stop and think, what would I do in a situation like that.    Picoult starts each chapter with a blurb such as the following:   \\"Whether or not you believe in fate comes down to one thing: who you blame when something goes wrong. Do you think it's your fault-that if you tried better, or worked harder, it wouldn't of happened: Or do you just chalk it up to circumstances?    I know people who will hear about the people who died, and will say it was God's will. I know people who'll say it was bad luck. And then there is my personal favorite: They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.   Then again, you could say the same thing about me couldn't you?\\"  These blurbs keep you interested and pull you in to each chapter wondering what is going to be on the next page.   The only way that you will ever find out what happened to Peter after his trial is to pick it up the book and not put it down once you start reading.

0440238609|5.0|This and the other His Dark Materials novels rank among the best in the genre, alongside Lord of the Rings, the Gormenghast novels, and others of that stature. You can be sure they'll stand the test of time, and railing against them for their ideas is no less foolish than attempting to hide knowledge in all its forms from your children. Anyone who has read and understood Milton's great Paradise Lost (one of the author's key inspirations) should grasp that folly. Use it as a teaching tool, if you like, but don't give it one star just because your private morality is threatened by its ideas. Of course that's the very kind of zealotry that doesn't fare well in these novels. If there's any reason these novels may not be suitable for younger children, it's only because the second and third novels get progressively more metaphysical and complex--somewhat challenging even for adults. By the way, Amazon sells a gorgeous edition of Paradise Lost annotated by Pullman. I recommend it highly.

190521121X|4.0|For a person like me who is not into making a living on the Internet, this book is a fascinating description of how the business models used by e-businesses such as Amazon, iTunes and Netflix are dramatically different from their pre-Internet equivalents, and the implications of these differences.    For example, a large traditional bookstore such as Borders may have as many as 100,000 titles in stock. But Amazon boasts of well over 3 million! This means that Amazon buyers get a vastly greater choice, and exposure to an enormous number of titles that in the traditional model they would never know about. How does a title get to be included in the Borders 100,000? By selling reasonably well. How does a book get to sell well? In part by being in the Borders 100,000. Some tricky issues there! The Amazon approach democratizes the distribution process.    This in turn can give ideas to all the millions of potential micro-entrepreneurs, sitting at their computers wondering how they might be able to turn a buck from selling their hand-made greeting cards or their collection of second-hand books.    I found this book fascinating because it analysed many of the Internet business phenomena I was aware of but hadn't really thought about. Recommended!

B000N6UERK|4.0|This is a mostly enjoyable movie from start to finish, and having Denzel Washington in the lead is almost never a bad thing.    I've always loved well-done time travel movies (or books, or games) dealing with cause and effect.  Sadly, this movie breaks one of the biggest rules of time-travel movies: it leaves some plot holes big enough to blindly drive a hummer through.  Or, if you want to give the director a little more faith: merely some big loose ends he forgot to tie up.  It's a shame, because this movie otherwise seems very clever, so those gaffes are all the more jarring in comparison.    That coupled with a much-touted car chase that I found a bit ridiculous (the way it was executed in the movie, not the premise behind it) take this from being a great movie to merely an entertaining one.    So, while the plot isn't quite as tight as some others in the genre (like [[ASIN:B0007PALZ2 12 Monkeys (Special Edition)]], it's still an enjoyable movie that I recommend watching if not purchasing.
B000CNESU8|5.0|This really should be on Criterion Collection. A true American classic about the secret war on journalism. Many of the films points still remain current topics of discussion in todays media and posses important political, social and moral questions. As true today as it was then, an inspirational film that will make you get up out of chair, go to the window and scream, \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\" A must see.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|Five thumbs up/*****    Do you want to really KNOW Ludwig van BEETHOVEN?    Rent or buy \\"Copying Beethoven\\" the 2005, 104 minute masterpiece with Ed Harris and Diane Kruger.    This  cinematic adventure is undoubtedly the BEST rendition of van Beethoven (in any media-form) I have ever experienced;...and, I have seen and heard many, many....    Agniesyka Holland's [Hungarian] cinematic-gift to us, reveals van Beethoven's clear  understanding, insight, obedience and love for God....His true dedication to be God's instrument [something not possible of his own].  In van Beethoven words [quoted]\\"music is the closest thing to God.... and to be a composer of music is to be in communion with the Almighty: an enormous, frightening priviledge beyond all comprehension....and certainly NOT to be ever wasted!\\"    For all Catholics, and especially those in-love with van Beethoven, this film must be asorbed into one's being as well! Music burned within him: van Beethoven knew God!
B000OYC7A8|4.0|I hate to rate it like this but...  Just got it yesterday and watched most of it.  Great floyd music as usual- sound is pretty good, but the video SUCKS!!!!!  You would think the concert video people (CMG?) would learn how to film a concert like this for one in HD, and two how to figure out darker/ less light shots.  Since Floyd uses a lot of lighting/lasers, etc, you would think they would have this ready to go.  Apparently not.  The video is extremely grainy.  I have a projector that throws a 110\\" screen and it looks like hell on there.  Even Roger Waters video is much, much clearer.  I am mostly dissapointed because it looks like a great concert, but is ruined by sheety video.  These guys aint gonna be around forever, do you think we could get ONE decent DVD out of them (producers)?
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Mr Spielberg may not have directed but his hand is all over this movie. Tobe Hooper probably went home at night and chastised himself in the mirror for collecting his paycheck and credit.  That aside it is in and of itself one of the scariest flicks I have ever seen with shocks galore and effects that still hold up.  Who can forget the catch phrase of 1982, \\"They're heeeere!\\"!  It still sends shivers up my spine.  Don't watch it alone.  Trust me.
068987474X|5.0|I loved reading this book. It put all of the relationships I've ever had into perspective and contained necessary information I wasn't getting anywhere else. It was difficult to put the book down because the author was so warm and funny. I recommend this book to ALL of my girlfriends!
0767020308|3.0|Good movie - read others reviews of it. I can only comment on the poor, dim, grainy quality of this DVD. Maybe there's a better recorded edition, but this sure wasn't it. Too bad. This 1997 version looks like it was recorded in the 80's.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it isn't nasty ENOUGH.  The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a \\"helpful\\" way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that's the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There's no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.      But don't get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it's super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly & witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn't exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he's faking, we're kinda in on the joke.  We can be \\"amused\\" along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.    The only true \\"dark side\\" to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn't really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter's killings also had.    The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it's probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It's a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar's character is the ultimate example of this.    Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.      So, while the show, to me, isn't perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I think you'll like it a lot.  If the basic premise turns you off...then don't even bother watching!
0375842209|5.0|I only recently heard about this novel while talking with a stranger on the bus about good novels. She highly recommended this especially because I am interested in the lives of ordinary Germans and Jews during the Nazi reign of terror. I was not disappointed. Although it took a little while to get used to the author's writing style, I was totally immersed in this sweet, sad and tragic novel. Don't miss it.
0143038419|1.0|I was quite disappointed with this book.  It may be of interest to women with similar \\"issues\\" as the author, but,for me, it was like trudging through the desert, looking for an oasis (which I never found).    I wish I had known the religious orientation prior to my purchase.  Not my style.
B000J103X4|5.0|not a bad song on the cd....buy it if you truly love him! you won't be disappointed!
B000VT6FAO|5.0|Depeche Mode vocalist Dave Gahan returns to his roots on his sophomore solo disc \\"Hourglass\\". Whilst his solo debut \\"Paper monsters\\" saw him fleeting with a more guitar heavy sound than his Depeche Mode alumnus, this is more electronic than that.<br /><br />More dour and introspective (Gahan co-wrote all the songs, something he hardly did with the group) than the group's sound, the 10 songs cut right to the chase. Touching on subjects such as confusion/doubt over religion, (the haunting percussion free ballad \\"Miracles\\" with lyrics like \\"I don't believe in miracles / and they happen everyday / I dont believe in Jesus / but I'm praying anyway\\"), an industrial sound (the more guitar driven, distorted sounding \\"Use you\\"), and the bass laden \\"Deeper and deeper\\" with snarling vocals.<br /><br />My absolute favourites are opening cut, the hypnotic \\"Saw something\\" (with its buzzing synths, it sounds like a cross between Thom Yorke and eighties Depeche Mode) and lead off single \\"Kingdom\\" (again, lyrics touching on his doubt) with just the right balance of guitar, distortion and electronic effects.<br /><br />Shifting the tempo down is the gently pulsating \\"Endless\\" (with the albums title \\"Hourglass\\" in its lyrics), the dreamy \\"Insoluble\\", while closing the CD is the chiming and swirling melancholic ballad aptly titled \\"Down\\".<br /><br />This is such a beautiful collection of songs, before you realize it, the hourglass is done!!
B000E5N62U|3.0|After two great solo albums with The Nightfly and Kamakiriad, I was somewhat disappointed with this effort. Don't get me wrong, it is an OK CD. But that's all, just OK. And for Donald Fagen, that's disappointing. Nothing really stood out. There was absolutely no WOW factor to be found anywhere. And there were a couple of throw aways including the title track.    Maybe it'll grow on me. But with his previous two solo albums, both grabbed me at first listen. This one did not.    But I still love Donald Fagen's work, solo and with Walter Becker.
B000N3ST7K|3.0|There are one or two songs, maybe three but overall this is a mediocre ride. I must been really high when I saw the movie and decided to order the soundtrack. The first song, Baby it's you by Smith is so poorly recorded it takes some of the magic. Everyone seemed to be praising this soundtrack and like I mentioned above I must have been really out there to follow the hype and the great compliments this soundtrack received. I bought, paid real dollars for it and my conclusion after listening to it twice is: Not Worth the Ride, Nothing to Ride home about it. Some of the songs are cool, I liked Staggolee by Pacific Gas & Electric, of course Jeepster by T Rex is okey but we all know that one has been heard and heard...Down in Mexico I enjoyed and of course, Willie De Ville (are Willie and Mink Deville the same person? they do sound the same). The point is: This is no Killer Soundtrack, it works ten times better with the movie to go along. So I am out of the price of admission and that is the price one have to pay when buying a new CD. From the reviews one would expect one Hell of a Ride instead all I got was one Mediocre Ride! 3 Stars for Death Proof and that is all.
0307387178|5.0|This is an amazing, thought provoking read.I had a hard time concentrating on the details of my daily life because I kept wondering what would happen next to Chris.  I highly recommend this book to any young adult in search of adventure,it will help them to make informed decisions before launching into the wilderness.  Jan M.
0143038583|5.0|I discovered Michael Pollan about ten years ago and happened to pick up his gardening book, \\"Second Nature\\", at a bookstore.  Ten years later, I am still an organic gardener.  His book about building, \\"A Place of My Own\\", was next and it really got me thinking about building and architecture.  \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" will surely change the way my family eats - it's fascinating, well-written, an easy read, and full of facts that will definitely change my life!
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|Troy is a masterful epic and adding back some of the extra footage only makes it moreso. While some of the footage is merely extra violence and nudity (fans of Mr. Pitt's posterior will be pleased), there are some nice character moments, and some extended scenes play far better -- most notably between Priam and Hector (Odysseus benefits as well). If you didn't like the theatrical release of Troy, then this won't win you over, but for any fan of the film, the extended edition is a treat. The extras in the box -- a mini art book, some impressive packaging -- are well done, though the nicest touch is a facsimile of a letter from Brad Pitt discussing his costuming -- but really it's worth it just for more footage. This collection is money very well invested.
0920668372|5.0|I was just looking at the reviews for this book after a friend tried to \\"trade\\" the one she had bought with the newer illustrations with the one that I have in the library. I refused to give up my old copy because the pictures really do resonate much more with the fact that this is a grown man here, not someone fresh out of college. Mother still loves him--no matter if he is 50 or something.     I was so surprised to see just how many people think of this as some kind of \\"creepy\\" book. I'll admit I sometimes read the Amazon reviews simply to find out just how laughable some folks are about their reviews and this was one of those cases. If you want to take everything in the book so literally that you think that Mom would crawl through a window with a ladder, so be it. On the other hand you are one of those who sees that as a metaphor of always caring and loving your son, then this book is truly special and to be enjoyed.
0783225547|5.0|Since I didn't read all the reviews, somebody probably has already pointed this out, but Dantes Peak really doesn't make any pretenses about being a re-telling of the St Helens eruption. Not only is St Helens referred to verbally at least 3 times in the movie, but much of the on location filming took place at St Helens summit and crater. I can say this with confidence as I climbed her back in 2003, and I'd know the view anywhere. They even have a stubborn elderly resident (Linda Hamiltons' mother-in-law) who lives up on the mountain (about the same distance as Harry Truman lived) and refuses to evacuate, thus giving us the indispensable, if not very watered down, Harry truman character. Although the dialogue gets unbearably corny at times, I gave this 5 stars because its great entertainment. The special effects are much better than in 1986's release of St Helens (starring Art Carney as Harry Truman)and I happen to love a good volcano flick and, as the choices are limited, this one is probably one of the best.
B000VT6FAO|5.0|The first three songs on the CD are absolutely awesome: Saw something\\" is a wonderful electronic ballad that starts really slow and ends with a brilliant climax, so that you only want to close your eyes and let yourself fall into the arms of someone else. It is an excellent song and it has been a long time ago, that I have ever heard a song that really captured my heart like this. The second song Kingdom\\" is a great dancetrack and is going to be one of these classic songs. Deeper and deeper\\" is a song where people will have different opinions about: Either you'll hate it or you'll love it. I loved this song from the first tunes. It is smashing, fast, aggressive, evil\\" and great for dancing.     21 Days\\" sounds dark, slow and Dave has a real penetrating voice that sounds extremely sexy and which really turns me on. It reminds me a bit of DM Ultra\\" times. The next song is the ballade Miracles\\" that starts with an electronic sound layer, followed by Dave's striking slow voice and lyrics pointing out what I think and feel too. Use you\\" sounds a bit like former DM songs. It's a great dance track, falling in the categorie nasty, evil, sexy and dangerous\\". Insoluble\\" is a kind of ingenious ballade starting with strong electro sounds that are really exciting, ambitious and diversified.     Endless\\" is the most wicked song on this album. I have never heard some tunes like this before. It starts with some electrobeats which sound like the volume is consistently openend and closed. Dave's voice appears in an extremely resound and hypnotic way. I love this song and I am addicted to it. It's wicked, lush, sexy and a good song for DM partys. A little lie\\" is a wonderfull balade with strong drums and great guitar tones that remind me of very old Simple Minds songs. Down\\" is a condigned last song on this album.     I have never liked Dave's first album Paper Monster\\" that much. But this album is different. I am really impressed by the mature Dave and his extremely intense voice, ofwhich I have the impression, that I have never heard it in this perfect quality ever before. The way Dave sings and in addition his lyrics really capture my heart and my soul. I Thank Dave, als well as Andrew Philpott and Christian Eigner, for this excellent work and I hope to hear more music like this in the near future.    The idea to show the handwritten lyrics in the booklet, instead of just printing them as everyone does, is absolutely lovely. Thus the album gets a more individual character.
B00004XPPE|2.0|I used to think this movie was an incredible one.  The idea of a flight of US bombers being dispatched by mistake to attack Moscow and the desperate efforts by both the US and the Soviet Union to stop them is loaded with high drama.  The movie also has a power cast headed by Henry Fonda.<br /><br />But looking back at this film after serving in the military and government for more than 20 years, the movie is fraught with problems.  For one thing, the film casts the US in the role of (accidental) villain.  If you look on Wikipedia, for something called &#34;Dead Hand,&#34; you'll see it was the Soviets that had something that could have automatically launched a massive missile strike on the US if the computer running it judged that the Soviet Government had been obliterated by the US.<br /><br />Another moment that I found totally unbelievable was the scene where the wife of the man commanding the errant flight of US bombers is brought into the NORAD command center to tell him his mission is a mistake and to beg him to turn back.  The commander of the bomber flight coldly rebuffs her for fear he is the victim of a communist trick.  Come on!  I would imagine that any married couple have intimate secrets between them that no one else could possibly know and that she could use to establish that she was who she said she was.<br /><br />Finally, the ending is totally beyond belief.  Facing the fact that the bombers are about to destroy Moscow, the US President (played by Fonda) tells the Soviets that to &#34;compensate&#34; them for the loss of Moscow, a US bomber will drop a hydrogen bomb on New York City.  And the movie ends with this being done.<br /><br />&#60;if anyone is inclined to get angry because of this &#34;spoiler&#34; I would tell them, &#34;The movie was released almost 50 years ago!!&#62;<br /><br />Set aside the fact that the President of the United States ordered the murder of millions of his own countrymen (including his own wife).  How many people seriously believe anyone in the US military would obey such an insane order.  I'm no longer in the military, but if the President gave me such a crazy command, I wouldn't feel bound by it and I would feel it was my duty to do everything in my power to stop him from carrying out such a mad scheme.<br /><br />Maybe my version of the movie would end in nuclear war.  But the real ending of &#34;Fail Safe&#34; as it was filmed would have been the President and probably everyone in the White House being placed on trial for treason (&#34;levying war against the United States&#34;) if they weren't lynched en masse first.<br /><br />I guess some people would ask:  well, what would you do then?  Well, I might reply that such a scenario couldn't happen.  But if it did, I could see myself telling the Russians that we had made a terrible mistake and would massively indemnify them for the destruction of their capital and would submit to an international inquiry and would be willing to negotiate a mutual nuclear disarmament regime.  Maybe that wouldn't work, but there's no way...none at all...that I would ever see myself doing what the President in this movie does or following his orders.ously believe anyone in the US military would obey such an insane order.

B000P2A256|5.0|This album from Maroon 5 landed on the planet with all the obligatory negative laurels of any sophomoric effort...except that it's excellent.  It's also well-composed, expertly produced, and uncommonly symphonic.     Adam Levine has a voice that is to be loved or hated.  Like Brad Roberts of the Crash Test Dummies, falling in love with - and for some, getting past - the voice grants the primer to the musical labyrinth.     It is what I call, \\"Headphone Music\\".  The subtleties, nuances, and flourishes are best heard upon close-inspection.  The recurring crotale-tone in \\"Little of your time\\" -  a Perfect 5th above the tonal center of the song, ringing within phrases while gently reminding that its symmetry is purposefully asymmetrical - is only one example.    Lyrically there isn't much (for me) to say. Unlike many bands, every syllable has been supplied - even the background vocals and lead repetitions - within the liner notes if you can muster up the 14 bucks to buy it fairly.  I bought it twice.   Like The Godfather part I, this album possesses the best and practically extinct X-factor: Replay Value.    In 1997, Faith No More released an album entitled, album of the year.  A great and clever title for an album it was...I own it...and even the most pedestrian should know of Mike Patton's gumption, weirdness, and his compositional prowess.    Although a decade has passed and there are only a few months left in 2007, this Maroon 5 offering (sorry, Mike) is the Album of the Year.    Chip Webster  Unassociated Press
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|After listening to this album straight through as soon as I got it, I sat there, admittedly, with my mouth wide open. This album, simply put, is a face-melter. It is a rock n' roll freight train that doesn't let up from the shred-fest that is \\"Ties That Bind\\" to the final notes of \\"Wayward One.\\"  It is apparent that the members of Alter Bridge have left \\"that other band\\" in the past and are moving forward. Mark Tremonti's guitar work is some of the best in the business. It's hard to believe, but yes, he is actually getting better. Scary. I loved \\"All That Remains,\\" even if it sounded a little Creed-ish in parts (but hey, I liked Creed...so sue me), but \\"Blackbird\\" is a GIANT LEAP forward.  Personal favorites include the incredibly catchy \\"Buried Alive,\\" the ACDC-esque \\"Coming Home,\\" the straight-up rocker \\"One by One,\\" and the epic title track, \\"Blackbird.\\" \\"Ties That Bind\\" and \\"White Knuckles\\" are like an audible punch to the face...and I don't think I've ever enjoyed being punched in the face as much as this.  All in all, \\"Blackbird\\" is a spectacular sophomore album from Alter Bridge...a catchy rocker that will be in my CD player until it melts.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|This movie has got Drama, Fantasy, Romance, and Comedy; in that order from biggest to smallest. If your looking to see Will Ferrell in another hilarious comedy you wont find it here. He plays Harold; a boring man, whos' life is being narrated by an author writing a book surrounding him. The plot sounds intresting in the begin, but it gets played out after 5 minutes. If you've seen the trailer you have seen just about all the jokes there are to laugh at, the rest are based around taking stabs at classic literature. Thankfully Stranger Than Fiction also stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman who give impressive performances as a baker and a college literature professor. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the movie that I paid $9.75 was the ending. It is the only part of the movie which holds any value, because of its lasts lines which speak about humanity and life. I doubt you will find it fullfilling to set through 105 min of punchlines you can see a mile away just because you love   Will Ferrell.    Closest I have come to walking out on a film  D+
B000SNUMC0|5.0|wow... I never heard of this band before.  I am a Queensryche and Savatage fan and got this recommended to me by amazon and noticed that tim ripper owens was on it so I decided to check it out and boy was I surprised.  with apologies to Tool / A Perfect Circle / Sevendust this album is in my opinion is THE BEST hard rock /  metal album I've heard since I can't even remember... maybe as far back as Metallica's black album.  I'm so excited because I had pretty much resigned myself to listening to Wolfmother if I wanted to hear something new and hard and good again.  This band kicks buttocks so hard that it leaves a footprint and I can almost taste it's bootlaces in the back of my throat.  I went out and bought the greatest hits album and alive in athens and the glorious burden and can't wait to give those a try as soon as I listen to this album again!!!  If you're a fan of Savatage, Metallica, Queensryche, Dio, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, King Diamond, etc. and feel like somethinig is missing in your life because you haven't heard any new music this century that speaks to you, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|One of the best underdog films Ive seen in a while.  No this isn't a happy-go-lucky disney flick, this is the true story of a man just trying to make his life better; fighting for it tooth and nail. Will Smith is liked by just about everyone, but I think he isn't credited enough as an actor. The Pursuit of Happyness really shows off Will Smith's talent with his son as his co-star. The film is a little longer than necessary, but it will really make you appreciate the story. For some people this film will inspire, for some it serve as a reality check, but I think everyone can take something positive away from the picture.    A-

This book was the one that stood out from the rest.  It is nicely illustrated and contains a lot of pictures.  Of all the books I bought, I still come back to this one for information.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|Set in the near future, women are infertile, hope is lost, and the world is going down the drain. If your looking for something fresh, something raw, and original... this film has it. Children of Men is more for the guys, it has action, suspense, adventure, and a sci-fi edge mixed into a cocktail that you will be chugging down.  This film has some of the most amazing filmmaking since the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan. Shot sequences that last up to 5 minutes without a cut will make you feel like a sidekick to the movie's hero (Clive Owen) as bullets fly past your ears. This is a movie your definitely going to have to see in the theaters to get the full experience.    A-
0316067598|4.0|Markus Luttrell's account of his experiences of being trained as a U.S. Navy SEAL, as well as his nightmare he went through in Afghanistan, is told in a very unusual way. His pride as a Texan and member of the military is apparent and at times, it shines through as a bid over the top. But who else would deserve to express this kind of pride?? Someone who hasn't been in his shoes can't possible understand.<br />My hat's up to Markus for not just months and months of grueling training, but also returning to the core of the evil and continuing the battle against the enemy, side by side with his SEAL's brothers after he'd lost his team in an unimaginable encounter.<br />Throughout this book, I learned to appreciate his witty way with words and his humor. I'm glad and amazed that he kept his humor throughout his ordeal.<br />Thank you, Markus, for sharing! And God bless you!<br /><br />Rebecca Lerwill, author of [[ASIN:1933538872 Relocating Mia]]

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney was her best cd out of the 5, in my opinion. This cd has the kind of music I wish Britney would still be making; songs with meaning... substance... not a bunch of dance music about having sex and partying.    This entire album, with the possible exception of \\"Anticipating\\", is 5 stars.
B000UJCALI|4.0|\\"The Shining\\" is one of my all time favorite movies, saw as a little kid and it scared me to death. Years later I watched it again and loved the movie. Many people either love or hate the movie based on the fact that it strays pretty far from the Stephen King novel. The way I see it is like this, the book was incredible, the movie is incredible, they are two seperate things and should be viewed as such. The only problem with the movie is the casting. Nicholson and Duval were both perfect and horrible casting at the same time. Nicholson plays the madman to perfection, but you never see him as a loving father and husband. Duval plays the terrified wife perfectly as well, but you get the feeling she's lived her whole marriage in fear. You don't believe these two would have ever gotten together. Because of this, the first half of the movie is a bit hard to swallow, once she reads what Jack's been writing however, the casting is perfect.    As for this new edition included are two new documentaries about the movie with interviews with crew from the film as well as Jack Nicholson and others who are fans of the film (Steven Spielberg for instance). The docs are interesting to watch and learn about some of the behind the scenes stuff. There is also a piece with Wendy Carlos who did the music for the film. Too bad the soundtrack is not in print, it is by far THE scariest music from a film ever. If you can find a copy somewhere, give it a spin sitting alone in your house at night! Creepy stuff.    A nice upgrade from previous editions of the film.
B000NQR7NO|4.0|Flourescent Adolescent was the song I'd heard that had turned me on to this band. The cd is great. Had heard mixed things about this band how they're all over the place. I love them.  They make me happy. I keep it in the car for the commute.
038533348X|4.0|I'm an avid Vonnegut reader.  Though I have not read all of his novels, I've read many- I would say roughly half, give or take one or two.<br /><br />As you may already know, the premise for the book is that the author is writing a book on the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. Felix Hoeniker.  He ends up learning about a more devastating weapon (if you will call it), Ice-9.  Ice-9 is by far more devastating because it freezes all water immediately upon touch, with the ability to freeze the world if ever exposed to great bodies of water.<br /><br />The book's main focus is on the ugly side of science- Developing new things that create more harm than good, without realizing the consequences.  Another focus of the book is on religion's role in society and in persons' lives and how it affects both.<br /><br />Anyways, I do not wish to give too much away.  To do so would 1) Spoil your read, and 2) Take up too much time.<br /><br />The book is a good read, though not among my favorite Vonnegut books.  However, I attribute this to personal preference, rather than Cat's Cradle being an inferior book.  Indeed, any Vonnegut book is heads and shoulders above much of the rest.  Many people may disagree, but I did not find the many characters to be fleshed out very well in comparison to some of his other works (Bluebeard comes to mind).  Also, comparatively speaking and consistent with my previous statement, I felt that the main characters didn't grow as much as I would've liked (but this is not to say that they didn't grow).  Again, these are my opinions and I'm sure that some, if not many, would disagree.<br /><br />In conclusion, Cat's Cradle is a solid read with clever insight into religion and technology's affect on society, for both good and bad.  If you're new to Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle isn't a bad start, though I would suggest Breakfast of Champions (arguably Vonnegut's most accessible book), Slaughter House Five (his most renowned), Welcome to the Monkey's House (not extra spectacular, but short stories are a good way to see if you like his style), or Sirens of Titan (his most underrated book and tied with another one of his as my favorite).  If you're familiar with Vonnegut, then Cat's Cradle is a very reasonable book to pick up.  Either way, there's a good chance there's something you'll keep with you when you finish Cat's Cradle.d way to see if you like his style), or Sirens of Titan (his most underrated book and tied with another one of his as my favorite).

1401300529|4.0|David Halberstam writes a fitting finale work on one of America's least known engagements, yet one which in 3 years resulted in nearly as many casualties as the much longer Vietnam War.  Halberstam provides the fascinating statistic on the arrangement of libraries into WWII history books and Vietnam history books with one or two Korean histories thrown in.  Halberstam does a great job at showing the political struggles which led to the war and the complex personalities which, in the first year, drove the participants.    I only refrain from giving this a 5 star rating because I believe the book's one weakness is that it stops for all intents and purposes after MacCarthur is relieved of duty. There were still 2 more years of fighting, some of it quite vicious and deserving of much more than a quick glossing over. One stat Halberstam did not reveal is that 1/2 of all Medal of Honor's awarded in the Korean War happened after the lines stabalized.    All in all though a decent work from an author who will be greatly missed.

B000SZLSB2|3.0|Mr. Blunt's first album was full of an intense energy and soul-bearing insight.  You felt his pain (and his joy), and personally I even worried occasionally about his mental health.  Have you *seen* that glint he gets in his eyes when singing \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" live?  It's rare that an album has more than one or two great songs, and Blunt's debut had three (\\"You're Beautiful,\\" \\"High\\" and \\"Goodbye My Lover\\").  They're in my car, on my Treo, stacked next to my CD player at home and pretty much anywhere else I listen to music.<br /><br />It was a tough act to follow.  And \\"All The Lost Souls\\" doesn't quite match his earlier work.  It's too, well... upbeat!  The first album may have sounded like indie singer-songwriter rock, but the soul was all blues.  \\"All The Lost Souls\\" has some catchy songs, and is not in any way irritating to listen to.  It just lacks the intensity and depth of his debut work.<br /><br />If you're a fan, then buy it, just don't expect to be as addicted to it as his earlier album.  I know I'm not.  I'm already eagerly awaiting number 3.  A couple more years in the tabloids and maybe he'll have enough material to regain some of that angst-ridden power which permeated his first album.
0307387178|5.0|The cover tells the story; a young dreamer from a well-to-do family gives away his money and possessions before trudging into the Alaskan wild on a quest for spiritual awakening.  Four months later, his body is discovered by moose hunters.   The plot of Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild can be reduced to those few words, so why has this simple story inspired readers to trek twenty miles into the unforgiving wilderness to visit his final resting place?  Why has he become the center of a cult-like mythology and the genesis of 2007's most ambitious biopic?  Of those who read his story or see it on screen, some will understand, while others will simply judge him.  Whether there exists within the reader a connection to the natural world, a desire to discern the boundaries of mankind's ability to survive in a perilous environment and a hunger for incorruptible truth and sometimes painful honesty will play heavily into the reward/enjoyment of his story.      Chris McCandless never outlived the phase many young adults experience in their years after college or high school when they first realize the ugliness of the world.  By tracing the last years of his life, Krakauer depicts McCandless as wide-eyed and childlike, as he holds to a simplistic belief that people just need to be good to each other to make the most out of their short time on earth.   But with his Holden Caulfield-like epiphanies about the deceit and phoniness of the world, he is drawn to the one place he knows he can find truth: the wild.          On his odyssey tramping throughout the West, McCandless encounters a Homer-like string of splendid characters.  Like his own search for the meaning of \\"rosebud\\", Krakauer allows those closest to the young vagabond fill his pages with their anecdotes and reflections.   Although their experiences are different, they all describe him as an unforgettable stranger who wandered into their lives and didn't stay long enough.      By practicing his \\"love one another\\" approach tolife, McCandless inspired those who met him and continues to inspire those who read about him 15 years after his death.  The great tragedy of his life is that someone who had such an impact on those he encountered spent most of his time with Tolstoy, Thoreau and London.   But by illustrating how those men were with the dying romantic in his last days, Krakaeur shows us that many of his readers will carry Chris McCandless with them until their end.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I remember seeing this film in theatres the day it came out. I am a huge Star Wars fan, not some weirdo who dresses up in SW costumes, but someone who truly holds a special place in their heart for the original three films. After seeing this movie back when it was released, I remember being utterly dissapointed by it. I also couldn't think of another film that was single-handly ruined by one single character like this movie is. Yes, Jar Jar Binks has to be the worst character, not only in the Star Wars universe, but in any film ever! Trust me, he's that bad. He ruins the movie completely. And he's not even a minor character, he has more screen time than Obi-Wan and Darth Maul! Give me a break Lucas. This is really a kids movie, very childish in so many ways.     I just bought the DVD's of the all three prequels the other day. They were on sale. I watched Phantom Menace last night and my thoughts are still the same. Everytime a scene would become interesting it was quickly ruined by horrible dialogue or acting, or Jar Jar would walk in. Perhaps the most intense scene of the movie, the Darth Maul/Jedi fight, if absolutely ruined by cutting the scene back to Jar Jar stumbling around.     This movie was the biggest letdown. Yes, I was expecting a lot, but this is a really bad movie on its own, not connected to the other three films. The SFX were the only thing worth noting with this horror show. George Lucas should be ashamed of himself. This movie has a terrible plot, horrible acting, even worse dialogue, and almost NO character development. Don't waste your time.
B00005JPWF|5.0|*SPOILER WARNING* If you know nothing of this story, nearly all reviews give away the \\"ending\\".  Therefore, if you don't want to know anything about the plot of the film, don't read any reviews...including this one.<br /><br />The book's cover tells the story; a young idealist from a well-to-do family gives away his money and possessions before trudging into the Alaskan wild on a quest for spiritual awakening.  Four months later, his body is discovered by moose hunters.  Christopher McCandless' story can be reduced to those few words, so why do readers of Jon Krakauer's book about McCandless trek twenty miles into the unforgiving wilderness to visit his final resting place?  Why has he become the center of a cult-like mythology and the inspiration for Sean Penn's graceful biopic?<br /><br />Like Krakaeur, readers of \\"Into the Wild\\" and other people who have heard of McCandless' story on television, in newspapers or around a crackling fire surrounded by wanderers, Penn became bewitched by the young man so certain of the redemptive power of natural purity, self reliance and isolation that he cast off his worldly possessions after an impressive academic career at Emory University and tramped throughout the Western US.  Unlike judgmental critics who can't understand the longing within McCandless to explore a life of innocence untouched by the trappings of society, Penn felt the same desires within and set out to capture the story on screen.  Even those who dislike Penn (count me among you) should see within him many of the same idealistic, uncompromising traits of McCandless and the same subtle disappointment at the world for not sharing his aesthetics.<br /><br />Penn's film is a remarkably consistent adaptation of Krakauer's work.  But just like the book, the film will receive mixed reviews from audiences.  Some people simply can't (or won't) listen to McCandless.  Whether there exists within the viewer a connection to the natural world, a desire to discern the boundaries of mankind's ability to survive in a perilous environment and a hunger for incorruptible truth and sometimes painful honesty will play heavily into the reward/enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Chris McCandless never outlived the phase many young adults experience in their years after college or high school when they first realize the ugliness of the world.  Penn's film traces the last years of his life, showing his hero to be wide-eyed and childlike, as he holds to a simplistic belief that people just need to be good to each other to make the most out of their short time on earth.  On his odyssey tramping throughout the West, McCandless encounters a Homer-like string of splendid characters.  But even with a string of rewarding relationships with people who view him with a aura of mysticism, a Holden Caulfield-like epiphanies about deceit and phoniness of the world draws Chris to the one place he knows he can find truth: into the wild.<br /><br />FILM DIFFERENCES/STRENGTHS<br />The most obvious difference in the book and the film is the \\"suspense\\" created by holding off his death until the end.  While the book is an investigation into a dead man (although we see him certainly as a very vivid and vital dead man), the film keeps him alive until the very end.  Viewers unfamiliar with the story may wonder why the tale is even being told, especially when it seems he is about to walk to safety.<br /><br />I don't consider myself among the \\"the book is always better\\" crowd, because I think the film medium allows for unambiguous depictions of images, scenery, etc.  I was unfamiliar with the Lake Mead canyons where he kayaked or the channels that floated him into Mexico.  No description in a book could help me see those things like the film does.  Penn also takes advantage of a great device where he uses uncomfortable camera angles and quick, jerky cuts whenever Chris is in a city and juxtaposes them with spectacular views from some of the more beautiful stops of Chris'life.
B000R7GKQE|3.0|I watch season one on disc obssessively!  It is amazing.  I mean, it's not the best acting, but the cinematography is gorgeous, the boys are simpathetic characters, and the plots are interesting, neatly scripted, and well executed.<br /><br />It seems like in season two, however, the producers are trying too much.  They introduce several new characters (including several new white female characters and bad-guy black male characters), who then slip out of subsequent shows; the boys each get to become evil -- threatening to kill each other or \\"innocent\\" humans; and they are placed in greater and greater harm from the demon world.  The writers pay occasional attention to the \\"Sam is a gifted psychic sought by 'the' demon plot.\\"  But this comes and goes -- but it does resurface at the end of the season for a great finale.  During the course of the season, however, the boys steal cars, get arrested, lie, and become fugitives from the law; and a demon-possessed Sam abuses Jo and threatens to kill  her -- but we are supposed to think of them as sympathetic.  I understand that they are trying to shake the \\"good boy\\" image and spice things up a bit, but the changes are quite sudden and are a bit taxing.<br /><br />Some themes are also repeated too much.  They repeat the \\"devil's trap\\"/exorcism story several times (it started with Meg in season one, and then Dean tries it with a demon and Bobby tries it with a possessed Sam).  They test the \\"Sam is weak, but Dean is callous\\" theme again and again.  Things also become unnecessarily bloodier and bloodier.  Their guns now shoot bullets more often than rock salt...and I witnessed more stabbings this season than the first.<br /><br />Despite the criticisms, there are some awesome episodes.  I really like the one where they are chasing a \\"ghost\\" with a woman, who believes the ghost has killed her husband.  In a plot twist, she is a ghost herself.  It was a touching episode. The season finale is awesome, and the episode with the bad cop  haunted by a murder victim has some great suspense in it.<br /><br />I love this show and hope it stays on tv as long as possible....I just hope they streamline the plots again.  Sometimes less is best.  Just ask the X-Files fans.urder victim has some great suspense in it.

Watch Thorton walk amidst a flurry of raw cotton in a 19th century cotton mill while the overvoice of Margaret sadly states that she has learned that the color of hell is white.  Oh yes--Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe are perfect!

B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is my all-time favorite TV show! Every episode makes for riveting viewing, and the great casting makes all the difference...the drama centers around the life and exploits of single mother Lorelai Gilmore [the amazing Lauren Graham] who raises her only child Rory [stunning Alexis Bledel]in the idyllic town of Stars Hollow, somewhere in Connecticut. Its an amazing drama...every episode here in Season One makes you really come to know and love the characters, both main and secondary. We come to care about what happens to Lorelai & Rory...in Season One, 16 year old Rory gets accepted into the prestigious private school Chilton, and Lorelai has to grapple with the problem of how to finance it, and out of desperation approaches her estanged parents for help. The chemistry between the two leads as mother and daughter is electrifying and altogether credible...Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore are portrayed as stuffy, upper-class people who use money as the means to keep tabs on their daughter and granddaughter. Of course, the stories go deeper than that, and the characters themselves develop in greater depth as the series goes on...but herein lies the chram in Gilmore Girls...the dialogue, witty repartee and stellar acting from all characters make this a show that grows from strength to strength and makes an addict of the viewer.<br /><br />The residents of Stars Hollow are an eccentric bunch indeed - be it Luke of Luke's Diner, Ms Patty the dance teacher, Taylor the town councilman,Michel the crabby concierge, Sookie St James the irreverent cook and BFF of Lorelai, Lane Kim as Rory's sidekick - we come to love each of these characters for their role in the series.<br /><br />Watching these episodes is like a reunion of old friends - and every fall, I rewatch the seasons of Gilmore Girls, and get the feeling that I'm part of something special and magical, a feeling like I'm truly home. A must-watch series, and highly recommended.

0385473788|5.0|Like most American school kids I was assigned this book to read as a teenager and was amazed by the experience of Anne Frank.  I decided to revisit the book and found that Otto Frank (her father) had republished the book with about 30% more content.  Apparently, he had taken a lot of criticism for his heavy editing of Anne's original manuscripts and there were accusations of the whole book being a forgery.  Extensive research by the Dutch government has concluded that the diary was authentic, and Otto decided to introduce material that he had first omitted for obvious personal reasons.<br /><br />All I can say is \\"wow\\".  The book that was once sort of a documentary of the Frank family confinement is now a facinating study of a young woman's developmental psychology.  Anne was a great writer, and great observer of human nature.  She was also acutely aware of her own development and evolving feminine nature.  In the definitive edition we now see a young woman going through puberty and her developing sense of sexuality, and self exploration.  I know that this would be controversial as her father obviously understood it would be, and he ommitted these passages in the original book.  However, her relationship to her family and the 17 year old boy named Peter who became her first love and was also confined with them is really interesting.<br /><br />I think Anne's diary has obviously stood the test of time in becoming one of the great published works of western civilization.  I am glad that her father also decided to republish her work including things that would have been tough to accept like her anger at her mother, and her relationship with her boyfriend.  Her diary is a classic.  God bless Anne Frank.  She was an amazing young lady.
B00005JL96|3.0|This movie is a great tool for teaching children the meaning of \\"deus ex machina\\".    There is quite a bit of build-up in the struggle of Lilo's sister to prove that she is a worthy caretaker for her much younger sister. She consistently tries but can't quite get it right, thanks in no small part to Lilo herself. And just when things look the bleakest, we get a \\"just kidding!\\" end.    The trouble is that things got to a point where there was no other way to resolve the plot with a happy \\"family stays together\\" ending. It left me asking what the point of all the build-up was. Because, happy or not, there's no getting around the fact that the ending was a cheat.
6305736650|5.0|What can one say? This is the ultimate movie ever made and it does get better with each viewing. Watching it four or five times a year always evokes a freshness in me to the plot and the character development is always remarkable. I never tire of it.   Even as I think of it now, I want to watch it. You truly cannot say that about many films that have ever been made. To think that this movie was never really intended to be a classic, yet has become one is in itself remarkable. Casablanca has intrigue, sublime action and a sensual quality between the characters that all come together and make it my favorite movie.

014118213X|5.0|It's hard to say enough about this book. Forster's novel about the tortured relations between three families and the struggle for ownership of a house is a fundamental tale -- maybe THE fundamental tale -- of class relations in England before the First World War.    The basic plot is so well known, there is no point in repeating it here. But the book is incredibly rich. Forster's depiction of the arriviste commercial bourgeoisie, the monied intelligentsia, and the threatened lower class is incredibly insightful. The manner in which he details their lives, loves, socialization, aspirations, and mentalities tells us more than any traditional history book could.    The writing is lithe and even comical. Forster's witty asides and factual embellishments impress and enhance the text rather than distract from it. It is a brilliant book, both in content and style. It is a must-read for any lover of English literature or history.

B00009AOBI|5.0|My friend and I went to go see Les Dudek play at a club in Arcadia, CA in September.  In between songs he was telling us about him being close to Arcadia during the filming of \\"Mask\\".  And by the way, they released a \\"Directors Cut\\" which had more footage of him in it...which he really liked! ha!<br />Well I got home the next day and ordered the Directors Cut.  I've seen the movie before.  But having seen what the movie was like in it's original form and what we got shoved down our throats.  I was kind of pissed.  You know...money sometimes IS the root of all evil.  Because of money...they turned what was a much better film with a damn good soundtrack.  And turned it into a commercial success.<br />IF...it came out as it was with the Bruce Springsteen soundtrack...MAN!  It may have gotten more than just the award for best make-up that year.<br />Some great scenes that were not in the original movie that really give it a little more kick.<br />And of course Les playing more!

B000005JA8|4.0|Introduced to the record TROUT MASK REPLICA over 30 years ago, I hated it, though I soon after bought and enjoyed my own copy of SHINY BEAST (BAT CHAIN PULLER).  Decades later, I'd found myself triangulating the problem of TROUT MASK REPLICA by first discovering and loving all of CAPTAIN BEEFHEART's records released immediately before and after TROUT MASK: SAFE AS MILK, STRICTLY PERSONAL and LICK MY DECALS OFF, BABY.  Having a clue how far the CAPTAIN could push the conventions of popular music, my technique proved successful, for TROUT MASK REPLICA is not for the novice.<br /><br />Sometimes disturbing (\\"Dachau Blues\\") or jaw-droppingly insightful and funny (\\"Ella Guru\\") or horrbly ugly and funny (\\"Bill's Corpse\\") or weird and weirder (\\"Neon Meate Dream Of A Octafish\\") and even kind of lovely (\\"Pachuco Cadaver\\") this record is much more interested in challenging than entertaining its listener.  Though it is exhausting, I immediately found some cool Blues on TROUT MASK REPLICA.  \\"China Pig\\"  sounds like a monaural prison-made recording, by a one-off lost 1930s artist with mesmerizing guitar and bizarrely authentic vocal (JOHN LEE HOOKER would seem to be the inspiration).  Or \\"Moonlight In Vermont\\" which rocks harder than any artist I've listened to (and that's not a few) and incorporates an old spiritual on acid soaked guitar: \\"Gimme that old time religion, gimme that old time religion...\\"  Or the catatonic \\"Veteran's Day Poppy,\\" which for two minutes almost sounds conventional borrowing its riff from \\"Sweet Leilani\\" y'know, \\"...heavenly flower...\\" but then devolves into a compellingly monotonous, typically atonal riff.<br /><br />I couldn't listen to all of TROUT MASK REPLICA in one sitting because I found it overwhelming, so I listened to it in chunks... and liked the results much better.  Now I have to admit I love much (but not all) of this record, but still listen to only portions at a time.  I like all of CAPTAIN BEEFHEART's records, but this is not his best, and a bit indulgent, though in hindsight, necessary.  It is an extremely difficult record for even the most diehard music fan, in some instances an education you may not be ready for, but there really are reasons for TROUT MASK REPLICA's reputation, and one of the reasons is actually great music !!<br />BTW: \\"...The breeze blowin' up me ...'n up the canyon... far as I could see...\\"dulgent, though in hindsight, necessary.

B00005A46U|5.0|Caravan is such a beautiful band. Not to mention a forgotten one. One listen to \\"If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You\\" will probably win you over with its catchy vocal melodies and instantly enjoyable 70's good-time atmosphere. These guys knew how to write music and make the songs memorable for just about anyone to enjoy, of all ages. Sometimes I think the band was influenced by the Mamas and the Papas, but you know, that's probably not true. I doubt the two artists ever came in contact with each other.     I'd put these guys right up there with Procol Harum and the Moody Blues when it comes to writing satisfying vocal melodies that catch your attention the first time you hear them. It's a special feeling for a special band. Don't even worry about how long some of these songs are- the melodies flow into each other with such ease and instant satisfaction that it probably wouldn't even matter if these songs were twice as long. Some of the flute playing is really nice, but for this release, it's the vocals that make me love it. Pick it up today. By the way, the album cover reminds me of an early Paul McCartney and the Wings album. I love it, and it reminds me of the hazy, forest-like dreams these kind of melodically atmospheric songs usually create.

But I wasn't. I was expecting fun, clean, romantic fluff. And in what I expected (and wanted!) it delivered. Wow, did it deliver. It was incredibly fun, and the romance worked for me. (By, \\"worked for me,\\" I mean actually gave me the little romantic butterflies. A lot.) I wished it were longer, but that was really my only complaint. I thought it was well written (I read a whole lot and poorly written books really bug me), and very, very fun.
B000MGBRHC|5.0|A refreshing change from all the so called new metal/hard rock out there today! At a time where all the new music of this type is either overshadowed by a screaming banshee singer or someone who sounds like they have guttural laryngitis Volbeat is definitely a welcome breath of fresh air! Nice upbeat tempo to most of this CD and very tight musicianship. Lots of \\"crunchy\\" guitar work reminiscent of Metallica's Black CD to Reload days throughout. \\"Radio Girl\\" is a nice tribute to the 50's and I love the country intro to \\"Sad Man's Tongue\\" For an adrenaline rush \\"Devil or the Blue Cat's Song\\" \\"A Moment Forever\\" or \\"You or Them\\" will do it for you.  I was surprised that I liked this CD as much as I did because Volbeat doesn't seem to care about guitar solos. Singer Poulsen has a unique flavor to his singing that is, yes, kind of like old Elvis but on a speed rush. The band is out touring Europe right now and I hope someday to see them live in the U.S.  Check out this CD and play it through a few times. It takes a few plays to fully appreciate the different approach Volbeat takes but you'll quickly become a fan like I did.

B000GY729M|3.0|There are 2 GREAT songs on this record, \\"Bling\\" and \\"Read My Mind.\\"  This album definitely shows the artists are growing.  Sometimes it sounds like the lead singer, Brandon Flowers, is imitating someone else (Bruce Springsteen especially.)

Most instructions are simple enough for novice bakers yet the finished products are nothing short of spectacular & delicious.  The richly complex & intense flavors offered up by such basics as chocolate chip cookies are mind blowing.  Colleen has carefully shaped these receipes in such a way that the elimination of dairy products does not compromise them one bit.  The beautiful pictures & high quality of the publication makes it worth owning if only to browse through.  This book is a must for any baker at any level.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|What can I say?     There is a moment in the concert when all the other band members are just staring with their mouths wide open at David Gilmour's guitar... he's a genius and this concert DVD was well worth the wait.    David Gilmour is and forever will be the greatest guitar player there is on the face of this planet.

B000002LR3|2.0|I can appreciate Screamadelica's influence and its place in musical history, but influential does not always equal good.<br /><br />At first, I thought this album was completely awful.  However, repeated listens have softened my view on Screamdelica. It is not awful, not by any stretch of the imagination. But neither is it good. It's just kinda....blah.  You can play this CD softly while entertaining friends and it will offend no one. But no one will ask you, \\"Who is this? This is great!\\"<br /><br />Onto the tracks:<br /><br />Movin' On Up - Sounds like a warmed-over version of George Michael's  \\"Freedom\\". I did like the guitar stabs throughout, though.<br /><br />Slip Inside This House - Let the dance party begin. I have a feeling this one would have thinned the dance floor, however. But it wouldn't have cleared it altogether, so points in its favor.<br /><br />Don't Fight It, Feel It - I WILL fight it! I'm sure it was ahead of its time in '91, but now it sounds like any techno/house number I can hear in any Bally's JazzerFunk exercise class. Influential? Sure.  Dated?  Absolutely not. Good? Well, let's just say not my cup of tea.<br /><br />Higher Than The Sun - Eh. Yes it's trippy and dazzling, but not especially moving. After a while the music loses all impact here and becomes background music. Pleasant, though.<br /><br />Inner Flight - Should be called Inner Nap. This song does make terrific ambient music in the kids' room at night time, though. My two little ones were out like a LIGHT, so it's a nice children's aid.<br /><br />Come Together - Too. Long.  While I am a big fan of the concept of repetitive groove, there's nothing interesting about this track to begin with. It's light and airy and does not gain any power throughout. And it goes for 10 minutes. Give me the Stone Roses' \\"Fools Gold\\" every time.<br /><br />Loaded - The Peter Fonda sample is awesome, and overall this is the best of the dance tracks on here. This is a different kind of bedroom song, and for all the right reasons.<br /><br />Damaged - Best track on the record. Very cool and the guitars throughout are a fantastic touch.<br /><br />I'm Comin' Down - We're back to the slow fade into the Background Music, made worse by that annoying sax.<br /><br />Higher Than The Sun (A Dub Symphony In Two Parts) - One of the first 12-inch remixes, if I'm not mistaken. Either way, we're back to one of the precursors of house, \\"trip-hop\\", and that just isn't my thing.<br /><br />Shine Like Stars - The album ends with a whimper. I appreciate the psychedelic feel the band was going far with this track (and most of the record), but it failed to move me.<br /><br />I could never underestimate the enormous cultural influence this album had on music (bigger, in fact, than Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", which came out in the same year, I believe?). But was that influence for the greater musical good? I say no, and I also say \\"Screamdelica\\" doesn't even approach the greatness of the Stone Roses' first album. Oh well, to each his own.<br /><br />But I will keep it as well for our next dinner party.ery cool and the guitars throughout are a fantastic touch.

B000UJCALI|5.0|I just viewed the new re-release of The Shining, if you are a fan of this movie it's a must own. The picture looks amazing, the colors and contrast are just beautiful. The new aspect ratio looks very sweet. The soundtrack also sounds great...I can't wait to listen to this on an expensive stereo system, even on my tiny tv speakers I could hear alot more clarity and nuances, especially the voices echoing through the Overlook Hotel.  I loved the extra featues as well, lots of insightful interviews intertwined with cleverly re-editid clips from the movie.  The commentary was fascinating, it was great learning about the meticulous attention to detail Kubrick used on this film.  If you love this movie, treat yourself and buy it. If you've never seen it before, then now is the time to see it!
B000000YNZ|5.0|Evans is peerless when it comes to jazz ballads, to my ears, and here's a full album of his mellow mastery.<br /><br />Moonbeams is perfect for those who love quiet, introspective music, and is superb background sound for dimming the lights and so on. It is also much more than that. Evans' genius is his inchoate ability to invest almost endless emotion in his work.<br /><br />All the listener need do is let the notes and harmonies flow in, and the spell is cast; there is deep feeling on this record, and many unique meloodic and harmonic choices. Re: Person I Know and Moonbeams are just two of the highlights from an album with no weak spots. Evans had a fine rhythm section here; Motian is a fabulous brush player, and Israels fills La Faro's sadly empty shoes more than credibly.<br /><br />Producer Keepnews made a wise choice in recording uptempo numbers at this session to balance to mood, and in putting them together on How My Heart Sings, another fine Evans album. His best call was making sure we had at least this one album of all ballads by a man whose magical touch and translucent soul create lush tapestries of blissful relaxation.<br /><br />This is quietly creative jazz at its finest.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|If you grew up with the Irish Civil War a constant part of the evening news, you don't want to miss this movie.  James Nesbitt (Jekyll) portrays an Irish member of Parliament who is trying to make peace between the IRA and the British Government.  A peaceful rally goes bad, and the horrors of the conflict come to life.  The way it was filmed (hand-held cameras) lend an air of reality and the incredible sadness.  This movie is based on actual events that took place in Ireland during that time.  It held my attention the entire time.  Highly recommended.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|I am an old school Eddie Vedder fan and although it's been years since I've listened to him, that remarkably familiar and beautiful sweet baritone vibrato was easily recognizable while in the theater, seeing this amazing film for the first time.  This collection of songs is deep, beautiful, and moving, as it links the story of a tragic young life to the film.  I only know of a few truly great albums that tell a story from beginning to end, and it gives such a human connection to the music you're listening to.  Eddie Vedder is, in my opinion, as good as he's ever been.
0143038419|5.0|This really is 3 books in one.  The first section is beautifully written and it is so interesting to read about the Italian culture.  I can only imagine how difficult it must be to move to a different country, with a different language and a different culture.  The author excels at this and has wonderful stories about the people she met and the food she ate.  But in between the lines, this truly is about her slowly healing herself after her divorce, but before she can accept what happened and deal with it in a productive way.    The second section is completely different and I almost found it hard to believe it was by the same person.  I am not a very religious person and found some of the discussions about God a little uncomfortable, but the writing made it seem almost magical.  I have always wondered what it would be like to go to an Ashram in India and it is something so many of us never knew existed.  The parts I liked the most were her interactions with the wonderful people she met and their thoughtful suggestions in helping her face her divorce and failed relationships head on and accept them and heal.    The third section we see the author as much more free-spirited and we can almost feel her happiness and her almost completed healing.  Her descriptions of Bali make me want to travel there.  Her life there is filled with wonderful people and we see her hesitantly falling in love.      When I was finished reading this book, I felt lost and wanted more.  It may be one of my favorite books.  I liked that it gave me interest in things and places I hadn't thought about.  I liked that it provoked thought and healing for me from my past failed relationships.  I liked that sometimes there were things I disagreed with because it provoked thought.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially those who have ever looked back on a failed relationship and felt the tremendous burden of guilt and blame.
B000002L6P|5.0|After her classic debut, there must've been a lot of speculation about whether or not Madonna could make something as great or better again, as it has been proven over the years that many artists don't. Not Madonna. Arguably her best album and certainly no worse than her debut, it contains four of her most signature songs, \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Angel\\" and the absolutely classic title track. All of these are some of the most exemplary pieces of 80s pop, and the world would have been much different (not in a good way) without them.    Warning: If you loved this album in the 80s, stay away from the 2001 remastered version. It sounds considerably different that what you've probably come to know and love over the years.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|The movie and soundtrack are excellent.  I was very surprised, and impressed.  Cool story.  Great visuals.  Music will blow you away.
0440418569|1.0|I'd like to note I listened to the audiobook, but it's the same thing.<br /><br />First off, let's get the religion part out of the way.  Yes it slams organized religion, of which I am a part, but whatever.  Not as huge of a deal as people make it out to be, since it pretty clearly states that the enemy is not the 'Creator'.<br /><br />I do not know how anyone can give this five stars and title their review 'satisfying conclusion to trilogy', 'best out of three', etc.  The last chapters in a book, let alone the last book in a trilogy, should answer some questions to even a small extent.<br /><br />To really get started, the title of the book is 'The Amber Spyglass'.  Usually when you title a book, you title it with some sort of plot point/device, or intriguing element that vaguely, minutely, but importantly plays into the overall plot.  Examples would be 'Northern Lights' (where characters saw the possible other worlds) and 'The Subtle Knife', which we all know how important that was.  But the Amber Spyglass, the actual device, plays hardly any function in the series; it has no impact.  In fact, neither did Dr. Malone, to be honest.<br /><br />Which brings me to the next point: the mulefa.  Sure they were interesting, and when I first came upon them I thought 'this could be cool for her to pick up some information over a few chapters to hand over to Lyra'...but Dr. Malone was with them the entire book.  The way her plot line alternated with Mrs. Coulter's and Will and Lyra's really bogged the story down, and honestly, served no purpose.  The disruption of the world/Dust could have been told in a much better way, perhaps by an Angel, like Metatron himself.<br /><br />Oh Metatron.  He's not the Creator, but he's not even the Authority.  He's like, third in 'command', and is taken down by two humans and two daemons.  Why was he so big and bad?  Doesn't make sense.  The battle has no clear sides, and no outcome that had any lasting impact.  Why even discuss the Authority is hiding somewhere?<br /><br />Will and Lyra save the world by 'true love' and their sacrifice to not see each other again...according to some reviewers here.  Hello?  The kids are 12-13 years old.  THEIR 'true love' saves the universe(s)?  You have to be kidding me.<br /><br />The outcome of the worlds is not discussed, nor the battle with Heaven.  There were no clear sides or victors, and as much as I don't want to harp on this, it seems the whole point was to allow Pullman to kill 'God', since there was really no point to this at all.<br /><br />I was really interested in how Lyra would be the next 'Eve' and she had a 'choice' and would be 'tempted' and a 'tempter'.  NONE of this comes to fruition.  I don't believe leaving the window closed was a choice, because this has no 'Eve-ness' and Will was also involved in the decision.<br /><br />Important characters that you think will have impact just die, for no reason.  This isn't even like Harry Potter's someone-dies-because-it-is-realistic, it is they just are walking along and fall off a cliff and die.  This was really evident with the Father [Gomez?] who was to kill Lyra.  He doesn't even get to them to cause any sort of suspense, he just dies and doesn't cause any antagonism.<br /><br />What happens to Will and his mother?  Lyra relearns to read the aleitheometer?  For what purpose?  Whoopie, they saved the ghosts in the World of the Dead (another pointless jaunt)?  What is REALLY the point of Dust and its origins?  Daemons remain unsatisfyingly mysterious (read as: unanswered).<br /><br />It could have been much better, but collapses under its own weight, which is funny for the lack of substance compared to the previous two.Lyra save the world by 'true love' and their sacrifice to not see each other again...according to some reviewers here.

B000E5ELW4|5.0|Mythological professional killer vs detective.<br /><br />Mythological in the sense that he has a fancy name tying in to the history surrounding that particular assassin.<br /><br />In this case, some perhaps not so nice people want a French leader removed, and haven't managed it themselves, so they bring in an outside expert.<br /><br />On the other side is a detective trying to track him down.<br /><br />An excellent example of tense spy thriller writing of the time, by one of its foremost proponents.

B00005JPFH|5.0|I have enjoyed all three of the movies. I do think that some things could have been done better, or at least differently, but they are all three excellent movies. I completely do not agree that this was the worst of the three. I liked the fact that there were so many for Spidey to battle. It made the movie full of action and faster paced.      All those who criticize this one so harshly need to remember that this is a comic book super hero movie. It is not nearly as bad as they claim it to be and in fact is excellent! The absolute worst super hero movie of late is HULK. That was a real stinker. This third Spiderman movie is as good as the other two. The stories are pretty well thought out and put together very well. I do not think the acting was bad at all in any of the movies either. They all seem to stay true to the comic books spirit. I can't wait to get the third one added to my collection.

0525950079|4.0|Pillars of the Earth was a wonderful book and nearly anything Follet would have written in sequel would have likely suffered by comparison. However, we deserved a better effort than Follet ended up offering us. This book contained so much gratuitous sex and its characters possessed so many modern sensibilities that at the end of the day the world Follet crafted in \\"World Without End\\" lacked the compelling verisimilitude of his superb \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  It just had a much more \\"pulpy\\" feel to it than POE but due to his energetic writing style the story never boggs down.    The story is a reasonably good one, particularly if you don't mind a bit of a rehash of POE, but it is not nearly as irresistible as his first novel, and suffered from story line and character similarities. The lack of originality and constant echoes from Follet's POE detracted from what otherwise would have been an even better book. Sure it's a good read, but do not expect the excellence and superb characters and character development of POE.     We follow our protagonists, Merthin and Caris, from the childhood to well into their 40s. They are a lusty couple barely able to restrain themselves from constant coupling even when Caris is forced into the nunnery by an unscrupulous Prior. Merthin's brother is one of this book's evil characters though not nearly so bad or arresting as POE's Earl of Shiring. None of the characters manages to inspire the interest of the wonderful fully fleshed out characters from POE.     Follet's characters in this book have abortions, pursue same-sex relations with abandon, and engage in the whole panoply of \\"modern\\" behavior apparently suggesting little or no differences between past and present other than the stage of economic and technological development. In POE he deftly and painstakingly creates a medieval world where the characters behave in a manner more consistent with the mores of that period. It almost seemed as though Follet was beguiled by his political inclinations into a more agenda driven story. Whatever the reason, his story suffers accordingly and, to me at least, seemed less authentic than POE.     No doubt human behavior from the dawn of humanity has reflected the essential characteristics of that humanity, but each period of history has profoundly influenced the expression of our common humanity. Follet failed in this book to credibly blend our common human characteristics into the historical context of the 14th century. He took the short cut of simply grafting modern behavior onto the historical framework of the 1300s.     One thing Follet does remarkably well is keep this 1000 plus page book moving along in a manner that maintains your interest throughout.  There is no point at which the reader's interest sags.  I've read that Follet tries to incorporate a new plot device into every 10 - 20 pages in order to maintain the flow and interest level of the book.  He does this exceedingly well.  Trust me:  your interest will be preserved from beginning to end.    Despite its deficiencies, I did enjoy the book, however I am only giving it 4 stars due to lack of originality and historical credibility as well as its failure to live up to expectations.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I watched the series,Planet Earth this summer at the beach on wet afternoons and evenings when a house full of us were depressed by bad weather. It was one of the most exciting Nature series I have ever seen, and I grew up with the BBC's expertise in this regard.     Buy this to remind yourself of the beauty of the world we live in. Buy this to remind yourself why we all have to work hard to save what we have, what we  can see because of this  film that there is  yet left for us to explore.   It is beautifully filmed, filled with images that will stay with you. This series will teach you lots you did not know , entrance you for hours on end with its visual delights.  I gave it to a special family, for whom I have much regard, as a thank you for all they had done for me in the early days of my divorce.     I know  that over the years it will be the gift that goes on giving for the two children and parents both..
0385720920|2.0|I'm not finished yet but am close to being finished.  Know what I mean?  The book lags quite a bit.  I read so many positive reviews and decided to ignore my best friend who thought it wasn't Chuck's best work... Guess what?  It really isn't.  It's a laborious read and he goes on and on and on about a lot of bs.  Just when you think it's going to get good it slides into a pit of mud from which there is no escape.  Fortunately for this book, I have to read whatever I pick up... Finish reading even if I'm all ready finished.    I must say that he's seriously one of my favorite writers.  I'd have to read this book anyway whether I like it or not.  I wish I would have listened to my friend though and read Survivor instead.  What a bummer.

I have a rediculous home theatre setup and some of the older stuff did have some clipping and hiss, had me thinkin my roomie blew my center speaker and didnt tell me.but most of the audio sounded great.  This is a must have for any true AC/DC fan.  These dvds show why AC/DC are one of if not the greatest Rock & Roll bands of all time.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|The animation is so wonderful it will draw you in and make you wish you were there.  It is amazing.    The story is superb with a message that says, \\"No matter who you are you can do it.\\"  A message we all need to hear once in a while, especially children.      It is a very meaningful story.  There are little lessons, such as don't take credit that belongs to others, you can't force someone to be something he's not, and we should encourage the dreams of all, to name a few.      Though the story definately leads you up and down emotionally, there are no deaths or heartbreaks that shouldn't be in cartoons.    Excellent!  Worthy of 5 Stars!
B000VH3FV8|3.0|It's very very sad that it took Luther's death for a comprehensive box set to be released.  That said this one is a very mixed bag.  There are two versions of this set; a small standard (will fit on your cd shelf) edition, and an oversized long box edition.  First the good news:  The presentation and booklet are near perfect.  For me, it was worth it just for the box and booklet alone.  Next there are seven true rarities included on this set.  The box claims more than that, but the \\"Lady Is A Tramp\\" duet is previously available on Frank Sinatra's duets album and the new live mix of A House Is Not A Home is indeed better sounding than the original 2003 Radio City Music Hall cd, but not different otherwise.  There are a few other extended versions etc., but nothing else truly rare.   Was it worth it for just seven new trax?  You betcha!  But that brings us to the bad news  ONLY 7 RARE CUTS ON A 4 CD BOX SET.    Not near enough for his long suffering fans.  Even if you give the set the benefit of the doubt and included every alt, extended, remixed version, and count things like Hot Butterfly,  which I'll bet most fans already have (and which I'm very glad was in fact included here) we're still only talkin' like 13 or 14 items that aren't on Luther's standard discography!!!  There should have been TONS of previously unreleased live trax and TONS of lesser known studio cuts and TONS of unreleased material.  Come on now, we all know they exist!!!  What about including \\"She's So Good To Me\\" from THE GOONIES soundtrack (even though luckily I already have that cut on a UK promo cd single)?  What about more than just the single cut from Luther's first two albums on Cotillion Records (and again... thank goodness I already have them both)?  There should have been an entire disc devoted to unreleased live material, an entire disc devoted to unreleased studio trax, an entire disc devoted to alt versions and remixes and then finally a disc of regular run of the mill album cuts that you could get just about anywhere.  THAT'S WHAT THIS SET SHOULD HAVE BEEN!!!  If this sounds like sour grapes, it's not.  The set for all my complaints is a very nice overview collection, but seeing as how most fans have the vast majority of this material already, it seems like a huge missed opportunity to me.  Still, this is better than nothing at all and I'm very happy that Luther finally gets the box set treatment.  Or better yet, how 'bout a do over!!!      jd

B000068IEU|2.0|I'm not sure what genre I'd put this in but it wouldn't be horror. The movie isn't scary at all. I can see it being very shocking and controversial for the year it came out and I guess there are some scenes that would still be considered shocking and controversial today. And on paper I think they definitely are. But on the screne they're not that shocking to me. The pitch for this movie is \\"keep telling yourself, It's only a movie, It's only a movie\\" I think that's a bit ridiculous! At NO point did I feel this movie was real or I was a part of it. It comes off kind of cheesy to me. The acting isn't that good for the most part. The screenplay isn't that good, and the directing isn't that good. Also it seems like the shocking scenes were strictly put in to be shocking. Like the scene where they pull out some of the girls intestines. First of all you only see about 3 seconds of it. Secondly, why would they do this? They're not cannibals. They don't play in the blood or rub it on themselves. So the fact that they would do this seems completely unrealistic. I give it 2 1/2 stars for taking the chances it did in 1972. Other than that it's not very good.
B000JU7N7E|5.0|It is hilarious with out ever missing a single logical step! Gaiman and Pratchett are the perfect match for the co-authorship.<br /><br />It shines a humorous light on the good and bad inherent in mankind as an angel and a devil just claim the deeds of men for their own - in a few cases the same deed! You have the supernatural pair, a nice boy meant to destroy the world, a witch and her witch-hunter, the iconic delivery-man, the apocaliptic horsemen and an extra set of bikers just behind them!<br /><br />I consider it a must!
078322933X|4.0|fear is a good thriller. something to get you to shake your head and say man, listen girl, you know parents are hardly ever wrong. and this is movie is just a bit more proof of that. a glimpse at an obsession way beyond the norm. a good and intense film that plays a lot like real life episodes. it hits close to home so that makes it even better. a story about a girl who only wants to find the \\"one\\" to love her forever and ever. well, she finds that in this guy, david, who is devoted to her, who's scary jealous, (red flag)and cares about everything she does. he has this innocent good boy behavior attitude, put down clean and knows just how to win her over. it's physical attraction at first sight and just escalates, until it's serious for both, or so nicole thinks. david tries to sabatoge her family and her and her fathers relationship, and she believes him. blinded by love, you know. then she sees her friend and her boyfriend in the worst kind of betrayel, and she calls it quits. that and her father sends david over the edge. he wants to get her back, and he'll do anything to do just that. whether she wants to or not, it's david and nicole forever. the relationship turns deadly and they're at the hands of a psychotic boy who's starving for love. it's a roller coaster ride, of emotions and thrills. any parents worst nightmare. all in all it's a good movie, an eye opener, and another reason to listen to those who know best. the actors were great. mark wahlberg did an excellent job as the down to earth, sweet, sensitive, guy who's only looking for an honest relationship. he has that goodboy charm that could seduce anybody. and the way he flips it, man that was crazy, kind of freaks you out. how someone can get like that quick. reese witherspoon, she always been a doll. superb job as that innocent naive teenager who stands up at all cost at her boyfriends side. great characters and good on screen chemistry.
B0000508U6|5.0|It's very, very mellow.<br /><br />Anyway, at first, none of the songs really stood out...<br /><br />But flash forward 7-8 months, and this is quite a nice, relaxing, and very, very soothing alternative CD.<br /><br />And Chris Martin's voice for the most part, fits right in!<br /><br />My favorite songs are:<br /><br />Spies (great underrated lyrics I never understood till now)<br />Don't Panic<br />High Speed<br />Sparks<br />Trouble (nice piano)<br /><br />I now own all 3 of Coldplay's albums. I think that this album is there very, very best, and they expanded their sound, to reach the masses with [[ASIN:B000069AUI A Rush of Blood to the Head]]. It was nearly as good, but less unique than this CD. [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]] was most definitely the weakest link.<br /><br />But all of the CDs have at least 4 inspiring tracks on them.<br /><br />I really like the upbeat numbers that they do; Clocks, Daylight, Speed Of Sound, Fix You and Square One are amongst my favorites!<br /><br />This CD should be owned by most alternative music fans. As a MATTER OF FACT, do your friend a favor, and spread some love this Christmas by buying them this! They will love its mellow and calming vibe. It's in-describe-able!! Seriously. It's so lovely, that I'm at a BIG loss of words.<br /><br />I don't know if I've said this already, but when I initially purchased this from Best Buy for 13 bucks, and got it home, I was thinking, \\"This doesn't stand out much.\\"<br /><br />But these days, it's definitely one of THE BEST alternative CD I own. It's perfection. You know they've found something special when the skit on the album perfectly blends into the next song.<br /><br />So if You've had a hard day at work, kick off your shoes and socks, turn the damn phone OFF, and pop this into your CD/DVD player. Smoke something nice, get a cappuccino, and just L-I-S-T-E-N. Most of all, R-E-L-A-X.<br /><br />I have no regrets buying this one.<br /><br />5 stars.
1400063515|2.0|Mr. Taleb makes some interesting statements but I'm glad I didn't buy the book. What comes across in a most repetitively annoying way is an enormous axe to grind instead of an argument to make. \\"Only I know\\" seems to be what shouts from every page and after a while it masks the important contributions his book could have made if he sounded a little less like a know-it all adolescent.      Mr. Taleb seems to be caught up in other people's past evolutions. Another reviewer points out correctly that the Gaussian models have lasted so long simply because we lacked the computing power to develop more accurate models. Other models certainly exist now and we should play with them, but making blistering rebuttals against people whose contributions were limited by the physical and mental technology of the time seems to me like calling Edison an imbecile because he didn't go straight to the development of the MP3.     I'm not a computer whiz, mathematical modeler, or Nobel prize winner. I'm just a speculator who has made a living at being right in the markets for over 30 years, all of it the result of self education through observation. Maybe I would have made more money over the years by being more mathematical. But I've found that it isn't the mathematics of the market that is as important as the psychology....what people think of their models of the market. If people want to believe in Black Swans, Myron Scholes, or Ed Thorp I really don't care. What I make money on, what every speculator makes money on, is the fact that I know what model is predominant in the minds of most other traders regardless of any connection to any so called objective reality. What speculators make money off of isn't models but other people's belief in them. Which explains why despite waiting for the next unforseen event....which by definition can't be predicited...we mere mortals watch the EIA reports, and employment numbers, etc. because other people are making decisions based on them. Are they right? I don't know nor care...I only know that I ignore their beliefs at my peril.     Speculators understand that our knowledge of the markets is imperfect. We know that our failings aren't the result so much of failing to see answers but failing to forsee relevant questions.  We are all at some time blinded by our model/map of what is there...the quest for exact knowledge blinds us to systematic wisdom.  We all tend to over estimate what we know, or can know and so overestimate the permanence of our current trends or models upon which they are built. A speculator like me may not know the mathematics of dynamic hedging and how it should fit in with chaos therory but I know that my judgments of necessity must be \\"fuzzy\\" enough to allow for the possiblity of the \\"unplanned\\" model that is or maybe unfolding in the market. In this sense I agree with Mr. Taleb's apparent goal to expand and evolve new models. It's just that he could have done it with a little more grace and with a simple respect for the ideas upon which he will inevitably build his own models.
B000089RVX|5.0|I like Fallen. I like Evanescence. And I love Amy Lee. What a passionate, haunting and angelic voice! Evanescence's Fallen (2003) is a beautifully poetic metal plea for salvation from the hell of emotional suffering and hopelessness.<br /><br />Goth-metal? Could be. There is an electric guitar dominated goth-metal edge to much of the music on Fallen, but powerful piano ballads carry significant weight here, too. Call the music of Evanescence what you want, but it's Amy Lee, with her captivating vocal expressions, that is the main attraction here. She sings with such emotional depth and acuity, that her credibility seems beyond reproach. Every word is meaningful, and every sentiment plausible. She's more than convincing when she pleads to God in Tourniquet:<br /><br />Will you be on the other side<br />Or will you forget me?<br />I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming,<br />Am I too lost to be saved?<br />Am I too lost?<br /><br />With song titles like Going Under, Bring Me To Life, Haunted, Taking Over Me and My Last Breath, the distance between salvation and the abyss is short, and the emotional crisis critical. Sometimes Fallen is an impetuous tempest of turbulent passion, and sometimes it is a fragile, grieving cry. But it is always profoundly intense, and always extremely emotional. And consummately unforgetable.
0740748475|5.0|I mean literally.  He reads this series every single day.  It was well worth the $100 I paid.    Now I am trying to get him into novels and non-fiction, some linear non bubble enclosed text would be a nice change for him.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|First off, I believe this a different take of Hot 'Lanta. The guitar solos are totally different from the original, classic release. Also I think the mastering is MUCH better on this release. The drums and the bass sound crisper and deeper and maybe a little louder. All in all, it's fantastic. If you already own \\"Eat a Peach\\" and \\"Live At the Fillmore East,\\" do you NEED to buy it? I'd say no, you're good - unless you've got money to burn.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|This album is short and sweet and Serj shows off his vocal range and abilities along with some pretty crazy and dope lyrics. Also, there is alot of piano in the songs, which really twists the music up.
0743298039|5.0|This book was very well written. It is a period epic in which the characters are fully developed and intriguing. It's a tale of love, loss, and self discovery. It's a story within a story. It kept me engaged the entire time I was reading it. I did listen to the audio version, which was incredibly well narrated. Fantastic! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|All the characters seem to be growing in their parts.  Episodes continue to improve.
B000002UY5|5.0|I my view, one of the top 5 albums EVER.  Brilliant lyrics along with exceedlingly talented musicianship.  There is simply not one bad song on the album.  I listen to it about once a week and it never grows old.  For those who have only heard \\"No Rain,\\" it is probably one of the weakest song, if you can call it that.
6305949980|5.0|this is my ultimate favorite movie , its the movie i could watch any day , any time and still not get sick of it. i think ive seen it 40000000,00000 times haha. if you havent see this movie GO SEE IT NOW. its a beautiful story of romance ( morbid but sweet ) and hopes and dreams.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I have been a great fan of the Altantis series and the 3rd season is fantastic I have enjoyed each episode.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Can't really add anything insightful or original to some of the other reviews already provided for this movie.  I can't say the other postivie reviews helped me, since I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  The reviews in favor of this move just explain how I feel better than I can.<br /><br />Yes, the story is shortened for the purpose of this movie and some of the characters are not as fully developed as in the book.  However, in the time alloted for a feature film, the director and actors stayed true to the spirit of the book and this is a great representation of the book.<br /><br />Matthew Macfadyen - what a performance!!!  He conveys so much with his eyes and facial expressions.  The most internally tortured Darcy I have ever seen.  While many seem to think Keira Knightley can't act,  I disagree.  A perfect Lizzie in my opinion.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to see the BBC mini-series, which many seem to prefer, so I can't compare or contrast to this film.  All I can say, as I did in the beginning, is that I love this film.  Great photography, great adaptation, great acting, great film.
B000SZLSB2|2.0|Mr. Blunt was born in 1974, which means that in 1973 he would have been in his mother's womb.  So either he's named his umbilical cord Simona and called his mother's womb \\"a club\\", or he believes he is actually a 54 year old man.  Either way, I see no reason to feed his madness.
B0000AOV85|5.0|This is Pink Floyd taking us through time. A good documentary. In fact, the whole Classic Album series is a must for any music fan.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Maybe I'm just blind to the point of this movie but halfway through I was wondering were this was all going.  By the end I just wanted to put a bullet in my head.
B00004Z400|5.0|I would have bought this album just for 'Change,' back in the day before everyone was downloading, but even now, this Deftones album is awesome the whole way through... and obviously I still bought it, which says something in and of itself.
B000UCEJEQ|1.0|I don't know the cause of the problem, but I was not able to play this CD on my Windows Vista laptop. I tried using Windows Media Player and Itunes, and neither worked. Each time the laptop's software could not play the audio out loud and the length of the tracks appeared as 789 minutes. I am guessing there is a copy protection issue, but this malicous software (alledged) not only kept me from being able to play it, but it destroyed 72 other tracks that I had legal rights to own (having purchased the CD or having purchased the track on the Itunes store).     I was able to play it in my car, and while the music was excellent in quality, every song was terribly depressing.
B00001SIES|4.0|I randomly bought this one, knowing fairly little about the band, but I love Radiohead and Muse is some crazy mix of Radiohead and something I cannot put my finger on. I was generally very pleased with my decision.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|For those of you that loved LP's past cd's you will most likely like this one. There seemed to be a different vib to it but all in all a good cd.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, but then I'm a sucker for dance movies. Channing Tatum, the male lead has once again changed his spots.  He's been a basketball player(Coash Carter), a soccer player(She's The Man), an angry/abused tough kid(A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints and now a streetkid/dancer in this movie.  These are just a few of his roles and I think that he pulls this one off very well.  The two leads, Ty and Nora come from two different worlds, but are brought together because of their love of dance and each other.  You get to see a lot of dance, hear a lot of music ( I reccomend the soundtrack) and of course a happy ending.  And \\"widescreen a must\\" because when you see it on tv, and then you see the dvd on widescreen, you realize just how much you really do miss.  On widescreen you get to see so much more of the final dance number.  So if you are in to music, dance or love stories, I highly reccomend this movie, but watch it on widescreen if you can...but ignore Nora's friend Lucy, she is so fake!
B000FA57NK|1.0|Product did not work.  Amazon sent 2nd DVD and it did not work.    I had to use a 1 star for the review to go through.  You should have a zero for did not work.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is one of those movies I can watch  time and again, and never grow tired of it. Guy Richie's editing style is genius, the way he cuts from one scene to another. This is SO funny, it's hard to even feel bad watching Frankie Four Fingers pistol-whipping the beejezus out of a  London jeweler in the attempt to uncover the old man's stash...awful as that sounds! Despite a cast replete with big name stars and characters with names like Bullet-tooth Tony, Bricktop, and Boris the Blade, Jason Statham's character, Turkish, OWNS this movie and it just does your heart good to see the bad guys get THEIRS in the end. A positively BRILLIANT British comedy at least as much as anything else, it is laced with action and really cool gripping twists and one-liners throughout. Easily well worth the money and the time!
B000002UAO|5.0|If I had just one sentence to describe this album it would something like \\"This album is the beginning of the unstoppable evolution of the Beatles\\". As they stepped in the studio and started to record Rubber Soul they started to carve a new whole definition for their music, the push forward all the existing barriers for a LP.    They included some great rock tracks such as \\"Drive my car\\" which is always going to remain as a McCartney classic and \\"Think for yourself\\" a great rock track from George with the catchy fuzz bass, we also hear in this album an experimenting Lennon, he motivated the group to make the studio into a workshop, it is no longer just  making a lot of takes and choosing the best one to overdub, now it is a whole new dimension, they could add more instruments to their music; they are no longer confined in the studio, now they have the authority to make whatever the feel like, why? Simply because they are The Beatles!. For me this is a fascinating idea, they could go the same direction as in \\"Help!\\" or \\"Beatles for Sale\\", but they decided to reinvent themselves with more complex tunes and lyrics. As an example, \\"In my Life\\" one of the most beautiful songs I ever heard, another example \\"Norwegian Wood (This bird has flown)\\" the inclusion of George's sitar elevated this track into a classic unforgettable category.     If you are not a Beatles fan, I would recommend this album as a good starter for what the Beatles really were, after this album they release \\"Revolver\\" which is another gem, you can hear their evolution, their growing ideas and the perfection of Martin's production. When you hear songs like \\"Nowhere man\\", \\"The word\\", \\"Drive my car\\", \\"In my life\\" you'll understand why the Beatles have that place in music history they rightfully own. Another \\"must have\\" in any Beatles large or small collection......Buy it and enjoy, a splendid time is guaranteed for all!
1401300529|5.0|A memory jogging account for Korean veterans of the events of the Korean war.  It depicts the heartache of wrong decisions made by leaders and the effect on so many lives.  Spellbinding and difficut to put down once started.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|I love English and Celtic folk music and \\"Crimson\\" is something like what I was hoping for.  If I were ordering up, I'd take less of a traditional and understated take on some of the music, but Knopfler tells you what to expect in the Scottish song, \\"Heart Full of Holes:\\"    Rock n' roll - well, I don't know  Dead people's wedding gifts  walk out the door  A clarinet squeals to be free  Accordions hop  from the shelves to the floor -  start playing their polkas to     Dire Straits fans--there is one song here for you.  \\"We can get Wild\\" would certainly fit in most of the Staits collections:    We're old enough for leaving home,  The old joanna and the old trombone,  It's all going on,  I'm growing my sideboards long,  Hey you and me  Can be who we want to be.    Still, there's a lot of good music here with a very contemporary take on society's trends.  \\"Punish the Monkey\\" talks about corporate irresponsibility--\\"they punish the monkey and let the organ grinder go.\\"    This is a niche album much like \\"Ragpicker's Dreams.\\" If you love English and Celtic folk, you're going to like this CD. If you're looking for something with more of a rock beat or country, just listen to the samples and know they are pretty representative of the whole.
B000EHSVSC|4.0|An excellently made movie. A must see. You should have a copy on ypur shelf.
0525950079|4.0|I have read [[ASIN:0451207149 The Pillars of the Earth]] several times and consider it one of my favorite books.  Like many, I came upon it accidentally in a used book store and was fascinated.  I loved it so much I actually bought a new copy when my original disintegrated after loaning it out so much.<br />  Once again by happy accident I stumbled upon [[ASIN:0525950079 World Without End]] at my local book store, and I bought it, delirious that there was another chapter in this story that I had assumed was a stand-alone book.  I have to say, I wasn't disappointed.<br />  Follett is an excellent writer, and he really brings you into the times well.  His characterizations are fantastic, and you truly feel as if these are living, breathing people who you are watching going through their lives.<br />  Although I didn't find the novel was quite as good as the first, I still think that it is a wonderful read, and I would highly reccommend it to anyone who loves historical fiction.<br />  I hope that Follett will find time to possibly write another chapter in the Kingsbridge story, perhaps during the reign of Henry VIII and his dissolution of the Catholic Church in Britian?  Now that I would pre-order!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Junior class has just graduated with the release of his junior album, Graduation.  This thirteen track album will keep you wanting more, from the beginning track: \\"Good Morning,\\" to the last track \\"Big Brother.\\"  Each song delivers a soul grabbing melody and lyrical flows that would keep the CD player on repeat.    One of the most standout tracks is \\"Big Brother.\\" A tribute song from Kanye to Jay-Z.  This CD includes guest appearances from Lil Wayne, T-pain, Mos Def and Dule from Coldplay.  With a CD like this it is safe to say the showdown between 50 cent and Kanye himself, Kanye comes out victorious.
0521677467|5.0|There are plenty of Advanced Grammar Books, Advanced Readings, etcetera. But just a few publications deal with Advanced Vocabulary. This is a great choice for us, non-native speakers. The explanations are simple and clear, and the examples are great! It is updated, precise and fun...! If you thought you'd had enough with your vocabulary books, think twice!! This is a must-have one-of-a-kind book...!
1594489505|5.0|This was an excellent book which gave insight into another culture.  I heartily recommend it to serious readers.
0374105235|4.0|An absolutely gripping tale of a child's audacity to look life and its travails in the eye and not flinch...  This book should be required reading for all children in this country, aged 13-18.  Ishmael Beah proves the human spirit is as resilient and strong as one's desire to display it in the face of monumental adversity.  Great Read...
8489367116|1.0|I have ordered many books from Amazon with great success.  However, when I ordered Shantaram, they sent it in Spanish.  I have never ordered a book from them in Spanish so they should have been alerted that something might be wrong.  I did not see any sign that I was ordering the book in Spanish.  A friend of mine also had the same thing happen, ordering what she thought was Shantram in English and it came in Spanish.... somehow, that part of the system of Amazon is not very well set up....  When I returned it, I had to pay for return shipping because they did not have a return reason to cover my problem and did not have a spot for \\"Other Reasons\\" so they assumed that it was not their fault that I received the wrong book.  Rather than try again and take the chance, I chose to get the copy of Shantaram that I needed in English from our local Barnes and Noble.  Other than that, I have had great success with Amazon and will use them again.  I am still reading Shantaram.  However, from what I have read of it, the use of the language is beautiful.  The story I have yet to decide if I like it.  It certainly gives you a lot to ponder.
B000KN7BOA|3.0|not the normal bee gees sound. a lot of the songs were very similar to beatles songs.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|The third season of Atlantis delivers all the action, comedy and sci fi goodness that we've come to expect from the Stargate franchise. The commentaries and features are informative and entertaining, but I'll have to subtract points for not having any of the actors on the commentaries this year.
0143038419|1.0|I could not finish this book.  When the author burst into sobs yet again in the middle of prayer, or a conversation, or walking down the street, or (more likely) on the floor of yet another bathroom, I gave up.  This is the type of person you meet at a cocktail party and RUN in the other direction after a few minutes when she starts spewing out all her problems at you with no end in sight.  Note to the author: I am your reader, not your psychotherapist.  I really tried to enjoy the book and even like the author, but after slogging through a couple hundred pages of endlessly self-absorbed chatter, I was worn out and put the book in the Goodwill pile.  When she writes, \\"I discovered my mind was not a very interesting place to be,\\" I have to say, \\"Amen, sister!\\"
B000P12LWY|2.0|If you haven't seen this series in HD, you're missing out.  It is the only reason I made it through the entire first season.  There is a scene (can't remember the episode) where Catherine of Aragon is sitting outside under some trees.  I was absolutely hypnotized by the picture quality.  It felt like I could've reached out and plucked a leaf.      While I completely enjoyed the HD experience, I can't say the same for the rest of it.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's just not written very well.  I understand dramatic license, and I understand that Showtime can skew a bit raunchier than HBO, but having said that I don't understand why they dumbed down a very good (real life) story, and threw in a bunch of gratuitous and not very convincing sex scenes.  I felt embarrassed for the actors, especially JRM.    The costumes were beautiful (totally wrong time period).  The scenery was excellent.  There were no stand out performances for me.  I really like Sam Neill, but he wasn't given enough to do.  The most glaring departure from the true story, the one that added NOTHING to the series, was the Margaret Tudor storyline.  Another reviewer's already pointed out where it all went wrong, so I'll leave it alone.  But really, she kills her sick old husband, then she dies of consumption.  And in between we're given no reason to care about poor old Margaret.      Maybe the writers were trying to go for a Sopranos thing, where the characters are reprehensible, but we still care about some of them.  They didn't pull it off here.  There wasn't one character I cared about.  Even Catherine of Aragon, maybe the most sympathetic person of the whole tale, came across as a whiny, desperate has-been.      Overall, I gave the series 2 stars, strictly for the film quality.  It really is stunning.  For the rest I give it zero.  The writers could have produced something intelligent AND sexy, but they took the cheap and dirty way out.
0743486285|5.0|Wow!!!  I bought this book because I have been a HUGE fan of Motley Crue since the early 80's.  I read The Dirt and loved it.  But The Heroin Diaries was something I couldn't put down.  Before I read this I didn't think much of Nikki Sixx, but now....I see him so differently.  What an intelligent man (even at his worst!)  He has street smarts, and a good eye for business.  I never relized that he was the puppet master of the Greatest band ever.  I also like that he updates you on his life and all involved now.  Gives it that happy ending feel.        Like I said, I read it in three days.
B000UJ48SQ|1.0|I just received this exact DVD from Amazon. Although the package art now carries a 2007 date, the disc inside is the same as the 2001 release. It is NOT anamorphically enhanced. In fact, the files on the DVD are dated 2001, so it literally is the exact DVD release in 2001 - the menu is the same as well. The only difference is this comes in a keep case rather than a snapper case. Such a shame that WB won't do better by this overlooked masterpiece.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Some song catch you right away and some will grow on you after you listen to them. My expectation were high after reading from others it was the best since The River. I don't think it's his best but is more to my liking than the past 4 albums
B000MRAAJM|3.0|First, when this DVD looks good, it looks better than almost anything I've ever seen. The first episode is jaw-droppingly spectacular and the shots from space are unbelievable.  The whole concept, narration, music, direction, etc., is really staggering.  BUT starting with the Angel falls scene on the second disc there seems to be a serious technical problem.      If you cruise through the multitude of rave reviews on this site, you'll notice several that talk about recurring problems with noticeable graininess, flickering snow, and/or pixel breakup in scenes with low light or shadowed landscapes.  All of those people - including me - seem to have high end, 1080p flat-screens, players and cables.  Several reviewers single out the same scenes, for instance, the shadowed parts of the mountain around Angel Falls in the second episode, so we're not making this up.      Several readers have responded with \\"explanations.\\"  One guy said that he read on a Blu-Ray blog that it was some kind of camera interference encountered while filming the series.  It wasn't noticed until after the crew returned to the studio, and they cleaned it up as best they could.  Another said to try new cables.  Another DID try new cables and it didn't help.  Another said to REDUCE the resolution (isn't high definition the reason that we HAVE these things in the first place?).  But I don't think any of these explanations take into consideration why so few people are noticing the problem.    I can only think of two options here:  1) Either there is a transfer/coding/compression problem with every single copy of the series that is only visible to detail-oriented watchers with really high-end equipment; or 2) There is a bad batch of DVDs out there, and some of us were unlucky enough to buy one.  (Note:  I tried two copies of Planet Earth (from the same retailer) and had to return both of them because of this weird, but consistent, technical problem.)    Several reviewers state that the Discovery Channel Blu-Ray version of Planet Earth, with Sigourney Weaver narrating, doesn't have this problem, BUT the resolution is 1080i, not 1080p.      I find this particularly frustrating because of the high-level production values and the truly amazing images that were captured for this ground-breaking series.

B00006LI4S|2.0|First -  I love David Gilmour...and believe he was more the 'sound' of Pink Floyd than Roger.   Upon reading reviews of this DVD \\"David Gilmour in Concert 2002\\", I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD.  Mistake.  This one, though a quality performance, is not \\"Pink Floyd re-visited\\" and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s (David Gilmour and About Face).  It is a bunch of slow, 'On an Island' type songs from I don't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same...  I had to fast forward several times.   The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras.  The DVD is 'only' $10, but I don't see myself ever watching it again so...not worth the money.
B00013F38K|5.0|I had heard about the Kung fu series from my Father who used to rave about it every time the topic came up. I finally had a chance to watch it when my local Library bought the first season and have now bought all three seasons. Though the acting and direction is not comparable to our modern day Spielberg movie, the effort to make such an unusual series is very commendable. Imagine having something like this on television today!! The conversations between Caine (David Carradine) and his Masters is always thought provoking. Each episode deals with something different about the human soul and always leaves one contemplating long after watching it. I recommend this product strongly to anyone who wants to watch something not dealing with crime, violence, sex etc but just something pure, wholesome and enlightening.
B00003CXV4|1.0|I first saw this movie when it first came out with a friend--she had free tickets--I am very glad she did, because after watching it, I am glad I did not pay $10.00 bucks to see this movie. Okay, being a sucker for romances, I decided to watch it again.....<br /><br />First, I would like to say, I love, love Charlize Theron as an actor, she is excellent, when placed in the right roles and her agent is not on some kind of \\"let's make a quick buck, fix!\\" But hey, she did make Mr. Reeves look good, okay not really.<br /><br />But Keanu Reeves in a romances is like someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard, HUH! actually he is just an awfully, awful actor, it's like watching a robot trying to have emotions, especially in an romantic movie. Keanu is better in movies that does not require using the human heart to express emotions!<br /><br />Now on to the Scenes in the Sweet November. I'm from SF and know for certain, at least I am 99.9% certain that you cannot walk out of your house in Potrero Hill and 5 minutes later be scrolling down Dolores Park, eating an ice cream cone, nor can you be in Chinatown with one skip and a hop from Potrero Hill. Unless you have a car or you have a very special route from Potrero to Dolores Park to Chinatown, in which case could someone please let me Know!  Just had to mention this, because it really bugged me....<br /><br />But hey, this is hollywood and I guess they figured us folks in the Bay Area would not catch this one.<br /><br />Basically, if the acting on Keanu's part had been believable, heartfelt and real, I would have enjoyed this movie more. Plus, what is up with the Movies about dying woman, with some unknown disease!
B00005JPRD|2.0|In all fairness, I was skeptical about this movie before i saw it. My girlfriend was pulling my arm into the theatre to see this film. So i gave it a shot and to be honest i felt it was way too  speratic. Simply put they tried to cram too much  character development into a short period, what they should have done was tone down on the backstories and make the film somewhat more linear. i didn't recognize a solid plot that progressed until midway through the movie. It was like like several smaller  vignettes. All in all i disliked it
B000I2MRHE|5.0|We bought this cute playmat to make tummy time a little more enjoyable for our 10 week old. She seems to like it for about 5 minutes and then she needs a break. The cute ladybug stool cradles your baby's torso and helps prevent them from rolling off. She likes all of the little activities each \\"flower petal\\" offers but I'd have to say the \\"crinkly\\" sound the leaves make seem to be her favorite. Or maybe she just likes the leave because she can get a good grasp on them and rotate herself around. I was a little surprised at how small the mat is but I'm sure it'll give our daughter lots of fun tummy time despite the size. I wish they had this when we had our other daughter 5 years ago.
1844560368|1.0|I started reading this book and fell in love.  Then, I bought the audio version so that I could finish it in the car.  The two don't even compare!  This book is so abridged, it ends up sounding like, \\"Then she met so and so, then they went here, then they got married, etc.\\"  I mean, all of the beauty of the descriptions and character development and nuances are gone.  It's good for reviewing for a test, maybe, but you're probably better off with Cliff Notes.  Just buy the book!

0143038419|4.0|This book had great descriptions of the author's emotional and physical journey to find happiness after divorce.  The people and places are so detailed and alive, I want to follow in her footsteps and eat the same pizza, visit the same ashram, meet the same medicine man.  The author finds her independence again after a long time in an unhappy relationship, and though she has to go to the ends of the Earth to find it, the message applies anywhere: enjoy, forgive, relax.
B000Q6ZG6G|5.0|While one of the slower films kubrick has made this is still a great film. The CG fig leaves covering the nude scenes have been removed. The fuss was over nothing. I have literally seen more nudity on bus ads. The film has a dreamy cyclical quality to it. It has grown on me and continues to give me food for thought as time goes on. This film is still way better than most films that get made. The orgy scene and the scenes that follow are as scary and thrilling as anythging I have ever seen.
0689859368|3.0|I read this for one reason, because the movie is coming out. I was expecting a book. I did not get a book. I got a chapter of a book. I could see this for 7-9 year olds. But 9-12? I don't think so. The language is right for that age group, but the \\"book\\" is extremely short and the only reason I could see the book being so short is to make money. There wasn't even a real \\"book\\" feel to it. There was no real conflict, no rising and falling action no climax. It was like the introductory chapter of a book. It was good. But why should I have to buy three books to get a story that would fit in one?
0345347951|5.0|Contemporary social analysis combines with exploration of the possible in works that are both entertaining and profound, like this Clarke story in which he convincingly portrays an alien invasion of earth.  Disconcertingly, the aliens are not hostile but supply us with everything we need.  The great 'what if' of the novel is--what if the need for human effort and curiosity were removed?  Clarke tells his tale with consummate skill, and the moment when the alien finally reveals themselves to waiting humanity is----so classic science fiction!!!!!

B000J103PC|4.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is about a recent Ivy League graduate that can't find a job to pay the bills  while waiting to be a successful writer. She finally lands a job as an assistant to the personal assistant of a top fashion magazine editor.  The only trouble is she never heard of the editor, nor read the magazine, nor has any fashion sense.   Unfortunately, the editor is a self-absorbed, fiercely ambitious woman who barely talks above a whisper, but has an attitude that is as frosty and drop dead cold as her hair.     And yet, this is a fun movie.  Thanks to Meryl Streep who turns simple lines like \\"That's all\\" and \\"Why is nobody ready?\\" into comedic classics. She deftly rides the line between nasty and comical.  As the movie develops, Ms. Streep is also able to break from the script's cliché of the lonely heart behind the powerful woman.  Meryl Streep even decided to go an extra step and do one of these scenes with no make-up, a rarity in Hollywood movies, to show how tired, worn and, well...normal...her character really is.     So, what's the movie like when Meryl isn't in a scene?  Not as good. Anne Hathaway plays the new assistant, but with not nearly as many shades as Meryl Streep.  After a particularly nasty chewing out by the boss, Ms. Hathaway's character decides to give herself a fashion makeover, take her job seriously and impress the boss.  However, unlike Ms. Streep, Anne Hathaway can not break out of the script's predictability to make it more engaging. Other developments of her character, equally predictable, bring the movie dangerously close to showing its \\"chick lit\\" roots.  As a repeat viewer of this movie, most of these scenes are frequently skipped.     Other characters are Anne Hathaway's boyfriend, who is a bland sounding board for Anne.  Two others, however, a loyal long suffering employee played by Stanley Tucci and the other assistant, played by Emily Blunt, manage to edge into Meryl's limelight and generate a few laughs and some interest.But it's Meryl Streep, by flinging her coat or tossing a steak after half a bite, or simply saying \\"That wasn't a question\\", that generates laughs, amazement and even, once in awhile a \\"Gee, I'd like to try working for her.\\"

B000VWQUEC|1.0|Whats in the box you may ask?      Nothing but rip offs.      The cover says, \\"A 2DVD Documentary Set Which Tells The Full Story Of The Greatest Rock Band of All Time\\".

This is just like the critical review sets, a rip off and the makers trying to climb the Stairway to Cash.
B00000DGUY|3.0|This 1998 compilation includes all the singles by Dire Straits. However,  since it is a \\"best of\\" rather than a \\"greatest hits\\", the chance to include two album tracks which received tonnes of airplay in their time is puzzling. These two tracks \\"Industrial Disease\\" and \\"Skateaway\\" have been left off, with space given instead to live versions of \\"Going Home\\" and \\"Why Worry\\".  There is also a live version of \\"Love over Gold\\". I'm not sure why record companies insist on adding live versions over studio versions.     Admittingly, alot of Dire Straits songs are over 5 minutes long which explains why edited versions of some tracks appear on this compilation. A good example is \\"Money for nothing\\". I actually dont mind the shorter version here as I used to find the album version went on a little too long.     This 1998 compilation appears to be digitally remastered. This is noticeable when you compare common tracks from the first CD release of \\"Brothers in Arms\\" or \\"Making Movies\\". Fortunately, both these CD's have since been re-released as digital remastered too.      Overall, a fairly good compilation.  It had the chance to be so much more by including the tracks I mentioned earlier. It could have been more so too if it dropped the annoying \\"Twisting by the Pool\\" and \\"Walk of Life\\". To me they are the weakest songs released as singles and go against what I love about the band i.e. non-predictable.
0743277457|5.0|The best way that I can summarize the content and benefit to be gained from this book for those reading this review would be as follows:    For those seeking an understanding of the authors perspectives towards learning and a greater understanding of the process that this entails. I think the information presented for the reader will assist in bringing a greater clarity to this area in life provided the reader is open minded about the intricacies involved in the art of learning.      The author defines the various aspects of breaking things down in the learning process combined with an explanation of various human conditions of the learning process and the various barriers that often occur while in the pursuit of personal goals in life.  I think this will best relate to any individual who has pursued something in life and has had to overcome various obstacles in there pursuits in life and continues to struggle in this area.  I think if anyone desires to understand the art of learning better and understand there own inhibition than this book will greatly assist in there ability to gain valuable insight in there own perspective towards learning so they can work out any of there own faulty methods of learning.

0671449028|3.0|I am not blown away by this book. It was mildly entertaining for any reading level but, as a parent and now a grandmother reading to a child,  I've read better.
B00009EJC5|5.0|This is my favorite James Brown album - arguably my favorite funk album, too. It's basically a collection of remixes and single-only tracks, with a couple well-known album cuts (\\"Hot Pants\\"; \\"Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothin'\\") reprised. So who needs it? Everybody! For one, the remixes aren't just anyone's remixes, they're James Brown's remixes! This sure isn't Black Eyed Peas doing their 8,000,000 remix of \\"My Humps (Jimmy Hoffa Mix)\\" or whatever. This is JAMES BROWN! The Godfather of Soul! And when he remixes, he REMIXES - you'd expect a song titled \\"Give it up or Turnit Loose\\" to be loose, and while the original sure was, this is even more so. It's almost out-of-control. And I love it! By the way, if you listen closely you can also hear a few licks from my one of my favorite James Brown tunes, \\"Sex Machine\\". So that's where they came from... I always thought the groove was made up on the spot, but I guess not.<br />Anyway, this has a lot of the best of the Bootsy Collins band. Bootzilla is all over \\"Soul Power\\", a total classic with memorable vocal tradeoff between Brown and Bobby Byrd (Who plays an impressive organ, too!) This also contains my favorite Brown track ever - \\"Funky Drummer\\". For one, JB plays some awesome organ on it; for another, Maceo plays a classic solo; and of course there's the Clyde Stubblefield drum break, which I believe makes it the most sampled song of all time. You gotta hear that one! And you gotta hear the full \\"Hot Pants\\", too. That is excellent stuff. A more overlooked track is \\"Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved\\". Why is it always forgotten? That heavy rhythm guitar part is stunning, and as usual the vocal hook and bass part is marvelous. It also contains the powerful Nixon indictment \\"Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothin'\\" - a fantastic song, be it this remixed version or on There It Is (my second-favorite James Brown album). \\"I Got to Move\\" is one of the weaker songs here, but removed from its company and spliced onto another album, it would've been the high point. It's a lot like \\"There Was a Time\\" (actually, I think they have the exact same lyrics), only longer and funkier. And Brown puts a lot of soul on \\"It's a New Day\\".<br />This is JB how I like him! No saccharine ballads; no misfired covers; just givin' up the funk. The recordings here are some of the most influential in R&B history, paving the way for both funk and rap, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice in missing out on them.e been the high point.

The songs are easy listening but they are definitely not boring elevator music.  Most importantly, the lyrics from the songs are very touching just like the show.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I can recall seeing Solaris (2002 version) about a year after it came out on home video. The movie appeared interesting and it seemed like a different type of film for George Clooney.  I had no real expectations for the movie, I do remembering I rented this movie several days after I broke up with a girlfriend.  This might have added to my fondness for the film.<br /><br />Solaris is a very much a film of atmosphere, it is quite, mellow, dark, dreamy, devoted and has flares of intense energy.  It sounds like it might be action pack, yet it really isn't.  As a matter of fact, this movie is rather slow and takes awhile for the plot to reveal itself.  I never found that to be a problem, while other viewers might.  The lush colors painted in outer space and wonderful ambient soundtrack by Cliff Martinez (one of the best pieces of ambient music, I ordered the soundtrack as soon as the movie was over) was paramount in my viewing of this film.  The soundtrack along with the images makes this movie a vision of beautiful tapestry.<br /><br />It wasn't until after I watch Solaris (2002) that I realized this film was a remake of a Russian film.  I did seek the original and have to say that in juxtaposition, both movies are very different.  The original (also called Solaris made in 1972) is very philosophical and focuses more humankind, where the remake is also philosophical, not as much as the 1972 version, but really focuses on a romance storyline.  I have to be honest I feel many romance centered plots are cheesy and/or insipid.  Nevertheless, I found the romance storyline in Solaris to be absolutely divine.<br /><br />I also felt this was a strong performance for George Clooney and it seemed like it was a role that he hadn't tackled at that point in his career.  I also felt Natascha McElhnoe was hypnotic in this film.  There were times she appeared malicious and others where she was figurehead of love.  Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies also provide some wonderful acting jobs in this movie.  I give Steven Soderbergh credit, he was brave enough to allow music, atmosphere, editing and set design play a huge part in this movie.  This can be a difficult ruse to pull off and I feel he did a fine job.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of people who feel that this version is inferior to the original.  Perhaps if I had seen the 1972 version first I might share that opinion.  However, I feel this remake can stand on its own two feet.  I don't think Steven Soderbergh was trying to recreate the original, just add some new texture to it.  It was interesting to see a Russian version and an American version of the same film.  That would be a wonderful social sciences endeavor.  For instance, in the American version all of the actors/actresses are very attractive where in the Russian version they are more \\"average\\" looking.<br /><br />Overall for a \\"Hollywood-ized\\" remake of a classic sci-fi film, I found Solaris to be a great film and a deviation from the standard Hollywood movie i.e. flat characters, tons of CGI, shoddy editing, pointless plot and poor directing.  I can totally understand if Solaris isn't taken in by everyone.  It is slow and is really more of subdued romance disguised as a sci-fi movie.  I can also see how people who love the 1972 version might find this remake as heresy.  Consequently, I enjoyed and own both versions of Solaris and recommend them as wonderful and intelligent pieces of cinema.Steven Soderbergh credit, he was brave enough to allow music, atmosphere, editing and set design play a huge part in this movie.

0441172717|5.0|Written over a period of six years, DUNE first appeared in the pages of ANALOG magazine and was thereafter rejected by one publisher after another until a tiny publishing house named Chilton took it on in 1965. It received considerable critical praise and numerous awards, but it was no more than a marginal commercial success until the early 1970s, when it at last began to reach an audience beyond the core of science-fiction fans who so praised it--and in fact its designation as a \\"science-fiction masterpiece\\" prevented me from reading the book from well over a decade, for science-fiction is not a genre I particularly enjoy.<br /><br />But I will make an exception for DUNE. This may seem an odd comparison, but in a certain sense it is somewhat like GONE WITH THE WIND: it is long, it is flawed, and it is occasionally silly in a stylistic sense--but you just can't stop reading the damn thing. To pick up DUNE is to find yourself locked in its pages until exhaustion claims you, and on the three occasions I have read the book I have done so over the course of a single day. Such is the power of Herbert's vision and narrative that nothing else matters.<br /><br />An outline of the plot reads like \\"space opera\\" of the least inspired variety: an ecologically hostile planet becomes the center of galactic intrigue due to the fact that is the only known source of a substance--in this instance described as a \\"spice.\\" But what Hebert does with the idea is completely unexpected. DUNE is not a tedious rehash of Edgar Rice Burroughs; it is an astonishing portrait of an unexpectedly plausible civilization in which politics, religion, and corruption begin to spin wildy out of control.<br /><br />Perhaps the single most astonishing thing about DUNE is that there really isn't much in the way of \\"science\\" in this science-fiction. Not only is this a universe in which computers are forbidden, they are plausibly forbidden--and while Herbert is adept at inventing (and, perhaps even more difficult, convincingly naming) futuristic equipment, he doesn't actually spend a tremendous amount on it. The items simply exist in much the same way as you or I might regard a cup and saucer. It is a turn of mind that makes these devices remarkable plausible.<br /><br />Moreover, it has the effect of focusing the story on the characters, the civilization, and the planet itself. And it is here that Herbert really knocks the ball out the park: Duke Leto, Lady Jessica, Paul, Chani--every character is remarkably well rendered, their backgrounds and struggles and ambitions equally so, and the ecology of the planet an overriding concern as the struggle to survive in what is easily one of the most hostile enviroments ever to spring forth from a writer's mind.<br /><br />Herbert wrote several more DUNE novels before his death and his son has continued the series. I have sampled a few, and while I'm sure many will disagree, I have to say that they should have left well enough alone; there is only one DUNE, and this is it. And if you have seen the truly dire film version--don't let that stop you from picking up the book. Because once you do, you won't put it down until you turn the last page.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerming) futuristic equipment, he doesn't actually spend a tremendous amount on it.

1401300529|5.0|If you want to understand the Cold War and Vietnam, you should start with this excellent work about the war in Korea. Here you will find a thoughtful explanation about global politics circa 1946-1953, how America struggled to  define its position as one of two superpowers, and how a lack of preparation for war[only 9 years after Pearl Harbor!] lead to near complete disaster in Korea. But much more awaits the reader; here are fascinating behind the scenes views on Kim Il-Sung, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedung, Chiang Kai Shek and the China lobby; Harry Truman, Dean Acheson, Douglas MacArthur, Matthew Ridgway, George C. Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, and their subordinates, some brilliant, courageous and noble; others selfish, arrogant, foolish and venal.<br />Learn why two, then four nations stumbled in to a brutal, bloody war that neither wanted; how failure in intelligence on BOTH sides lead to horrendous battlefield losses; how efforts at a truce after one year of fighting were sabotaged by Far Eastern high command, ultimately leading to the famous dismissal of MacArthur by Truman, and how a close reading of the record by Halberstam shows the facts, vindicating Truman and diminishing MacArthurs military record.<br />The lessons are timely, as current events have again shown us the tragedy of intelligence failures, the need for balance in government, and the central role of a free press in democratic societies.<br />A minor criticism: the book would benefit from more and better maps of the battlefields. Also, there is little discussion of the air war, which proved essential for the UN forces to counter the manpower advantage of the Chinese.<br />Every concerned citizen should read this book.

B000SBUCEA|3.0|First of all, let me say that I will almost always purchase anything related to ELP if it contains new or unreleased music regardless of how much duplication there might be.   That being said, I was excited to see that the track listing had several tunes listed as being different versions than otherwise available.  This is only somewhat the case.  To my disappointment, \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\" is the very same as released on \\"In the Hot Seat\\" instead of the extended version hardcore fans have wondered about since the release of that album.  Indeed, the track listing on this site currently says (ext) beside this song.     Additionally, \\"Take a Pebble\\" is the original studio version, not the Lyceum live recording as advertised.  Too bad.  This is the one with Lake singing about a dog named Blue that was on the original \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" / \\"Rock and Roll Your Eyes\\" movie.  Canario is also the original studio version and not the rehearsal (as noted here and on the picture of the back of the box).  I am also rather sure that the alternative versions of \\"Jerusalem\\" and \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\" are the original ones used on \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\".  What makes them alternative I suppose, is that they are different than the Sanctuary Remastered version of BSS.    Coincidentally, the track list was also very misleading on Emerson's \\"At the Movies\\" set which said it contained \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" which fortunately later showed up on \\"Off the Shelf\\". I will admit that there is usually a different mix for one or more songs not identified as such which sometimes mitigates the disappointment of not getting what you expect. Haven't yet discovered any of these here.    It truly puzzles me how poorly their later products have been produced and marketed.  There are misspellings, omissions of/and incorrect detail related to this box set and other recent products.  This promised to be a wonderful collection of rarities.  Also, any real ELP fan (and less face it, who else wouldbuy something like this) already has the Manticore Special (DVD-disc 6).  Of course I am assuming this is what it is since it will not play on my DVD player.  This could have been left out and the set could have been sold for less.  For that matter, they only needed a couple of discs to house the unreleased product.    On the bright side, \\"Oh My Father\\" is a great tune albeit not as fully developed as it could have been.  I wish there was more music during this time period (when Greg Lake's voice was so passionate).  Despite the aforementioned absence of \\"Blue\\", the Lyceum tunes and the Mar Y Sol festival are very decent recordings displaying the raw energy evident within the band at that time.  Different versions of \\"Father Christmas\\" and \\"C'est La Vie\\" are also worthy.  The booklet has great pictures and interviews.    ELP will forever be my favorite band.  I knew I was getting little new when I purchased this.  I just didn't realize it was even less than advertised.  All this said, and sadly, I would still buy it for what I did not already have.  On 2nd thought, maybe the marketing was spot-on!     Cheers.
6304057709|5.0|I love this movie.  I watch it at least 5 times per year or more; it's one of my all time favorites.  The acting, the setting, the story is superb.  Can't say enough about Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Kate Winslet.

055357342X|5.0|In the longest book of the series so far, the lands of Westeros are no closer to peace than when we last left them. Filled with jaw-dropping twists, ASoS was very easy to get lost in for hours upon hours.<br /><br />=part three of the A Song of Ice and Fire series=
B000URDEB0|1.0|The loss of Tarja is way to evident, in Dark Passion Play.  From the Moment that Anette starts to sing,you can no longer call this Nightwish anymore. Tarja had a voice that boomed over the loud rifts and the symponetic keyboard,  but Anette sounds like a lost pop star girl in a metal band.  A combination that when put together really sounds bad.  Her is for Tarja's solo carrier.  It should be way better then the current Nightwish.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I love Rufus Wainwright, and to me this represents some of his best work.  I also like his current (2007) album, but if I could own only one, this would be it.  Like another reviewer (and probably many) said, it is true and wonderful poetry at work in song.  Highly recommended!
B00005JPLW|4.0|I bought two editions of the 2-disc 300 DVD.  One in steelcase, similar to that for The Departed.  Another is in the ordinary case but with a miniature Spartan helmet.  Each edition cost Philippine Peso 1,250 (under $28).  But I even got Phil Peso 200 (around $4.45) discount for pre-booking an order.<br /><br />While this movie pales in comparison to another Frank Miller novel-turned-movie, Sin City, the packaging alone is worth it.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Being a casual Springsteen fan I think I can objectively say that this is Springsteen's best original album since Born in the U.S.A. I actually prefer what Springsteen has done in the last 2-3 years over much of his older material. That being said there are some great songs on this cd, my favs are: Radio Nowhere, You'll Be Comin' Down, Livin' in the Future, Girls in their Summer Clothes, I'll Work For Your Love and Terry's Song. For under $10 go buy it, you won't regret it.
0553579908|5.0|ACoK is a tad longer than its predecessor, and filled with even more deception, betrayal, and intrigue. I really enjoy the point-of-view changes for each chapter, as they make the book feel like a soap opera, with some scenes playing out in chronological order and some happening simultaneously with other chapters.<br /><br />=part two of the A Song of Ice and Fire series=

0440241413|2.0|I can see the author is trying to be cute and funny, but it's not actually funny.  I mean, it's funny at first, but then after awhile it starts to feel like a 'madcap comedy about a bumbling addict trying to score some blow, while running into zany predicaments, with unpredictable and hilarious results!'  Yeah, not actually funny... she's so out of control with her purchases, and even when she starts to figure it out she doesn't take it seriously.<br /><br />Good news?  It made me take a good hard look at my own finances and see that rationalizations about sales and discounts are just that, rationalizations.  Hopefully shopaholic was depressing enough that I might think of her when I shop.  So... morality tale instead of chicklit, not exactly what I was looking for.  But I guess it works.
B000UJCALI|1.0|Ain't they beat this horse to death yet?  This overblown, over-hyped, overacted, and over-distributed filmmaking debacle is now being released as a special 2-Disc Special Edition.  Pardon me while I play the grand piano...<br /><br />Originally released in 1980(?), this stinker is based on the novel by Stephen King.  As in most cases, the book is 50 times better--not to mention SCARIER--than this movie.  A friend of mine accompanied me to the cinema to see this when it was first released.  We both had such HIGH hopes:  directed by Stanley Kubrick, starring Jack Nicholson--what could possibly go wrong?  Fifteen minutes into the movie and we both realized MUCH had gone wrong.<br /><br />The novel was about a man's GRADUAL descent into madness.  Nicholson's characterization of Jack Torrence was absolutely despicable from the outset.  It was as if he only tolerated his wife and child.  He took the job of overseer at the Overlook Hotel in Colorado because he thought it would jump-start his writing career.  Once they family arrived at the hotel, I was hoping that would jump-start something.  Disappointed yet again.<br /><br />Shelly Duvall plays Wendy Torrence.  Her's was the ONLY performance I thought was believable.  She managed to capture confusion, horror, and pathos all at the right times.  I don't remember the cherub who played Danny, the son.  The only thing I remember was how ridiculous he looked with his \\"talking finger.\\"  See, Danny had the gift to \\"shine\\"--see the future; predict the future--whatever you want to call it--and in the book his imaginary friend Tony always \\"appeared\\" when something bad was going to happen.  How difficult would it have been for Kubrick to simply shoot this?  TOTALLY unbelievable and COMPLETELY ridiculous!  And it only gets worse.<br /><br />Many have said this movie is the \\"scariest of all time.\\"  Yeah, right; and these are magic beans...  Kubrick, it is said, contacted King and asked him how he would feel if \\"he killed everyone.\\"  I'm glad King at least balked at that.  Kubrick had already bastardized most of his book, including completing overlooking the fact that it was the heating system that held that hotel together.  If you let it overheat, all hell would break loose.  AND he had the original hero of the book (Halloran--played here by Scatman Crothers) fly back from Miami to get hit in the chest with an axe and die.<br /><br />I'm not sure but I think the movie last about 3 days.  It is rated R for retarded.  So many have said that Kubrick paid so much detail to how the movie was shot.  It's a shame that's the ONLY thing he was concerned about.at that.

157912626X|5.0|Many Agatha Christie fans love Hercule Poirot and detest Miss Jane Marple. I love them both, and after many re-readings of the Christie canon, I think overall I prefer Miss Marple.  \\"The Body in the Library\\" is one of the books that nudges me toward the Miss Marple camp.    The plot is one of Christie's best. Characters are above average. The pacing is excellent.  The humor sparkles. This is definitely a \\"fair play\\" detective story.  I don't want to spoil the plot by giving out any clues, but Miss Marple herself states that you shouldn't believe what people say.  Even with Miss Marple's warning I let Miss Christie lead me down the garden path.     Agatha Christie is the best, and \\"The Body in the Library\\" is one of her best.  Read and enjoy.
0441172717|4.0|An anomaly for me. The world Herbert created here is so rich and engulfing that instead of reading all the sequels I shy away from them, afraid they might taint the aftertaste of this masterpiece.

B000SSV8HI|3.0|I'm usually not a music snob and will give 5 stars to anything that will \\"get me rockin'\\" in my BarkoLounger, but, regarding The Biggest Bang . . .<br /><br />Venues too big (I'm here for the performance, not the audience.  Big does not guarantee good).  Performers too old, too jaded (Nothing wrong with age, I'm getting old. But they are tired of it, and acting . . . except maybe Kieth, who still digs it).  Photography too selective (I can read the inscription on Keith's guitar pick, but the camera won't come within twenty feet of Mick's face).  Stage too colossal (so that the audience a quarter mile back can see the big screen, but I don't need that.  Way too much empty space on stage . . . and my TV screen).  Selections too redundant (with all of the Stone's source material, no need for all the repeats).  Sound too imbalanced (too much Mick singing/reciting into the mic, not enough Rolling Stones band).  Too contrived.  Too insensitive.  (And too expensive).<br /><br />There is so much to see that the camera won't hold on more than 4 seconds of anything (go ahead, time it yourself).  This thing is to music what a schlocky 4-day commercial cruise is to \\"pleasure boating\\".  This thing is to music what Las Vegas is to \\"architecture\\".  This thing is to music what my Review is to a \\"yes or no\\" question.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm not going to rubber stamp this just because it's the Rolling Stones.  The 4 disc DVD is a huge quantity of high end live music on an epic scale . . . presented poorly.
0553573403|5.0|I'm a sucker for big, chunky books. I'm also quite fond of long, epic, series. This book delivers on both those counts. I finished it only an hour ago and I am already itching to pick up its successor.<br /><br />=part one of the A Song of Ice and Fire series=
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Having heard the two singles, \\"The Unthinking Majority\\" and \\"Empty Walls,\\" dozens of times on the radio, I knew I wanted to buy this album, even though it's not my typical music choice and I'm not familiar at all with Tankian's previous works or SOAD. The songs were catchy, they stayed in my head, and when I actually bothered to take a listen to the lyrics I was surprised and impressed by the complexity and politics.    So, being a naive newcomer to Tankian, I bought the album, figuring it would be some dozen tracks just like the two singles. Not true, and in the best way possible.    While Elect the Dead is a decidedly cohesive album in style and musicality, after the two title tracks it is surprisingly more introspective than I would have guessed. After listening through the album the first time, I was left with a feeling altogether different than the one I had from the singles. It was a much richer, deeper sense than the go-go-go politicism of Unthinking Majority and Empty Walls. Tankian has far more layers to his music than mere social commentary. While I won't deny that there's such commentary throughout the lyrics, there exist emotions above and beyond this social commentary. There are moments of melancholy and curiosity, eloquently conveyed by Tankian's voice. The man can shout his lyrics with the best, but he can also slow and draw his voice out into a despairing line, calling emotions up in the listener.    One element that's definitely carried through to several tracks is the juxtaposition heard in Empty Walls -- going from five hundred miles an hour to five, wild one moment and tender the next. The way Tankian does it, even though the various modes may sound entirely different taken individually, the elements complement each other in each individual song. The transitions hold your attention, and Tankian masterfully makes the transitions not repetitive so much as surprising. Sometimes you think you know what's coming next -- especially in \\"Sky Is Over\\" --and it's something entirely different.    There really are so many surprises on the album. Little musical riffs, things that appear only once but are so enticing you have to play the track over again just to hear that one little element, the way you never know what's coming next until at least the second time listening, and a final track that I can only liken to a funeral dirge.    And after I had listened to the album, I turned around and started listening to it all over again. If you've heard the singles and expect an entire album of the same, this is something better. It's similar, and it's definitely the voice of a single artist, but it's not just more of the same.
0060920084|3.0|Like most of Bryson's books, especially \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" which is his exhaustive book about Australia, he could have had the same effect in 100 fewer pages. I, as someone who has also published a travel book and numerous articles, love the history and culture of these places, but it rambles. And Bryson is, as usual, condescending. As someone who moved from the coastal elite towns of LA and DC to the Heartland or \\"Nowheresville,\\" Bryson should not mock places like Des Moines so much. Iowa's capital city, like the rest of America's heart, is a great place to live and visit. That he spent time in London, where Muslim Jihadists threaten to take over each day, and loved it, is telling. Nonetheless, even a pompous liberal elite like Bryson, when talented, can be entertaining.

B000VK99Z6|3.0|This was the first movie I downloaded to my Tivo and the process was really simple.  I love the feature, the movie was not quite as perfect.  I really liked Shaun of the Dead and had high hopes as these are the same actors.  The movie is NOT bad, it just lacks plot and direction.  I still thought it was worth watching, but I am glad it only cost me $.99!
0393057658|5.0|Not much I can add that has not already been mentioned about this revolutionary book. It does get a tad repetitive and wordy in the economic theory portions, but the fact that pro baseball teams, their scouts, and other top brass utilize Lewis and Beane's theories prove this book has merit. Moneyball is an indictment of all the socialist baseball haters who think money wins baseball games. This is clearly proven false each year, starting with the Athletics nearly a decade ago.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|This album is good, I have been waiting for a few of these songs to come out after I saw him in concert.  I really want you was better live, but it's great!
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I wold recommend reading the full TekkonKinkreet graphic novel before watching the film.  I also recommend Blue Spring, a live-action adaptation of Taiyo Matsumoto's work and the best example of a manga adaptation I've encountered.
B000T7FO6E|4.0|After three spins, I'd say Live At Soundstage ranks as Ringo's finest live CD to date. On the plus side, it features nothing but solo Ringo & some of his Beatles material, unlike his star-studded all-starr band albums. It also isn't marred by long story introductions, which was the point of the equally fine VH1 Storytellers disc (great stories...you just don't want to hear them each time you play the CD).    The only negative I can think of is they cut a fine live version of Ringo's Give Me Back The Beat, one of Choose Love's (2005) highlights. I also wish he'd treat us to more of his always fine drum work. He does pick up the sticks on Choose Love, Back Off Boogaloo & Boys at least.    That said, you get GREAT performances of Octopus's Garden, I'm The Greatest, Don't Pass Me By, Never Without You and Choose Love. In fact, the whole set is filled with energetic live versions that are faithful to the studio recordings. It's a fun CD I'm sure I'll return to again and again.
B000GPI15K|5.0|With a music library of over 1400 CDs, I listen to a lot of musical variety, but I have to have my daily fix of Mythologies, and have now for a whole year.  Maybe I'm \\"in it too deep\\" to give a reasonable review, but I think Patricia Barber`s compositions about several Greek mythical figures are extraordinary beyond words because they strike at so many levels.  It is very listenable as background music, although the first piece, The Moon, as a bookend, has a somewhat unapproachable (to some) intro.  But then the rhythm kicks in and everyone takes off.  On a musical level, the songs fascinate me at every listen, with her melodies, voice, unusual timings and long time-close knit innovative quartet creating exciting phrases, verses, solos and refrains, giving us little breaks long enough to catch our breath.  Her totally current interpretation of the stories is intelligently descriptive and poetic, at times conversational, and expresses the essence of their timeless relationship to us all.  How many of us need Morpheus, the god of dreams, to help us sleep?  And Pygmalion, who creates a love that cannot love in return, is certainly universal.  Then there's Hunger, too often insatiable.  Icarus is driven to soar and fly above the masses, while Orpheus wallows in the despair of loss.  Provocative Persephone mesmerizes and evokes the need to reveal both our admirable and our dark sides.  Narcissus - we must love our own self to enable the deepest connection to another.  The dual destruction of native cultures and our Earth is contrasted in Whiteworld and Phaeton, while musically integrating some rap and a large vocal chorus.  The Hours is the other bookend and the time of our lives.  I've given many copies of Mythologies to loved ones, desiring to share this incredible gift that I enjoy every day.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I really like Stargate Atlantis.  We own all 3 seasons. It is clean enough for children, there is good character development, and it is interesting enough to hold adult interest. Good choice for science fiction lovers.
B000UFAURI|5.0|I was not the biggest fan of In Your Honor, so when this hit the shelves, I was hoping it would not be in the vein of that album.  It sure isn't.  This is a nice blend of the sound like One By One and There Is Nothing Left To Loose.  Heavy and fast with a few slowed down songs.  Sure, they released the first track \\"The Pretender\\" as the first single, usually a sign of failure of an album.  That track is strong, but so is the rest of the album.  Let it die, erase/replace, and the ballad of beaconsfield miners are all great tracks.  Well mixed, and sorted in order.  A must have for any FOO FAN, or good intro to what the Foo fighters have been doing for over 10 years now.  buy this album

B000002UAU|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to buy this masterpiece. Guess I was just afraid of being disappointed. So I took the chance and bought it. Man, was I wrong! Now I know why everyone talks nothing but praise about this album. From \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" to \\"A Day in the Life\\" there is not a single bad song on this album. This is one album I can listen to front to back all the way through and not stop until it's done (The other being \\"Appetite for Destruction\\")     I should've known how great it was. I've always liked the Beatles. Forget about anyone calling the Beatles \\"More hype than talent\\" There are reasons why they are among the top selling/influential/listened to bands of all time and the biggest selling band in U.S. history. Because they have the talent to back it up. Just listen to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and you'll see exactly what I mean. I also recommend everything else by them as well.     LONG LIVE THE BEATLES!!
B000VKW7AK|5.0|This is the box set that I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams.  If you are a metal/thrash fan, this is the pinicle of all box sets, and you need to have this here.  All the classic tracks, new live tracks, rare tracks like Duke Nukem, Coming Home, One Thing in one spot and not scattered on all the soundtracks of import versions of albums is an asset. Plus the Live DVD of Megadeth on Clash of The Titans, what more needs to be said.  This is a no brainer, and the price is right for the taking. Storm The Stores and Declair War, get the Warchest!!!!

B000JLTRIQ|4.0|Viewers of Oliver Stone films usually fall into two camps: those that admire his work and those that don't. I tend to like most of the director's films that I have watched and \\"World Trade Center\\" is no different.<br /><br />As is obvious by the title, the film takes place during that horrific day in September six years ago when the city of New York, along with the rest of the world, turned upside down due to the devastating attack on the city's landmark structures. Stone doesn't show too much of the archival footage of the death and destruction and that is probably for the best. The images are too ingrained into the American psyche that filmgoers and fill in the blanks, themselves.<br /><br />Instead, the film deals with two policemen trapped under the rumble and their struggles to survive, along with the worried families and the subsequent rescue attempts.<br /><br />Both Nicholas Cage - an actor that I usually don't like - and Micheal Pena acquaint themselves well as the cops. The actors really deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenjaal, Broadway veteran Donna Murphy are quite good as suffering wives of the trapped and fallen.<br /><br />Impressive cinematography by Seamus McGarvey and Craig Armstrong's' powerful score are other highlights of Stone's film.<br /><br />It is obvious that Stone sought to make a film that is in honor of those that suffered that fateful day and the director succeeds in crafting something for the mainstream, something that he's probably not done before.

1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again.  I remember first hearing about Afghanistan many years ago and not really knowing where it was on a map.  How interesting it was to read about Afghan history: the Soviet invasion and the Taliban from another point of view, people living through it.  This story is gripping.  Nothing is spared in its writing; it's raw and out there.  Wonderfully done.
0743298039|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this book.  It grabbed me from the beginning.  Not so much a ghost story as described but I do recommend this book.  The ending kind of petered out and I was disappointed, but all in all a very good book!
B0000507R2|4.0|This is a very nice sounding version of this album. You have to have a DVD player to play this version, and better yet one that plays DVD-A to get the most out of this specific format.    WHAT I LIKE - It plays at a higher resolution for better sound. You can view the lyrics on your TV and watch a video of song, \\"Carnival\\" although it is not in the high-resolution audio format.    WHAT I DON'T LIKE - If you have a 2-channel audio system, your player may not down-convert the multi-channel format into 2-channel stereo sound like you may be familiar with on regular CD. This format seem to have more delay in between tracks than on a regular CD. It took me some getting used to. It's much more of an annoyance with artists that intertwine songs together like Pink Floyd - DVD-Audio will break up these transitions.
0060763892|2.0|This was my first experience with a James Rollins book. Perhaps because of my biology background, I find the premise of the book to be totally off the reality map.  The plasmids and change in character of a bacterium is fine, however the incorporation into the human genome is a bit too far fetched especially to the extent he takes it. The resolution to the epidemic makes no sense.  Plotting a course from Christmas Isand to a minute location in Thailand by the actions of a few crabs is beyond reality.  For anyone who has been to Angkor Bot, Istanbul the story lacks credibility.  The all powerful bad guys and the silent genius who figures everything out in the nick of time.  True action needs to be credible.  To many leaps in logic and faith.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|I listen to this album almost every day since I bought it a couple of weeks ago.At first I wasn't as impressed as I was with the previous album but the songs grow on you and become addictive and now I hear them in my head while I work.I recommend you buy it if you enjoyed his previous album as much as most people did

B000TX7B5U|2.0|Serj is a hard-working, creative guy. I just wish that the music on the record was as interesting as the album art. The singles are about the only memorable tracks from the record. It's a self-indulgent SOLO record , which at times reminds one of some SOAD stuff that is stop-go-stop type writing. I hate to say it, but it's VERY disappointing. Sorry.    Let's hear that Scars on Broadway and see if that's ANy good.     About time for a SOAD left-overs record.    TOOL RULES!    A
0141439785|3.0|Thomas Hardy, while certainly an extremely talented author, seemingly had the knack of producing Victorian-era soap operas which never fails to depress even the most cheerful soul.  Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles), but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity.  This mayor is one twisted, selfish and self-loathing individual.  He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head, and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved.  Fun guy?  Nope.  And there isn't even a happy ending.<br /><br />Bottom line: nice characterizations and fine prose amount to lipstick on a sow.  Not recommended.
B000SSS05Q|5.0|This is Tom Waits best album. I personally like his later work better myself on a whole, but this early offering from 1975, remains to be my above all favorite. The reason I think, is because it's the real Tom Waits. What I mean by this, is that, as a poet/writer, sometimes I think that the guy takes a lot of different angles and themes to make up his songs. On Nighthawks, you get Tom Waits being Tom Waits. Playing live for a small and intimate crowd. The material on this album really hits it home for me. Not overly complex, jazzy, beatnick type stuff. Low volume.<br /><br />I own this on an old double LP, but format isn't very important. I always listen to this one around 3am when I'm the only one awake. Low decible volume does justice here. I love the raspy talk up sessions he puts on between songs. \\"I've had some scary patty melts at Norms... some prevocative veal cutlets at the Copper Penny, where what you get is a salsbury steak, in the shake and bake, with a lovely sauce made of velveeta and half&half, then smothered in Campbells tomato soup...\\"<br /><br />Kicked off with the Emotional Weather Report, where he claims that \\"things are tough all over...\\" the theme always surrounds the people that I've always known and loved. The Nighthawks. The Last call, last game of 8-ball crowd. A perfect album. Mellow stuff, not a second is wasted on my ears.<br /><br />I reviewed the LP, only because I already reviewed the CD like a hundred years ago... You can find the CD here at Amazon, and I recommend that you do!
B000TX7B5U|5.0|very deep and strong lyrics from serj, which we all know u can pull off.<br />i was very ify about his solo cd but i poped it in and i said wow.<br />if u are expecting hard core soad this isnt what you are looking for. this plays smooth with some signs of metal. but it to me is a classic album from serj, it reminds me alot of toxicity (lyric wise)<br />for all soad fans it is a must buy.
B000002J0G|5.0|this was the first cd with unoriginal menbers james murphy and john tempesta?at first thought I was unsure but after listening this is brutally heavy.this made many people reconsider 80 thrash bands the set forth new standards in that realm of music. james has alway chosen to work with the cream of the crop(obituary,death,teastamen ect.)but this was put him in a hard spot replacing alex sckolnick(guitar god)but james stomped on alex's place out.James to thing to a higher level and could do anything alex did before ( you want proof live at the filmore listen to it)john tempesta (replaced louie )with surprisingly great referances(anthrax tech,exodus,slayer temp. then to white zombie)and did a  great job better than I thought he would do but left just after recording to be replaced by paul bostiph(formerly of forbidden/next move slayer 13 years+)with chuck,Eric,greg still there these two new guy with the 10 years in the sceane produced one of the memorible cds of the era and broke major new ground with this cd.this is a must have!
B000002GB9|5.0|1977's 'The Grand Illusion' is undoubtedly the definitive album from 70s arena rock group Styx. While the previous albums 'Equinox' and 'Crystal Ball' showed the band honing in more and more on the rock, pop and progressive rock hybrid that would characterize its most creatively and commerically successful period, 'The Grand Illusion' is the album that finally brought all of those influences together in one seamless, undeniable whole.<br /><br />The tremendous success of 'The Grand Illusion' launched Styx to superstar status, and deservedly so. The tension between three singer/songwriters was always Styx' greatest strength (as well as its Achilles' heel at times), and here the band finds its voice by balancing the classical melodicism of Dennis DeYoung, the melodic rock of Tommy Shaw, and the hard rock bombast of James \\"JY\\" Young. Though credited individually, songs like \\"The Grand Illusion\\", \\"Fooling Yourself\\", \\"Miss America\\" and \\"Come Sail Away\\"  -  perhaps the definitive Styx song  -  reveal the strengths of each of the band members in turn, providing a showcase for the band's instrumental, and particularly vocal chops. Less familiar tracks like \\"Superstars\\", \\"Man In The Wilderness\\" and \\"Castle Walls\\" are just as strong and round out one of the definitive rock albums of the 70s.<br /><br />Sterling Whitaker<br />Author, 'The Grand Delusion: The Unauthorized True Story of Styx'
B000003H3M|2.0|this cd dosen't represent testament in my eyes at all just a lost broke band lokking to cash in!yea I said that Eric and Chuck needed the money they got adamn fine drummer gene Hoglan(dark angel)and Eric's cousin Derek Ramirez and Glen Alvelaz(ex-forbidden)to but down some  solo's.thishad alot of possiblities to be a great cd but it ends up being just a poorly exicuted death metal cd that has only one great song track to my demonic the title track n the main reason to own this cd or just buy the best of with it on it and the draw the line & sails of carion, covers on them.this d just dose not excite me it possible hit the bargin bin quicker then metallica's load/reload cds or new GnR cd.It just is not great thrash that testament known for they might reach for death metal sound and riffs sometimes but that's not what most fans like from them.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I have to speak out on this incredible, life changing album. It is truly, hands down one of the best recordings ever made! Seldom is music as powerful and spiritual as this. Even if we never hear her voice again, this masterpiece is worth a lifetime's work and more. These songs are for the living who dwell among the dead. They help you to hope and focus and survive. How can I ever thank you enough - Dearest Ms. Hill!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is the version of \\"Serenity\\" that should have been released originally.  As a movie taken on it's own merits, it is a supremely well cast, written and acted ride. To those who followed the \\"Firefly\\" series however, it's a promise fulfilled and just maybe a ground-breaker for yet another movie based around the series.  The key is the second disc, comprising  commentary from film maker Joss Wheden and members of the cast who not only fill in the sort of detail and background one expects in a disc of \\"Bonus Material\\", but communicate a love of this film's (and the Firefly series) premise and the unusually vibrant chemistry that manifests itself not only to the spectator, but pretty obviously to all the people involved in the film/show as well.  It is obviously a labor of Love that reaches out to the viewer and if you have the sci-fi bug, pulls you in and engages you on a whole range of levels.  I absolutely recommend buying the Firefly collection AND this collector's edition of Serenity and watching them in that order.  It's like a book you don't want to end, and when it does, you can't wait to start again.  As Joss Wheden says in his commentary...\\"there's something happening here, and now you're part of it.\\"  Great great stuff.
B0007OCG56|5.0|I would like to express my dismay at seeing the measly 3.5 stars this film has received. It is witty, hilarious, touching, and beautiful. Yes, it has comedy actors Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. Yes, the description sounds bland and like it will shove cultural points at you and yes, it seems like it might just be a chick flick.     All of these things couldn't be more wrong. Spanglish may not be a blockbuster hit but then, Click was, so who's to judge for godssake. You can't always trust the multitudes on these things.     With a smart and funny spirit, Spanglish teaches the importance of family and the gorgeous points of a real woman without a hint of preaching. Somehow...there's no way to get across how this is a film for people of all kinds and how surprising it is in its uniqueness, so I just wanted to give my opinion and add another 5 stars for Spanglish.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|If you are a Quentin Tarantino fan, then you will not be overly disappointed.... it has some slick dialogue and some great scenes of Carnage along with some superb car chase scenes....  My only crisitim is the length of the movie and extended dialogue between the two halves of the movie - I think it is not necessary.  This DVD is the extended and unrated version.  Having not seen the other versions I am probably assuming your not missing much and probably be better off with the \\"normal\\" version.   The extended features are great with some in-depth interviews and all that.  Overall a cool movie, but I think Planet Terror will be far better than this.

0060763280|2.0|I was unimpressed with this book.  The basic premise here is auto-suggestion, covered much better by other authors.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I got this for my Mom for her birthday, she had never seen it before. My Mom does not watch TV and is very picky about movies, and there is almost NOTHING we both like. She loves Jane Austin movies, I tend to prefer Fight Club and other dark themes.<br /><br />This is one of the few things we could both appreciate. We stayed up all night watching the DVD's and laughing. It's a great show, and one that people who don't normally like this sort of thing can enjoy.<br /><br />Frankly, anything that my Mom and I can both enjoy and agree upon is a frikken miracle.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have had this little flash for a few months now, and I absolutely love it. I use it on my D80 with the 18-200mm lens and get great results with much longer range and much less red-eye than the pop-up flash.    *It sits just high enough to not create shadow with a longer lens, but not high enough to get in the way.    *It is small enough to fit in my smallest camera bag.    *Battery life (with standard AAs) is great.    *One of the nicest features is the swiveling lens/reflector to bounce off of a ceiling or (even better) a small reflector card to diffuse the light a little more.  Doing this will get much more natural looking results.
0553381350|4.0|Bang! Zoom! Pow!<br /><br />If you like prose that crackles like sparklers in your eyes, and tells a good story besides, then Tom Wolfe's \\"The Right Stuff\\", about the Mercury 7 spaceflight program of the early 1960s, is for you.<br /><br />Published in 1979, back when the U.S. was the world's laughing stock and \\"malaise\\" was the operative word from the White House, \\"The Right Stuff\\" calls to mind with equal degrees of snark and awe a time when real heroes walked the earth and flew beyond and around it. Men, yes, but heroes, too. Wolfe never lets go of the human element, in fact, the best thing \\"The Right Stuff\\" has going for it.<br /><br />As a non-fiction novel, it has its limitations, too. Wolfe doesn't make up quotes, he hardly quotes the seven Mercury astronauts at the center of the story, except for flight transcripts and press conferences where their words are public record. But he doesn't seem to channel theirs or anyone else's voices, except Wolfe's own.<br /><br />Beginning with the book's title, he uses a lot of terms to capture what the early U.S. space program, and the test flights on experimental jets leading up to it, were really about. Terms like \\"the great ziggurat\\" \\"flying & drinking and drinking & driving\\", \\"true brother\\", \\"the mighty integral\\", often in caps, get a lot of use even though there's no sign anyone ever used them or even thought them up before Wolfe did.<br /><br />There's an overall tone of omnipotence that feels smug and gets in the way: Never mind what was going through John Glenn's mind when he was wondering if Friendship 7's heat shield had burned up on atmospheric reentry - here's what he REALLY MUST have thought!<br /><br />But the book is so entertaining, it really compensates for Wolfe's excesses. The astronauts were not breaking new ground; everything they did the Soviets did too, except sooner and for longer durations. But they were putting their lives on the line as investments toward a larger purpose, an achievement no other country has matched in close to 40 years, landing on the moon. And they were also disproving the notion that Americans after World War II were doomed to failure, that \\"our boys always botch it\\" mentality which hung over the country at the time (and which by 1979 was back with a vengeance).<br /><br />Sharp, funny, and full of graspable insights (the riders of the first Mercury capsules had as much control over their craft as does a Ferris-wheel rider), \\"The Right Stuff\\" may settle for entertainment over enlightenment, but it is very entertaining.er country has matched in close to 40 years, landing on the moon.

1400049628|2.0|\\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is quite an oddity. Not really funny enough to really be a successful parody and not serious enough (because, let's face it, the odds of an actual zombie attack are essentially nil) to be of any use. The book's main draw is that you can see Max Brooks' working out the material he'd put to vastly better use in his living-dead epic \\"[[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]].\\" So, I'd only recommend this to major fans of \\"World War Z.\\" If you haven't read \\"World War Z,\\" then you absolutely should read it before even considering \\"The Zombie Survival Guide.\\"
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Simply the best show on television and a wonderful movie.  A story this great, and characters so wonderful, are a rare creation.  I've only recently discovered this show and I've fallen in love with it.    The Special Edition is absolutely worth buying for the additional features, and to show continued support for a possible sequel.
B00078XGRO|4.0|Coming off the disappointing film that was \\"Star Trek Generations\\", I was hoping that this film would give this series a boost. After viewing, I was thrilled that this film did just that, and then some. I really liked this one, its one of the best in the entire Star Trek film series. Again, the important thing is that the plot to the basic story to the movie is good. The crew has to travel back in time to stop the Borg from assimilating the human race in the past, and make sure that humans make \\"first contact\\" with alien lifeforms. Though, the whole time travel thing has been done a lot, when done right, it still works. But I do think that a bit of this story is borrowed from the original Star Trek episode \\"Assignment: Earth\\". Again, I'm not a big fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation series, and I'm not too familiar with the cast, but I knew about the Borg storyline from the show. And it really does make for a good motion picture. The film starts quickly and flows nicely. Cast member Johnathan Frakes directs this one, and does a good job. And the acting is as good as you're gonna get in these films. Overall, this one is definitely worth watching and owning. Again, its one of the best in the Star Trek movie series.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Magic is an excellent album. It would be a career highlight for most artists. But this is not just another artist... this is the boss. The album is brimming with melody, wit and bite. As much as I like Magic, you will not find a song here to rival his best (Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands, Atlantic City, The River etc...) Mr. Springsteen is guilty of only one thing: He can not live up to his own master works (who could; look at the mess Paul McCartney's made over at Starbucks!) Springsteen's work still towers over most music in 2007.<br /><br />Magic takes a tour of Bruce's entire career and delivers bits and pieces of what his fans want. \\"Radio Nowhere\\" is ironically fit for any dj's play list. \\"You'll be coming down\\" sounds like it came from the early seventies. \\"Livin in the future\\" is vintage Boss (Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge...) \\"Girls in their summer clothes\\" splahes some California sunshine in the mix. Springsteen tells our story as hard working, misunderstood Americans. We hum along to his sad songs. Even in the darkness there is is light and hope. That's what this record is about. That is what our master songwriter (along with Dylan and Young) has always been about. And while I'd like another five star classic, I'll accept four star gold.

My favorite line from this collection: \\"I'll watch the bones in your back like the Stations of the Cross.\\" Magic, indeed. Thank God he's still writing these poignant tunes.
0743277457|3.0|Josh Waitzkin is an interesting person. The title suggests Josh has some insights on approaches to learning with general application to persons other than Josh, sadly not. From a learning perspective, theres little here more beyond freshman psychology and pop psych-101, perhaps the insight into the need to take breaks mid competition to maintain focus and reduce unforced errors is insightful but thats about it.     However for all that, this is a well written book and continues the story of Joshs life after the movie SFBF. The closing chapters, as Josh progresses his martial arts career, are particularly well written and entertaining, and i can see why so many other reviewers found it inspiring especially other martial artists. Of particular note is his learned ability to deal with cheating at many levels with equinimity.    Overall a worthy autobiography, but a massivly disappointment in relation to pedagogical content alluded to by the title. Overall worthy, and a testiment to human motivation, and will to win, and the adaptability of the human brain and body.
B00011D1RC|4.0|Grand Hotel was a pretty revolutionary concept in 1932. A film of seemingly unrelated multiple plotlines in which all or most of the main characters are played by established movie stars is nothing new to today's audience, but in 1932 it was groundbreaking and resulted in critical and commercial success, as well as an Academy Award for Best Picture - the only category it was nominated in.    The film is not just pushed by the sheer star power of its cast, possibly the greatest ever assembled on film, but the grand soap opera plot of love, deceit, sex, and murder makes it a classic with great rewatachability.    Warner Bros. has assembled a nice DVD edition of the film. The transfer has very little in the way of digital artifacting, but the source quality is not as clean and pristine as that of many films Warner Bros. has put onto DVD. There's minor warping at one point in the film, and the print is a bit grainier than one would desire. However, this is still quite possibly the best the film has ever looked or sounded, so I have no major complaints.    The DVD boasts a nice selection of bonus materials. A short 10-minute making-of documentary never really goes too in-depth, but still provides a nice glimpse of the making of the film. There's trailers for Grand Hotel and its remake, Weekend At The Waldorf, plus the short film Nothing Ever Happens, which was a parody of Grand Hotel. But the nicest bonus is the premiere footage. There's also a theater announcement for the film at Grauman's Chinese Theater.    To sum everything up, this DVD edition of Grand Hotel is about as good as it gets. I recommend this film for fans of classic cinema and fans of the cast. The print quality leaves a bit to be desired, but it still looks pretty good and a nice handful of bonus materials provide great entertainment value as well.
0783240236|5.0|With [[ASIN:0783225849 Psycho (Collector's Edition)]], Hitchcock managed to scare his audience halfway to death.  Although every movie of his can be considered thriller, that and this one are the only two that accurately portray the horror thriller title.    The Birds is, quite simply, about killer birds terrorizing the residents of a small town.  But nothing's that simple in an Alfred Hitchcock film.    The DVD includes a making of feature, the \\"alternate ending\\", and few other smaller features.    No Hitchcock collection is complete with it.    Must Have.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|A great CD and DVD package that is well worth including in one's music library. Michael does a wonderful job of singing old standards including some of Sinatra's hits. What most have left out of their reviews is the beautiful duet between Michael and the gorgeous Italian diva, Laura Pausini. One who truly admires Laura will really be in for a treat in the DVD.  Her entrance down the steps and joining Michael singing Lew Rawls' hit, \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\" oozes sex personified. Having lived in Sicily for six years allowed me to listen to a wide array of Italian singers.  Ms. Pausini is tops and does Michael well in the duet.  I recommend those who enjoy Laura check out her album sung entirely in English, \\"From The Inside Out\\" on the Atlantic label.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Dr. Strangelove, originally released in 1964, is an American classic.  Stanley Kubrick's wonderful direction, and the main player's incredible action really make this a must see.  This is considered a black comedy but I know a lot of people won't be in stitches.  It's not the type of laugh out loud comedy that's come accustomed.  It's the absurdity of the situation that'll have you chuckling.    It's a true end of the world nightmare that wasn't quite out of left field in the 60's and isn't there even today.    This 40th Anniversary releases features a stunning transfer in its original aspect ration (a few and only a few scenes are shot in 1.33), and plenty of featurettes on the second disc.  One of my favorites is the split screen interview.    Must Have.

B000UR9T8C|4.0|I will make this as brief as I possibly can.  I will first say I liked this one in general, for everything they were TRYING to do, but did not necessarily succeed in doing.  Very ambitious.  I thought Venom and the whole black suit story should have been saved for one movie exclusively devoted to that stuff.  I also think they should have used Lizard instead of Sandman.  I will say though that this one seemed more like a comic than the others in the sense that, you have the first two movies where there is an extensive amount of character development, like in comics, where the first, let's say, 6 or 7 issues, are about main character development.  And then after that, the hero fights different villains, sometimes they team up, etc. etc., and sometimes fights old foes.  That's kind of what I saw in Spider-man 3, so in a way it was like how comic series run.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Ok ..I strongly agree on saying the guy who did the review on this CD needs another job.. Seriously ..

This cd not only hits home but is awesome.. there honestly in my opinion isnt a bad song on the whole cd.. Love it & strongly recommend it.. Its an awesome start to a new beginning...
B00003CXCD|5.0|William Wyler's \\"Roman Holiday\\" is one of the very best, most charming fantasy/romantic comedies ever made. It is sweet, funny, simple, beautiful, and tender. It takes place in the eternal city of Rome during 24 hours that its heroine as well as every movie lover in the world will cherish for as long as they live. The heroine is a young princess, the sole heiress to the throne of an unnamed European country. One evening while visiting Rome, she decides to take a holiday from her royal duties and stiffing life style and explore Rome as one of commoners on her own. She is accompanied by an American newsman, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and his cameraman and sidekick, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert).<br /><br />Everything and everyone is perfect and highly enjoyable in \\"Roman Holiday\\". Wyler's idea to direct the film entirely in Rome proved to be extremely successful. The script by Dalton Trumbo is terrific. Peck as a handsome journalist who seems to hit a jack pot with the story about a runaway princess that can make him both famous and rich but whose plans collapsed when he fell in love with her was perfect for a role. So was Eddie Albert in his Oscar nominated performance.<br /><br />The film belongs to Audrey Hepburn. With her blend of innocence, vulnerability, inner strength, and real class, she was perfectly cast in her first Hollywood role that brought her the Oscar. Hepburn was the daughter of a Dutch Aristocrat mother and a British father. She spent the WWII years starving and hiding from Nazis in occupied Holland. The article from the time of \\"Roman Holiday\\"s release describes Audrey as an original, \\"A thin child-woman with irregular teeth, wide jawbone, flaring nostrils and upswept brows, yet she carries herself with ethereal grace and entrances with a smile both wistful and radiant, and has remarkably large and expressive eyes.\\" Gregory Peck predicted from the very first day of the shooting that Hepburn would win Academy Award for her performance and she'd become a huge star. She went to many screen successes including \\"Sabrina\\", \\"Breakfast at Tiffany\\", Charade, and \\"My Fair Lady\\" among others. Her death from cancer in 1992 at the age of 63 left a gap that will never be filled. There will never be another Audrey Hepburn but the final scene of her first film with the close-up of her marvelous face and that \\"wistful and radiant smile\\" will live forever as one of the cinema's most precious images.She went to many screen successes including \\"Sabrina\\", \\"Breakfast at Tiffany\\", Charade, and \\"My Fair Lady\\" among others.

This is a story about a person who is brilliant, knows he's right, and doesn't care what others think about him.  Truly a message for our time when so many are cowed by political correctness.  Bravo!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I don't typically jump in on such obvious conversations & reviews, because the overwhelming response is so right-on and, well, overwhelming, why bother (except for a few who decry the alleged hype, the alleged exclusive Jersey aesthetic, and various psychic revelations of some lack of authenticity, etc.)? Except when I pushed the CD into my MacBook Pro, pulled the Sennheisers over my ears, then hit play, a huge smile creased my face. I was back in the mid 70's, hanging out on the Asbury Park boardwalk in the late afternoon summer sun, waiting to head over to the Stone Pony to hear Bruce & the E Street Band play (the first time i heard them, I was too young to get in, so we hung outside listening...). Raw while polished, straining to hear lyrics that cut deep with such lyric poetry while the music found a visceral groove that compelled feet to dance... The distinctive howl of Clarence's sax, the cutting wail of Bruce's harmonica, his Tele cutting through the din along with Stevie's Strat with it's idiosyncratic cut-your-ears-off treble clarity, Max & the rest of this now-distinguished entourage paving a foundation that propelled the whole thing to R&R Nirvana...    A lotta miles have passed since those summers on the boardwalk, wondering if this band i liked so much would ever make it... A lotta politics, a lotta heartbreak, a lotta growing up, a lotta books read... Listening to this CD, Magic, is like seeing an old friend and seeing how far that friend has gone, how familiar the raw expression with the added maturity and wisdom only living for a while can offer.    I've long considered Born to Run the quintessential R&R album, possibly the best ever. Magic is its equal.    The lyrics are more telling, with more socio-political conviction, without embarrassing the poetic muses (my only real complaint is that the singing is almost buried in the mix: I'd like them to be hotter and more up-front-and-center). With the scepter of authority borne from his tenure in R&R andthe respect garnered from peers and audiences alike, he offers up some pretty robust clobbering and truth-telling while keeping those poetic muses happy (and dancing). The music, informed by Mr. Springsteen's forays into Seeger and other musical influences, never relinquishes its rawness, its foundation firmly rooted in... well, a tradition Bruce & Co created with Born to Run.    Magic is quintessential rock'n'roll, quintessential Bruce, quintessential E Street Band.    Welcome home. Magic is... Well, magic.
B00005JPLW|2.0|Having seen the 1962 film,\\"300 Spartans\\",and though a comic book admirer, this newer, graphic comic-take on the last stand satisfies only modestly. Both films share a fictional rendition, though \\"300\\" has a unique visual stamp to its efforts. Adding gratuitous sexcapades for the modern porn-inclined audience was degrading to its dramatic efforts, including the British accents and preposterous \\"M-lords\\" scattered throughout.Yet the most inventive use of slo-motion in action film to date allowed the viewer to savor the synchronized movements of the brave lads as a unit or separately to absorb the weaponry tailored for the daring close combat.<br />The acting was superior to the daytime soap screenplay;and despite the autodesk re-created Pompeiian town in detail, the film never makes an attempt to wrap the action in historicity. The History channel's \\"Last Stand of the 300\\" is the real take on this incident.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|This movie is \\"the balls\\" It is by far the best Bond movie to come out in many years. I love Pierce Brosnan and all but Craig brings the series back to where it should be without all the rocket cars and ice palaces. The movie has the recipe for dude soup, one part hot women, one part hot car, and 4 cans of BAMF. Buy it, love it.
0596009208|4.0|The printing, black and white, features airy pages, varied typography, an ongoing cast of cartoony characters, and plenty of humorous illustrations.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, it also features good content about Java 5, very good. It covers wait/notify better than others I've seen, and takes a fair stab at generics. They describe synchronization and deadlock, as well as good chunks of the standard libraries. They even describe serialization and deserialization well enough to get going with. Quizzes with answers and solved problems check your understanding as you go along.<br /><br />On the minus side, I didn't see mention of \\"volatile\\" declarations - a necessity for safe sharing of data between threads. Even if you don't use the volatile declaration, you need to know what volatility is or face erratic, unrepeatable error in your threaded code. Murphy's Law being what it is, such errors rarely occur in lightly loaded test conditions; they usually wait until a system is running a big configuration and a heavy load, i.e. just when you want failures least. Pretty much everything else is somewhere in this book, though, in enough detail to get you started.<br /><br />So, decide what you want. If you already know that you're born member of the video game generation, this light and breezy presentation might suit you. Speaking as a user-unfriendly user, I have to grit my teeth to get past the fun fluff and into the gritty bits. They are there to be had, though.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is by far one of the most interesting and wicked cool documentaries I have ever seen. The detail is amazing and there is stuff I have never ever seen before. No CGI, no fiction, this stuff is all real and it looks freakin amazing. If you have a Blu Ray player and do NOT have this disc set you have wasted your money so far. Buy this, watch it, and learn more about the world than you ever could imagine. 5 out of 5 BAMF's
0805079831|5.0|I just finished this book from the library and I'll have to go out and buy it.  The revelations of torture, economic policy, corporate complicity and government support for all of this wasn't really new to me, but this puts the theory and rationale behind the actions.  It dovetails theory and practice so that I now see Iraq, Russia, Chile, South America, South Africa, and others in a new light.  As a warning that this could happen here, the warrantless wiretaping of American phone calls, emails etc. should send a chill to anyone who believes in the Constitution and the freedom of democracy.  The founding fathers would be very sad to see how we have let the United States become a corporate shill and enabler of torture, convictions and detentions without trial and other crimes against humanity.  A great read.  Highly recommended
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This film is nothing short of mantastic. I would hesitate to call this one of the best movies ever only because I feel people with a normal sense of morals may consider this movie \\"too violent.\\" I do not have such a problem so once again I say this movie is awesome.

B000UGG39Q|5.0|The members of Down have been through a deal of hardship since their last release five years ago. Mother nature's swipe of New Orleans, the shocking murder of ex-Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, and singer Phil Anselmo's personal battles, such as being shut out of Darrell's funeral and struggling against the lures of drug addiction. These issues made me sceptical that the music would become unfocused or overly aggressive. I am overjoyed to say that this scepticism was unjust, as Down have responded to these hardships and returned with a superb album, showcasing some of the band's best work to date.<br /><br />As Anselmo promised in the build-up to the release, \\"Over The Under\\" shows a great deal of pride and determination, but also of overriding anger. Songs such as \\"Pillamyd\\", \\"Mourn\\" and \\"I Scream\\" rank up there with the most aggressive of Down songs, and even touch the brute visceral levels of Pantera. Determination is equally constant, depicted from the get go with the \\"Three Suns And One Star\\" - \\"The old dog has to learn a new trick and more / Or the next trick will be on him.\\" And best shown through the galloping \\"On March The Saints\\", proclaiming the bands deep seeded pride and onward thinking from hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />Musically the album matches the engulfing themes. Once again Pepper Keenan (of Corrosion of Conformity) comes up with some of the most badass riffs around. From the sharp opening of \\"Three Suns And One Star\\" to the almost Pink Floyd stylings of the moving \\"Nothing In Return\\", the music hits home hard . His combination of Sabbathian bluesy grooves and thundering classic metal cuts gives Down a unique and unforgettable sound. While Down II seemed to venture off into new territories, \\"Over The Under\\" seems very much a continuation of \\"Nola\\", with simpler structures and greater emphasis on groove. This should please the die-hard fans of \\"Nola\\", and also be more accessible for new fans than Down II was. Overall another superb outing from one of my favourite bands around.urite bands around.

0375505091|3.0|This book, as the title might imply to you, is about Leibovitz' life from 1990 to 2005. This does not mean though, that the book is limited to that. The focus shifts back and forth between her personal life and her career. The pictures are all large and vibrant. Many of them span a left and right page. There are some good portraits in here of: The White Stripes, Juliane Moore, Bruce Springsteen, Al Pacino & Robert DeNiro, Jack Nicholson, and a lot of others too. There were a lot of portraits. Then breaking up sections of these portraits were sections of pictures taken in and of her own life including funerals, vacations, and childbirth. I personally was more interested in the portraits though. Those of you who are more along my lines of just wanting to see portraits, American Music is probably more of what you want. I'm waiting for mine now.
B00004Y87I|2.0|This film was inspired by the short stories of James Thurber. Walter Mitty drives to the train station in a small NJ town that resembles southern California. Mitty works for a publishing company in Manhattan that prints racy detective stories and other popular magazines (classified as \\"escapist\\" literature). Mitty's daydreams are interspersed with his real life. An imagined operation has comic touches. His fiance's dog doesn't trust him. His furnace has logs that burn quickly (unlike in the real world). Mitty's comic musician seems quite outdated. On his morning train he meets a strange woman who ask for his help. Mitty's life quickly becomes complicated, far more than in any daydream. He has become involved in dangerous situation. Will he survive?    The story continues with comic scares and scenes. They now seek a missing notebook that was placed into a woman's corset. Scenes switch from reality to fantasy. Does Mitty need a psychiatrist? Does his job affect his imagination? The film runs on with more scenes of comic terror. At the end there is a surprise. This film tells what Hollywood thought would please customers. Did it? This isn't a good parody of suspense thrillers where an ordinary man stumbles into danger.

B000TUXL2A|5.0|A great CD, with many songs in a slower style that will disappoint only those whose interest in Mark Knopfler's music is fleeting at best.    How many artists are putting out material that their fans can truly embrace like this more than 30 years after their first recordings?  The list is very short, especially if you hold them to creating music that meets or even surpasses their early work.  Mark Knopfler is a truly remarkable human being.

Lennie, a sweet-natured, mentally-retarded man who doesn't realize his own crushing strength, and George, his companion and protector, befriend an aging farmhand on the ranch where they work as wheat harvesters. The three men resolve to buy a farm together and escape their down-trodden existence as itinerant laborers. But their dream is shattered when the child-like Lennie accidentally strangles the flirtatious wife of the ranch owner's son and George and Lennie are forced to run for their lives.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Very interesting film. It was missing a few components though. Some scenes were a stretch, but the viseral and thought impact made up for most of its shortcomings. Nicolas Cage is not one of my favorites but he was spot on as the \\"magician\\" who can actually see 2 minutes into the future. Great storyline. Seeing the future can be more complex then most people would think and the movie is careful to point that out. That adds realism. I was disappointed with Jessica Biel. Sure shes got a hot body but something was missing from her acting. I think its more that she was the wrong person for the role, too prissy. Pleny of twists and turns. Much time and thought was put into the making of this and it shows. This is the kind of sci-fi that develops appreciation from true lovers of the genre. Its good to see Peter Falk in a film again, especially this kind of film. Pure entertainment.

B00000J2KY|3.0|Probably the most controversial,\\"banned in Boston\\" movie of 1962;the ban helped to send literally hundreds of  thousands crashing through theater doors to see it.All the commotion was caused by young Sue Lyon, sunning herself in her back yard,very modestly clad by today's standards, being ogled by \\"dirty old man\\" James Mason. Mason wants her bigtime, and finally succeeds, but only after marrying Lyon's mother,who is quickly killed in an auto \\"accident\\".As Curly Howard might have said: \\"he's supposed to be her father,now he's trying to be her husband\\", Enter Peter Sellers, playing multiple roles, trying any and all schemes to drive Mason away, thus assuring Sellers an unfettered  \\"expressway\\" to Lyon's heart. In the end everyone loses, especially the censors: today the film is unrated.
B000OHZJ9Q|5.0|Another Porcupine Tree success.  Though slightly less interesting musically than \\"Deadwing\\" or \\"In Absentia\\", this is PT\\"s most lyrically coherent, and accessible, album.  The plight of today's disengaged youth is poignantly laid bare.  Their Ritalin-riddled upbringing at the hands of their \\"me-generation\\" parents, though fortunately not ubiquitous, is perhaps as big a risk to the planet as extreme climate change.  The dour subject matter is appropriately matched by the music: at times boring and shallow then grounded by menace and doom.    As usual, since PT's first surround mix with \\"In Absentia\\", the 5.1 audio takes the listener to new heights.  Thank you, Steven Wilson, et al, for perservering with this wonderful format when major studios are abandoning it.  A great listen.

B000MM1F5A|1.0|Mariza has a great voice and her music is just fabulous. This recording is mediocre at best with people shouting from the audience and clapping with the music. It feels as if you are in some yankee-doodle get together. In some instances, they have dancers on stage and you can hear their feet and people cheering for them. It feels as if you are listening to the Nashville Grand Ole Opry Dancers on Radio. Pretty awful. I guess you'd have to be at the concert in order to enjoy this CD. Otherwise skip it. To have audience participation rob you of the purity of Fado is something that I don't appreciate.    I bought this CD after I saw Mariza on David Letterman and she was simply fabulous. Fado is to be enjoyed for its purity of sound, beauty and sadness. Also shame on Mariza's publicists for promoting this CD on Letterman when they should be promoting a non-live (and non-hick) version.

0141183357|5.0|In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate. When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. When Henry asserts that Porphyria Fire Insurance Co. is on the verge of collapse, Helen and Margaret persuade Leonard Bast, a young clerk they have befriended, to resign his position there, only to have him later \\"downsized\\" out of his subsequent bank job. Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on those over whom they have little control. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success. When Helen returns from Germany, where she has been living, and Henry and his family discover she is pregnant, Henry's belief that her condition reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it. With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm of the country and that its conflicts are those of the nation. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years.

B000I2J0W4|5.0|The Shining is one of the horror genre's most notable films.  Made in 1980 by the late, legendary Stanley Kubrick, the film stands out as not only one of his best but probably the best Stephen King adaptation as well.  Though not nearly as true to the book as the later TV-movie would be, it is undoubtedly darker, more macabre, and ultimately superior to that version.  Kubrick was a genius behind the camera, giving us long, beautiful shots, allowing us to take in both the beauty and the horror of the Overlook Hotel.  For those who have yet to see the movie (and honestly, who hasn't at this point?), do yourself a favor and buy it today!  Disappointment is impossible.<br /><br />As for the transfer of the film, it is unbelievable.  While clearly not as visually stunning or breathtaking as modern day flicks, this HD DVD version of The Shining boasts a virtually flawless transfer and cleans up many of the blemishes that were present on previous VHS and DVD versions.  Black levels are deep, clean, and ungrainy and the majority of the film offers a surprisingly clean look.  Detail is not as strong as it could have been, but Kubrick intentionally shot this film softly. The images won't pop and shine like modern movies will, as this is an old film, but for the price of the disc you are without a doubt getting the highest quality transfer this film has ever seen.<br /><br />Audio has been upgraded from a mono to a TrueHD soundtrack, but for the most part audio will be very front-heavy.  Most of the peripheral speakers are used only for music, to intensify the sound of it (and it is effective).<br /><br />Special features are slim: the old making of documentary (with or without commentary), theatrical trailer, and a few small featurettes that delve deeper into the making of The Shining, as well Stanley Kubrick's \\"Visions.\\"  All pretty standard fare, all in 480i/p standard definition.<br /><br />Whether you're a long time fan of the film, or new to it, this is a must-own if you own an HD DVD player and HDTV!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is the best movie Pixar has done since Toy Story, not only taking computer animation to the next level, but returning to the fun story telling that propelled Toy Story.  I hope that Pixar includes a couple shorts with the movie, like the amusing \\"Lifted,\\" which served as a prelude to the movie in the theatres.  I think the creators owe a big debt to The Triplets of Belleville and French animation in general for the visages of their many characters.  The restaurant critic was great, captured to sublime perfection, right down to the change of expression on his face when he sampled the Ratatouille.  A voice only Peter O'Toole could do. Janeane Garofalo was great as Colette as well.  But it was Remy who stole the show, a rat with a great nose for food, guided in his search for the ultimate cuisine by the ghost of the consumate chef, Gusteau.  Remy gave the young Linguini (Lou Romano) a decided advantage, while the hilarious Skinner (Ian Holm) smelled a rat in his kitchen.  Lou Romano seems to have found a home with Pixar.  The movie is great fun for everyone!

0679731725|5.0|Despite years of avoiding this book because of a vague sense that it was a boring little English-gentry novel, I'm happy to report that it's actually exquisite. The story goes like so: Stevens, the butler at Darlington House -- one of those British manors that has stood for longer than most nations, including ours -- takes a rare holiday, driving off into the British countryside to see the country that he apparently has had very little time to see in his many years of butlering. Indeed, it's possible that he's never left Darlington House: he seems to spend most of his rare bits of free time tucked away in his windowless, badly-lit office. Such has been his life for perhaps half a century.<br /><br />But it's after World War II, and Britain is not what it once was. The Darlington Houses, and their dozens of servants, have fallen into disuse; whenever someone mentions another manor home, the many unused rooms are invariably covered with plastic sheeting. It's a sad time to be a butler.<br /><br />Darlington House has passed into the ownership of a wealthy American man who, while he's a gentleman by American standards, is more crass than Stevens is used to. He tries to banter with Stevens in a very American way, and Stevens just cannot make head or tail of it. Some of the funniest scenes in The Remains of the Day center on Stevens's attempts to return the verbal play in his restrained British butler's style; they're met with only puzzlement.<br /><br />That restrained butler's style is the source both of the book's comedy, and its heartbreak. A truly great butler, says Stevens, must be a butler to his core. He cannot be a dignified butler one moment and a bantering, jocular everyman the next. The only times when he may let his guard down are when he is completely alone.<br /><br />Note that: alone. A butler, one assumes, would make a terrible husband. Stevens is incapable of interacting with other human beings the way the rest of us would. A feisty, strong-willed, passionate woman joins the staff at Darlington House, and all Stevens can do is stare.<br /><br />We only occasionally can pierce through the veil of his butlerish self-restraint, and only then when he describes what other people say to him. Most of the time, the world desires that he be just as he is: courteous to a fault, merely the vehicle for his master's desires -- a cipher to everyone including himself. But every now and again, others would enjoy interacting with a human. Stevens doesn't know how to be a human. Only once does he admit to himself that he is experiencing a human foible. That ends, and back he returns to his master.<br /><br />It's a 200-page read, and a brisk one at that. It is a tiny, exquisite sculpture of a man.Darlington House, and all Stevens can do is stare.

B000M341QE|1.0|When the bodies began to pile up at the end my son said this is Shakespearean. So it was in more ways than the body count. Shakespeare is not easy to follow because of the difficult language and hard to follow plot. But this film beats the Bard on both counts. After a few minutes we switched on the subtitles to understand the incomprehensible Bostonian accents. It did not help me understand what was going on but my son who had seen it before kept explaining to me. The story was not without drama and tension but it was too hard to understand. The language was fithy. I do not know why my son wanted this for his birthday. He too is wondering how tone gets a cellphone to work underground.

0805079831|5.0|Very well written and researched work by Noami Klein, however it is rather depressing read (at least for me). It injects lots of pessimistic feelings about human nature, about our inability to live in peace and create just economic system. Even if the connection between the political repressions/killings and the free market \\"revolution\\" is only partially true, reading \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" one cannot escape conclusion that world is shifting into at least questionable unsustainable direction. Author points out that many socio-economical ideologies and theories cannot be blamed for misery. It is their interpretation and distorted application being responsible for terrible consequences. Communistic utopian idea of \\"equality\\" never managed, to engulf large portion of the world (transforming instead here and there into horrible mutations). Now Friedman's econo-doctrine (unsustainable, unlimited expansion in a finite system - this planet) spreads fast around the globe like a disease. Polarizing wealth within societies and between nations it therefore creates opposite to communism scenario and rejects notion of democracy as \\"equality of condition\\" in favor of \\"equality of OPPORTUNITY\\". Since last 30 or so years, helpless, disadvantaged and poor citizens of numerous countries live and die in misery paying terrible price for unbridled mantra of economical growth (check also: \\"Dying for Growth - Global Inequality and the Health of the Poor\\" by Institute of Health and Social Justice). Once Friedman model is introduced, there is no practical way to escape from it. Economist and the rest of us are living in a state of mass delusion, made possible by the potent drug of consumerism. Any old school economic theory is now irrelevant. The worst though is...that Friedo-capitalism is so brazen that allows free flow of strong criticism (like for example this and other books) without being concerned about it at all. And this is really scary.

0743277457|5.0|The Art of Learning is a rare book in that it provides an account of a rare individual, one who is both a world class chess champion and a world class martial artist. Josh Waitzkin (The kid protrayed in the book and movie Searching for Bobby Fischer) does a superb job of giving the reader direct access to how he developed his unique set of skills and how he used them to conqure both the chess world and the martial arts world. You get to go inside his mind and view the competitions he partictpated in from his point of view. He breaks down his stretagy for winning into several lessons designed to help the reader assimilate them into there own daily life, so success can be experienced in all areas. Its one of the best books I've ever read. The really soecial thing about this book is that Josh vividly describes his experiances with developing his subtle energy force(Called Chi,Ki, or Prana)as it relates to him winning his two world championschips in Push Hands Tai Chi. So people involved in stuff like yoga of the martial arts get a good view of how the  life force can be directed in practical situations. Really good stuff. Buy this book, read in twice and then succeed in whatever you put your mind to!! Thanks Josh !!
0575081392|2.0|Several months ago my grandmother and I went with a friend to see a four-hour documentary about French college students sitting around smoking pot in the days following the failed revolution of '68, all lovingly shot on grainy, black-and-white film.  As the theatre emptied, Grandma loudly proclaimed in classic old person style, \\"That certainly was a long, boring movie.\\"  Her blunt assessment largely mirrors what I feel after reading \\"The Name of the Wind\\".  Partick Rothfuss did not write an utter waste of paper like Terry Goodkind, nor a shameless Tolkien ripoff like Terry Brooks.  But he did, unfortunately, write a 660-page book in which very little happens.    Kvothe (pronounced \\"quothe\\", as we're repeatedly informed) first appears minding an inn in the middle of nowhere, where the regulars come straight from fantasy casting central.  A hint of a story appears when a spider-like demon attacks.  Then, sadly, that story is abandoned in favor of a long flashback.  We meet young Kvothe and his parents traveling the world with a troupe of actors.  Another story seems to be in motion when the troupe gets attacked by villains thought to be legendary.  Even more sadly, that story is also abandoned.  Instead the book follows Kvothe through the trials and tribulations of everyday life.  Wagon trips, baths, fundraising, clothes shopping, food shopping, book shopping, music shopping, horse shopping, and so forth.  To be forthright, this is very boring and repetitious.    Kvothe is strictly the male version of a Mary Sue.  Besides being the world's greatest wizard at an age when Harry Potter still lived under the stairs, he also is perfect at fist-fighting, knife-fighting, music, business, horse-riding, poetry, and attracting beautiful young women.  (A good half dozen of these fling themselves at his feet throughout the book.)  I ploughed grimly through the book, hoping that a whiz-bang ending might redeem the lackluster middle.  Sadly, there was no ending whatever.  No mysteries are solved, no villains beaten, no conclusions reached.  The book peters outs with many lame attempts to trick us into buying the next book, and at last we realize that we spent thirty-five bucks on an advertisement for the sequel.    Rothfuss' writing is not awful, yet at the same time it is certainly not great.  His poor dialogue tends to crush any life that the storyline may have had.  Particularly annoying is when he declares through the narrator that he has avoided clichés, as in, \\"If this had been a fancy drama we would have made love right then, but of course we did not.\\"  Using this trick once would be lame, but Rothfuss often does it two or three times on a single page.    \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is far from the worst fantasy ever written, but it is frustrating as a lost opportunity.  There are moments, few and far between, where a better and more ambitious novel is trying to break out.  A handful of scenes, such as Kvothe's second encounter with the murderous Chandrian, stand out for their genuine emotion and moving prose.  But in the end, they get buried under a flood of turgid details.  This one would have been better if a strong-willed editor could have chopped out roughly 500 pages of swill.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|I picked up the CD the day it was released, brought it back work, and listened to it through little tiny laptop speakers, and thought...    \\"Hmmm...no rockers, that's interesting, okay.\\" I only picked up a few of the words, but the low-key melodies grabbed me from that first listen.    When I got home I gave it proper listen with good headphones, I just fell in love with it.    As another reviewer pointed out, the music he's making here is incredibly close to the soundtracks he did back in the `70's and early '80's for \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Cal\\". All of the tunes on this CD have a very distinct Northern English or Scottish folk music feel.    The songwriting, of course, is perfect. Mark's the best at creating intricate, little short stories that become songs.    And, while I love the pared down studio band this time around, it still sounds incredibly rich to these ears.     Perhaps after dancing around the kitchen to LCD Soundsystem, or listening to the aural density of \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" and \\"In Rainbows\\", it's just great to hear a master doing what he does best with less.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Loved this movie. I hadn't seen it in a while and I found the storyline compelling. Not bad for that era of movie making! ('70s)
0452286751|2.0|If one reads the commentaries recorded by RASHI on the Bible book \\"Song of Songs\\" the description, lovely, by the man of his beloved's breasts  is annotated as meaning Moses and Aaron.      The author of Fountainhead has the quality of the commentary--taking the life out of the wonderous. She does this by preaching and by horrid writing.  As literature, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is horrid.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|John Ford plays it straight in this film adaptation of Steinbeck's novel about the Odyssey of a displaced Oklahoma clan to California in search of work during the Great Depression.  Steinbeck's knowledge of California and his work as a journalist gave him a wealth of material for his novel, and several of his most unforgettable scenes are faithfully recreated in the film.      The prejudice of the native Californians against the Okies, the exploitation of the migrant workers, the cruel disappointments of the Okies, and the nobility of their struggle to survive so vividly captured by Steinbeck are successfully realized in Ford's film.     Ford makes his actors act.  Lots of close ups on eyes, silhouetted against dark and dreary backgrounds.  These are real actors, with a background in the theater, who know their craft.      Because the film is so faithful to the book, one may as well just read the book, which is Steinbeck's best and deserves its place in the pantheon of great American novels.  But the film does have two advantages.  First, it is made only a year or two after the Depression, so the mood and times are well captured in some of the backgrounds and in the faces of the actors.  Second, and most importantly, there is Henry Fonda.  Fonda's ability to portray the rage of Tom Joad that lurks beneath the surface and to articulate in spare words and expressions the unfairness of the treatment of the Okies is extraordinary.  This is one of the great pieces of acting in the history of American film.      The progressive spirit of the film and the, I think, justified bashing of the rich given the history of the times may be a bit jarring to the modern viewer.  But I found that element of the film to be fascinating.      Ford's ending is a bit more uplifting and hopeful than Steinbeck's, with its famous scene of a new mother nursing a struggling Okie.  Can't put that kind of stuff on the screen in 1940.  Ford ends with the message that the Okies are survivors and that the poor and meek shall inherit the Earth.  It's not exactly what ended up happening, though the lot of the poor in America has certainly improved, and the kind of prejudice portrayed in the film is now universally reviled.     An excellent job by Ford and an even better job by Fonda.
1844137872|5.0|It's a great book, one that definitely puts Banksy in its rightful place even in the minds of people that have no idea about urban art and art anarchism. Insight from Banksy himself, the hooded mistery, photographs of some of his most famous pieces, this book has it all. A must read for any and everyone.
B00005JNEI|5.0|\\"The man who fears no truth has nothing to fear from lies.\\"  Thomas Jefferson    No better example currently on DVD can be found proving Jefferson's timeless truth.  It is not the opinions or interpretations by Moore that his vociferous (compensating with volume for what they lack in numbers) detractors have a problem with, it is his undoing of millions of dollars worth of corporate propaganda and censorship by his exposition of facts.  \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is the original \\"inconvenient truth\\", inconveniencing right-wingers, a complicit media, and derelict journalists alike with a litany of non-repudiated inconvenient facts such as: the billions of dollars of Saudi investments in American real estate and business and Bush's cozy relationship with some of those investors, the Saudi billionaire bin Laden family and the supposed black-sheep member of their family, anti-Russian-CIA-operative Osama, who strangely offered his assistance against Saddam Hussein when the latter threatened Saudi oil by invading Kuwait, the many bizarre and now notorious events preceding and following 9/11, etc, etc.      The corporate media monopoly takes a major hit by Moore's exposure of facts they deliberately excluded, as does the post 9/11 reality they had created for mass consumption.  How does Moore's famous video-clip of Bush staring like a deer trapped in a hunter's headlights after being informed of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center gel with the media's heroic portrayal of the Great Leader, arm draped around a battle-weary firefighter, shouting soundbites from the 9/11 rubble?  People investing millions of dollars manufacturing 9/11 \\"truth\\" are not pleased.    THIS then, is the reason to see this film.  To see and hear facts, stats, and pictures that you have never, yet, seen or heard in the mainstream media, no matter how often they repeat the lie about their being liberal.  Whether you agree with Moore's often-implied opinions and interpretations of those facts isirrelevant.  (I, e.g., think too much was made over Bush's strange, possibly suspicious, stupefied stare.  However, in a country with a free press it would have received much media coverage.  Like most of the material in the movie, I had never seen it or heard about it before this movie!)    Many people, of course, don't deserve to have a democracy and avoid the truth because, as Jack Nicholson famously memorialized to Tom Cruise (portraying military prosecutor Iglesias): \\"You can't handle the truth!\\"    And many are thankful that they have corporate media lackeys to protect them from the truth.  If you are not one of them, it is still not too late to see what the mainstream media does not want you to.
0679809015|5.0|I bought this book for my second daughter when she was still in my womb! I got it after seeing it how my friend's kids adore it. As it turns out my daughter absolutely loves it. She is now 18 months old and picks this book daily to read over and over and over... The pictures are simple, bright and clear. She loves to lift the flaps and see which animal is waiting for her and we both giggle our hearts out as we make the sounds together. A pure joy of a book for both child and adult. The favourite series of my older daughter is [[ASIN:0972732829 Why Some Cats are Rascals, Book 1]].
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This album is great. It has the musical line from their previous.....which is ok because thay already made a style. A slight difference is the song \\"Ties that bind\\" which is great, actually getting close to the style of the christian band Petra (another personal favourite). Also notable songs are \\"Wayward One\\" and \\"Watch over you\\". The lyrics are wonderful, great cover art and....keep up the good work. Alter Bridge rocks. Peace!.
B000063V8T|5.0|The best shows seem to arise from adversity and limitation.  As the Next Generation's season five was filming, the Star Trek universe was about to expand into two shows running simultaneously.  Thus, new writers, producers, directors, etc. had to be brought in to fill in the gaps.  Minor characters, who would cross over into DS9 were given more screen time to make the bridge.  And Gene Roddenberry, creator and guiding light of the Star Trek universe, passed away.  This is the crucible in which TNG Season 5 was forged, and it remains the best season of all the Star Trek series since the Original.    Not only are the shows consistently interesting, there are more standout episodes in this season than in the rest of the show's run combined.  Even when stealing Original Series ideas, they are a completely new take on an old tune, like a remake of a '60s pop tune by a '90s heavy metal artist. True, neither the season premier's Klingon War nor the finale's time-travelling cliffhanger are very good.  Resolution I (the first half of the Klingon war) and The Best of Both Worlds I and II are clearly superior.  But in between these disappointments are the following great shows:    Darmok - a \\"remake\\" of the classic Trek episode \\"Arena\\".  Picard and an alien captain are trapped together on a planet to do battle against a common foe, while learning about each other's cultures.    Ensign Ro - a veiled commentary on the Palastinian question that protrays the problem with negotiating with fractured ethnic groups - who do you negotiate with?  Introduces Ro Laren and the Bajoran people.    Disaster - the best of the \\"kids\\" episodes.  Picard is trapped in an elevator with the winners of the elementary school science fair when the Enterprise is hit by a quantum filament that knocks out main power and intraship communications.    Conundrum - yet another \\"Naked Time\\"-esque episode, where the crew has its memories erased and they must piece together their mission and their relative positions in the command hierarchy.    The Outcast - Riker falls in love with a member of an androgynous society.  The catch - she thinks of herself as female only, which is considered a sexual perversion in her society.    Cause and Effect - the Enterprise is trapped in a time loop caused by an anti-matter accident.  They are forced to live the same day over and over until they can figure out how to break the cycle.  Filmed well before the more famous movie \\"Groundhog Day\\".    The Perfect Mate - another Original Series ripoff, this time of \\"Elaan of Troyus\\".  An empath whose sole purpose in life is to be the perfect mate is promised in marriage to a foreign dignitary to cement a peace treaty.  Unfortunately, she is prematurely \\"hatched\\" and raises havoc with the male parts of the crew.    The Next Phase - Geordi and Ro are \\"cloaked\\" in a Romulan cloaking device accident.  Ro thinks she is in limbo to make peace with her living friends before she can move to the afterlife.    The First Duty - following an accident at Starfleet Academy, Wesley must choose between loyalty to the principles of Starfleet or loyalty to his friends.    Inner Light - the best Next Generation show, possibly the best Star Trek show over all series.  Picard is selected by a probe and lives out a life on an alien planet.  Winner of a Hugo for best dramatic presentation.    Sharp-eyed Trekkies will notice I left \\"Unification\\" off this list.  I find it to be quite problematic.  It was eagerly anticipated as episodes to feature both Spock and Sarek, which they did, but the brilliant parts (Spock's interactions with Data, for example) are counterbalanced by the silly Tasha-Yar's-daughter subplots that marred most of the Romulan episodes of this era.  Similarly, there are some great sacrifices of science to the needs of the plot.  Sometimes they are necessary - for example, Geordi and Ro can move through walls but not floors? (\\"Next Phase\\")  What really irritates me, though, is the sacrifice of the lawsof physics for no reason - for example, we are supposed to believe that a few phaser shots will cause planet-wide earthquakes/volcanoes, but a giant asteroid strike did not?? (\\"A Matter of Time\\")    Perhaps the main reason the 5th season is so successful is that the cast works together so well, also integrating new and recurring minor characters (e.g. Chief O'Brien, Ens. Ro).  Even the Wesley shows (both \\"The Game\\" and especially \\"First Duty) are good.  Even the kids shows are good (Alexander, Worf's son, quickly wears out his welcome in his 2 episodes, but the other episodes that prominently feature kids, like \\"Disaster\\", \\"Hero Worship\\", and \\"Imaginary Friend\\" are all enjoyable).  Basically, the tried-and-true Trek formula of combining socially relevant statements, sci-fi action, and a feeling of family among the crewmembers is at its pinnacle in this season.    To sum up: if you only buy one TNG season, make it this one.  All the best episodes, save possibly \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" and certain Q episodes, are in this season.
B000O76T90|5.0|This DVD Rocks with great DTS 5.1 surround sound as well as incredible special features. I strongly recommend this 2-disc steel case edition highly!!!
B00004VVND|4.0|It's thirty years since I saw this movie and yes it's dated visually but still a great story, and still scary too!  Yul Bryner is excellent as the robot gunman.  Good adventure ... my teenage sons thought it was really cool!
0723257639|5.0|I bought this set for my 6 yr old son to read, but the entire collection is so beautiful that I had to give him \\"instructions\\" on how to open or hold the book...  They are in the original small size Beatrix Potter wanted her books published to fit small children's little hands.  All 23 books are in blue hard covers with the soft color sleeves, and the presentation box opened to a 3D drawing of the World of Peter Rabbit!  I'm very satisfied with the purchase!!!
B000U7169M|3.0|Kind of on the fence about this movie. First thing I thought of when watching this was how it was shot, the camera was shaky in some parts and it didn't stay on one thing long enough for you to see, that started the movie off bad for me, it did get better though as the movie went on. Also as a side note, the HD version didn't really look HD to me, seemed like a tiny step up from a regular DVD.    As for the movie, it was just \\"ok\\" I rented it through Netflix so it wasn't a total waste, but I probably would've wanted my money back if I watched this at the theater. Swank and the black guy were pretty good in this movie, the other actors were blah, nothing special.    Overall it was worth a Netflix rent but that's it. 2.5 stars
B000N3T0DW|5.0|I can't stand Almodovar, his love of the eccentric, of the shock factor.  But this film is something else.  It's better not to read too much about the film before seeing it; just sit back and enjoy it.  I could not recommend this film enough!
1401300529|4.0|I liked this book, however, it doesn't cover much new ground compared to Clay Blair's \\"The Forgotten War\\". I was disappointed by this especially since Blair's book was written at the end of the Cold War before much former Soviet archival data was accessible and I was hoping some of that would be included.  The Clay Blair book is quoted extensively and is far more in-depth with regards to military history.  In my view this book spends too much time on political issues rather than military history (for example, the last two years of the war are covered in less than five pages and only passing mention is made of the Air Force and Navy's contributions).  One good point compared to Blair's book is that he has included more veterans' recollections.  Bottomline...great book for someone who has a casual interest in the history of the Korean War but those seeking an in-depth treatment should read \\"The Forgotten War\\".
B0000942LT|5.0|Again , if you don't own the best of CD , buy this one and the other 2
B00005JO5L|5.0|This movie has it's flaws but it is a film that takes place in time that has long past in New York. The performances are acted out well. The film got away with ideas and language that I do not believe can be carried out by hollywood these days. Just for that it's worth watching.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If you've never seen Firefly or Serenity, now is the time to buy this dvd.  If you already have the old, llama cover version of the dvd, you'll definitely want to get this much improved release.  The new extras alone make this worth purchasing, but oh yeah, you also get a great new dvd cover - a HUGE improvement over the original.  To me, this was worth getting just to be able to see the River Tam Sessions, which I had somehow managed to miss before.  Also, the new Joss and cast commentary track is a complete departure from the original one that Joss did alone.  Both are awesome, but in completely different ways.  Still hoping for a sequel.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this. I waited months for it to come to DVD. It flopped in the theaters and I figured that it was too smart for a mainstream audience. After seeing the movie last night I realize I was wrong. It wasn't very good. It wasn't very good at all. There were about 15 minutes that were great but over all it was pretty bland. It was such a great idea and I thought that fun, cheezy, low-budge, violent, and sexy movies would be back. What happened to the B-movie? When did everyone get so serious? I thought with the internet there would be a huge influx of Grindhouse movies... but it flopped.     It wasn't very good and there are a million missed chances.
B000QFCD5O|4.0|Gran regreso de la banda original de Asia! La calidad de estos músicos está intacta, Steve un maestro de la guitarra, impresionante en Time Again, Carl Palmer brillante, el sólo al final de The heat goes on es increible, Geoff con la calidad de siempre y la voz de John está intacta. Un gran concierto! Muy buenas las interpretaciones de Roundabout y Fanfare for a Common Man.
0440236738|5.0|This was my first Harlan Coben book and I loved it!    The opening chapter begins with Will's mother, Sunny, on her death bed, whispering something incredible about her other son, Ken, who had vanished into thin air 11 years earlier after the brutal murder of their neighbour Julie (who had also been, in the past, Will's much loved girlfriend).  Ken had been accused of the murder but Will had always believed in his innocence, despite the evidence against him.  After the funeral, something totally unexpected turns up in Sunny's bedroom.  This starts off a series of mind-boggling events.  The tension starts building up immediately, escalating up to the very last page, with twists & turns at every corner.    I liked ALL the characters, no exceptions, well depicted and very credible indeed.  Will's and his friend Square's jobs, in particular, working and volunteering for a charity house trying to save young teenagers from the dangers of street life, is well described and conveys the care, understanding and efforts these persons put into their line of work (and not just in fiction).  Although pertinent to some of the events, the story is not, however, solely centered on their work at the charity.  There's so much more!  A real page-turner, where narrative, events and dialogues are fast paced, plausible and convincing.    Just the kind of thriller book I like, where, in the end, every little detail is taken care of, every question is answered to and you are left without any lingering doubts.  Great!
B000024C7W|5.0|This was one of my all-time favorite albums back in the days of LP's - a double album, just as it now features 2 CD's. Journey through the Secret Life of Plants is so rich in textures, melodies, lyrics, it should not be a secret, as it sometimes seems to be. Oftentimes, even those who know and love the music of Stevie Wonder, have missed this musical gem. But, just like it's never too late to have a happy childhood, it's never too late to discover musical treasure, even if it's two decades down the road. If you've never heard this \\"Wonder\\"ful album, treat yourself now. From \\"the beginning\\", which is creation, to the loveliness of the wish to \\"come back as a flower\\" you'll be delighted by this \\"pistil-packing\\" musical adventure!
B000UJ48UO|4.0|If you're a fan of this film like me and had bought the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD before and thought \\"This is hi-def?\\", then you're in for a treat. This newly remastered version has a sharper picture and better color image and new commentaries to boot. While not as stunning a transfer as \\"The Shining\\" or \\"2001\\", this is still a much improved re-release. Trade in your old copy and purchase with confidence.
B00000G6H1|4.0|Most ONJ fans, myself included, rank Physical as one of Olivia's best releases. The title track may seem a bit goofy, and it was overplayed in the early 80s, but the album as a whole is really good. The uptempo songs are full of energy and there's a fire in her voice, and the ballads are soulful and her voice is extremely genuine in tone and timbre. An outstanding CD from beginning to end. If you're looking for an Olivia CD beyond a greatest hits compiliation, this is a very good one to check out. \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Make A Move On Me\\" are two of my favorites from her entire repertoire. Other standout tracks include \\"Love Make Me Strong,\\" \\"Silvery Rain,\\" \\"Promise,\\" and the well-known title track, \\"Physical.\\"
B000Q6ZG6G|3.0|Still a bit of a let down after all the anticipation of Kubrick's last film. That said, the transfer is an improvement over the standard DVD, and widescreen, and yes, unrated. I had an import unrated version and it was really a matter of digitally putting 2 dark figures in cloaks in front of some of the more graphic sex scenes. Not that I'm not glad to have the unrated version. This was the way it was shot. The image itself suffers from the way it was shot. A lot of it looks kinda blurry with gauze in front of the lens. The extras are good and it's nice to have the best quality version out there on my shelf.
B000URDEB0|1.0|(Its apparent by their site, this album, the new singer and new fans that Nightwish prefers the image of \\"soiled angel\\".  Newcomers, do yourself a favor and find Nightwish from their beginning)<br /><br />In the entire album there's only 2:30 seconds of worthwhile music, and thats in Poet And The Pendulum. Its a very mellow bit where the noise shuts up and Annette's asked to sing instead of squall.<br /><br />I'm dumbfounded why Annette was chosen from hundreds of singers. There is no depth or subtlety. And its not just her voice but her performance (look at the Amaranth video). She is the worst singer I've heard in any band, ever.<br /><br />Many people may like Amaranth or Bye Bye Beautiful or what have you, but they can't stand next to the 30 Nightwish classics (give or take). Don't expect any innocent ballads, just short lasting - fast paced - heavy riffed - bombastically orchestrated - (in otherwise simple) tunes. The orchestra is way overused and misused as filler more than anything (compare with Epica or Lacrimosa)<br /><br />I expect music to move me emotionally, otherwise its a failed art.<br />Nightwish failed with this album, and that's not going to change.<br />I honestly feel that Tarja was the heart of this band, Tuomas the soul, and both are gone.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Having watched all the new Kubrick Blu-Rays, I can say that \\"The Shining\\" is the most surprising. The sharpness and crisp colors just blew me away. WOW! I saw this in the theatre when it came out, and it was nice to finally have it in the widescreen format again. Note - it is 1.78:1, not 1.85:1. It fills the 16X9 screen entirely. I can't recommend this one any higher! Buy it.

I do not speak the language, had never heard of \\"Fado\\" but let me tell you, after having viewed the DVD, and listened to Mariza, I am totally in love with the music and Mariza's voice.  Such expression, such passion.  How wonderful it is to learn about a new kind of music.  It truly is the Universal language!  One may not know the language, but you can certainly feel the passion, whether it be joy or sadness.  Oh! I just love this CD.  I hope Mariza tours the US, especially VA Beach, VA!

B000RZIGSG|3.0|Popular movies and songs can be seen as history markers.  `Blue Suede Shoes', `Rock Around the Clock', and `Love Me Tender' marked the arrival of Rock and roll in the 1950's, while `Shane', `Giant' and `Rebel without A Cause' burnt up the screens.  Every decade has it's own set of readily identifiable images and sounds.<br /><br />For the 1980's, MTV and the arrival of rock videos shocked the world.  On the heels of the `new' art-form, Jennifer Beal starred in Flashdance, a big budget, big hair, big music runaway success.  `Flashdance' follows the dreams of Alex Owens, welder and dancer by night and her driven pursuit of going to dance school.  Noticed by her day boss, Nick Hurley, one night at Mawbys, he takes a special interest in her and a romance develops as soon as she is `fired'.  After finding out her dream, his membership on the Art Council becomes valuable when he pulls a string and she is granted an audition.  Hard work and talent takes her the rest of the way.<br /><br />The story won a Razzy for the worst screenplay, but if it were so insipid, the music and visual dance sequences were genius, easily making up any deficiencies.  Each dance sequence is almost a MTV feature every time, and draw on a number of cultural references.  Songs like `Maniac', and the Oscar winning `What A Feeling' turned this soundtrack and movie into a classic.<br /><br />With the 25th anniversary of Flashdance so close, the time is good to re-experience the phenomena one more time.<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta

0321344758|5.0|Steve Krug flawlessly (and colorfully) presents the need for website usability testing and affordable, easy-to-implement strategies for making your site function more efficiently, no matter the number of users. Steve's strategies seem so basic, but anyone who uses the web at all knows that most sites have at least some sort flaw when it comes to usability. Steve's recommendations are by no means a panacea for a site's problems, but they're a great start. Anyone who writes for, develops content for or administers a website at work or home needs to read (and re-read) this book. Steve also happens to be a very nice guy and will most certainly respond if you have any questions for him.
0307346609|4.0|When someone asks you what the book your reading is about and you say, \\"Zombies\\" some people will dismiss you. This book is the prize for not having such bias. This book can stand along books in any other genre. It is well written and includes social and political commentary that will cement it in place as a literary place marker for our times. The gritty personal stories that make up this book will suck you in. Max Brooks pays great attention to detail and weaves it through the stories and characters so well that the fact that they are fighting zombies never seems corny. By the end of the first interview in the book you won't think twice about zombies. By the end of the book you'll have your own plan of action \\"if that ever does happen.\\" If not Max wrote that too! Personally I'll read whatever Max Brooks writes next because of this book, I have recommended this book to everybody.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Some may say there are similarities emerging within Sufjan's catalogue, but this only strengthens the hold he has on his audience.  This is a smashing mix of rock, pop, folk, ballad and quirky asides. There are alpine highs and submarine lows as well as pure hair raising moments (\\"John Wayne Gacy Jr). Its a beautiful thing to behold.
1878424505|2.0|The Four Agreements really are life changing, but the book does NOT add any more insight; it just says the same thing over and over. I read the agreements and loved them. They are so simple, but so powerful to hear and it has already made me a stronger person. I bought the book thinking that I would get more insight into the agreements...... but the book just repeated them! It uses really obvious examples and it keeps referring to the metaphor \\"hell\\" (the place people are in when they judge others and don't understand each other) and other metaphors... but they don't enhance the reading. The author just repeats the same thing that was said by replacing words with symbols. I definitely say that the agreements are AWESOME... but seriously... the book is not. Just learn the agreements and you'll be set! (If you do buy the book, think of it as a donation or thank you to the author for simply revealing the 4 agreements)
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This album is amazingly written and recorded.  It was recorded straight to tape with little editing, it is 100% genuine.  I own it on CD and and Vinyl.  Brandi has such wonderful control over her voice which makes her incredibly wide range shine through even better.  Each song is telling you a story that is well written and grabs your heart.  She portrays every emotion vocally and lyrically.  It is a must have album!
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Bought my first one of these in 1978, and they have only gotten better.  I only replaced it because the keyboard has been used so much in 30 years that the case is looking a bit funky....mostly because of leaving it out uncovered in the tropical climate here in Hawaii.  The capabilities are beyond my wildest expectations....and abilities.  Mortage amortization is a snap, and I've even done discounted internal rates of return.  If you don't know how to enter the problem the instructions will lead you through it.  You can even set up multi-step programs to run your number crunching.  The older ones used RPN which some find cumbersome 1-enter-1-+, but the new models can also use standard entry...1+1=2.  Probably the last one I'll ever need to buy.

1572815108|5.0|I love this tarot deck. The card's graphics are simply amazing and so far I would say this is my favorite deck and so far the most accurate when it comes to readings. I really like the size of the cards; they are big but not too big. The booklet has helped me a lot when referring to the cards meaning and I know I will have this deck with me every time I do tarot.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are great......I just decided to get some new headphones, my Grado SR-60s were falling apart. I made a great choice, these headphones are clear, the music feels up front-without being overwhelming.  I can tell that these would make great headphones for mixing, as you really have a sense of the spatial placement of sounds when you listen to music with these. Not to mention the fact that they're really comfortable, I barely even notice them. I don't think you'll find better sounding headphones for under 100$.
1400031001|5.0|Brilliant.  One of the ten best books I have ever read.  As one newspaper review stated, while reading the book I found myself disbelieving that this was a work of fiction.  The book runs the gamut of a lifetime's experiences.      I discovered William Boyd through Restless and thought it a fine read.  However, Any Human Heart was head and shoulders above Restless.  I can hardly wait to read more of Boyd's books.
0061148512|5.0|[[ASIN:1933831014 Bad Girls Club]]<br /><br />I read this book every summer and have for the last few years. Plath is so apt at capturing her own descent into insanity, one little step at a time. She takes you on her journey with her in such a way that you truly feel her slip into this other world. I enjoy it most because it's flawless and as a writer, I have studied Plath to try and understand how she made everything work so well together. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever suffered loss.
6305922756|5.0|I really recommend this edition as it has the movie which is a classic but the extras which include never seen before scenes that didn't make it to the final movie are hilarious.  There is heaps of extra footage.  I have recommended this to all my friends who love Spinal Tap.  So I recommend it to you too!
0553278398|5.0|It's hard to say anything new about the foundation series.  I had always heard good things about it, and finally got around to picking it up.  I started with this book, Prelude to Foundation, and I think it was a good choice (even though it's not the first written).  However, I think it would have been helpful to have read the full Robot series first because it is slightly intertwined, though so far, I don't think it's spoiled my later enjoyment of that series.
0743201140|5.0|Buckingham is leading a revolution.  I'm one of those who have signed-on for this revolution because his book spoke to the depth of my being.  The world convinced me to improve my weaknesses, but Buckingham affirmed everything I innately knew about myself and my ability to lead/manage out of my strengths.  I'm forever indebted to Gallup's Strengthsfinder and Buckingham.  The people I lead and manage are too.  They now have someone who affirms their God-given hardwiring and wants to position them for maximum impact in their jobs, in their service, and in personal satisfaction.  That's a revolution.  You should join it!
0684135051|5.0|I taught myself to knit from an ancient Good Housekeeping Needlecrafts book and for several years slavishly followed patterns from library books, magazines and free leaflets.  It's a worthy and satisfying activity to follow a good pattern, and my children had the sweaters, mittens and socks to prove it.<br /><br />KNITTING WITHOUT TEARS, borrowed from the library as usual in those frugal times, was my first hint that you could really \\"own\\" your knitting.  I had no idea of Elizabeth Zimmermann's stature in the knitting world, her amazing public television broadcasts, her legendary knitting camps. Her writing style is so down-to-earth, she could be sitting in the next rocking chair glancing over at your knitting and offering pithy, helpful commentary just to you.<br /><br />The premise of this book is that you can find your gauge, plan your knitting, do the math, and come up with the garment you visualized.  Don't like seams?  No problem -- knit a tube and cut your openings.  CUT your knitting?  I was too inexperienced to feel the fear and cheerfully cut my first steeks with Elizabeth's words propped against the teapot in front of me.<br /><br />I've long since bought this book, more than once in fact. It's not the sort of knitting book we're used to -- its appeal is in the concepts and the clarity of text, not in pictures or modular layout.  Nor is it a how-to book for brand new knitters.  If you can knit and purl, keep a steady gauge, and follow basic directions, why not \\"kick it up a notch\\" with the thinking knitter's approach?<br /><br />It's fitting that Elizabeth Zimmermann is lovingly known as EZ.  If you adopt her easy-going attitude, you'll find it \\"EZ\\" to love your knitting.
6305433909|5.0|This is one of Whoopi's better pieces of work in my personal opinion. A fantastic musical delight for everyone! A Must see!
0374280967|5.0|A delightful novella reaching into the personal life of HRH QEII. I loved the fact she not only spoke of herself in the 3rd person, but always called herself \\"One\\".  The characters are delightful, the read is easy, and the end is perfect.  When one remembers we here, at this site, are all readers, the book is even more fun!
B00001OH7G|5.0|Rory was an amazing guitarist/singer/writer. He plays all styles and leaves a lot of his contemporaries in the dust. Get this album. Also get 'Against the Grain' and 'Deuce' and you'll be all set. 'Walk on Hot Coals' is the highlight of this disc. Great band,too.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I can't believe how stuffy Mr. Emerson comes off sounding in his review above.  I couldn't stand the 'Director's Cut' version of this wonderful movie, and I was quite angry that they didn't include the original version on the DVD when it was originally released.  Now we can finally see the film in it's original.  Mr. Emerson doesn't like Harrison Ford's voice over, but to me it added just the right touch of 'world-weary gumshoe detective' to the film.  That odd contrast of old-fashioned detective story with futuristic vision and spectacular music by Vangelis is what makes me love this movie so much.  Shame also on Vangelis for releasing the movie 'soundtrack' without including my favorite piece of music from the film - \\"Prologue and Main Titles\\".
B000A0GYD2|5.0|First, let me say that I own both the 1998 full screen Collector's Edition and the 2005 widescreen Signature Edition.  Many reviewers are debating whether the 2005 edition is true widescreen (1.85:1) or a cropped version of the full-screen (1.33:1) picture.  Well, I compared the two versions I have, and I can tell you that the answer is:  IT IS BOTH.<br /><br />In the filmed sequences, there is more of the picture visible in the 2005 edition.  This definitely means that the show was originally filmed in widescreen format.  However, the entire series is a composite of filmed sequences, actual archive footage/pictures, and computerized special effects.  Since the archival footage and special effects were not filmed in widescreen, they had to be cropped to widescreen format.  So, in the 2005 edition, anytime you see original archival footage or SPFX it is going to a cropped image.  The rest will be true widescreen.  In the 2005 edition, the cropping is very noticeable during opening title sequence of each episode.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will help out potential buyers.  In my opinion the cropping is not a big enough reason not to by this DVD.  This is an excellent mini-series, and should be seen by everyone.
B000URDEB0|4.0|Nightwish have conquered new field again. Just when we thought it was all about gothic melancholia Anette Olzen enters the scene like a fresh breath of air on a calm sea. The new record is more about Power Metal again, big  arrangements catchy melodies I really think Tuomas have outdone himself this time. This along with , Kamelot´s -  ghost opera, Olympos Mons -  Medievil and Symphony X - Paradise lost are the best Metal records of 2007. Anette has a great voice steady and melodic and nobody can deny she´s beautiful too. I don´t think she will have a problem to live up to the achievements of Tarja!  The first track \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" nearly 15 minutes long but still it manage to be a proper opener for the album. The third song \\"Amaranth\\" is clearly the catchiest of them all while the beautiful \\"The islander\\" won´t leave anyone untouched. Marco is also showing new sides of himself as a singer, only few masters the art of Growl aswell as real singing. \\"Eva is the best ballad I´ve heard in a long time simply great! Another great moment on this album is without doubt the bombasic ending. No one since Pink floyd has created such an atmosphere as you can here on the very end of this album. In mind comes P.F´s  \\"The great gig in the sky\\". I recommend this record to everyone who´s into big arrangements and even greater melodies!!!
0810993139|5.0|My seven year old boy loves this book. He read it cover to cover in three days (that's saying a lot for someone who has been reluctant to read longer books). Then he picked it right back up at page one. He's plowing through it for a second time now.<br /><br />Our introduction was when we picked up a friend of our son's who had moved away... His friend and his friend's mom sat in the back, and the mom read from this story. Everyone in the car -- from 7 to 49 -- was laughing out loud and asking to see the pictures.<br /><br />This is the first book that has been bought for my son that I will likely read cover to cover on my own -- if he ever puts it down.<br /><br />Now I need to know if there's a list out there of other books that might appeal to my boy. I want to keep this train rolling.

B000063JDE|5.0|Going into it, the less hype you hear, good or bad, the better. You hear all these things about \\"it\\" and when you actually watch \\"it\\" for the first time, all that profound analysis or whatever the kids are calling it nowadays can be not unlike a rowdy theater, full of a motely crew of chattering chatter boxes, all making their own shadow puppets on the screen and all in the discomfort of you're already crowded head device mark 12. This means this, that means that, this is wrong, thats right, Colonel Muster with the candle stick... aye yai yai, calgon take me away. Thankfully I saw this movie before I heard to much about it, or even Lynch himself for that matter (whom many seem to see as some kind of fly by night charlatan for some utterly creepy reason, I figure it's sexual jealousy). All I had was five bucks in my pocket, a blockbuster card, brutal loneliness and a heart full of napalm. It was like some bizzare friend I'd been waiting for without even knowing I was waiting, that was equally adept at making me laugh as making me cry, and in that, I am truly in debt to it in some zany, cooky kind of way. I can say without risk of hyperbole it was one of the most satisfying and powerful cinematic experiences I've had since I was a child (these results are not typical, no refunds.) It seems unfair that the only thing I can give back for that experience is mere praise (we'll try to work on that.)    If you have yet to watch it, stop reading all the reviews right now and see it for yourself. You may love it, you may hate it, you may have cheap sex with it and not call it the next day, but it's a swell enough movie to where those are largely the only choices you'll have, he said somewhat cautiously. True, there have been some wonderful and thought provoking things said about this film, in it's praise and in it's opposite, but they're not worth you're dime till you've seen it for you're self and have drawn you're own conclusions, and maybe not even then. For me, the film largely stops when the end credits run, and I don't need anybody telling me why I should like it or despise it, for I have seen the mountian, and it is good.     Many intellectual types (possibly qualified as hard nosed intellectual elitists, who, like red necks, despise what they can't understand.) can't stand Lynch because they have a hard time making heads or tails of his work, but oh the folly, if only they would sit back and allow themselves to feel the film, instead of trying to figure it out as if it is was as simple as some mathematical problem. They listen but they do not hear, eat but do not taste, shift but do no shimmy, etc. etc., blah, blah, blah. I don't care if it's all a gimmick or a bowl of broccoli, it's worth something to me.    In summary, I liked it very much, I'm glad it was made instead of not, and if you're cool, you'll like it too.    Viva La Blue Velvet and all it's mutant children.
0743486285|5.0|I've been a Crue and Nikki Sixx fan for quite some time, so when I heard about this book I thought it would be quite interesting... given the antics of Nikki and the boys back in the day.  And wow, was I right.  An absolutely riveting read.  Heart breaking one moment, funny as hell the next... as other reviewers have mentioned it's a real roller coaster of a read.  I purchased the book before leaving on vacation a few weeks ago and was finished it the 2nd day there.  My wife, who is a casual reader at best, thought she would see what I was raving about and was instantly hooked.  Here she is, in Cancun, on our vacation, reading until 4am!  The diary format of the book flows quite nicely, and Nikki even mentions in one of his entries \\"who knows, maybe they will make a book out of this some day... yeah, right\\".  I'm sure glad he did, because it's a hell of a story.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Who better than a rodent to have a gourmet seeking nose?  This fun, delightful for the whole family to see Pixar creation is about Remy, a truly cuisine minded mouse who takes the Paris gourmet scene by storm, riding the hair tails of a chef famous family.<br /><br />This is fun movie watching.  I saw it with the grandkids and their parents, and we all had a good time.  The music and animation and storyline were fun, innocent enough.  Just plain good entertainment.<br /><br />The bonus features are worth the purchase price itself, especially the one which accompanied the movie theatre version: Lifted!  Besides that, there is great new short animation \\"Your Friend the Rat\\" starring Remy and Emile as well as insightful two world confluence of Chef Thomas Keller of French Laundry fame as well as Ratatouille's director Brad Bird.<br /><br />Picks up on much of competition and furious kitchen activity of the finest kitchens around, hopefully without any rodent participation.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|I like the old film style, but the movie is not as fun or interesting as it should be.  too much talking, not enough plot development or action.  I miss the old tarentino films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  Everything since then has been lame.  Kill bill sucked too.

0486440966|5.0|Wilkie Collins' writing is amazing.  The story is so engaging,  spoken from such different points of view with unique voices.  To think it was written in the late 1800's and so enjoyable today.  He is a master story teller.  A classic read that HS English classes should embrace.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This is one of those movies that's lost a bit with age, specially since they've shown it so many times on TV.   The highlight of this DVD are the featturetes which happily include all of the people involved, even Pat Morita who died shortly after his participation here. My only complaint is that they show Daniel's flying kick over a dozen times as well as the same behind-the-scenes beach rehearsal clip, over and over again. The best part: the movie writer's complaint that whenever anybody learns about his work in this movie, the first thing they invariably utter is \\"wax on-wax off\\" (no question there, specially since those words always come up to my mind every time I wax my car !).
B00005MP58|3.0|Pride and Prejudice is such a wonderful story that I wanted so much to love this adaptation.  This version is pretty good and I liked it, but after it was over I felt a bit let down.      PRO:  * Jennifer Ehle gave a lovely performance.    * The script was fairly true to the book (though too much of a good thing can be a liability - see below)    * There were some lovely moments between Darcy and Elizabeth early on and midway through where their growing love is so evident. I especially enjoyed the scene at Pemberley when Elizabeth and Darcy meet unexpectedly.  So charming!      CON:  * The cinematography and direction were completely uninspired.  I could have forgiven boring visuals (even though this is a visual medium...) but,    * The director didn't add his own special thought or point of view to the story.  He took the easy way out and made it literal - TOO literal, in my opinion.  Many times, the story felt flat, cold and unfailingly polite - but not REAL.  This is a movie, not a book and not everything in the novel translates well onto the screen.    * The movie started off nice, but ended with a fizzle, almost as if the director had gotten bored and just wanted to hurry up and get it over with.    * The 2nd proposal had to be one of the most underplayed, disappointing scenes in cinematic history.  It's a simple scene in the novel, as well, but simple doesn't mean boring!  So much could have been done to convey the emotion of the event (when you read the novel, the passion is unmistakable), but in this film it was just a boring, little exchange.  I almost missed the fact that it WAS the proposal. It was *that* bad.  I blame the director.    Despite it's flaws, I still believe it is well worth watching, but it's certainly not the Greatest P&P adaptation ever.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Classic in every sense of the word!!! Dumbo has it all heart,emotion,humor,great animation and so much more!!! All in a movie thats only a little over a hour long (64 minutes)!!! The \\"Pink Elephants On Parade\\" sequence is quite colorful groovy,and to think this was before the groovy colorful sixties,Austin Powers probably dug this movie!!! The Big Top Edition is top notch DVD entertainment!!! Includes a restored version of this all time classic and some top notch DVD extras!!! Disney animation at it's very finest!!! A treat for everyone,young and old everyone in between!!! By the way this is Leonard Maltin's favorte Disney film,and it's mine too!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!! A+
006054094X|5.0|The idea that Chinese maps were used in the European discoveries of America makes perfect sense.  Along with that comes a question: would Columbus have told Queen Isabella that the Chinese really discovered America?  I do not think so.  It is prefectly logical that these voyages were kept secret by not only the Chinese (due to radical shifts in China) but by explorers who wanted to take all the credit.  Academics are quick to criticize Menzies, mainly since he departs from their own developed theories.  Dismissing this book out of hand is reckless and short sighted.  One other key factor is Menzies' intimate knowledge of the seas (winds, currents, etc.), which most land-locked academics lack.  This book (and others about the period) can give us important insights into the Chinese character (temporarily aborted by Mao, the great destroyer)which can help us decifer how China will work in the world - get ready!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|OK, so Tarantino movies aren't long on substance.  So what?  If you want to see a movie that is just a movie, and by that I mean just good old entertainment, he's your guy.  In Death Proof, Quentin continues his string of strong women protagonists (Jackie Brown, Kill Bill) and these chicks are a blast!  Kurt Russell is a hoot as the bad guy.  As you would expect, the film is full of pop culture and movie references and even reminders of Tarantino's own other films.  This movie moves along breezily, propelled by Tarantino's dialogue.  The big shocking scene, which I won't spoil, continues to shock no matter how many times you watch it (and I backed up 3-4 times and rewatched it both times I watched this movie).  Thats how good it is, I watched it twice on the day I got it.
B000002MY3|5.0|A truly original talent, Alanis Morissette's haunting songwriting, angst-ridden lyrics, and jarring voice was really the kick in the you-know-what that the now super-successful singer-songwriter movement needed back then. Whether she's lashing out at society (Ironic), admitting that she was won over by a guy that she probably hated (Head Over Feet), or demanding that he (or perhaps some other guy) get the hell out of her life (You Oughta Know), the intense realism that Alanis speaks to the world with is something that a lot of other singers either don't have or are afraid to use.
9569569387|1.0|This CD is dreadful.  The man who is reading the text has an absolutely horrid reading voice.  It sounds as if he reading the phone book!

1594489505|5.0|All I can really say about this book is that it was an amazing read! I surely could not put it down once I started reading it. Then life intervened so when I did have to put it down, I would catch my mind wondering about the book. It really is a great heart-wrenching book. It makes you an emotional mess. Being a Muslim woman, I can understand a lot of the references made in this book, I especially admire how the author made sure he didn't make Islam the villain, rather the people who interpreted to their advantage the villains. Islam isn't a religion about violence; the word itself means peace. It's those people that think they can use Islam and the Quran to justify their selfishness and their crimes. This book is a great read for Muslims and Non-Muslims alike. I think it will wake you up to the injustices being done around the world. I think this book surely will inspire you to make a little prayer for the people who are actually suffering through what is so profoundly illustrated in this novel. It's a moving story, its raw and heart wrenching. It is one of those books which will surely take its time leaving your mind and heart.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|In 1975, one European reviewer wrote: \\"One collapses in one's seat and is propelled in a state of drunken euphoria.\\"  That's just how I felt about it, going back to experience \\"Barry Lyndon\\" over and over again at the Los Angeles Cinerama Dome theater in 1975-76.  So I give the movie 5 stars. But for the standard 3x4 DVD (1:1.33 aspect ratio), only 3.   Having recently watched the 16x9 Hi-Def Blu-Ray discs of \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (after having watched the old standard DVDs a number of times), I can say that Hi-Def makes an important difference with Kubrick's movies -- not just because they are gorgeously photographed, but because the richness of the images conveys so much essential, visceral meaning that even a slightly degraded picture (i.e., standard DVD) actually impairs the work's emotional fullness, clarity and expressiveness.  So much of \\"Barry Lyndon\\" consists of pure image and music, and so many of the images are meant to intoxicate, that the film needs to be seen in the best possible technical presentation.  Short of a new 35mm print, a 16x9 Blu-Ray disc displayed on a big 1080 set in the dark, uninterrupted, is the way to watch all of Kubrick, perhaps especially \\"Barry Lyndon.\\"  Now, finally, Warners Brothers Home Entertainment will release \\"Barry Lyndon\\" in Hi-Def on Blu-Ray disc on May 31, 2011.  Yes, that means you have to buy it again, but if Warners' Hi-Def releases of their other Kubrick films are any indication, it will be worth it.  With any luck, this Hi-Def release should accelerate the recent critical rehabilitation of this tragically under-appreciated masterpiece.

159102594X|5.0|Barbarians, torture, bloodshed, treason and brawling.      And that is just in the first bit of the book. Throw in mages, monks, cannibal monsters, wastrel swordsmen and more.    Right from the start with the presumed protagonist of the piece nearly falling and doing himself in with his own weapon it seems that this book will be entertaining, and it doesn't disappoint.    It would seem that on this end of the fantasy spectrum A comes between B and C, not before, as somewhere between Brust and Cook's Black Company is where you could say the tone of this book lies.    It actually made me laugh more than once, which is always a good sign.    No brainless bland farmboys or peasant girls who will be sorcerers to be found here.    I suspect the author is greatly entertaining himself with jokes and character references, and if he is, I am sure there are plenty I will not get, having not read tons of this stuff.    However, he has a 'Barbarian from the North' as a major character, which Conan is, of course.  This guy is named Logen, and is the 'best he is at what he does' to quote the First of the Magi in the novel, more of less.  This, of course, is Wolverine's signature line (real name Logan) and he  is also from the cold North and goes berserk much as the 'Bloody-Nine' does, and also cannot have too many knives, being built in.    There are several major characters followed here, or threads of the novel.  One of the others is Glokta, an Inquisitor, or torturer, who has an apprentice torturer named Severard. Not that  this is a name that is remotely differenced from Gene Wolfe's Severian.  There is a Lector, not a Lictor.    Old wizards with Jedi mind tricks, annoying monks with lots of tricks a la Feist, and others, if this is deliberate.  Lots of fun, anyway.    The basic situation is that a strong leader and ex-employer of Logen's has united the Northern barbarian type tribes and fancies a spot of invasion.  The target of said invasion is mostly too busy with decadentplotting, and also has other enemies sensing weakness.    It does seem that the First of the Magi has some sort of vague plan, at least, and he gathers a few people, including Logen and Jezal Luthar the wastrel but now fine swordsman (who wouldn't be the first to go the Earl of Bronze type route, either)  together by the end to try and do something about it, as the Union shores up defenses elsewhere.    Written in a pleasing, no nonsense style with people that basically talk like real people as opposed to rejects from a bad Shakespeare play this is a very refreshing book, indeed.    No generic heroes to be found, but picking this up you will find one hell of an excellent fantasy novel.    Oh, and the cover is cool, so if you need a pirate treasure map/ancient tome for a Halloween or other costume prop, it will stand in nicely in that role, too.    The other sign that this is excellent?  It makes me want to read the next one right now.    Don't remember the last 550 page fantasy book of this sort that did that.    The only real criticism I can think of is that it does take a little bit of time to pull together perhaps with all the disparate character groups.  The various different parties were all interesting though.    If you roll your eyes at elves and dragons and princesses and would prefer to spend time with Skillgannon, Croaker, Vlad Taltos or even the Raven then give this book a shot, as quite likely to be more up your alley.      4.5 out of 5
B000VI04HK|3.0|While the performances here are solid, one CD with 17 tracks and a second CD with 5 just doesn't seem like the way to go, at least for those who aren't just going to rip it to their iPods anyway.  That second CD is crying out for filling up with...oh, c'mon guys, you're geniuses when you can put your minds to it.  A double-live CD packed to the brim with 159 minutes of your best songs would have been legendary.  This is merely adequate.
B00008R9KF|4.0|I suppose people either love this film or hate it....<br /><br />The basic plot was a guy trying to do something in his life in a somewhat confusing world, were everything was not to his advantage.  Omar, a son of Pakistani immigrant, who up until the start of the movie, didn't have any direction in life.  We don't know about his history, but it'll unfold later in the movie.  We learned he is gay, and was a troublemaker when he was younger.<br /><br />Anyways..., I suppose some people don't like how this movie rambles.  I for one, hate it when I sense the author of a book (or in this case, filmmaker) can't seem to make up his/her mind.  I don't think in this movie the direction is lost (it actually works for some odd reason).  The movie is sort of a snapshot of life going through a phase.  This is realism.  I suppose it won't satisfy people who like a grand plot that's meticulously devised.<br /><br />Also keep in mind the movie was from the 80's when most movies' plots were thin like paper.  There are some dialogues that don't connect too well.  In general though, it's pretty good if you put the era into perspective.<br /><br />Memorable characters....  This is a very difficult thing to do in a movie or a book.  I like how real the characters seem to be.  Not fake, not exaggerated malevolent or divinely benign.  They have their own self interests.  There is few political agenda in characters' dialogue (e.g., let's beautify gay people, or let's do an anti-discrimination theme).  No, they are just real people.  They don't speak words directly to the audience and feed us ideas.  They earn out affection by being themselves, not \\"I am gay and Pakistani, so you owe me something.\\"  If you want melodrama, look elsewhere.  (And people say I am melodramatic... ;-))<br /><br />I love the ending; very cute and affectionate.  Leave an imprint on me without shock value or sensual eroticism.  You'd think after Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis) got beaten up, you'd hear some grunt about life and injustice in general.  No..., we are rewarded with a scene where Omar tried to clean Johnny's wound and they ended up not \\"I'm sorry, but let's have sex\\" but two guys, very innocently splash water at each other.  That's VERY original (though I sensed Day-Lewis was about to take his pants off...).  I challenge you to write a scene like that.<br /><br />Life moves on, you know.  I am happy the movie doesn't give a self-pity, wound-licking ending.  (I apologize for being so unprofessional in this review.  LOL!)we are rewarded with a scene where Omar tried to clean Johnny's wound and they ended up not \\"I'm sorry, but let's have sex\\" but two guys, very innocently splash water at each other.

1582701709|3.0|This book is nothing more than a book about positive thinking.  Nothing wrong with positive thinking.  It's what propels you forward, but you have to be realistic as well.  If we truly had the power to wish our way into happiness, there'd be a lot less conflict going on in the world right now.      This book is uplifting, but I'd save your money.

I even have the Journey CD. It's pretty nice if you ask me.    OK, so I'm supposed to be reviewing the Journey CD, & it's pretty AWESOME. The titled track \\"Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants\\" has some major substance behind it. I didn't know how good this double (yes I said double) CD was until letting it jam a lil'. Check it out and see that the Boy Genius known as harmonica man did his thing in this CD.
B00012QM86|5.0|schindeler's list, one of the best movies of all time, without a doubt, and one of my absolute favorites. this movie is a masterpiece. very touching on so many levels. it truly is an eye opener, and gives it to you straight. no beating around the bush. very sad, and a tragedy that was so terrible and unreasonable. about one madmans sadistic ruling over so many helpless people. this movie from beginning to end hits you right in the heart. overall look through the eyes of a man who at first didn't give a damn about noone but himself, and turned out to be the savior of so many thankful people. to this day he is remembered. the era of the holocaust. such a tragic event in history, and the fact that this film is based on one man's journey through this rough time makes it all the more realer. if you have not seen it, then you must because there is hardly any words to make you understand what you will feel once you have seen this movie. it starts with the jews giving their names, profession, and they all have to wear a star. the star is a brand. they are branded as jews. little by little they are being kicked out of homes, discarded in the streets, driven off to consentration camps, or thrown in to caged areas to live. they are stripped of their possesions, their identities,  they are ripped from their families, and they have no say. they can not object, they can not think, and they can not escape for they will be executed. it is an extermination of all people who are jewish. a command to be carried out as brutally as one can imagine, by a man so evil and sinister he is hell on earth. then comes oscar shindler, a womanizer who's only goal is to make money and look out for himself. he sees what occurs around him but feels nothing and doesn't really care. if it doesn't affect him, what does it matter. he never thought twice about being a part of the nazi crew. until he met itzhak stern, his helper. together they purchase a factory ready to make money, but itzhak has other plans. he knows that this factory can save lives of the hell that surrounds them. so one by one he recruites people. as many as he can to come to schindlers place to work. then oscar realizes what is happening and he can't help but feel some kind of guilt, remorse, and sympathy for these people who have done nothing wrong. he starts to become involved, more aware, and goes broke in order to buy these people, or bribe the higher officials, all in order to save lives. this becomes his goal, he thinks of nothing else but this. all the while making sure he never got caught. by the end you are so involved in the movie you just can't help not to think about it and realize what kind of a man it takes to put his life at risk for others. what do you call a man that gives up everything for these people he knew nothing about. these people that are known as schindlers people. people he grew to care for. thus after this he became a different man. he gained their respect, their love, and their admiration forever. this movie is of the deepest kind, for real, and no other has come to compare to this film. wonderful actors, great depiction of real life events, and a sad but beautiful story. another lesson learned, never give up hope. liam neeson, wonderful actor, excellent role and i got hooked on him after i saw this film. he does it just right. i have just touched the tip of this movie with my review, it is a must see, for all. you see this and you realize that life isn't so bad. at least we have a choice. GREAT FILM!

B000000WCV|5.0|I saw one review here which said something about how bad Homework is because of the elemetry beats and the repetivness. This person obvisouly has no idea about how dance music was in the earlier acid days. Violent and repitivive is what they where going for in this album. If  you like more pop/easy listning type of music, their second album Discovery is probably more for you. I like all their albums but I must say homework is my favourite. Its all about the TR-909, TR-808 beats, old samplers and dirty basslines produced by vintage synths like the korg ms-20 and so on! -

B00005JMFQ|2.0|The only two \\"real women\\" in the movie (read, over 30) have unhappy endings and yet all the men, young and old alike, have their wildest fantasys come true.  If you like to see 50-something men end up with women half their age, this is the movie for you. Maybe I'm just mad because I didn't like how the Emma Thompson bit turned out. What the heck happened? I never figured it out.   The only reason this gets two stars is because I like Colin Firth. But he is only in about 1/10th of this movie, so don't get too excited!
B000VI04HK|2.0|What a great missed opportunity this DVD set is.  I won free tickets to see a screening of this DVD in a movie theater yesterday, and I was really excited -- I'd seen REM on the tour that this DVD documents, and love their music.    But boy was I disappointed when it started -- the DVD was PAINFUL to watch and made both my wife and I nauseous -- it has to be the worst concert DVD I've ever seen -- the editing is beyond frenetic -- I mean, harsh cuts that never last more than 1 or 2 seconds on each shot (you can count them out -- 1, 2, 3 -- CUT; 1,2,3 -- CUT; 1,2 -- CUT; 1 -- CUT), and even worse -- the shots are never steady (as if the director/producer told the cameramen \\"Don't ever hold your cameras still), they focus on random things (SUPER closeup of Michael Stipe's left eye; grainy footage of video monitors in the editing room; get a good shot of a guitar and then [WHY???] cut to the same shot with green editing graphics over it; a foot); and even worse, they do inneumerable things to distort the picture when the do have a good shot (put a prism in front of the camera [I think], mess with the graininess and/or color).    Despite LOVING the music and generally being a fan of concert videos, we couldn't stand more than 20 minutes of this PAINFUL video -- it gave us both headaches.      So, buy/listen to the CDs, or even play the DVD if you want to hear surround sound, but for your own sake, TURN THE TV OFF IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET NAUSEOUS or a headache!!!!
B000TGCR3I|4.0|This DVD glues you to the screen.  I was particularly interested in the character of White and how the child at times seems simple-minded, just being a child, joyful, insane, depressed and near the end during his separation from Black almost has extra-sensory perception to be able to see events happening to Black in a different place.  It was most interesting.  Black also goes through many emotional phases from warrior, to acrobat, to child protector, to emotionally lost.  The character of Kimura also becomes quite moving.  The scene where he has to shoot his mentor is touching.  The animation goes from making us feel like we're on a Tokyo street to the wildly fantastic.  The climactic carnival sequence with fire and blood is breathtaking.  This is an engaging story and DVD, well worth viewing.  Enjoy!

B000WSHF4E|5.0|\\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" entrances.  Presented at the Toronto Film Festival, Cate Blanchett is riveting.  The range of queen to a private woman with doubts & desires is exquisite.  Blanchett played in the 1998 film \\"Elizabeth\\" & was nominated for an Oscar.  She won Best Supporting Actress for \\"The Aviator\\" in 2004 and was nominated for \\"Notes on a Scandal\\" in 2006.  She centerpieces the film.<br /><br />An array of excellent players includes Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh.

With stunning good looks, she displays great range from the official to personal with Sir Walter to concern for her cousin.<br /><br />Her cousin Francis Throckmorton is played by Steven Robertson.  In brief scenes, he is memorable, urging Bess to help him regain favor with the Queen and in torture as Rush's Walsingham wrenches information from him.  Robertson had a small role in Orlando Bloom's \\"Kingdom of Heaven.\\"<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne, who was Matt Damon's son in \\"The Good Shepard,\\" plays Thomas Babington who attempts to assassinate Elizabeth with an unloaded gun.

0920668372|1.0|The title of this book and its cover illustration compelled me to buy it for my sons, and I was very happy with it for the first several pages.  But when a woman in her, say 60s, drives across town in the middle of the night with a ladder on her car, climbs the ladder UP INTO HER SLEEPING ADULT SON'S BEDROOM, to hold him in her arms....it completely weirded me out!    I mean, they could have shown him in a hospital bed after knee surgery or something if the author wanted to show that your mom will still nurture you as an adult.  Why a BED has to be involved, I don't know.  And why didn't she have a key to her son's house???  She is a nut, that's why.  Strange...I have never thrown away a book in my life, but did with that one.
B000VSBX34|5.0|After \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" They did it in less than a year. Another comedy directed by Richard Lester. This time it's more than a musical but a very british sit-com full of Beatle gags. They were extremely funny and full of wit, they played themselved being in an adventure/ action movie and it worked perfectly. They were stoned all the time too, but that doesn't mean they weren't having fun. Ringo claims he doesn't remember a second of the shooting because he was on pot all the time. Nevertheless, he played extremely well for \\"Ticket To Ride\\" and \\"You're Gonna Lose That Girl.\\" John was in his \\"Fat Elvis\\" phase, depressed of all the fame and fortune he had and not being able to express himself completely. Sgt. Pepper was a year and a half away. Paul McCartney had his best Beatle moment, in my opinion. Two extremely good songs: \\"The Night Before\\" and \\"Another Girl\\" were featured in the movie and another song for the Help! LP, \\"Yesterday\\" became his masterpiece. George wrote and sang \\"I Need You\\" and, with \\"Something\\", it's his best piece of work.<br /><br />You know what would have been a great bonus feature for the DVD? a commentary/ review of the 7 additional songs in the Help! U.K. album. I would have loved to hear George Martin talking about \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\\" the last cover the Beatles played in record, featuring a powerful, soulful John. Even tho he claimed later \\"It's Only Love\\" sucked, this tune is really, really adorable and romantic. Ringo strikes with \\"Act Naturally\\" and of course, Paul brings down the country house with \\"I've Just Seen A Face.\\" Let's be honest, side B is better than side A in the Help! LP. Am I right?<br /><br />I don't know why Help! was moved to the Nov. 6, maybe it's a Paul McCartney move to promote his DVD box being released the next week and also clean his image because of his messy divorce... I don't know. I want to have Help! right now in my hands!

0679409874|4.0|Okay, I wrote a review on this novel about 4 days ago, and I don't think it's going to show up on here, so I'll give it another try.<br />  I can't help but love Jane Austen.  She is my guilty pleasure read, like a Jackie Collins of the early 19th century because her novels are just drenched in drama and scandal.  They are not really a thinking man's novel, just fun stories to read.  I also enjoy the romance aspects of her novels because they are classy, not like the trash smut you read in today's modern \\"romance\\" stories.  I feel almost uncomfortable and embarrassed when I read a modern romance story.  Well anyhow, when it comes to drama and scandal, Sense and Sensibility does not disappoint.  When you commit to the story, it really takes you in.  I really enjoyed the protagonist, Elinor, but I was unhappy with Austen's Marianne character.  It seems as if Austen could truly identify with Elinor because she did a great job developing her character as level-headed, proud, and classy.  Perhaps she took a little Elinor from herself?  Now, in the beginning of the novel you get drawn in by Marianne.  She commands a good third of the book with her story and her character starts off well developed.  You get a true feeling for her impetuousness.  She is emotional, passionate, wears her heart on her sleeve.  The novel is so interesting until the end.  The end completely disappoints.  Now I don't know if Austen became uninspired at the end of the novel or just didn't know how to end it better, but it falls completely flat.  Like I mentioned before, you get interested in this Marianne character and you know how she is, but then at the end she decides one day to become like Elinor?!  Just like that?!  An impetuous person like Marianne would not and could not do a 180 with their mannerisms.  Then, Austen does no justice to Marianne by having her marry at the end of the novel.  It is just so dubious it doesn't make sense.  Austen also wraps up all the scandal and drama in almost 3 pages.  How convenient!  That was just bogus to me.  But the rest of the story is so good I would still recommend this, especially to Austen fans.  If I were to make a recommendation to a new Austen reader, I would recommend Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility.  It is more concise and it is a shorter novel.3 pages.  How convenient!  That was just bogus to me.  But the rest of the story is so good I would still recommend this, especially to Austen fans.

034544678X|5.0|Let me begin by saying, I'm not an animal behaviorist, nor do I feel qualified to agree or disagree with everything in the book... I will say this though, when McConnell gives you a bit of food for thought, and you work with it, you really realize how great her books are.  - - Though not an instructional manual, I often find myself putting her books down and trying out ome of the ideas, and saying, \\"Wow, she's right! I never thought of it like that!\\" - - as to what her key point is, its simple:  We people are primates, and we have an instinctively different way of talking with our body than canines... in many ways the opposite... As a result, often we send messages to our dogs that we don't mean to, while misinterpreting the one's they send to us.  Dogs, both fortunately and unfortunately are masters at reading body language and as a result we drive them nuts, as well as are driven nuts... for example when we say \\"come!\\" with our mouth, but with our bodies say \\"run away from me!\\" - - We even try to express our love to our dogs using gestures that dogs use to tell other dogs, \\"Submit or put up a fight!\\" - - (Hence the phenomena of the normally friendly German Shepard who suddenly snaps right at a kid's face.)<br /><br />Using her distinct style of writing which combines academic experience and anecdotal experience with the loves of her live (Lassie and Cool Hand Luke), Patricia McConnell really does bring to life the mystery of human dog communication... and does it in an interesting way:  but getting US to observe our own body language...<br /><br />In the end, even if you are one of those people who are enlightened enough to realize that dogs are dogs, not people... after reading this book you will probably look at yourself and your dog VERY differently !  MUST HAVE READING !<br /><br />P.S.  Since reading McConnell's books, I can get my 5 month pup to come when called almost EVERY time no matter how distracted he is... - - not bad for two books that DON'T claim to be training manuals!nuals!
B000WCBPOG|4.0|This edition is 29 songs long.  I found another version with 31 songs at Best Buy.  The two missing songs here are:  \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\\" and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\"     Otherwise, this is a great album.  The original cast voices Evan Rachel Woods, Jim Sturgess, etc. are excellent, plus we get guest shots from Joe Cocker (Come Together), Bono (I am the Walrus, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds) and Eddie Izzard (Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite).     Probably my top two of this collection is Joe Cocker's rough voice on \\"Come Together\\" and the excellent surprise of Martin Luther McCoy's voice on \\"While my Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"     I strongly recommend the movie and this soundtrack is one of my favorites as well.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This special edition of The Shining is fantastic, especially in hi-def. Picture and sound quality (5.1 and PCM both sound excellent) is top notch, and the special features are actually worth watching; the steadicam feature, the \\"Making Of\\" which highlights Kubrick's abilities as a visual and psychological director (he practically torments his actors to get the agitation and desperation out of each take), and the documentary filmed by his daugther. This is a necessary upgrade for any Kubrick enthusiast or fan of the movie (or both for that matter).    ** The movie is in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, not 1.66:1 like Amazon's specs say. Also, this is the uncut version, not the European edit. I'm honestly not a movie buff like many voicing these concerns, but I love the movie, went out and bought it at a retail store, and watched it at home; it's the real deal. **
0060853980|5.0|Is the Apocalypse funny?  You wouldn't think so. I won't belabor the plot, characters, etc.  I'm just adding my 5 stars to the total for this book because it's well worth that--and more.     \\"Good Omens\\" is one of the funniest books I have ever read.  While both the authors are good individually, this one collective work is classic.      I have read very few books more than once--but I'm re-reading this book and finding more to laugh about.  I've bought several copies of \\"Good Omens\\" to give to friends and family when I think they'll need it.
0143038419|3.0|This book is divided into three sections or chapters where Ms. Gilbert travels in her quest to find herself and the meaning of life.  I am giving this book only three stars because I really enjoyed the chapters on Italy (EAT) and Indonesia (LOVE), but I felt the chapter on India (PRAY-which is 1/3 of the book) could have been better.  I struggled with getting through the India chapter and almost skipped that chapter to make it to Indonesia and finish the book.  All in all, I liked Ms. Gilbert's style of writing.  I long to go back to Italy (especially Naples which I visited as a little girl) and eat pasta there and now I also want to travel to Bali to swim at the beach and experience with my husband the romance of this beautiful, magical place, which Ms. Gilbert thoroughly enjoyed.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Due to storage issues, I am coming to re-evaluate my need to buy CDs.  iTunes and others offer attractive prices on single songs, liner notes and lyrics are often available on the artist sites, and let's face it--there are very few CDs that I like every song.    \\"Magic\\" is one of that category.  People liken it to \\"Born in the USA,\\" \\"The Rising\\", all the good Springsteen and I'd agree--because the spirit of the collection is on that level--there's just no filler here.      Of course, the Boss has things to say about American life, culture, etc.  \\"Radio Nowhere\\" the song I first heard from this collection talks about the state of the broadcast industry:    I was tryin' to find my way home  But all I heard was a drone  Bouncing off a satellite  Crushin' the last lone American night  This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?  This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?    And he's right--you wonder that when you're searching the FM band for something that's not \\"Jack\\", \\"Earl\\", or \\"Bob.\\" (Didn't that used to be Tom, Dick and Harry?)    Probably the hardest song to listen to is \\"Living in the Future.\\"  One verse literally gave me chills:    Woke up Election Day, skies gunpowder and shades of gray  Beneath a dirty sun, I whistled my time away  Then just about sundown  You come walkin' through town  Your boot heels clickin'  Like the barrel of a pistol spinnin' 'round    Just when you think the future's a bleak and terrible place, \\"Girls in their Summer Clothes\\" leaves you with a little more hope.      A kids rubber ball smacks  Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light  Big bank clock chimes  Off go the sleepy front porch lights  Downtown the stores alight as the evening's underway  Things been a little tight  But I know their gonna turn my way    This particular song took me back to my childhood in a time when people used less air conditioning and spent their time outdoors actually hearing the chimes and seeing what was going on in the street.The magic of this particular CD is that it does take you places.  Some of them are not comfortable--most of them make you think, but that's what Bruce and the E Street Band is all about--good music with a message to go along with it.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|OK, just pop in disc 1, look at the hilarious arcade computer game menu, and you know it's gonna be fun. Because AC/DC was and is always in for a bit of fun. Have a good time, while rockin' out. Judged from the content on this boxset, that is very obvious. Select \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\" and you just can't not bang your head a little bit to the electrifying sound, which, on this track, sounds absolutely brilliant, beautifully remastered for this release. The really old clips before that sound a bit muffled, probably because of age. Further on the sound is varying between spectacular and a bit cranky.  I understand that the restoration people only can do so much, but I'm very satisfied with their clean-up work.  At last, with this release, we get to see Bon Scott's funny stage persona in full, making funny faces and winking at the cameras. In \\"Rocker\\" you can't stop laughing when Angus goes into the frozen (from shock?) audience and gets in their hair. More jokes from the band as they cut off Pete Drummond's intro speech on camera, and just kick off with \\"Problem Child\\".  The selection of songs is very good, although I suspect that some fans will miss their personal favorites.   Rounding out disc 1 are some cool vintage interview clips with the band and one long interview with a very laid back Bon Scott.  Disc 2 contains live material with singer Brian Johnson. As there are several live dvd releases out there featuring Brian, most fans are familiar with Brian's showmanship. It's nice to see some of his most early footage with the band, from 1981, including some interview clips, where he admitted that he didn't realise what he was in for or how big the band already had become.  Especially cool is the VH-1 clip where we see the band in a very small studio space as opposed to the large stages we have seen them up until now, but with a good sense of being a tight unit and comfortable with each other and just enjoying playing rock n' roll together. Rehearsal footagemade during the soundcheck for this session is presented as a bonus, also very cool. We see Angus playing with a cigarette in his mouth and just jamming along. The sound starts out a bit crap, because it's a soundcheck, but later on we get to hear the instruments getting into the mix and Brian's dancing along.  The other cool extra on this disc is live footage taken from the Rolling Stones 40 Licks tour, where AC/DC probably shared the bill on that day in 2003.  Angus and Malcolm join the Stones on stage to play \\"Rock Me Baby\\", an old B.B. King blues track. Keith and Ron Wood and Angus doing his usual funny thing, just a pleasure to watch. You can tell by the look on all of their faces that The Stones and the Young brothers really had some fun there.  Disc 3 contains first of all some tracks that have been cut from disc 1 and 2. Why not put it there in the first place? I don't know. Maybe to ensure picture and sound quality with a high bitrate on those discs. Maybe to give the fans some extra stuff for buying the Collector's Edition. Among the highlights is a clip with band rehearsal footage from 1983, where we see the band playing facing each other, a set up anyone who's playing in a band will recognise. Great stuff.  Also featuring on this disc is a big part of a concert filmed in 1983 in Houston, with 9 songs in a row. A bit of a shame that they didn't put the entire gig on here.  All in all, I had a great time going through all this stuff, and I'm very pleased that live material from the Bon Scott era has been made available. I still can't believe the energy Angus has when I see him play (I myself saw AC/DC play in 1988 and 2000). The way he moves like he's on full tilt and bangs his head, as if he's the greatest fan of the band, and then play so effortlessly, amazing. Especially the old stuff is great where he looks just like a kid (and probably was).  Apart from the great dvd's you get a nice booklet, and some facsimiles from old concert tickets and backstagepasses, and a concert poster from 1979.  A spectacular set for a great price. Highly recommended! And Amazon, please, don't list this as a Rolling Stones release, they're on 1 bloody track for pete's sake. This is AC/DC, man.
B000FVBLEI|4.0|In this review i am going to sum up 2 cd's they made.    this darkened heart- i love this cd. It isn't overly heavy but I really like the amount of time it seems they put into this album. good amount of tracks and just good song writing.only prob probably could have been recorded better    fall of ideals. much heavier which I like. but for some reason something is lacking on this record. i think to much double bass for there style of music i'm not sure. I also don't think they took enough time in writing the songs. anyway still a killer release with good recording.      all in all i like this darkened heart better but fall of ideals is still awesome..pick up both albums
0066214122|3.0|Pretty good book, easy to read, and entertaining. I wished that there would have been more action taking place at home than at the lab. That was a bit boring. The book was predictable, but in a good way, I mean of if you've read a lot of sci-fi books then you can pretty much tell how the book is going to end.   The ending it what I kind of didn't like. It seemed so rushed and shoddy. I was absolutely flustered at the end cause you know there isn't a Prey 2, so I think he could have rapped it up a little better than that.
0143038583|3.0|A fascinating view of our food supplies.    Apart from one very bad glaring mistake it is a damn good read.    The mistake? The brain does not need glucose to function.  The brain functions perfectly well on ketones (derived from fat).    Apart from the above nonsense it is a great read.
0307387178|3.0|This is a good book but is not really my type of book. There is too much sadness in it.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|I am very much enjoying the Hits CD. The Misses are honestly, well, just that... I bought this two CD pack because I couldn't find a straight forward greatest hits CD that provided the songs I wanted and I thought why not? I might find some buried treasure. After reviewing, I can say, not so much.     If you are in the same boat, you may just want to download the songs you want from i-tunes. That said, download those songs because Peter's best stuff is amazing.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|this is a wonderful period comedy/drama it has good music to go with the story it being set in 18th century italy.an excellent film with good acting and good humour.
B000TSIK14|5.0|It's amazing to hear this band emitting so much intensity and energy after all these years. This is THE heaviest album from the band. Vocals are high quality with crisp voice and sensible lyrics. The album starts with an energetic Hour I, peaks at 321, the best song on the album, and ends at a soft-yet-strong Humanity. There's also a beautiful ballad, called \\"Love will keep us alive\\", which is also probably the lightest song on the record. There's not a single slack moment in the entire album. Each and every song, barring one, has razor riffs with excellent sound engineering. Although you might complain in the end about the heaviness of the album, but will nevertheless find yourself reaching out for this CD again after a short while. Compositions have very catchy tunes, and not enough words can be used to praise the band's playing.    A master stroke! A MUST BUY for any music lover. While metalheads will love this album simply because it is a perfectly crafted metal album, non-metalheads can get a lesson on how metal music SHOULD actually sound.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|This CD promises great things, but never quite delivers.  Far Cry opens with churninig humbuckers as a natural progression from Vapor Trails then hits with a ringing chord which harkens back to Hemispheres.  A few more \\"throwback\\" moments might have helped save what is, for the most part, a forgettable effort.  There are a few good tracks (Far Cry, Main Monkey Business, Working Them Angels), but far more forgettable fodder.  The musicianship is impeccable as always, with all three of the guys stretching their skills repeatedly but not needlessly in terms of serving the song.      Call me nuts, but after listening to Geddy Lee's vocals for the whole album, I find that I prefer his past \\"high pitched warble\\", as some music reporters have called it, to the current more mellow and melodious method he currently employes.  I also am finding that Neil Peart's lyrics grow increasingly less interesting from album to album.  His lyrics are often obvious and, frankly, are not nearly as insightful as he probably thinks they are.  I realize it is a bit much to ask for another The Trees, Anthem, Subdivisions or even Limelight, but the last few CDs have really fallen short in my opinion on the lyrical front.    It's Rush, so it earns four stars, but probably really only deserves three.
0790733226|5.0|Jodie Foster gives a passionate performance as a scientist in search for ET.  Her determination to go against the scientific community, the government and politics within her own scientific community, in order to substantiate the existence of extraterrestial life pays off in the end, or does it?  She is by default left to take the ultimate journey herself to see whether what her father believed was truth or fiction.  The billionaire who funds her venture adds a bit of wonderful eccentricity to the movie.  Even though the ending of the movie with her transport to the outer reaches of the universe and a surprise encounter with another being leaves one wondering \\"what was that all about\\" the movie, as a whole, is very entertaining.  The special effects of the \\"other worlds\\" is stunning and so beautiful you don't want to stop watching.  It is a fitting tribute to Carl Sagan, the Cosmos Series Author.
B000002OZY|3.0|Sure, there's no questioning the importance of Tommy, the Who's landmark 1969 double-LP rock-opera opus. The record, along with King Crimson's debut, is one of the founding documents of progressive rock, and among the first albums to treat rock `n' roll as a serious art form rather than a pop music flavor-of-the-decade. It's also one of the group's most popular albums, and the home of at least one signature Who tune (\\"Pinball Wizard\\"). Its position in rock history is, for better or worse, pretty much secure. But enough time has elapsed since its inception and recording to reveal that Tommy is also a bloated, pretentious mess of an album.     I mean, seriously, look at this thing: The \\"plot\\" of the opera is thinner than wax paper and full of gaping holes. The symbolism is overdone and heavy-handed, and the story swerves from incomprehensible to melodramatic, with plenty of irrelevant plot turns and head-scratching non-developments thrown in for good measure. There's not much in the way of good characterization, either. In general, the whole thing feels like a slip-shod, thrown together affair.    All of which would be mostly tolerable if Tommy were stuffed with great songs. Sadly, a lot of these tracks are here mainly to advance the plot (even though some of them serve only to muddle it). \\"It's A Boy,\\" \\"There's A Doctor,\\" \\"Smash the Mirror,\\" \\"Fiddle About,\\" \\"Miracle Cure,\\" \\"Tommy Can You Hear Me\\" and \\"Tommy's Holiday Camp\\" are the most notable culprits, since none of them even seem to attempt to be enjoyable in and of themselves (even though the latter does have a certain charming silliness). Even the more substantial songs tend to fall short of excellent: \\"Christmas\\" matches an uninteresting melody with annoyingly melodramatic lyrics, while \\"Sensation\\" is generic third-rate power pop. There's also an excruciatingly stiff and pitifully un-bluesy cover of Sonny Boy Williamson's \\"Eyesight To The Blind,\\" and a just-okay Entwistle tune entitled \\"Cousin Kevin.\\"     So, why am I giving this thing three stars? Because the Who are the Who, that's why! Even their weaker albums had world-class songs, and Tommy's inordinate size really gives the law of averages a run for its money. \\"Pinball Wizard\\" is a rollicking classic with some fantastic power-chordage and memorable lyrics. There's also the wistful, swinging folk rock of \\"Sally Simpson\\" and the dreamy, almost psychedelic \\"I'm Free.\\" We've also got the lilting \\"Welcome\\" and the merciless pound of \\"Acid Queen.\\" \\"Amazing Journey\\" is intoxicating and hypnotic, and it spills into the rip-roaring instrumental that is \\"Sparks.\\" \\"Overture,\\" despite having a name and purpose that smack of theatrical pretention, is an engrossing and shape-shifting introduction to the album. \\"Underture\\" an unwieldy epic that, although it may overstay its welcome, does feature some great moments as well. \\"1921\\" has a melody that isn't too far from beautiful, and \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" brings the album to a rocking conclusion. \\"Go To The Mirror, Boy\\" is the album's hidden gem, a classic bit of crunching power pop with an absolutely spine-tingling second half.    So, influence aside, there's really only a clutch of good songs preventing this album from being a true disaster. Get it for the good tunes and the historical value, but if you want a truly great rock opera from the Who, check out Quadrophenia.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|If you're a Sci-Fi buff or just looking for good entertainment and material to ponder, this movie is for you.  It is based on fact and after viewing it more than once, it kinda gives you the shudders to even contemplate that some aliens aren't the little grays that we have come to know and (love??).  What these young men went through (and one in particular) would change anyone's perspective on the question, \\"are we the only life form in the universe?\\"  I highly recommend it.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|When `Saw' was first released it took the nation by storm.  It was the freshest thing to hit the world of horror and it still to this day has a large following.  With `Saw IV' set to hit theaters this weekend the anticipation is already thick for what new and disturbing things lay in store for the general public.  With the sequels though there has been an onslaught of critics for the original film as well calling it an overrated piece of trash.  I feel that this is an unfair assessment.  The original film was unique and thought provoking.  Finally we had a detour from the abundance of prefabricated copycats, horror films that relied heavily on severed limbs and large amounts of gore to establish a fan base.  This is not to say that `Saw' is lacking in the gore department, or even in the severed limbs area (just what do you think that `saw' is for) but it's smarter than that.  By the closing credits the audience has been forced to really open their minds, turn on their thinkers and delve into the material presented before them.  Saw is gritty, real, disturbing and most importantly stimulating.<br /><br />The film opens with two men waking up in a room alone with a corpse.  The two men are chained to opposite sides of the room, the corpse lying between them just out of reach.  The two men are Adam, a student, and Lawrence, a doctor.  Soon after awakening the two men are informed that they only have a short period of time before they are to be killed.  They have been left clues in order to lead them to survival but they must find and follow them.  Before long it becomes apparent that they are being toyed with by a mastermind bent on making them atone for past indiscretions.  As their sanity begins to fray they uncover that they are linked in more ways than their current situation.<br /><br />As far as acting is concerned, this is far from a showcase that's for sure.  Cary Elwes is somewhat all over the place here and Leigh Whannell (who co-wrote the film with director James Wan) is very amateur.  Danny Glover is decent as is Monica Porter but really the only effective actor is Tobin Bell and he's rarely seen, only heard.<br /><br />What `Saw' lacks in acting it makes up for in originality and sheer eeriness.  In fact this is one of the only films that have kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  It has been compared to `Se7en', which is a nice compliment (`Se7en' is the better film), but `Saw' really is a film all its own.  Aside from the scare tactics there really is no similarity between the two films.  The subsequent sequels have been less effective than this original and it's a shame that Hollywood rushes these things because of that `it' factor, embracing a hot commodity to the effect of tarnishing a good thing.  If only a little more time and effort had been placed into creating sequels with the same originality and gritty flare as this original film then maybe we would have a complete set of worthy horror films.  Sure `Saw' has its flaws (mostly found within the acting) but it works hard within the script and plot to make up for its flaws and deliver one disturbing, horrific and gruesome good time.ery amateur.

076790382X|5.0|Back to New England after a two-decade-long spell in the old one, Bill Bryson penned these articles for a British newspaper supposedly over protestations that he didn't have the time to do so. You would never know it. The result is a thoroughly entertaining book. Well, okay - a pretty entertaining book. But it's thoroughly entertaining in places, swimming with wonderful bits of utterly useless information. A collection of essays, some, naturally, are better than others, but the good ones really shine. Living in the UK so long allowed Bryson a cultural comparative model, and upon return to his homeland the good, the bad, the ugly, and, most importantly, the patently absurd all came into crystal-clear focus. In short, American society was begging to made fun of.<br /><br />Bryson skewers new and unsettling trends along with things he previously took for granted or never gave much thought to. Absolutely, he complains a good deal, but he is good at it, and goodness knows someone has to. His writing flows in that buoyant, easy manner for which he has become so well known. And, of course, there is humour. Some jokes fall flat, but most hit their mark. I bought I'm a Stranger Here Myself as Notes from a Big Country, paired with his book about traveling around England, Notes from a Small Island. Together, these form The Complete Notes, which held my interest for weeks.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt, author
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I had heard \\"You Can Send Me Flowers\\" on Satellite Radio several times and knew I had to find this Blues Prophet Ray.  His lyrics are so gut-wrenching and cathartic that after hearing the entire CD I felt it had saved me thousands in psychotherapy.  Quite a religious experience.  Collaborating with people like Michael McDonald didn't hurt his arrangements, either.  Ray sounds like Joe Cocker in \\"Three More Days,\\" and like George Harrison in \\"Within You.\\"  But he lays out his bare soul in all lyrics with the most passion I have heard in a long time, along with great guitar licks, his own unique style, and THE MOST HAUNTING VOICE.  A true blues prophet Ray is.  I'm so glad he finally convinced himself to find his way out of his manufacturing plant job and into songwriting and performing where he truly belongs.  I look forward to his other CDs.  Don't miss this one!
B0002858YS|5.0|Wonderful retro album that takes you back to the early 80's and is obviously influenced by the bands of that time.  Vocally and musically reminds me a lot of Ultravox.  My favorite song is actually \\"Smile like you mean it\\". Highly recommended retro alternative rock and roll.
B00005ATQF|4.0|I took my wife (still married since 1987) to this movie for our very first date.  Yes, yes it was a mistake - what was I thinking.  Nevertheless it has always been a topic of humorous conversation throughout the many years we've been together.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the boot camp scene is the only section of the movie that catapults this movie above the rest.  I had been in boot camp only a couple of years before, so it resonated with me on a different level I guess.  The rest of the movie is rather blah and the ending is rather ridiculous, so that is what prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars.<br /><br />I recommend it, but don't take your date to it, unless you really want to end up married.  ha ha
1592332803|5.0|I have been a listener and big fan of the author's podcast for several months now. I purchased this cookbook based on how thoughtful and articulate the podcast is; and, I was not disappointed! Everything I have made from this cookbook has turned out beautifully. I have never considered myself much of a \\"baker,\\" so I am delighted at how yummy the results have been thus far. The chocolate chip cookies (a favorite for my little ones) are wonderful (and impossible to distinguish as vegan). I love that this cookbook includes a variety of baked goods (not just sweets). The cornbread is awesome, and I can't wait to try the pumpkin bread! Thanks, Colleen.  - A happy cook and fellow vegan
B0009VRHLK|1.0|This movie was by far the worst I have seen in some time.  Lack creativity and was very boring.  The director demonstrated limit depth in cinema.  The acting was awful as well.  This movie was done some time ago and I hope the actors have work on their craft.
B000UJ48VI|1.0|This is the third DVD release of Kubrick´s masterpiece, and it is still not given an anamorphic transfer. How can this happen in 2007, considering Warner´s reputation as a studio that cares and the classic status of the film? Incredible. And not a trace of any new extras or bonuses except the trailer we´ve seen before. A huge boo to Warner! Words fail.
B000GH3CVQ|4.0|Steeped in what was once known as Top Forty or now, Golden Oldies, I generally dislike alternative or indie music.  Whatever descriptive label you wish to place on this CD, \\"very good\\" should be included somewhere.  Having seen \\"Once\\" and liking it, I was curious about additional work by Glen Hansart and Marketa Irglova.  The rhythm is non-syncopated (if I am using that term correctly) but engaging.  Mr. Hansard's Celtic roots are woven into many of the pieces, especially the title song. The power and passion of \\"When Your Minds Made Up\\" give me goose-bumps.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This is definitely worth seeing once, due to some excellent casting, sharp writing, and a few surprises. However, I never considered it a comedy. It is an exaggerated slice of life depiction of a dysfunctional family's long weekend road trip from New Mexico to Southern California for a child \\"beauty pageant.\\" Grandpa shoots up heroin, big brother does not speak at all, by choice, Mom's brother is a gay suicide survivor, Mom is disappointed in her husband's dreams of being the next self-help guru. Abby Breslin as the pageant contestant is superb, but there are several moments of tension or sadness in here which, while well-done, do outrank the laughs.
B000UJCALI|5.0|First off, rumor control:    1) This film was meant to be seen in widescreen as it is in this new DVD release. And yes you do see a little bit more on the sides (yet a little bit less on the top and bottom) due to this being an open matte film. The film looks great either way, and I prefer watching it this way.    2) This -is- the US 144 minute cut of the film. Even the amazon page has FINALLY updated itself. So those that gave this a negative review based on that information should retract their review.    The bonus features, while not extensive, are satisfying. The approx 30 minute new retrospective making-of doc has some pretty interesting information on the making of the film, with a lot of different people talking about it and how it was made, with constant appreciation to Kubrick. However, anyone who has read this film's trivia on imdb.com pretty much knows all that is talked about in concerns of the making of the film.    There is a shorter piece on the visionary look of the film and the way Kubrick stylized it. An even shorter featurette is of one of the film's composers who came up with the original music for the film. It's a nice piece, but almost feels useless since her music wasn't used in the film much (mostly replaced by classical) and she only talks about The Shining for half of its already short running time (the rest spent on her work for Clockwork Orange, and although interesting, it is not related). Also included from the previous DVD release is the documentary of the film by Vivian Kubrick (his daughter) and the film's trailer.    Also new to this release is a commentary by an author of Kubrick's works and the inventor of the steady-cam who worked on a lot of the filming of The Shining. Although not a bad commentary, they tend to repeat themselves within the time span of the film, repeat things from the documentaries, and even not speak at all for long intervals. What's worse is that the two people were obviously recorded at different times and edited together. However, there were occasional interesting remarks and stories of the film shoot not heard about elsewhere, but this definitely could have been better.    Overall, this is an amazing film and got a pretty decent special edition with a beautiful Widescreen transfer to boot. I would give this 4 stars based on the disappointing commentary, but since so many people gave this premature ratings because of the running time they thought it had, I am giving it a boost. May Kubrick live on through his art like this.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I just got the entire Kubrick collection in Blu-ray and, so far, The Shining is my favorite of all the releases.  The transfer is stunning, the audio is clean, and the extras compelling.  Seeing The Shining in hi-def is a revelation!  Now as Danny motors through the hotel you actually FEEL the sense of movement!  I remember when I saw it in the theatre how excited the crowd was during those shots.  And that feeling is back in this release.<br /><br />The extras are also great--especially the audio commentary.  Incredibly informative with lots and lots of anecdotes and analysis, giving the viewer a very full and greater appreciation for the work technically and artistically.<br /><br />Get This Disc--you won't be disappointed.
B0006Z2KX4|4.0|There are few aspects of this film that can really be intelligently commented on that Leonard Maltin has not already fawned all over. All in all the film is great, one of the most amazing classic comedies ever filmed. Grant and Hepburn are great, the script is phenomenal, the cinematography is stark and pretty. It's really just one of those films that no longer needs much comment, if you haven't seen it you should. It's a classic that lives up to its reputation. (The Leonard Maltin comment was largely based on the fact that he has no taste in films, just spews up the standard responses i.e. \\"Oh Casablanca is so amazing...you haven't seen Gone with the Wind?...it kind of makes me want to throw up how generic he is)
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I went with a friend, my 4 yo son & her 5 yo daughter.  Simply put: I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  I loved everything about it.  The animation is wonderful. The characters are developed and it is so darn sweet.  **The only caveat is it was about 15 minutes too long for the kids.  Both kids asked if the movie was \\"done yet\\", as did a boy sitting in front of us.  The movie does run a little long.  No matter, though, in the end both kids adored the movie and talked about after it.  This is is Must Buy.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|I've bought every Bruce album ever made, have been to more shows that I can count (including numerous times at Convention Hall in Asbury).  This album about what I was expecting and it falls well short of where he left off with the E-Street Band on The Rising.    The good news: There isn't one bad song on the album.  This truely is in contrast to most of his albums where even the most ardent Bruce fan finds a tune or two truely hard to enjoy (at least at first).    The downside: There really isn't a great song on the album.  Radio Nowhere is slightly catchy, seems a bit shallow and is as good as it gets on the album.    As others have mentioned, the album's production is weak.  Bruce sounds muffled and overpowered by the music.    Gone are the days of his first three albums where one tune could make you day dream for hours.  The Rising was the exception.  He needed such a catastrophic event (9/11) to come close to matching the writing inspiration of his youth.  He obviously struggled to write these songs as he's seemed to do with most of his tunes for the past 20 years.    I still love his music, will continue to buy anything that he puts out.  This is worthy of buying, but it probably won't stand the test of time as one of his classic albums.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|When Stallone wrote ROCKY and released the film in 1976, he could have little idea how this character would catch on with popular imagination, and effectively launching Stallone's career as a movie star.    Why ROCKY really succeeds is it takes an Everyman, the Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa, and gives him the chance of a lifetime - to fight the current heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers.    Rocky is simply a fighting nobody, living in Philadelphia, trying to scrape his way through life.  He has some low level mob involvement as an enforcer, but he's not happy with this role in life and opts for mercy when dealing with the debtors his boss sends him to collect payment.  He's obviously looking to get out and fights on the side, but fighting is his real passion.    Apollo Creed is looking to promote a fight, but the angle he is pursuing is he will fight an unknown, in the spirit of America as the land of opportunity. .  America was celebrating its bicentennial in 1976, and this fight would be part of those bicentennial celebrations.    Ultimately Apollo's promoters come up with Rocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion, as much for the name as anything else.  We all know what happens.  Rocky trains, fights Creed, and becomes successful.    If that's all there was to ROCKY, it'd be a pretty fun film, but not really Oscar worthy.  Fortunately there is much more to ROCKY than just that rather cliché sports film storyline.      What sets ROCKY apart is the great writing, acting, and production.  Actually, they had to go low budge with this film, and this low budget actually paid off wonderfully.  Stallone manages to capture the life of Rocky so perfectly the film serves as a vital snapshot of what real life is actually like for the vast majority of lower and middle class Americans.  Rocky struggles to get by, has dreams but these are frustrated by his economic situation.  He's looking for the big fighting break.  Unfortunately for a lot of usthat big break never comes.    While the film is certainly focused on boxing, the actual fight with Apollo is only a small portion of the movie experience.  We follow Rocky on the streets, we get an idea of his everyday life, his trying to romance Adrian (Talia Shire, Francis Ford Coppola's sister and Nicholas Cage's aunt), his oft trying relationship with his future brother-in-law Paulie.  Of course, the movie delves into the relationship between Rocky and his personal trainer, Mickey (played by Burgess Meredith).  Mickey even calls him out, saying he has the potential to be a great fighter but he's not living up to that potential.  It is these subplots that really make ROCKY the rich film that is really is.    Another major proponent of ROCKY is how inextricably linked it has become to the city of Philadelphia.  The entire film was shot in Philly, and there are so many different locations and areas that you can't help but smile when watching the movie if you know Philly.  The art museum especially has become very famous for its association with ROCKY, as Rocky runs up and down the steps in training, and when he gets to the top he throws his hands up in the air, with that look of victory in his face.  And who can forget him training in the meat lockers, punching those big hunks of meat?  Unconventional training, but it works.  Great stuff.    Then, of course, we have the famous ROCKY theme, that's been used in all the films and is one of the most famous fanfares in movie history.  Whenever I hear that theme I always think of the art museum training sequence.    What really makes ROCKY click is you totally identify with Rocky.  He has dreams and aspirations.  He wants to escape his circumstances.    He wants to win the girl and ride off into the sunset, victorious.  Rocky is the perfect embodiment of that great myth called the American Dream.  He starts out as a nobody, works hard with what he has been given, and makes a success out of himself.    And Rocky ultimately gets to live that dream.  He makes his life a success, he falls in love with Adrian and eventually marry.  Rocky manages to escape that fate of being \\"just another bum in the neighborhood\\", and becomes a major icon in film history. He would go on to star in five sequels to this film, each with varying degrees of success, but none of them quite matched the lightening bolt success of the original.    While ROCKY is an Oscar-winning film, Stallone would never again regain the critical acclaim he had with this movie.  His career, while far from being unsuccessful, has never matched the success he had with this movie.  People compared him with Marlon Brando because of this movie.  While he has seen been involved in mostly dull action flicks and critically ridiculed projects, he will always have ROCKY.    And I don't care who you are.  ROCKY is a tremendous legacy to leave behind.
1594489505|1.0|I can't believe the rave reviews this book has gotten, both from professional reviewers and here on Amazon. I thought the plot was melodramatic, the characters cardboard, the writing overdone. I felt very, very glad I hadn't bought the book but simply borrowed it.    Though the \\"Kite Runner\\" had problems, it also had some vivid descriptions of Kabul and Afghan life, which were what drew me in. I suspect most of these were autobiographical; it was in the book's second half, which was more fictionalized, that I thought the writer lost his way. Still, it was a good debut, and I thought he'd be able to correct the unevenness of the manuscript with his second effort. I was looking forward to it.     No. Absolutely no. The defects of the last part of \\"The Kite Runner\\" were here in force. I could not empathize with the characters or get into their heads at all, despite being a woman. It's not impossible for a writer of one sex to successfully write about the other sex, but difficult, and I applaud Hosseini's ambition. Still, I don't think he succeeded at all here. The women were cardboard figures that could have been any generic oppressed Afghan woman -- neither ever really came to life, making it hard for me to see them as anything but political constructs. It's as if Hosseini decided he would write a story about \\"oppression of women under the Taliban\\" and allowed the theme to devour the story, much to the story's detriment. The male characters were cardboard as well, as if he'd pulled \\"generic oppressor\\" figures out of a hat. Yes, they may well exist in Afghanistan. But as fictional characters, they never came to life. Nobody is so good and so bad as all the characters here.     And the triteness! The overwriting! We're hit over the head with the same image several times -- the t-shirt clad torso of one character falling down after an explosion, for example, with the same cringe-inducing reference to the t-shirt he was wearing. There were other embarrassing turns of phrase. The emotions of the characters aren't shown either; we're told that they're in agony, or whatever, but we don't see it. It's a soap opera set in Afghanistan -- very easy to read, but little of real substance. Afghan Lite, as it were.    We also don't have the same vivid sense of Afghan life that we got in the first part of \\"Kite Runner.\\" That's probably because Hosseini had left the country and had to rely on second-hand stories of what went on. This isn't an insurmountable problem necessarily, but he didn't manage to overcome it. Most of the descriptions of what happened were generic too.     I wonder if one reason for the raves is that it seems politically incorrect to criticize a book about Afghanistan, especially Afghani women and their troubles? Or that this book gives people a sense that they're learning about Afghan life, which allows them to seem knowing about the news without actually making much mental effort, and that's why it's been so successful. In any case, a real disappointment.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|'Fracture' is a sort of murder mystery type film, although you know exactly \\"who done it\\" which makes it unconventional in that regard. The mystery is, how and will he get away with it? While there were a few interesting turns of events, I thought the film was generally dull and the plot was just too contrived and poorly scripted for me to take seriously. I happen to think that Ryan Gosling is one of the better up and coming actors in the game (his questionable role selections notwithstanding) but his performance here was quite average I thought. The same goes for veteran Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this movie is about a guy (Hopkins) who finds out his wife is cheating on him, and thus shoots her. As luck would have it, the arresting officer is the guy who was banging his wife. The wife is in a coma, and the case for attempted murder is seemingly open and shut, being that the suspect still has the gun in hand when the police come, and he confesses on the spot. But alas, if it was that simple, there wouldn't be much of a mystery would there? Hopkins has a few tricks up his sleeve, and the prosecutor (Gosling) is so intrigued by the case that he postpones his new job at a prestigious defense firm to stay and try Hopkins. This leads to a cat and mouse game between the two, with Hopkins handing the young prosecutor his first real challenge of his career.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard fan of either of the lead actors, or an enthusiast for murder mysteries, you might want to give it a shot, but otherwise I would say skip it. Three stars.
1401211909|5.0|Many people think of fairy tales as just for kids. Not this one. A star falls to earth and is found by a young man who has made a rash promise, witches and princes meanwhile try to kill the star. Sounds linke the plot line to a motion picture, which now it is. If you like adventure, magic and just a little romance, then this is the fairy tale for you.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When Stallone announced he would be making the sixth installment in the ROCKY series, a lot of people shook he head.  After all, he was 60 years old at the time of filming, well past his prime.  And, given how bad ROCKY V was, a lot of people, there was a good possibility this was going to be a pretty bad movie.    Well, like the new Indiana Jones film currently in production (KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, where the hell did Lucas and Speilburg get that title?), ROCKY BALBOA does not try to hide the main protagonists' age.  Balboa is old, and he knows it.    Before we get into the film proper, there are several deleted scenes included on the DVD, as well as an alternate ending in which the outcome of the final fight with Mason Dixon is reversed.      Stallone, Burt Young (Paulie), and the guy who plays Duke are the only actors to be in all six films.  Five different actors have portrayed Rocky's son, one for each movie except the firt.    The film opens to Rocky feeding some turtles, a reference to the first film.  As the first hour or so unrolls, we find out that Adrian has died, Rocky has opened a restaurant in Philadelphia, Spider Rico from the first movie has become Christian, and Maria, also from the first movie, has struck up a friendship with Rocky.  Other than the fight, these are the main storylines that Stallone focuses on for the majority of the film.      Two of the best scenes, not only in this movie but in the series in general, is when Rocky goes before the Boxing Committee to get licensed.  The state committee refuses to give Rocky a license, and Rocky launches into a speech about his freedom and the Bill of Rights and how he needs to do what he needs to do.  The other has to do with his son, as his son feels like he is living in the shadow of his father.  Rocky quickly sets his son straight.  Great monologues.  And it's great to see Maria from the first film back again.  She had a scene in ROCKY V (Rocky's warning that she'd be a whore if she kept up her lifestyle turns out to be true prophecy) but it was cut, leaving Rocky to bring her back for BALBOA.    The film is openly nostalgic, with Rocky revisiting his old haunts, though the old places have changed, and a lot of times for the worst.  Unlike ROCKY V, however, this nostalgia is tempered with Rocky's heart, his optimism, and his winning attitude.  He's also having some relational issues with his son, but ultimately these are resolved by the end of the film.    BALBOA references all five previous films (though appropriately enough there's only one throw away reference to ROCKY V).  There's footage of his fights, and the film heavily references the first ROCKY.  Even Burgess Merideth, who died in 1997 and played Mickey, gets a line in one of the retrospective sequences.    Unfortunately, Carl Weathers does not appear in archive footage, as he wanted to be actually written into the movie (probably a dream sequence, something along those lines), and since Stallone wouldn't do that Weathers wouldn't let him use any footage with Apollo Creed, which is sad, given how important a character Apollo is to the Rocky movies.    Though long retired, a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon sparks interested in the aging Balboa when the computer marks Balboa as the winner.  Mason Dixon's promoters is looking for some new blood, because Dixon has been fighting chumps and has lost audience favor to the point where all of his proposed pay-per-view matches are being declined.  Dixon's promoters are looking at this as a way to remake Dixon's image, and see this match as a perfect way to do so.    Still, Balboa is a lot older now, so when Duke (yes, that Duke, the Duke in all five previous films) starts training him, a lot of the techniques are out do to his advanced age.  As Duke says, \\"Let's build some hurtin' bombs,\\" and these bombs they certainly build.  Despite the age, Balboa trains hard.  Stallone even incorporates a revision to the famous scene of him running up and down the Art Museum steps.  In the original film Rocky was to run the steps holding a dog, but this did not prove feasible as Stallone found the dog they had too hard to manage.  This time around they got the scene to work as originally envisioned.  Of course, we have the famous Rocky theme playing in the background as he trains.    Then Rocky and Mason Dixon fight.  This fight without a doubt is the best choreographed and filmed of all the Rocky fights.  It's also the most realistic.  For being 60 years old, Stallone is in remarkable condition.  Guess steroids will do that too you.      Mike Tyson also makes a cameo during the fight.  Strangely enough, like Reeses Pieces in ET, there's a few shots of product placement during the fight for GoldenPalace.com.      SPOILTER: The fight ends just like the first ROCKY, a split decision with the win going to Mason Dixon.  Even though Rocky loses, he doesn't because he manages to go all ten rounds, and gives Dixon a run for his money.      Stallone stuck with the ending in the film to pay homage to the first film, as well as making a point that Rocky still walks away victorious, even if he doesn't \\"win\\" parsay.  In fact, Rocky's out the door while the announcement is being announced, cause it doesn't matter whether he wins or loses, because he's already won something much bigger.      Another important theme is that Mason Dixon is looking for a real fight, and Mason Dixon wants to respect himself, and so they both come out winners. END SPOLIER.    ROCKY BALBOA is a great way for Stallone to end the series, and probably is the second best film in the entire franchise, behind the original.  We get to see Rocky the way we've always wanted too - a winner, a picture of the American Dream fully realised.  Sure, he's had some hard knocks, he lost Adrian, but he's still a fighter.  Still has that indomitable spirit about him.    The film ends with Rocky placing a flower on Adrian's grave, and with his signature line still fresh after all these years, Stallone says \\"Yo Adrian, we did it,\\" and then walks away with the film going out of focus.    Then the credits roll.  Even the credits give you that warm fuzzy feeling, for it has footage of different, ordinary people all running up the steps of the art museum.  Makes you just smile watching it.    And all I can say to that is bravo.  Stallone, out of all odds, managed not only to write a good end to the Rocky franchise, but wrote the best film since the original.  Given how bad ROCKY V is, this fact's even more miraculous.    Yeah Rocky, you really did do it.  Though we won't get to see you again, this is truly a great closure to remember you by.  You really are an American Icon.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Not as hot as his first two albums, but a decent effort.    The rapping is competent without being ground breaking, and deserves wider subject matter than the self analysis that is a constant theme.    The production quality is superb.     Yet this album lacks up-tempo stand out singles.  It is an album of album tracks, apart from the track \\"Everything I Am\\" which is a call for keeping things grounded in reality, over a lovely slow piano backing.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|It's true that this movie is no great drama, but so what? All that needs to be mentioned is Kate Beckinsale (the most beautiful woman in the world) in a leather catsuit, with vampire fangs, shooting lots of different guns. As a man who's always secretly loved goth girls, I thought that Ms. Beckinsale was an absolute vision in these movies. I hope Len Wiseman realizes how lucky he is.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Not having gotten into this show until 2006, I was pretty excited by the chance to purchase Season 1 on DVD. I wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />The premise of the show centers around two very different brothers -- laidback, vice-filled jingle-writer Charlie (Charlie Sheen) and neurotic chiropractor Alan (Jon Cryer) -- who are forced to share Charlie's posh Malibu home after Alan's divorce. Along for the ride are Jake, Alan's young son, and Berta, Charlie's wise-cracking and crass housekeeper.<br /><br />Particularly memorable episodes include \\"An Old Flame with a New Wick,\\" where Charlie learns an old girlfriend has become a man; and \\"Big Flappy Bastards,\\" where the guys try to get rid of a houseful of seagulls Jake accidentally let in.<br /><br />Although many of the storylines quickly become familiar -- Charlie's careless one-night stands, Alan's money woes and battles with ex-wife Judith, both brothers' uncomfortable relationship with their less-than-maternal mother Evelyn -- they never turn stale. Perhaps it's because just as in life, we all have a number of ever-present situations, so it's to be expected that the Harpers also battle the same demons on a regular basis. But it could also be that the wit and grace with which \\"Two and Half Men\\" tackle every problem is very human, and guaranteed to bring viewers near their hearts -- flawed though they might be.<br /><br />Those who enjoy DVD sets for the extras shouldn't be disappointed, as this set includes several -- a behind-the-scenes chat with cast and crew; a backstage tour with Angus T. Jones, who plays Jake; and bloopers.<br /><br />Five stars for a show whose writing and acting is consistently fresh, never failing to provide its audience with new laughs.
0440238609|2.0|I had heard lots of good things about this series for a long time so I finally broke down and bought it. As a reader of fantasy for 10+ years I have read plenty of good stories and bad ones. This story isn't one of the bad ones but I caution those of you like me who read alot of fantasy, Don't Believe the Hype.    For a longtime fantasy reader this story will be simple in plot and beyond simple in writing style. I could see this being ranked high as a Young Adult book but put up against other mature fantasy stories it is highly lacking.
0385335997|5.0|I am absolutely engrossed and charmed by this story.I have never had a novel make my heart pound and my palms sweat!!!!Once you hit the road with jamie and claire leave a note for the family because you'll be gone for a good long while and you won't want to come back!
0307387178|4.0|A heartbreaking story about a young man from a well off family who left all of his worldly possessions behind to hike around the country and live in the wild.  Four months after setting out, his body is found in Alaska.  Similar to stories about people climbing Mount Everest and risking their lives.  You are left torn feeling both angry at the Chris while also getting a better understanding of why he went out alone into the wild.  Read before the movie comes out.  - Noga Rosenthal
B000002U9L|4.0|The first time I watched the movie, I fell in love with the songs. I memorized it. It took me years to find the soundtrack, so when I did, I bought it. It's nice to listen to all of the songs that were in the movie in full version, it takes me back to when I first watched the movie.
0684135051|4.0|This book is amazing.  It is written in such a chatty way that it is a breeze to read.  She communicates the fundamental knitting practices, then provides a method for making sweaters to any size with any wool.  It is a timeless book that will be useful for beginners and more advanced knitters. Definitely recommended!    The only reason I didn't give it 5 out of 5 is because of the print quality of the book. Even tho the cover is nice, the pages seem rather cheap and rough, and the page margins are oddly spaced out.  Also, even though the book was originally written a while ago, more modern colour photos could also be included which would be a nice addition.
1401207138|5.0|Watchmen is surely the best graphic novel ever: perfect writing, perfect drawings, great story. If you don't already own it I warmly recommend it!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I would echo the superlatives of many of the other reviews of this CD.  It is my first experience with this artist's work and I have had it on constant replay.  I am totally incapable of picking a favorite track, though today I'm partial to \\"Gone Away From Me.\\"  Tomorrow it may be something else.    However, the \\"harsh critics\\" I refer to are the sleepy high school seniors in my first period Constitution class. Our school begins each day with a period of silent reading and I play music each day as we read.  Sometimes they groan.  This was the FIRST cd I've played this year from a widely eclectic selection that kids were begging to know who it was, and how to buy it.
B000LSAJ3O|4.0|got it yesterday ..could not stop watching it. Sounds great, looks great!  A must have for all Toto fans. Lukather plays as good as ever and acts like hes 20...he's funny. Just wish it had 99 and Pamela??
1878424777|4.0|I enjoyed the CD. It has some wonderful quidelines for everyday living. I would recommend it if anyone is looking for ways to make sense out of creation.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is an amazing woman, author, friend, follower, and leader. She takes on each role with aplomb and has mastered the art of introspection.  I don't know that anyone could take such a deep look at their own life and report on it with clarity, but Liz does a wonderful job of balancing her flaws and strengths. Anyone who has ever faltered after a divorce, or anyone who has ever been lost on the road, will find comfort in her journey.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The kickoff to Season 2 picks up where the Season 1 cliffhanger left off wondering if any of the Winchesters made it out alive from their tangle with the Yellow-eyed demon.  Season 2 is full of great character development where we learn much more about their individual motivation as well as where the ultimate plan of the yelow-eyed demon is headed, what Sammy's role is in it and how Dean reacts to that role.  A new base of operations and potential allies are introduced, but in the world of Hunters nothing is ever guaranteed.  In my opinion not quite as good as season 1, but it was such a tough act to follow I can't really fault them for it.  The season finale did not have quite the impact as the previous season but it paved the way for more Dean and Sammy - which is always a good thing!!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|What most \\"Rush\\" fans must realize is that \\"Rush\\" make music for themselves, not any of you. That being said, i enjoyed this album immensly. The songs on Snakes and Arrows are very heavy (often incorporating heavy metal riffs) while still offering much in the way of instrumental melody. And contrary to other reviews on this site, I did find that there are certainly moments of \\"Rush Magic\\" contained therein. For instance, The lyric in \\"Workin' Them Angels\\": \\"turn up the music and smile!\\" that Geddy enthusiastically shouts, and the beautiful chorus in \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\", among others. However, there still exists in this album the classic Rush complexity that fans have come to expect. Surprisingly, Snakes and Arrows also contains three instrumentals of varying lengths. \\"Hope\\" is a fully acoustic unaccompanied guitar solo that clocks in at just over two minutes. \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" is a highly rythmic and slightly funky number at about three minutes. Lastly, \\"The Main Monkey Buisness\\" is a six plus minute musical adventure that should satisfy almost anyone who takes the time to listen closely to the brilliant subtleties within it.This is all the song analysis I am willing to do, as i'd like to leave any potential listener with the pleasure of discovering the rest of this wonderful album for themselves. As for the lyrics on this one, expect something similiar to \\"vapor Trails\\" but with quite alot of religion bashing (which I personally enjoy in any form of media). Finally, I would recommend \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" to any hard rock fan with an open mind, any person that is a fan of intelligent music, and to the millions of \\"Rush\\" fanatics (like myself) who are bound to get this one regardless of what anyone like me has to say about it!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|My husband and I were pleasanly surprised by Supernatural Season 1.  The series premier really got you hooked right from the start.  While a few of the succeeding episodes were a bit predictable, the characterization and interplay between those characters is what keeps this series stellar as the seasons roll on.  We loved Season 1 so much we pre-ordered Season 2 right away and fortunately only had to wait a couple weeks before the release.  The DVD quality is so good it has made watching the weekly show tough as our local affiliate is a bit sub-par not to mention dealing with commercials.  Definitely a worthwhile investment.  If you like good suspense/horror, in-depth characters with enough humor thrown in to make it fun you want to check out Supernatural, especially Season 1 which in my opinion is the best season so far.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is my favorite version of Jane Eyre. The casting is fantastic and the acting wonderful. This Mr. Rochester is much younger than many of the other actors who have played him before and I found this much more appealing. The actress who plays Jane can say a thousand words with her eyes as she looks longingly at what she thinks she can never have. There are some scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester which have been added to this version and they show what was missing from most of the other adaptations -- the passion between the lovers. This is one I'll be watching again very soon as I'm curled up next to the fire on a cold, rainy day.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|Live At The Acropolis is my all time favorite but I think great things are soon to come from this composer/musician.  Yanni has recently joined with Ric Wake, an Oscar/Grammy award winning producer and I viewed a short video clip announcing the direction he is taking his music by visiting his official website. I have all of his CD's and DVD's, I can't wait to see what he does next, but this one is a must have for any Yanni collection! :-)
B000VL9XNI|5.0|Warning, this is for hardcore AC/DC Fans.  If you are a casual fan, you probably won't like it.  It shows some vintage footage that doesn't have best sound or film quality. However, that is the beauty of it.  They didn't have the high def or surround sound that we are use to now. It is like opening a time capsule on the greatest hard rock band ever.
B000P0I4O4|4.0|Teacher Ray (Kusack) who just got laid off tries with a camping trip to reconnect with his son who just got in cop trouble for smoking pot. Not long into the trip they stumble over a dying police chief with his prisoner Cardin (Morgan), an ex-CIA and military trained professional assassin in the process of being freed by his team. Ray thinks he must play hero and bring Cardin back into custody. Along the way he brings more harmless hikers into trouble and eventually actually loses Cardin despite all heroic efforts.    Kusack only makes an okay transition from regular guy to hero. Harrison Ford or Michael Douglas are way better at that. So he was a former cop, which explains that he outsmarts and outshoots a red-hot assassin. Nevertheless, the way he gets more and more fixated on turning in Cardin at the cost of risking his boy's life must seem unnatural to any parent. Morgan of course turns in one of his usual superb performances. He is actually likeable even as a pretty bad guy, showing his human side when saving the boy from falling down a rain-soaked mountain wall. A certain bonding is becoming evident between him and the teacher and boy, which in the end may very well save the lives of those two. Why Cardin is just cooperating with Ray all the time is not believable to me. If he had just sat down in the very beginning, what would Ray have done? Shot him? If the story had offered just one good reason for why Cardin was moving along in this odd trio, it would have made the whole movie more believable to me.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|\\"Ratatouille\\" was way above my expectations when I saw it the first time. The previews didn't do much for me, however, the initial buzz was favorable so I shelled out the bucks to watch it in the theater. Now with the DVD, I can enjoy it at home--the surround sound just jumps out - a very good dynamic mix with the excellent score by Michael Giacchino). There aren't too many extras, but what is there is enjoyable. The Pixar short \\"Lifted\\" about an alien in training attempting an abduction is cute; it amazes me how Pixar is able to capture the emotion and human movements of their 3D animated characters; something that the other studios don't quite have down yet. \\"Lifted\\" was the short shown with \\"Ratatouille\\" in the theaters. There is also a another short called \\"Your Friend the Rat,\\" which is the story of rats through history, showing them not to be the despicable creatures that humans make them out to be. The style of this short is traditional animation (other than the intro/ending by Remy & Emile) and very well done. I really like the sketch-like style that is used here. The DVD also has a 13:53 minute featurette that cuts between Pixar's Brad Bird and French Laundry's Thomas Keller. It is truly interesting to hear the two discuss their respective fields, and seeing just how similar the creative process and philosophies are. There are also 3 deleted scenes; all of them in rough b&w sketch form. 2 (\\"Meet Gusteau\\" and \\"First Day\\") deserved to be deleted. The scene titled \\"Chez Gusteau\\" harkens back to Hitchcock, as the camera takes you to Gusteau's restaurant, through the front door and into the kitchen, all in one continuous \\"take.\\" Even in the rough form, it was great fun to watch. Yet, I understand Bird's explanation that although a good scene, it didn't fit with the perspective he wanted \\"Ratatouille\\" to have. And that my friends is it for the extras. Not fantastic, but again, what is there is solid.<br /><br />Onto the movie--I found myself enjoying the characters. Amazon.com didn't seem to like the critic character, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole). Personally, I found him to be one of my favorites. He helped add a little dark \\"spice\\" to the movie that otherwise could have been too bland. Briefly, \\"Ratatouille\\" is about a rat who loves food, and idolizes the late Chef Gusteau. When he ends up in Paris, he teams up with a klutz, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano) and helps him become a great chef in Gusteau's restaurant. Skinner, the sous chef who is more interested in pillaging the Gusteau name by slapping it on frozen dinners, becomes the nemisis of Linguini and Remy. You can watch the movie to see how all resolves.<br /><br />In the end, I believe I still prefer \\"The Incredibles,\\" but boy does this one come in a close second. Great fun for the whole family to watch, although at times the slapstick is a little violent at times (in a 3 Stooges way), there is nothing too offensive here.on.com didn't seem to like the critic character, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole).

Great fun for the whole family to watch, although at times the slapstick is a little violent at times (in a 3 Stooges way), there is nothing too offensive here.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|This movie is based on the book by James Redfield of the same title. The WIKI contains a good summary of the book: [...] .    The movie features good performances in supporting roles, like Hector Elizondo as a cardinal, and Juergen Prochnow as the bad guy. Of course, for Juergen with his pock scars it's easy to play the bad guy :-). Matthew Settle and Thomas Kretschmann are giving okay performances as the main actors. Overall, the acting is decent, though at times the film looks a little like a made-for-TV show. For example, I didn't believe the Marjorie character how she played overly \\"hard to get\\".     Somehow, the mixture of New Age content with action movie did not work that well for me. I liked the ideas it brings up, for example how the more advanced characters experience glimpses of clairvoyance or that they can see human auras and energy patterns, and how they are guided by spirits (of some of the characters that didn't make it on Earth to the end of the movie). At the center of the story, nine ancient scrolls containing nine \\"insights\\" forecast the advent of a better time, which could be supported in reality by more and more people becoming more spiritual. The insights themselves, presented in shortened form at the epilog, sounded much alike to me, maybe they could have been compressed into three :-)    The action part comes from the bad guy influencing the military in Peru (that's where the scrolls were found and the majority of the film happens) trying to seize the scrolls (especially the ninth one) at all cost. Who actually is behind the bad guy is not made clear. Early on the Catholic church seems supporting him, only in the end its representative (the cardinal) breaks away and eventually protects all surviving scroll supporters from death by military.    Overall I have mixed feelings about this movie. Like I said, I liked the New Age ideas and actually believe in some of the spiritual themes it introduces. I don't say the action part is entirely bad, maybe it was just a tad to formulistic and easy to predict.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|This is an excellent example of post-grunge modern rock by Alter Bridge. This album does an excellent job of showcasing Mark Tremonti's divese guitar playing. Part Tony Iommi, part Dimebag, Tremonti is simply one of the finest musicinas in rock today. The vocals on this album are superb and sound perfect with the energetic compositions on this cd. Blackbird, Buried Alive and White Knuckles are my favorites, but this album is a great listen from start to finish. The rhythm section is incredibly tight, which should be expected. Losing Scott Stapp and moving on from the preachy pretentious music of Creed was the best thing these guys had done up until this point. Now, This album, Blackbird is the best thing they've done.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|A year ago my husband and I went to the Telluride Film Festival, and \\"The Lives of Others\\" was being screened.  My husband went to the showing and loved the movie.  I thought I wouldn't be feel drawn into a movie about the covert surveillance of Germany's own citizens. Boy was I wrong.  While you are exposed to the insidious intrusion into the lives of people, it is the character and values and soul of the lives of people that brings a depth to the movie -- people on both sides.  There are those who do the \\"listening\\" and those being \\"listened\\" to.  The acting is wonderful and the tale is told with real sensitivity.  The prime \\"listener\\" has the most expressive eyes -- you are affected by the look in his eyes.  I saw the director of this movie interviewed on Charlie Rose.  He is extremely young (34), and I was very surprised that such a young man could produce a movie with such depth.  Excellent.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I have loved linkin park since hybrid theory and I think this is a great CD. People keep saying that its is not hard enough but their are some harder songs. This CD just has more variety then the other 2 CDs. If you are a linkin park fan then you will enjoy this CD.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Beautiful music, beautiful lyrics.  I would love to see Glen and Marketa team up again on another album.  This is one of those CDs that comes once in a while.  Great movie too!
038572179X|5.0|I understand the negative assessments some reviewers have made, but I nonetheless found this to be an intensely moving book, one of the best I have ever read, bringing together many strands of different but complementary literary traditions, with many nuances and colors semi-hidden and not elaborated that add cumulative weight to the novel.  It has its self-conscious elements and self-consciously literary elements as well, but these are not overdone and add a dimension of \\"art for art's sake\\" in the most positive sense, which is of course most obvious in the way it ends and in the fact that the main body of the narrative is an embodiment of the novel's title.    It is a beautiful beautiful book that gives life to the humanizing and redeeming potential of literature, and it will break your heart along the way a dozen times.

B000UYX5AI|4.0|Biffy Clyro deserve their reputation as an underappreciated and rising force in experimental rock, and this album is consistently listenable and occasionally fascinating. But sometimes the band seems to be progressing just for the sake of progressing, and they can't quite reach the heights to which they're doggedly climbing. Granted, the band's engagingly cryptic lyrics and imposing musical chops lead to many victories on this album. (Regarding those lyrics, I wonder if anyone else has noticed the obscure Guns n' Roses quote to start off \\"Get F***ed Stud.\\") Biffy Clyro are at their best when they stick to smart mid-tempo hooks like in \\"A Whole Child Ago\\" and \\"The Conversation Is...\\"; while they add some real excitement with the sly heavy grooves of \\"Saturday Superhouse\\" and especially the punishing \\"Semi-Mental.\\" Unfortunately, trouble arises when the band slows down or experiments with different styles. The classical/gothic elements of \\"Intro,\\" \\"Living is a Problem Because Everything Dies,\\" and \\"9/15ths\\" are more annoying than they are enlightening. The angular stoner rock of \\"Who's Got a Match\\" is a direct rip-off of Queens of the Stone Age, and \\"Love Has a Diameter\\" is highly reminiscent of mid-period Peter Gabriel. The ballads \\"As Dust Dances\\" and \\"Machines,\\" while insistent and believable, could be dismissed as slightly less languid takes on Coldplay. Regardless, the progressions and explorations of Biffy Clyro are worth taking very seriously, and as soon as they shed their over-reliance on their influences and their somewhat directionless over-reaching, they'll achieve a real breakthrough.

B000002OVJ|4.0|For those who never were able to attend one of their concerts, \\"Live at Leeds\\" gives an indication of what they were capable of in on stage.  The band was considered at the time to be much better in live performances than on record.      It's a remarkably powerful and diffuse (even more so with the additional tracks on the CD) effort.  The original album got a lot more side one play, with a lineup of \\"Young Man Blues\\", \\"Substitute\\", \\"Summertime Blues\\", and \\"Shakin' All Over\\".   The album (of which the CD is a mini-version) was packaged as a mock bootleg and included a collection of scrapbook material; Peter Townshend's notes for \\"My Generation\\", the contract for them to play at Woodstock,  a poster for their early Marquee Club appearances in London, and a receipt for a case of smoke bombs.    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
6305428042|5.0|AWESOME movie!!!  This is the best \\"kid friendly\\" Halloween movie you'll ever see.  My family watches this movie over and over and over.  This is a must buy!
B000TX7B5U|5.0|A must have for any System of a Down Fan. Not only is this solo album some of serj's best songwriting, but it's also a display of his improved vocals. The songs on the track are anything but similar-sounding. The album is full of musical surprises and loaded lyrics that will please. When I finished the album I had to listen to it again; Once just wasn't enough. Phenomenal.
B000002MY3|5.0|It's beyond question that Alanis Morissette's album break-through album \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" has been an influence and inspiration to many female artists all over the world. Though really her third album it's often referred to as her debut, which is due to the facts that her first two albums were originally only released in her native Canada, and that they are musically totally different from her later recordings.<br /><br />Musically \\"JLP\\" continues in the tradition of artists like Joni Mitchell, Patti Smith and Kate Bush with strong songwriting and sharp lyrics. The album is also her most consistent so far, with extraordinary many catchy songs with hit-potentials; proven by the fact that no less than six singles were pulled from the album.<br /><br />Though very melodic most songs also have a hard rocking edge, greatly examplified by the five hit-singles \\"All I Really Want\\", \\"You Oughta Know\\", \\"Hand in Pocket\\", \\"You Learn\\" and \\"Head Over Feet\\". The stand-out song on the album is the softer \\"Ironic\\" with its acoustic verse, its wild chorus and the funny lyrics; still a regular radio-track and a popular song among young amateur artists/singers.<br /><br />There are also a couple of nice ballads with \\"Mary Jane\\" and \\"Perfect\\" showing the softer side of Alanis.<br /><br /> A standout classic album by a great artist!

I they could not have done a better job, I just wish that it brought it up to present day.  Can't wait for the movie and The Dirt II.  These guys rock!

B00005JO5L|3.0|I read an article about this movie, when it recently came out on DVD.  I had never heard of it. I love Pacino and had to see it.  I thought it was a great.  It realy seemed to be ahead of its time.  It i shard to believe that some of those images were on the mainstream big screen, when the movie was originally released.
1400063515|4.0|Nassim Taleb uses information from many diverse fields to prove that life is more random and less predictable than people want to believe.  Botony, history, sales, economics, finance, logic, psychology, anatomy, physiology, mathamatics, gambling, technology and philosophy are discussed.  Taleb's writing is choppy at times and his intellectual snobbery is obvious.  However, \\"The Black Swan\\" is well worth reading because of the connections drawn to a wide variety of fields.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I heard this artist on Saturday Night Live and knew I had to get the album. I was not disappointed. Listening to her music is like eating good chocolate - a rich, soothing, sensual delight.     I often play it when I'm relaxing or working. The songs are consistently good throughout.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I took a while to warm up to this album, but now that I have I've been listening to it for weeks. There are some strange tracks, but there are usually some strange tracks on NIN albums. If you're a NIN fan, you should have this album. I already had the music since the band leaked the whole thing before it was released, but the artwork is worth $10. The strange anti-piracy warnings are reason enough to purchase this. Conclusion - it's not Pretty Hate Machine, but it's a major improvement over The Fragile. (No offense to anyone that likes that one - I just can't get into more than 3 or 4 tracks on that one.)

BRAVO !! I have had the pleasure of experiencing a live concert and meeting Loreena.  Some performers fail outside the recording studio -- not her and her gifted team. The energy is fresh and arrangement variations and details are exiting!
079284131X|4.0|Andy Barclay [Alex Vincent] gets a Good Guy doll for his birthday from his mother [Catherine Hicks]. But, Andy soon comes to the realization that his doll is posessed by the spirit of deceased serial killer Charles Lee Ray [Brad Dourif, Who can be seen visibly in the beginning of the movie and is the voice of Chucky for the rest of the movie] and after a series of murders, His mother finally believes him as does a detective [Chris Sarandon]. Now, Chucky must be stopped before further mayhem ensues. This is easily the best Chucky movie hands down. It's full of suspense, features a clever story, has nice special effects, and you gotta admit, The Chucky character is actually very scary in this movie. The movie is also rather tame for a slasher film from the 80's, Seeing that the movie prefers substance over gore. Witty dialogue and well-pacing makes this one of the greatest horror films from the 80's. Followed by four sequels, The latter two are titled Bride Of Chucky and Seed Of Chucky.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The music of this charming movie, ballad-like and sentimental, is what brings the characters together through their joint venture in producing a CD, now available for the viewer/listener to revisit and/or listen into their world.

Following the tedious Child's Play 3 [Which explains why Chucky's all sowned together in this film, Being he was thrown into a fan at the end of part 3], This is a welcome breath of fresh air. This film has some wonderful doses of dark comedy as well as some interesting murder scenes and some cool new characters. This is another great sequel in the ongoing saga of Chucky. Followed by Seed Of Chucky.
185984054X|5.0|I read this absorbing short book in a day.  I was sorry it had been written before all the nonsense about the Monica Besra \\"miracle\\" and then heard that Christopher Hitchens had received many letters supporting his take on Mother Teresa, \\"enough\\", he said, \\"to write a sequel\\".    Yes please!    We need more people who will expose religious frauds and those who get rich (though MT didn't get rich herself, many do) on the gullibility and stupidity of others.
