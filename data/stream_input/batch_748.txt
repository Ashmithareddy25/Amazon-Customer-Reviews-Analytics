0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali autobiography \\"Infidel\\" chronicles her journey from a Muslim girl living in Somalia to her life as a Member of Parliament in Holland. This was an amazing story of how Ayaan survived beatings, mental abuse, and genital mutilation because she was living in a society where women's rights were virtually non-existing. She gave a detailed description of how life was for Muslim women in Somalia and how religion played a crucial role in the Somali society. When her father made an arranged marriage for her, Ayaan ran away and she started a life for herself in Holland.     What an amazing story this was. This was a story of one woman's struggle to overcome and defy traditional customs to seek the truths for herself. I feel that I have learned a lot about the Somali culture and values, particularly in regards to Islam. In addition, the book is well-written and very conversational, making it an extremely engaging read. Ayaan was also successful in bringing these complex issues revolving Islam to the public.This was one of the most memorable books that I have ever read and it is definitely one that makes me want to learn more about the subject of Islam and women. Highly recommended!
1416914285|5.0|I am truly shocked at the amount of low ratings this book received. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and so did everyone else I recommended it to. To me this story was about finding yourself amongst the lies and ommissions that the adults in your life tell you. The plot was very well developed,  the dynamics between the characters was extremely believeable (have any of you hung around teenagers lately??). If you are still doubtful about owning this book just go to your local library and read it, and then go to your local bookstore to purchase it. I definately recommend this book.
0143038419|5.0|Many of my girlfriends were deeply affected by this book. They kept insisting that I read it. I finally did and to my surprise I have been going to the medititation center that the author goes to. I then got all my friends who read the book to go and chant with me and they all had great experiences. This book is great for the average woman who is interested in opening up to spirituality.

Open-minded shows like this should be manditory viewing for children to keep their minds open. I also recommend Pleasentville & The Oblongs.
0634022296|4.0|The book is easy to read, and shows the chords on all the songs.  I am very happy with the contents.  The only thing I would have wanted were bigger pages since the book needs a clip or somthing sitting on it to keep the pages open.  if you try to bend it too much, you will break the bindings, so just be careful.
B000YAF4OS|4.0|This movie would have received 5 stars from me but the ending ruined it for me.  Creepy movie with great horror and suspense but that ending... I left the theater p'd off.  Explaining why I was upset would spoil the movie, so I'll leave it at that.  Great casting, great acting, great scary movie - messed up ending.
0151008787|5.0|This is a beautiful and moving memoir from a sensitive and humanistic writer of great skill and style. The reader will feel that he or she is personally experiencing growing up with the author in the most modest and simple circumstances, in the young State of Israel, from before statehood and into its early years, getting to know as friends and neighbors some of its intellectual leaders who were the writer's family members and friends. The book is a sheer delight, and highly recommended.

B000002H6C|5.0|Unreal from start to finish; almost every song on this 4th Metallica album is a masterpiece.  The exceptions are \\"Shortest Straw,\\" which is frenetic BUT LACKING in the melody and/or complexity that many of their other frenzied compositions possess, and \\"Harvester of Sorrow,\\" which is certainly GOOD, but shy of the great category.    The guitar work on this album is unsurpassed.    The first 4 tracks are absolutely great tunes, unrelenting in complexity and power, and each deserving of a spot on my list of Metallica's finest songs.  After their weakest track on the album, they beging to ramp it up with \\"Harvester of Sorrow,\\" and then kick it back up to greatness for the last 3 songs.  Within \\"To Live is To Die\\" is some of the best guitar solo you'll ever hear (thank you Kirk Hammett)    There is very little to appreciate in the Metallica releases which FOLLOWED \\"...and Justice For All.\\"  You can hear some classic Metallica on some very good earlier albums, such as \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning.\\"  But for start to finish excellence, THIS is the one Metallica album I'd consider a \\"must-own.\\"

This CD is worth buying for her sparkling renditions of \\"Stetit Puella,\\" \\"In trutina,\\" and \\"Dulcissime\\" alone.
B000FDECGA|5.0|I actually saw this in a theater when it was originally released to the US. It is apparently a kid show from Japan. It is amazingly bloody and violent! But heck, It is hilarious. The guy and his kid in the cart kill people so good they can't even fall down without a shove. Plus, the woman ninjas proving their abilities cuts up a warrior like a vege-matic. This movie is an honest to gosh classic. I am ordering a DVD immediately! Watch it and tell me Monty Python didn't steal (in a nice way)the Black Knight scene in Holy Grail from this movie.
0780631684|5.0|Here's one that won't be shown on transcontinental flights anytime soon. FINAL DESTINATION, a great piece of cinematic junk food, opens with one of the most frightening depictions of airplane disaster you've ever seen, and if you can get past that, you'll be shoveling the popcorn in, begging for more.<br /><br />Devon Sawa and his really white classmates board a plane for an end-of-the-year field trip. Among them are \\"Dawson's Creek\\" star Kerr Smith as your garden-variety jock jerk and Ali Larter as that most head-scratching of movie constructs, the gorgeous geek who's obviously the coolest chick in school. Sawa has a vision of the aircraft going up in flames, so of course he causes a scene and gets himself, his buddy, Smith, Smith's girlfriend, Seann William Scott and a teacher thrown off. Larter follows -- because she's got second billing -- and Smith throws a hissy fit until they see the plane become a fireball in mid-air. Sawa rationally concludes that they were all supposed to die, and that Death will soon be tracking them down.<br /><br />Is he psychic? The movie doesn't seem to care, so why should we?<br /><br />And here's where we get down to the nitty gritty: Death dispatches pouty starlets and mouth-breathers with a creativity we haven't seen since Jason Voorhees left the cineplex. A groovy variation on the teen-slasher movie, FINAL DESTINATION turns even the most mundane household items into torture devices. Director James Wong has a blast making us second-guess what he'll use to off his characters, and we wouldn't dream of spoiling any of the jolts for you. It's also nice to see a post-SCREAM thriller get laughs not from a more-ironic-than-thou aesthetic, but from horror-movie camp laid on as thick as your grandma's fruitcake. (Seconds after a friend is decapitated, a straight-faced Larter tells Sawa, \\"Get your head together!\\")<br /><br />The DVD extras play like a slumber party, with kooky interactive games helpfully revealing the date of your death (to the hour) and the amount of clairvoyant ability you possess, as well as the story of a real-life psychic! (Cue the \\"Twilight Zone\\" theme.) On a more intriguing note, the filmmakers include a documentary about the test-screening process, and how it saved FINAL DESTINATION from being as pretentious as the latest Michelle Pfeiffer snooze-fest. We're all for directors keeping their work pure, but let's get real: no one would mistake FINAL DESTINATION for an art film. It is, however, loads of trashy fun.airvoyant ability you possess, as well as the story of a real-life psychic! (Cue the \\"Twilight Zone\\" theme.)

B000VECAEO|5.0|In the final season, they knew ahead of time that they would not be back a 10th time. This freed them from any kind of conventional comedy. They took took gambles that no sitcom would take if it wanted to come back for another season. But those gambles paid off handsomely with what I believe to be the funniest season ever. Those episodes had people buzzing around the water cooler like never before. Season 9 went for broke, but instead came up with rich comedy.

B000VWYNNW|3.0|The Orignal was released in 1976, with 1976 technology. The Reissue was butchered with 2007 technology. Why edit (hack out) some of the best parts of the original in order to add new songs?<br />They could have and should have cleaned the original with modern technology AND added the new tracks cleaned up with modern technology.<br />The solos on No Quarter (1976 version) (both Page and Jones)were two of the best most ethereal solos ever captured live. What was the point in deleting them for the new reissue?<br />If you are a hardcore Zep fan, then buy this for the bonus tracks. It is now 2015, I will just use modern technology, sound editing programs and equalization from my home computer to make my 1976 TSRTS sound like as good as the reissue.<br />At least I can listen to complete songs that sound great with my application of 2015 technology-not hacked up songs that may(?) sound as good. Try my approach and use modern technology to clean up that old cd, and then perform a side by side comparison. There are so many sound editing and cleaning programs on the market now, that it should be no problem cleaning up TSRTS.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This DVD set is the best! The concert is good, the sound is great, and the light show is excellent! All Pink Floyd fans.....THIS IS A MUST HAVE DVD SET....now I can say \\"I told you so!\\". There is some great bootleg video in it too. Don't wait....buy it NOW! Well worth the money spent. It brings you back to the good ole days...except now your driving a mini van.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is quite possibly the best show ever filmed.  I've watched the entire show 4 times now and it's still amazing!  The performance by relatively unknown (until recently) actors adds a since of authenticity to a story line that would have probably been tainted by big name, main stream actors.    Regardless of whether or not you are a history or war buff (I am neither) you will be absolutely enthralled by the cinematography and top caliber performances offered in this DVD set.    I've never written a review for Amazon (that I can remember), but if I could only recommend one movie in my lifetime Band of Brothers would be it.
0307275639|5.0|\\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\\", this is an example of Morrie's quotes; they may sound familiar or even cliche to us, but Mitch Albom has greatly put together a short & sweet book 'Tuesday with Morrie', which presented us Morrie's true story in a humane way. I find \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" specially touching & inspiring, especially reading it after a very close friend of mine recently passed away unexpectedly. The following advice from Morrie is what I aim to keep deeply in my heart & lead my life with it: \\"So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half asleep, even when they are busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.\\"

B000YA9R3C|5.0|Best Direction: Paul Thomas Anderson, Best Actor: Daniel Day Lewis<br /><br />What is really striking about this film is its minimalism. Though based upon a sprawling novel (Upton Sinclair's OIL) Anderson has eliminated all but the bare essentials. Early in the film those bare essentails are tools, rock, a tent and the fierce determination to find something. In the opening scene we watch a man in a narrow chimney-like tunnel that reaches 50 yards below the earth's surface chipping away at a wall of rock. When this man climbs out of this chimney of rock and the camera pans back we see that this man is toiling in a massive and barren landscape. This sparse scene is our introduction to Daniel Plainview whose existence depends upon this ongoing search, and is, in fact, one and the same with this ongoing search. This is a rough-hewn vision of America and American character circa 1900. Its as if the very nation is searching for itself in the forlorn desert-scapes of Texas. Though much later we learn a few sparse details about Plainview's childhood, Anderson's lean style is at one with his lead character; there is no Freudian attempt to explain character with formative experiences; there is no Rosebud moment in this film! Sentiment is completely lacking. We might recall the austere aesthetic of Treasure of the Sierra Madre or think of the grim determinism and detachment of Citizen Kane while watching There Will Be Blood but this film does not make a play for our emotions in the way that Welles' and Huston's films do but rather it makes its appeal with the uncompromising integrity of its no-nonsense realist aesthetic. And this is why the film is so powerful, for the key to Daniel Plainview is not that his family or the nation or the world or God or woman or his fellow man has done something to him. This is not yet another victim film. Rather the power of the film is that Plainview has crafted himself into Daniel Plainview by choice. Plainview has chosen to extricate himself from the world of human emotions. And this stoic stance is, in part, the reason he succeeds for Plainview remains dispassionate in his decisions while other men make decisions based upon emotional needs. Plainview despises emotion but he knows mens interests and how to speak to them, to earn their trust, and to have them sign away their property to him and not some other landgrabber. He is not just a speculator, prospector or oil man but a politican of sorts whose plain speak appeals to the common man even though it veils blatant self-interest. For Plainview life is a contest, an endurance challenge; and though no one will ultimately win this challenge the pleasure, for Plainview, is in seeing other men lose faith, hope, and heart. Daniel Day Lewis does the impossible: he makes the character of Daniel Plainview seem singular and archetypal at the same time. With this character Anderson and Day Lewis bring to life an aspect of American life that has been left largely unexamined in American cinema of late: the selfishness, the emptiness, and the de-humanizing affects/effects of material accumulation. These powerful themes remain in plain view the entire film and yet we are so entranced by them, and by the stark beauty of the landscape, and by Daniel Day Lewis's uncompromising performance that we never feel like we are being lectured at or preached to. If one thinks of Paul Thomas Anderson's previous films (the dripping with camp 70's porn expose that was Boogie Nights and the seedy frenetic dysfunctional collage that was Magnolia) one is wholly unprepared for the crafted quiet of this piece of cinematic realism. The film is as carefully crafted and as grimly deterministic as a Kubrick film and yet this does not, in any way, feel like a Kubrick film. For despite the fact that Anderson's style is at one with his lead character's world view that lead character, believe it or not, has a (humanizing) sense of humor. And it is during two or three of the films most climactic moments that Anderson/Day Lewis show us this usually hidden dimension of Plainview. These brief glimpses of humor are finally what allow for some connection to be made between the lead character and the audience. The humor shows us that the character is aware of the absurdity of his predicament(s) and this self-awareness, ultimately, is what makes Plainview a more complex, a more fascinating, and a more sympathetic character than we may have initially thought. This subtle insertion of humor, in two or three key scenes, is, in the end, what makes Anderson's direction and Day Lewis' performance something beyond great.ts that Anderson/Day Lewis show us this usually hidden dimension of Plainview.

B0000C8AVR|4.0|Yup, it's Dylan alright, sounding better than my 40 year old LP! I bought the SACD version and am impressed with the clarity of sound, but was a bit disappointed in that the SACD layer (also has a regular CD layer) is only 2 channel - NOT multi-channel. But if you have good front speakers, you won't be disappointed in the improved sound quality: the harmonica in\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and honky tonk style piano in\\"It Takes a Lot To Laugh, etc.\\" and \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" are especially noticeably better than on the LP. The SACD version is even clearer and more intense, making me wonder why they didn't put a multi-layer (5.1) on the hybrid CD.
0894803123|5.0|I love this book ... unfortunately I don't seem to be able to hang on to one!!  3 of my Kids have ice cream makers and now all have copies of the book I bought to use with mine ... oh well gonna order number 4 soon.  If you like ice cream, and who doesn't, why not learn from two of the best .. Ben & Jerry.  The recipes are straight forward and easy to make.  The results delicious.  There are many Ben & Jerry favorites here and an interesting writeup on how these great guys got started.  The cream base(s) gives you a great jump off point to experiment with your own flavous.  Fun to have the Grandkids help out and then eat the results of their fun times.  If you own an ice cream maker THIS BOOK IS A MUST.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|I actually liked this wierd tale that is shot like a very cheap movie with intentional cuts and skips and grain in the film.  Kurt Russell is a serial psycho that likes to murder women with his car.  In the first portion of the film the director has a lot of interaction with a group of women that end up at a bar.  Russell seems to have followed them to the bar.  There they meet him and they know him only as Stuntman Man.  He claims to have been a stuntman in many old tv shows and he drives a car that he claims could be used to ram a brick was at 100 mph without a problem.  Russell eventually has his way with the women.    The second half of the film involves a different group of women in a different town.  When Russell tries to have his way with them he finds out fast that he messed with the wrong women!    As with all Tarentino films there is a good deal of graphic gore that you come to expect.  However, I found this movie entertaining.
B000SO7OL6|2.0|Let me first say how much the new practice of jazz/pop stars irks me.  They hold off a few tracks from an album, which only get released on import versions costing three times as much, or greatest hits CDs.  This Krall offering contains 3 previously unreleased tracks, only available here...perfect to get those who already own everything to buy this disc, just for 3 songs.  Anyway, on to the actual review.<br /><br />Typically, greatest hits compilations are designed for the consumer who wants to get the biggest songs from a particular artist.  And that scheme works for most rock/pop artists (Elvis, Rolling Stones, etc).  But in the case of Diana Krall, she doesn't really HAVE hits.  The majority of her recorded output is old standards from the world of classic pop vocals & jazz, spanning the 1920's-1960's.  Most of those already were huge hits, regardless of the performer.  So, it seems that a greatest hits album for her is sort of a silly point.<br /><br />Since buying this disc would give you a sampling of her most recent albums (only the Verve albums, by the way...not her early albums), it would give you a sampling of many styles and arrangements.  If you are looking for a hodge-podge of Krall, with no theme or style of its own, then this is definitely the disc for you.  However, if you are just getting into Diana Krall, and only want to buy one disc, a better option would be to decide what you like about her music, and get one of her original albums.  You don't need to buy every one.  Even if you only get one CD, any of her albums will find her singing big hits with her unique vocal style.  One of her original albums will set the mood much better than any \\"hits\\" album.  She sings on all albums.<br /><br />For example...<br /><br />if you like lush, romantic string ballads with an orchestra, then pick up either \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" or \\"The Look Of Love.\\"<br /><br />If you like the Nat King Cole Trio (piano, bass, guitar), then pick up either \\"All For You\\" or \\"Love Scenes.\\"<br /><br />If you like a more traditional jazz trio (piano, bass, drums), then pick up either of her first two albums \\"Steppin' Out\\" or \\"Only Trust Your Heart.\\"<br /><br />If you like the big band sound, get her latest effort, \\"From This Moment On.\\"  It contains fast and medium tempos with a large ensemble (sans strings).<br /><br />If you don't really like jazz or classic pop, and want something with more of an easy listening, rock/pop jazz feel, get \\"Girl In the Other Room.\\"  The songs are more modern.  This one is tough to describe, and not her best effort.  But it's still good.<br /><br />My favorites are the ballad album \\"The Look of Love,\\" which contains several of thetracks with a gentle bossa nova beat.  Very romantic.  I prepared a bath for my girlfriend and i with this album playing in the background, and she LOVED it.  Trust me.  Also, her snappiest, coolest jazzy album is \\"All For You\\" which is a tribute to the Nat Cole Trio, and contains many of his classic hits.<br /><br />You may love the \\"Very Best Of\\" CD, but just remember you are getting a very random mix of styles and moods on this disc.  But you may want it for the previously unreleased tracks.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|For any writers or would-be writers, you really should see this film.<br /><br />Emma Thompson is one of the best in the business and she really shines as a morbid writer's block victim.  Don't let Will Ferrell on the cover keep you from seeing it if you're not a fan of his movies - he does nothing of the sort junk he's normally in.<br /><br />The story is fun, not to be taken too seriously, and best of all the director knows it.  The pacing never seems to drag, and Emma Thompson delivers to the screen a little bit of the writer in all of us.
B00006878K|5.0|The Blues have always been much more popular in concert settings than on record.  Truth is, there's not a wealth of terrific Blues studio records that appeal to a broad audience.  If there were more Blues albums as excellent as \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\", there's no question there'd be a much larger audience.    If you've only ever heard the title song by Cream, do yourself a favor and get this to hear King's smoking version.  No worries that this will be an album that starts with a hit followed by a lot of filler.  There's a lot more searing guitar work on \\"Crosscut Saw\\" and \\"Kansas City\\" and then on throughout the album.  Every song is terrific.  \\"As The Years Go Passing By\\" is an achingly beautiful, if mournful, slow blues with a haunting solo from King. One of my all time favorite Blues songs.  Closing the album with the Jazz chestnut \\"The Very Thought Of You\\" might seem a curious choice but King reworks it as a Blues number and it really works.    This could not be a five star album if King weren't getting excellent support and Booker T and the MGs deliver that support with gusto.  Their crack playing perfectly complements King on this outstanding collection of songs without ever overshadowing him.      This is one of the very best Blues guitar albums and, come to that, one of the finest Blues albums period.  If you were starting a Blues collection with as few as five CDs, this would have to be one of them.  If you're looking for a first purchase of Albert King, I'd strongly recommend this over the excellent \\"Very Best of Albert King\\".  It's not just that King never made a better Blues record.  Nobody else did either.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World at War was an amazing series, perhaps the most epic ever done. The only thing that I can think of that is comparable was the earlier Victory at Sea series. The second world war was unique in many ways, but fortunately for posterity, one of the main differences was the extent to which the great powers documented their efforts on film. Through the thousands of film clips that make up this series, the viewer is drawn into the stark reality of total war in a way that would have been impossible just a few years before. It's a riveting and fascinating chronicle of the last of the 20th century's great wars, and I learned a tremendous amount just by watching it, since modern history isn't my strong point. This might be the greatest documentary series ever produced and aired, and itself ranks as a historic achievement in the history of filmmaking.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I have to admit that I was disappointed with this movie.  After reading all the excellent reviews I really expected to be swept away by it.  I wasn't.  The scenery was beautiful.  The costumes were beautiful.  This adaptation had enormous potential, however the movie was VERY SLOW and without any excitement or passion.  Basically, it was FLAT.  It lacked any qualities to get the viewer \\"caught up\\" in the romance.  It was a rather \\"quiet\\" movie that I struggled to watch hoping it would get better.

It should be a must read for all high school and college students. We need to be told of the cost of our freedom and the cost of securing freedom for others.

B00004Y87O|4.0|As a devoted DVD collector, I was anxious to get the Special Edition Escape from New York but I was disappointed about one thing - John Carpenter stated that before its release, he was going to add in the original opening sequence where Snake and Fresno Bob rob the Federal Reserve Depository and get caught on the subway. He even stated that he scored music for the scene and included it in the film but it does not appear in the feature film. It appears on Disc Two's Special Features. Misled but still a Plissken/Carpenter fan.
B000UJ48U4|5.0|Last weekend the wife and I watched Stanley Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut. For her, it was her first time. For me, it was the first time since it had originally come out, back in 1999.<br /><br />When it came out, it left many people a little disappointed. Kubrick was a film-making master, and his last film seemed stilted, wooden, and mystifying.<br /><br />While I understand the comments of those days, I have concluded that people who thought in this fashion, well, missed the point. The film is a study in a particular aspect of human behavior: sexuality and sexual behavior within the confines of a marriage.<br /><br />Let's review. One night, following a party the night before where both parties in a married relationship engaged in some flirtatious behavior, the wife admits to having adulterous thoughts one day in the past. This severely unnerves the husband, a doctor, who then is called away due to the death of a patient. What follows is a series of near encounters with morally questionable sexual situations:<br /><br />  1. the dead man's daughter confesses her love for the doctor...she herself is engaged to another man<br />  2. the doctor meets a prostitute, and goes to her home, and is interrupted before things go too far by a call from his wife<br />  3. the doctor needs a costume to go to a party, and encounters what appears to be under-age sex between the costumer's daughter and some businessmen<br />  4. the doctor gets caught by the powers-that-be at an orgy for the highest class of society<br /><br />In all of these situations, the next day brings home all of the associated dangers with these encounters:<br /><br />  1. The fiance answers the phone when the doctor calls, bringing the doctor into conflict with another man<br />  2. The prostitute isn't home when the doctor returns...she has AIDS<br />  3. The young girl is offered to the doctor by her father...can you imagine the dangers in that?<br />  4. The power-that-be hustle one of the doctor's friends out of town by force, have the doctor visibly followed, and appear to have one of the orgies other attendees killed.<br /><br />The affect that this has on the doctor feels palpable and real...you can see it in the way that he looks at his family one evening, thinking that has whole family life is crumbling away, under siege from both his wife's tale, and from the consequences of his own actions and near-infidelity.<br /><br />What comes across as stilted is deliberately so...Kubrick wants folks to understand that certain things are staged, but the consequences of those things can be real. Compare and contrast Thomas Gibson's acting in his encounter with Tom Cruise (and vice-versa), and Cruise's own acting both when he hear's his wife's tale for the first time, and as he becomes more and more terrified of the consequences of his own actions. Kubrick is drawing attention to consequences.<br /><br />This is a set piece, like Lost in Translation, and a well-thought-out one at that. Kubrick's films were never simple ones, even going back to Spartacus. So, those who dismissed Eyes Wide Shut, I suggest you think twice. And for myself, it's time to resume the Kubrick film festival that got interrupted so long ago., and appear to have one of the orgies other attendees killed.

B00005OWEG|5.0|As the Vietnam War fades into the past, a fresh look at war movies may be due, with the \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" an excellent candidate. What was a superior original movie is still a superior movie with the additional footage. The arguments that it is a somewhat better film are reasonable, as are the arguments that the footage adds little value and perhaps harms the flow. I consider the change a basic wash, with some benefits here and there (more time with Kurtz), some negatives (the second Playboy scene adds little, and Kilgore looking for his surfboard are examples), and some that I can't decide (the French plantation).     With the controversies at the time gone, the viewer may focus on the movie itself, rather than whether it was outrageous for Brando to get $1M  and other distractions. No insight is required to understand why Coppola wanted Brando as Kurtz. A perfect fit.     Forget the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" relationship, as it doesn't really matter. The story can be viewed simply as being about the nastiness of war. Enjoy the lesson, which you already knew anyway, and the flow and how Coppola develops the theme. Enjoy the over-the-top scenes, and is there a more over-the-top moment in movie history than Kilgore, napalm, and surfing? The contrast with the deadly serious scenes is astounding, yet they still come together in a model of anything goes.      The production on the DVD is vivid and lush, a beautiful film. The movie begs for additional content on the DVD. We don't need the director's comments, but we could really use his view on the additional scenes and what was still left out, how he views the movie nearly 30 years on, and anything else he feels like saying. The Redux version gave Coppola an opportunity to do so, and this movie and DVD deserve more. Sure, you can find plenty of material on the Internet, including Coppola's thoughts. When we get additional content for even trivial movies, I'd like to see it done for the classics. And Apocalypse Now is a true classic that will be watched decades hence.
B000YA82F6|5.0|At first, I didn't think this movie would be my cup of tea. Never really thought about it much. Then, it came out, did surprisingly well at the box office, and the reviews were thru the roof. Not just reviews, but word of mouth was catching on and it was strong and it was growing. I finally ended up seeing the movie, and I am so glad I did. It was such a wonderful experience. Very rarely do I catch on to these little films, nor do I jump on the bandwagon whenever the critics fall all over themselves. But this time, I'm glad I did.    Juno(Ellen Page)is a 16 year old high schooler who finds out that she is pregnant. The father?. Her friend Beeker(Michael Cera, from \\"Arrested Development and \\"Superbad\\"). At first, Juno just plans on having an abortion, but decides to have the baby and give to a deserving couple. She ends up finding the seemingly perfect couple(played by the great Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, another \\"Arrested Development\\" alumni), but things are not always easy for Juno.    The script, by newcomer Diablo Cody, is a little uncertain when the firm first starts. The first few minutes of the movie, where we are instantly pushed into Juno's world, felt a little forced and in your face. We are so imeediatley thrown into this universe, that the language and the way she speaks seemed a bit much. It was as if they were saying \\"Ha ha, listen to our hip and edgey dialogue. Aren't we clever?\\". Thankfully, it doesn't take long for you to get settled in Juno's world, and the dialogue and way of speaking really comes into it's own, and it is brilliant and absolutely hysterical. For a newcomer, Diablo Cody has a real future as a screenwriter. Her script really found itself and quick. It stayed tru to itself and it's characters, and made them all real and believeable people.    The cast and performances here are all wonderful. Ellen Page is a star. There is no question. She comes out of nowhere, carries this little movie on her own, and just shoots it out of thepark. She is wise beyond her years and, at 20, really seems like a 16 year old girl. There are people in their 20's playing high schoolers, and it just doesn't work. She pulls it off. She so rightfully deserved her Golden Globe nomination, and she certainly deserves her more recent Oscar nomination. Elsewhere, Allison Janney and JK Simmons plays her parents. They are real and honest people. They look like they could be your parents. Janney shines, and Simmons is a standout. Jennifer Garner is brilliant in her role of Vanessa. She really had some hard and interesting places to go with her character, and she was just so wonderful. You felt for her. You really did. And Jason Bateman?. I've always liked him, and he is so well suited here. His scenes alone with Page are wonderful. The rest of the supporting cast all shine, and just make the movie.    \\"Juno\\" is a rare comedy that is actually gut busting funny, but has real people in real, honest situations, that all rings true. The audience I saw it with were howling and having a good time. You believe this movie and it's characters, and that helps it. With some of the dramatic aspects of the movie, the script could of so easily of been obvious, but it saves itself from the predictable and the saccharine. Thank god for that. It's a movie that hits you in the brain and the heart, while being funny, real, sad, honest, and heartfelt. What more could you ask for?. In the end, \\"Juno\\" is a treat. Plain and simple. It's so deserving of it's 4 Oscar nominations in such major categories.
B00005JPXY|4.0|Internet buzz and rabid speculation surrounded Cloverfield for months, prior to its release on January 18th 2008...The question is: Now that it's finally here--Does the film live up to all of the hype? I say Yes.    The Story: On the night of May 22, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) throw a surprise going-away party for Jason's brother, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), after he lands a big job promotion that's gonna relocate him to Japan. Just prior to the guest of honor's arrival, Jason asks \\"Hud\\" (T.J. Miller) to chronicle the festivities of Rob's last night in the U.S. with a hand held camcorder. At first, he is quite reluctant to do so, But as soon as he notices that the object of his affection, Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), is in the room, Hud's ready to roll.    Shortly after Rob finally arrives, an argument erupts between Rob and his friend, Beth (Odette Yustman), and Rob confides to his close friends that they had hooked up a month ago. Rob is mad because Beth has arrived with a date. Beth is upset at Rob for not calling her after getting together. She leaves the party abruptly. Hud and Jason then encourage Rob to pursue a romantic relationship with Beth despite the fact he's leaving the country.    Suddenly the building rocks with earthquake intensity as loud animal-like noises can be heard outside. From the roof, the friends see a large explosion in the distance and they flee to the street where the head of the Statue of Liberty crashes to the ground. Several more explosions and glimpses of a ginormous creature are visible in the distance... The small group of pals decide that the best way to ensure their survival is to leave Manhattan--But first--they must rescue Beth.    The Film: Word is that J.J. Abrams was in line to direct this monster tale, but because he decided to helm the Star Trek reboot, Matt Reeves was asked to step in...No worries though, Cloverfield has plenty of Abrams' style all over it...    As written by Drew Goddard the script is exceedingly straightforward and uncluttered--which is one reason why it works. The beginning of the film took me right back to September 11, 2001, with it's stark dismantling of Lady Liberty and scenes of folks running for their lives as utter chaos rains down everywhere.    The media has made a big deal over the fact that the \\"always in motion\\" cinematography has hit some viewers in the gut--causing disorientation and dizziness--I had no trouble at all with that aspect of the film. I was too caught up in the plight of Rob and company...    The filmmakers offer just enough of a glimpse of the monster so that we the audience are intrigued to know what the characters are facing-but they wisely keep that to a minimum--Allowing the characters to carry the load rather than special effects or CGI. To that end, the cast does a great job of keeping it \\"real\\" amid the unreality of it all...    It's impossible not to think of the 1999 film The Blair Witch Project which Cloverfield patterns itself after, for sure. From its mysterious marketing campaign, the style of filming--Using no name stars--to its \\"ambiguous\\" conclusion. It's all there.    To me, there's nothing wrong with letting the viewer try and figure things out...Not every flick has to explain the who what and why-for it to work. I just hope that despite the film's success-everyone resists the temptation of a sequel, ala`Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. My way of thinking is that that would only serve to to diminish Cloverfield as a film--if there is a sequel--Leave it alone guys...    As is often the case with TV's Lost--Cloverfield poses more questions than it answers. But unlike the serialized drama-I am totally OK with that...    For what it is, it's a great monster movie that is a worthy trip to the cineplex...
B00005221M|4.0|This umpteenth remake of James Fenimore Cooper's deadly dull novel is much the best - it features terrific performances, a propulsive script, and gorgeous photography.  Hollywood and television have been wrestling with Cooper's novel, whose fame this reviewer finds incomprehensible, for decades.  Ultimately, every single version of the story only follows the last three chapters of the book. Yes, those few days that the films, including this one, deal with, represent just the last bit of Cooper's novel, and small wonder: the book is an interminable, pompously written, and ghastly boring piece that solemnly delivers every last racial and gender stereotype known to humankind.    Michael Mann, as have all the others who have brought this story to the screen, makes a few narrative changes to the story to suit his stars and his audience.  In the book, Nathaniel Bumppo (\\"Hawkeye\\", so named for his remarkable aim with a musket), the story's white hero, has been raised by the Mohicans from infancy and is a totally asexual, folksy woodsman, not remotely interested in either of the Munro sisters; he is much more at home traipsing through the eastern woodlands with his stepbrother, Uncas.  Needless to say, this was not a viable option with a star of the magnitude of Daniel Day Lewis in the role of Bumppo (whose unfortunate surname is thankfully mentioned only once in the entire script).    Day Lewis is riveting as the now-virilized hero of this version, and his work here is yet another testament to this remarkable actor's range (Hello?  This is the prissy twit loser from \\"A Room With A View\\"?!  The punk homosexual of \\"My Beautiful Launderette\\"?! The mismated Newland Archer from \\"The Age of Innocence\\"?!).  Thin and muscled (he lost so much weight training for the film that the producers began to worry), he is totally believable as the half-wild woodsman who answers to no authority save his own principles, and the beliefs handed down to him by his stepfather, Chingachcook, who adopted him as an orphaned toddler.    The time is the French and Indian Wars of the mid-18th century.  Britain and France are struggling on what was then the edge of the North American frontier for ownership of the continent.  France has allied itself with the Hurons, bitter enemies of the Mohicans.  The British army, entrenched at Fort Edward and Fort William Henry in upstate New York, are fighting to maintain their primacy in the region.  As the film opens, the two daughters of Col. Munro, the British commander of Ft. William Henry, are newly arrived in Albany from Boston (by way of London), and are about to set out to join their father at the fort.    Their journey to Ft. William Henry (with a troop of British redcoats drumming their way through the forest like people lining up to be target practice), is guided by Magua, a Huron pretending to be a Mohawk, who has a particular grievance against Col. Munro.  Magua is splendidly played by Wes Studi (who is actually a full-blood Cherokee).  This role was easily the best of Studi's career - it's not easy to give Magua some dimension, but Studi manages to do so while maintaining Magua's cruel implacability.    Magua leads the group straight into a Huron trap that leaves all but the troop's Captain, Duncan, dead on the road.  Duncan, who is in love with Cora, the elder sister, and has asked her to marry him, draws his sword in one last defence of the two girls as the Hurons advance.  At just this moment Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachcook arrive on the scene and beat back the Huron attack.  The three men rescue the two sisters and Duncan, and agree to guide them the rest of the way to Ft. William Henry.    However, when they get there, the Fort is about to fall to the French, and in fact, it does.  The French General, very much an old school gentleman, allows the British occupants to leave the Fort after they surrender with their standard held high, and the immediate conflict is seemingly over.  However, Magua allied himself with the French precisely to have an opportunity to avenge himself on Col. Munro, and has no intention of letting things end in so civilized a manner - he and his followers ambush the departing British, slaughtering most of them, including (naturally) women and children.  This massacre, by the way, is a historical fact: you can see mention of it on a plaque at Fort William Henry in upstate New York.    The protagonists escape the massacre by fleeing on the river in two canoes, but they are spotted and pursued by Magua and his band.  The rest of the film is taken up with the capture of Cora, Alice, and Duncan by Magua, who takes them to the big Huron camp, and their pursuit by Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachcook.    Hawkeye, of course, falls in love with the elder sister, Cora, who, despite her sheltered upbringing, wakes up to the throbbing pulse of life on the frontier and finds she rather likes it.  Her spirited response to events forces Hawkeye to revise his initial estimation of her as a silly white woman who should go back to London and stay there.  Cora is nicely played by Madeleine Stowe.  Stowe never did quite make it to stardom, and if she didn't after this film, she must not have deserved to, but I can't think why.  She holds up well against Day Lewis's magnetism, is very pretty, and does well with her quasi-British accent.  The English actress Jodhi May plays the fey younger sister, Alice, who is crushed rather than awakened by the events around her - poor Alice is just not cut out for this.  May, who may be familiar to television viewers in British vehicles such as Masterpiece Theater's \\"Daniel Deronda\\" and the LOGO channel's \\"Tipping the Velvet\\", is very touching as she tries, but fails, to stand up to the trials of the frontier.  Uncas, played with quiet strength by Eric Schweig, almost immediately falls for the delicate, blonde Alice.  He knows he has no shot here, but does what he can on behalf of his growing feeling for her.  The relationship betweenHawkeye and Cora, on the other hand, proceeds at a far warmer pace, as Cora dumps the mealymouthed Duncan in short order for the erotic charge she gets from the scantily dressed, sharp-shootin' frontiersman.    In Cooper's novel, Cora and Alice are half-sisters.  Cora, the dark-complected sister, is the child of her father's first marriage to a Native woman - she has \\"tainted blood\\".  The blonde Alice is the child of Col. Munro's second marriage to a white woman, and it is she who is the object of Duncan's affections.  It is Cora that Uncas falls for in the novel - they are, you see, \\"alike\\".  In fact, Magua also develops a yen for Cora (although a coarser one than Uncas's).  Of course, Uncas and Cora, and any relationship between them, are doomed.    This scenario, however, wouldn't have worked out so well onscreen with this group of great-looking people, so Cora and Alice become full sisters, Duncan's affections are switched to Cora to set up a conflict with Hawkeye, and Uncas's affections are switched to Alice - where he has no more hope of success than he did with Cora in the book.    Well, with a book this bad, it doesn't matter how they manipulate the original plot.  Believe me, watching any of the films made from this book is a far, far better thing than reading it.    The action in \\"Last of the Mochicans\\" is nonstop, the performances fine all the way around, including the redoubtable Russell Means as Chingachkook.  But Day Lewis's magnetism rises above all the other performances and carries the film forward.  There isn't a dull moment in it, the score is powerfully evocative, and you'll probably end up watching the film more than once.  It was shot, by the way, not in upstate New York, where all these events took place, but in North Carolina, where Fort William Henry was virtually reconstructed.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and the audience is treated to some sublimely romantic moments in them thar hills.
B00003CX8V|5.0|There is no question that THE APARTMENT was a worthy winner as best picture in 1960.  A question that does come to mind is whether it should have won as best drama rather than best comedy. More than a few viewers have asked whether it is a comedy with darkly dramatic overtones or simply the reverse. The answer is a function of how one sees it today and how audiences saw it back in 1960.  When it was released, American corporate culture was marked by dehumanized masses of workers endlessly crushed together in football-sized fields of offices.  To rise in the pecking order, one had to leapfrog over the shoulders of one's co-workers often using any means necessary.  Director Billy Wilder took this as the film's basic subtext to create a flashpoint around which America could revolve to examine whether this kind of lifestyle had any lasting endurance.  By the film's end, as Shirley MacLaine quipped \\"Deal the cards,\\" she indicates that this culture of death was powerful indeed, but if one were willing to abandon it in favor of seeking the company of like minded individuals, then those like her and Jack Lemmon could survive and thrive in a much smaller world of human touch and feeling.  The thrust of the film then was one of dark comedy leavened slightly by the over the top comic reactions of sexual predators who were predators more in their minds than in reality.  Today, as we view THE APARTMENT, we do not have the same cultural blinders of a deadening sense of corporate dehumanization that was then relevant.  We see the huge offices of worker drones and think no more of them than we do of similar cinematic subtexts from THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  Instead we see more clearly the comic end.  We laugh at the foolish sexual excesses of Lemmon's key borrowing friends who find out too late that the women whom they take to the apartment go there with eyes wide open and see these pathetic losers as one step upward on the ladder of corporate success.  Further, we today find a strange mixture of amusement and anger in some of the film's less noted scenes. Remember when Lemmon tells MacLaine early on that he knows her address, her social security number, and other private data?  She acts bemused, but now we call that sort of knowledge gathering as perilously close to stalking.  Remember when MacMurray has his shoes shined by a black shoe shine man?  That black man was very nearly the only Afro-American in the entire film and he was a shoe shine boy.  It is quite clear that both scenes encapsulate cinematic subtexts that unconsciously mark the 60s as a given but today ring painfully clear that what passes for comedy or drama or race relations depends heavily on the mindset of the audience far more so than on that of the director or cast.  We see THE APARTMENT as a brilliant expose of corporate America, we marvel at the superb acting of the entire cast, but for the definitive analysis we must ultimately look inward to see what we bring to the cinematic table.xture of amusement and anger in some of the film's less noted scenes.

0141439807|5.0|If all the Austen books were sisters, Mansfield Park would be the quiet, pensively courageous sibling of the six. Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion all seem to glow like ladies at a ball. (Northanger Abbey would, I guess, be the sister who plays piano and can't really sing...although she tries...)<br /><br />I felt this novel to have a wonderfully theatrical feel, a closet drama of sorts. The above novels are like social epics whereas Mansfield Park appears stately, stoic and unto itself, thoughtful in a way the others aren't. I still think the other novels are excellent but there is something reserved about this one in particular. I am not a dedicated Austen lover but I would chose this one over the others simply because it is the less popular and to me, the most fascinating. The social-relationship dynamics are similar to the other novels - i.e. learning that the pretty face doesn't always have a pretty soul.<br /><br />Let's put it this way, I'll probably read this novel again before the others. This is the sister I would like to know, to talk with and share philosophy with. The other sisters, in my opinion are great to dance with and they'll certainly entertain you. Nothing wrong in that.
006113399X|5.0|I wanted to add my own praise to that of the other reviewers.  This is a masterfully written detective story.  Harry Hole is a fully realized character, not a two-dimensional figure.  The intricate plot surpasses any American entry in the genre that I've ever read.  And the Norwegian locales are a welcome change from the usual New York and L.A. settings of so many novels and films.  Kudos also to the translator, Don Bartlett.
B00000DFSK|4.0|I bought this CD right when it came out, and I was very glad to, as at the time, U2 hadn't released a compilation and I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy four or five albums to get all the songs I liked by them.    First of all, a few provisos: people can argue over whether or not it was a good idea to restrict this compilation to a single decade, particularly when U2 continued to thrive, and possibly even improve, in the time following the period this album represents.    Also, compilations with titles like \\"The Best of...\\" are arguably more subjective than ones with titles like \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Singles\\", as people can quibble about what an artist's best songs are, but there is less disputing whether or not a song was a hit, and even less about whether or not one was a single.  Nevertheless, assuming that they meant something like \\"Hits\\" or \\"Singles\\" instead of \\"The Best of\\", this album fits the bill well, but not perfect.    First of all, not every song you might hear on the radio from this era is represented here - some more important than others, but still - \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", \\"In God's Country\\", \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\", \\"Surrender\\", \\"God, Part 2\\", and several others are missing.  At just over an hour, this compilation contains a good amount of music, but 4 or 5 more songs could have been included on a single CD.    Further, not all of them are as you might expect.  \\"Bad\\", for example, is present in the studio version from The Unforgettable Fire and not the live version from Wide Awake in America that I was accustomed to hearing.  Also, \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" are in edited versions, which may be more familiar to some (again with the radio vs. album versions), but others will miss the full-length versions.    In hindsight, I'm glad I bought this CD - there are a lot of excellent songs on here I don't have elsewhere, like \\"Pride\\", \\"Desire\\", and \\"I Will Follow\\", but I now own The Joshua Tree and War and several of their other albums, though.  In summary, I'd say that if you really like what you've heard from U2 thus far, you might consider their individual albums - you won't be disappointed with most of them.  That said, this is a good introduction to U2's early work, and I recommend it for casual fans.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the best nature documetary series I have ever seen. It is well narrated, the music and sound are of an exceptional quality, and the cinematography deserves an academy award.
020161622X|5.0|This book is brilliant.  It helps reinforce ideas with wit so the information isn't in one ear and out the other.  This book will definitely be on that i tell others to buy.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|This CD is pretty much amazing.    I've had it for about a year now, and still haven't gotten sick of it.     Best songs:  Almost Over  Going Nowhere  Fear City  ... actually this is pointless it's all incredible, even in comparison to other Elliot Smith cds. Just get it.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|Memo to Beatles fans -- relax, this isn't unwatchable dreck ala the Sgt. Pepper movie.  Granted the storyline is pretty trite and uninvolving and for all Julie Taymor's visionary skill the picture doesn't have the entertaining kick of Hairspray.  What it does have is some very strong singing -- most of it live, per the director's commentary.  And the portrait of the 60s anti-war movement is rereshingly free of the conservative revisionist history that we usually get. (Unfortunately, the parallels to today may be too subtle.)<br />All in all this is a bit of a noble failure and Taymor on the commentary tracks hits the likely objections of Beatlemanics with the film's use of the songs and the too cute names for the characters. If they can get passed that, there's some good stuff here.  (That excludes the one egregious number: Eddie Izzard's Mr. Kite which is enough to make one long for George Burns' take on Fixin' a Hole.)
B000VBJEEG|3.0|I love this film, it is another smashing success in the Pixar lineup. I am however, sorely disappointed by the lack of a 2-disc edition with real bonus features and a commentary track. If these special features are good enough for a film like Pirates, why not Ratatoullie?
B000W9DTG6|4.0|The Oceans trilogy has style to burn.  It doesn't always have much more than that, but the style is often enough.  Ocean's 11 is one of my favorite movies, full of fun performances and great lines.  The other 2 films have their moments, but don't quite live up to the first one. However, Clooney, Pitt, Damon et. al. are having such a great time that the movies are always fun to watch.  Savor 11 - save 12 & 13 for less frequent viewing.
B00005JO3E|5.0|This is a movie for any fan of period stories, especially those interested in tales of love and romance.  The performances in this film are exceptional.  It's noteworthy that the love portrayed here is not only the deeply romantic love between a man and woman, but also the intense love between parent and child.  It is a tremendous shame that this wonderful film is not yet available on DVD for American audiences!
B000UD0ESA|5.0|When you realize how long ago Blade Runner was made, it is remarkable how well it holds up.  The best thing about it is it's look - the vision of future LA as a sort of hell with huge pyramidal apartment blocks, floating video ads in English/Spanish/Japanese, and artificial humans and animals remains haunting.  Make sure you watch it in a dark room - the sun is never shining.  Harrison Ford is at his offhand macho best.  This film takes Philip K. Dick's novel in places it didn't originally go, making the viewer question what makes us human.  Add in some slam-bang action, and you have a classic.  I haven't viewed this version alongside all the other versions, so I couldn't tell you how different it is from the other director's cuts, etc.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|i recieved this cd 2 months in advance of it's debut, and it has been in the 6 disc changer since I received it. I have been nothing but impressed with it. it has 3 songs worth skipping, but Radiohead has managed to continue with amazingly listenable songs... songs like Jigsaw... that I can put on repeat and listen to over and over and over again. They are just so talented. I love the CD in its entirety, though. I would pay several hundred dollars to listen to a complete set of Rainbows, live, as the band just continues to improve. What an impressive, amazing band.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I recommend this product from this seller.  The arm is great for the price.  Prompt shipping.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|I must admit that I am a HUGE John Williams fan.  When the studio that brings us all the \\"Harry Potter\\" films announces that a different composer will score the latest Harry Potter film makes me nervous.  John Williams has created a theme that will stick with Harry Potter fans forever, and it makes me wonder if anyone else can live up to the challenge.  I am very happy to say that Nicholas Hooper has delivered.  His score for \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" is rich in melodic tones, and overflowing in diverse musical styles.  I think of the very first track on the CD entitles \\"Fireworks,\\" which is probably my favorite song on the soundtrack.  Mr. Hooper used the traditional orchestra but also included a variety on percussion instraments and an electric guitar.  It is a fun and light song that adds flavor to a series that is ever darkening.  \\"Professor Umbridge\\" is a beautiful theme with a hint of poison about it.  It was wonderfully scored and evokes the aura that is Umbridge.  Eventually, you will get to \\"Death of Sirius,\\" while poorly named, the song starts out slowly and mysteriously but builds into a fast and tense sequence that will make anyone long to see that part in the movie.  My only wish is that it could have been longer.  The track entitled \\"Ministery of Magic\\" is another wonderful song that is fun and magical.  It gives off the sense that the characters are entering a new part of the magical world and that it is large and wonderful.  \\"Flight of the Order of the Phoenix\\" is another fun and fast paced song that adds jollity to the dark soundtrack.  Overall, the score for \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" was wonderful and a delight to listen to.  Nicholas Hooper has created a piece of work that will surley go down into Harry Potter history.  I look forward to hearing his score for \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\\"
B000O179HW|5.0|I saw the movie in the theatre, but the HD DVD was astounding, especially with surround sound.  If you can't get enough singing and dancing in a movie, this one is for you! The background information with the package makes it a great value.
B0000D9R2E|4.0|What a challenge it must have been to the recording engineers when they were asked to capture a defining moment in the rise of Depeche Mode stateside. The culmination of a gruelling tour of the United States at the 60,000 seat Pasadena Rose Bowl. Even those of us with just a cursory knowledge of audio technology would do well to avoid making a recording in an open air stadium. Your environment is against you from the word go. Not only do you have the problem of sound bouncing off the seating stands, you also lose a large amount of audio signal to the very air around you. Also add to that the problem of recording a band that at this point in their career were very technology/electronic reliant. A format that does not lend its self to ambiance or atmosphere.<br /><br />So it was no mean feat that this document of what must have been a fantastic nights entertainment (with OMD as the support act) exists and what a treat to our ears to have it remastered and released in 5.1 SACD surround sound. If you close your eyes, turn the volume up nice and loud, you almost feel like you're there.<br /><br />Which leads me to what this recording sounds like. Unlike other SACD 5.1 mixes that are out there, this one has been mixed to give you the concert experience rather that bury you in the instrumentation. So the band is front and centre, and the crowd is left and right surround.<br /><br />As far as quality goes you could not ask for a better mix and the stereo mixes also benefit from the remaster. So if you want to feel what it was like to see Depeche Mode live in the 80's then &#34;101&#34; is what you need. I can also recommend the DVD version of this release which contains a great doco and part of the show as well as the other more recent DVD releases (eg.&#34;Touring The Angel&#34;) by the Mode.<br /><br />&#34;Good Evening Pasadena!&#34;
B00000AFFI|4.0|In a recent interview, Polly Jean Harvey said that there were 3 albums she'd done that she was truly satisfied with at the time she'd made them.  This one, White Chalk and To Bring You My Love.  If that doesn't mean anything to you, you probably wouldn't like it as much, but there is a lot of experimentation here and it's not for everyone, but if you like PJ Harvey, you'll like this one.
B000001E7T|5.0|This was the first PJ Harvey album I bought - I saw her that summer on tour with Live and Veruca Salt and a friend of mine had issues with the lack of great drumming (and the occasional use of a drum machine).  In a recent interview, she said that there were 3 albums she was satisfied with at the time she made them - this one, Is This Desire? and White Chalk.  Before this album, I'd never heard the guitars sound the way they do and some of the music was featured in movies as well (some movie with Leonardo DiCaprio where he plays...  I forget).  Long story short, if you like her, you probably already have it in your collection.  If you don't have it in your collection (and you're a fan), you should =D
0786178485|1.0|This is not a good recording. Too much noise and<br />the voice sounds muffled. The discs are CD-Rs,<br />not Audio CDs.<br /><br />Looks like it was made in a garage by<br />indifferent migrant workers.<br />Promptly returned.<br /><br />Very poor quality product,<br />not recommended.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is the best zombie movie ever made.  It's funny, if you can handle british comedy. I recomend this movie to everyone.  Even kids get a kick out of it.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|As an old fan of Star Trek, I was a little hesitant to order this HD remake of the original.......after watching all the episodes I can only say one thing........WOW. The picture, 5.1 surround, new special effects made you think you were watching a 21st Century series that was written as a retro prospective. It is unfortunate that right after my purchase was received, the bomb shell of HD DVD format being dead became public. History repeats..I had just received the last Beta tape of the Star Trek series when it was announced that Beta was dead. If they come out with the remaining years in HD DVD, I will still buy it as my last HD DVD purchase.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore's album RIOT!! is just amazing. I saw them live @ Warped Tour this summer in Tinley Park and they rocked my face off. Every last song on this album is awesome and the vocals of Hayley Williams are so incredibly strong.  She's ignites so much emotion in every song she sings from beginning to end.  My favorites are 'Crushcrushcrush','We Are Broken','When It Rains',and 'Hallelujah'. This is the best album I've heard in a long time and it gets better everytime I hear it.  This band rock my face off.  I Love Paramore and you will,too,if you buy this album.  You won't be disappointed @ all.
0143034545|4.0|This book is a great follow up to Allen's [[ASIN:0142000280 Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity]].  It probes a little deeper into the areas that he explains in GTD.  I gave it 4-stars because I feel it's a companion book and that the original is the 5-star read.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|I bought Alive yesterday.<br /><br />The only studio album I have right now of theirs is this one and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not old enough yet, even though I know I'll never get sick of it.<br /><br />Last Saturday, heading into work for a minute or two, I was listening to this album (again) and didn't find myself skipping to the next track at all.  To be fair, we didn't have a TV for the first 5 years of my life (television does rule the nation).<br /><br />Their first album was overplayed for me (it seemed like everyone was listening to it when it came out), but it still sounds good.  Familiar but still really good (I guess that makes it a classic).<br /><br />\\"Discovery\\" kind of disappointed me - even though I didn't want to admit it at the time.  A little too synthy and clubby (evoked people in polyester shirts doing lines of cocaine in cheesy nightclubs with greasy hair and maybe I just don't like it because I don't like those kinds of people), but I still liked it a lot (maybe it was how they incorporated rainbows into the album art).<br /><br />When this one came out, I  barely found out about it beforehand but had somewhat low expectations for it after \\"Discovery\\" (sorry, but that's just how I feel), but decided in the end that I didn't know what to expect.  It's just the good, solid one that comes after 3 albums and I love it.  If I could just remember that, I wouldn't feel compelled to buy the other 2 again.<br /><br />I'll just have to remember their live mix of \\"Technologic\\" - \\"F*** it, f*** it, f*** it, (repeated infinitely).\\"
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|The Harry Potter movies are a great addition to any High Def format. First, the price of these movies are among the cheapest I have seen and the quality is excellent. Most people are probably aware by now the premise of the movie and that it is the first of the darker Harry Potter films since Chris Columbus gave up the reins as director and it can be pretty scary in places for the kids (especially the Werewolf transformation). The transfer to Blu-Ray is excellent and to me is probably the best of the earlier series thus far. All the special features are present from the original 2 disc edition.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Arguably the best movie ever made and if you agree with that you should have this collection!
B0000042MY|5.0|One of the alltime best Film Soundtracks.  There are days when this CD doesn't leave my stereo.
B0011NVCO8|5.0|First of all Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe both have great performances in this original gangster movie.  Some may find the movie a little long, but the great performances make the movie move at a fast pace.  It's the reportedly true story of Frank Lucas rise and fall as an African American gangster.  Crowe's character plays the multi-layered police detective that pursues getting to the bottom of a large drug ring headed by Lucas (Washington).  I actually found both performances Oscar worthy and the movie is worth seeing solely based on the performances of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  I highly recommend seeing this movie!
0802130208|4.0|I have read a lot of negative reviews of this book, and I was surprised to see that so many people do not like it, because I'm almost done with it already and I can't put it down.  It seems like the majority of people who don't enjoy the book dislike it because they don't think the characters are likeable and they don't think that it's hilarious.  I don't know who started the rumor that this book was laugh-out-loud funny, but I promise you the author did not intend it to be that way.  The humor is dark and tongue-in-cheek at most, so it won't make you laugh, it will reveal how pathetic and sad the characters really are.  It's the kind of humor that pokes fun at society rather than makes you really laugh.  If you want to read a hysterical book with idealized, heroic characters, then this is not the book for you.  Go read Harry Potter or some kind of book that everyone can understand.  If you feel like reading a brilliant work of social satire in which all of the characters are exaggeratedly UNheroic, which in my opinion is more realistic than people who turn out the way you want them to, then you will appreciate this book as great American literature.  Yes, there is a lot of burping and other such bodily functions going on in here.  You're not supposed to find it endearing and funny, you're supposed to find the main character utterly disgusting!  Perhaps the author empathized and identified with his protagonist who was smarter than everyone around him but was tragically lazy and therefore always unsuccessful at everything.  Toole perfectly captures the almost (but not quite) humorous plight of a neighborhood dealing with poverty, vice, ignorance, and probably mental health disabilities, for whom nothing can ever go right.  It's not laugh-out-loud funny because it's not supposed to be.  It is, however, very interesting and different.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|This is a very intense, taut drama/action movie that goes at a very rapid pace.  Good performances by Leonard DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Dijimon Hounsou.  Diamonds, guns, trying to avoid being killed..great story.  Blu-ray transfer GREAT.
B000VR824S|5.0|On the shortened PBS version of the 2007 Festival, Clapton's Blind Faith reunion with Steve Winwood and Jeff Beck's set were the highlights.  But on the full-length DVD, the most impressive guitar-slinger for me was young Derek Trucks.  His set, his band's role as the house band for several other perfomers, and his solos on Clapton's rockin', dual-drummer version of \\"Tell the Truth\\" and on the Winwood-Clapton version of \\"Crossroads\\" were simply awe-inspiring, even for the audience.  Boy, was he channeling Duane Allman on the Derek & the Dominos jams or what?  In his new book, Clapton says Duane Allman was like family--has Clapton found a new family?  It is no wonder that Clapton included Trucks in his Festival band and that Derek and Warren Haynes have brought new life to the Allman Brothers Band.      My dream for a 2010 Festival lineup?  How about Clapton's old Immediate label bandmate Jimmy Page (if he is not on a Led Zepplin world tour), Keith Richards, legends Chuck Berry and Les Paul (if they are still around), the Allman Brothers Band, Bonnie Raitt (a real guitar player, unlike Sheryl Crow), Lonnie Mack, Dave Mason, Joe Walsh, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Buddy Guy, a lot more Skunk Baxter than was in the \\"extras\\", and a few other \\"old timers\\" from 2004 and 2007?  Now that would be worth $200!
B000XA5K4I|5.0|The majority of people want to see movies that entertain.  This movie entertains although you will have to forget sensible plots etc and just sit back and be entertained.  Lots of fun with non-stop action, gun-play, one-liners...Clive Owen is great as the lead character trying to rescue a baby from being shot by Paul Giamatti and his gang.  Monica Bellucci plays a hooker he enlists to help him protect the baby...meanwhile bullets fly non-stop. By the way Monica Bellucci is one of the sexiest actresses in our lifetime.  Blu-ray transfer..ordinary.
0143038583|4.0|Having long thought about my diet from the angle of a quasi-vegetarian (now rejected, though more from a place of admitted laziness than a historical or evolutionary basis -- more about those later) I figured the book was a good read. I was right, for the most part.    The first part (Corn, corn, corn...all we've become is corn) is illuminating, not because it says stuff we don't know (having drunk more than my fair share of sodapop over my life, I'd be foolish not to know what I've been drinking) but in reminding us the full scope of the situation. From its start in a set of four mutations that made it able to grow massive amounts of seeds to its unique response to inbreeding to Archer-Daniels-Midland and Ethanol, it's as much a story of a plant that came to rule our life as it is the story of a \\"meal at McDonalds\\" eaten in a car.    The second and third parts do an amazing job in dissecting the organic food market into two sections: Industrialized Organic and True Organic. While some of the innovations from the Industrialized Organic make for interesting reading (as in the use of plants to attract predatory insects), there's enough about it to turn the thinking eater off Industrial Organic (and onto Fast Food, at least you KNOW what you're getting there). The part of the farmer who works his farm like crazy (and not just to farm it; he's rehabbed the land from ruin to fruitfulness) and the meal from that land makes for probably the happiest and most hopeful part of the book.    The fourth section of the book goes into areas which the average American has little or no direct dealings with, as such it is both uneven and noteworthy. In attempting to emulate the hunter-gatherer way of eating he ends up going into areas which he's probably not fully comfortable, and his reactions show it. He ends up threatening to romanticize the experience (with lots of literary help), but he's also willing to try and make the exercise unnecessary as well (his temporary adapting of Vegetarianism). Both approaches are in ways extreme (Vegetarianism turns its back on evolutionary history and certain facts about the Human body, hunting/gathering can only work with small populations), and while I applaud his willingness to go to the edges (yes, I'm aware of Veganism) I do wish he had a better, tighter grasp on his writing here.    I am willing to forgive whatever problems may pop up with the hunting/gathering attempt. He's willing to give things a go (and fail, on occasion), and whatever shortcomings may exist, his insights give a good view on how and why people fall in love with hunting. There IS something about being able to kill an animal, even down to the point of wanting to thank the animal for giving itself to you (a justification, admittedly, but we're conscious enough of ourselves to believe that the pig owns his life to begin with. Name a lion or bear or wolf who can belief this.).    The section on Vegetarianism seems to me to be a bit lacking. Not so much because of his deciding against it (at least he tried it before turning away from it) but because his reasons seemed facile and toss-offish. At the very least, I would have liked to have heard some other reasons, including the above-mentioned comments based on history and evolution. While I believe we are evolving to be vegetarians (our need for Vitamin C is an example of this) there's still much in us that is best answered by meat (such as the fact that there are eight amino acids we don't make within our bodies, and the ability of Eggs to feed us those Amino Acids in the exact ratio of our need).    Overall, the book is a close and revelatory read of a most important facet of life: our food.
B00005JPUN|2.0|This is a sort of swashbuckling romp through a story told in film and television on several occasions as noted by most reviewers.<br /><br />Kidman and Craig do an OK job as the central characters and there is a modicum of suspense throughout the movie.<br /><br />It did not take long for the gaps in the plot and the inconsistencies to show through but it was entertaining enough for my fourteen year old to sit through until the end.<br /><br />Good idea, gone wrong. Too superficial, probably just made it into maximum viewer attention span of about 100 minutes and about as interesting as the remake of Stepford Wives. Hang on. Kidman was in that too. These movies must remind her of her ex-hubby.<br /><br />I would rather watch this than the election coverage but it is hard to choose between the two and I would rather not watch the elction coverage although Hilary and Obama remind me of Kidman and Craig.<br /><br />OK if you like this sort of thing.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Saw this at the theatre three times and felt compelled to own it.  Since it's on Ebert & Roeper's list of the best 10 films of 2007, it looks like I have good taste.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I missed seeing this series when it first aired and bought the DVD with both high hopes and expectations.  The best I can say about it is that the DVD as a piece of technology is good.  The content is by far the worst piece of pseudo-history garbage since Steve Reeves did the \\"Last Days of Pompeii\\".  While beautifully photographed virtually everything except the most basic history (ie. its set in England) is consistently wrong. Aside from the technical aspects such as grossly inappropriate costuming at times, the actual events are frequently twisted, mixed up chronologically, and in many important instances totally wrong. The classic example is Margaret's supposed marriage to the King of Portugal and then her death by consumption. Obviously in rice pudding as bad as this there have to be a few raisins of excellence, the portrayals of Wolsey and Catherine were very nicely done (although Catherine had reddish gold hair, not black).  Unfortunately, these raisins do not offset the overall fact this is just pudding.  What concerns me more is that this drivel will be taken by most as accurate history.  History is important for the lessons it can teach about human interaction and reaction.  If we learn these lessons from inacurate history we are learning the wrong lessons.  In this day and age I suppose it is even possible, God forbid, that this trash might even be used in schools.

B00005K3NR|5.0|I think this horror flick was Sissy Spacek's best movie of them all and plays an unpopular reclusive abused high school teenage girl(Carrie White) with interesting telekenetic powers along with the fact that this movie had showed us a lot what it's like for typical everyday high school students and what we all have or had to go through while we were growing up such as being a teenager that got picked on, dealing with peer pressures, growing pains, sex, dating, relationships, etc.; that most adolescents go through, which assured a lot of us that we're not alone in that department, not to mention CARRIE had some very cute chicks in it too, including the outstanding and sexy Nancy Allen as the wicked popular bad girl(Christine Hargenson).<br /><br />CARRIE also starts out deliciously nasty with a lot of graphic nudity; especially Nancy Allen who has beautiful bouncy ta-tas & pretty pubic-hair as she steps out of the girls lockerroom showers walking to the center of an all-girls only lockerroom with a bunch of sexy high school teenage girls flocking together roaming around as naked as the day they were born as they're freshening up at the ending of their PE class by grooming themselves, changing clothes, taking showers, dressing, undressing, & brushing their hair like a typical high school girls gym looks like in real-life after the ending of a typical high school PE Period except they used soft beautiful music scoring by Pino Donaggio for the girls lockerroom scene in slow motion at the beginning of this terror flick, which is very unusual since most movies with nude scenes in a lockerroom don't use any music composing for those scenes at all, unlike CARRIE, which was another thing that made the girls lockerroom scene in this Bryan De Palma film so intriguing.<br /><br />In addition, I think the girls lockerroom scene at the beginning of this flick was also the best nude scene for Nancy Allen, Sissy Spacek, & PJ Soles in their entire acting career along with half the other gals shown bare-assed & bare-breasted in the girls gym, including PJ Soles(Norma)in the girls shower stalls which goes to show you that females weren't uncomfortable to be naked in front of and/or around other women back then as opposed to how it supposedly is nowadays, especially adolescents.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the lockerroom scene at the beginning of this movie was my favorite scene throughout this entire film, especially since I really enjoyed seeing Sissy Spacek, Nancy Allen, and P.J. Soles undressed like many other people did, which I'm sure was another reason that made this thriller CARRIE so popular back in the 70's when it made its theatrical release in the Fall of 1976 and why so many people still like to watch the movie from time to time to this very day, except you cant enjoy it nearly as much if you watch this movie on cable TV or in syndication, since this flick contains too many scenes that are too gory, too sexy, & too offensive, including lots of profanity.<br /><br />I also like the way the PE teacher Ms. Collins(Betty Buckley) stood up for Carrie and how she handled & berated all the girls in Carrie's PE class after harrassing Carrie with the crappy stunt they pulled on Carrie when she freaks out while wiping the blood from her vagina not realizing that she started her period for the very first time being clueless to the facts of life on puberty.<br /><br />I especially liked the way the PE Teacher handled Hargenson, since Hargenson ended up getting what she deserved from Miss Collins, especially after the vicious incident that Hargenson instigated on Carrie with the bombarding of the tampons in the lockeroom and when Ms. Collins turns the tables on malicious Hargenson when she ends up slapping the obnoxious Hargenson and nearly knocking her on her ass out on the football field after the relentless Hargenson pulls a hasty stunt on Miss Collins by talking back to her and trying to get the rest of her PE classmates to unionize against the coach, except the cold-blooded Hargenson's idea & stunt ends up failing and getting herself banned from the prom instead.<br /><br />One of the things that I found baffling in this movie that I found kind of corny was Hargensons pal and partner in crime(Norma)never took her hat off in the movie with the exception of Norma's nude scene in the girls lockerroom showers in full-frontal nudity, which I also found intriguing, since PJ Soles also came out in John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN 2 years later playing the devirginized sassy high school cheerleeder(Lynda) who also ends up dying in that 1978 flick as well, which also did a cool sex scene in that movie with partial nudity showing PJ's hooters, except P.J. Soles wasn't as annoying or as snotty in John Carpenters HALLOWEEN as she was in CARRIE.<br /><br />In fact, P.J. Soles sexy nude scene in the girls lockerroom at the beginning of the movie CARRIE is initially what helped PJ Soles to get the role for Lynda in John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, since P.J. Soles impressive nude scene in CARRIE had potentially inspired John Carpenter to consider P.J. Soles for a teenage role in HALLOWEEN and chances are Nancy Allen's intriguing nude scene in full-frontal nudity in CARRIE had inspired director(Bryan DePalma) for her sexy nude scene in the shower in DRESSED TO KILL 4 years later along with the fact that Nancy Allen and Bryan De Palma were later married in 1979, but divorced in 1984.<br /><br />I also found it to be a shame that Carrie even ended up killing Ms. Collins(Betty Buckley) towards the end of the movie when Carrie ends up killing most of the prom attendants at her high school when she uses her powers to blow up the whole gymnasium after the stuck up Hargenson and her sleazy low-life boyfriend Billy Nolan(John Travolta) pull a nasty stunt on Carrie by dumping pigs blood on her after getting elected prom queen with her prom date Tommy Ross(Bill Katt) to ruin and embarrass the hell out of Carrie at the prom, in order to avenge Carrie, especially after snotty Hargenson ends up getting restricted from the the prom by Miss. Collins.<br /><br />I also enjoyed watching the bonus features on this DVD behind the making of CARRIE describing how they did the destruction scene in the gym when Carrie set it on fire killing just about everyone who attended the prom and how they actually used cornsyrup and red paint and food-coloring for the pigs blood that the malicious Hargenson dumped on Carrie at the prom and that Nancy Allen and De Palma eventually became an item & got married in real life when they made this movie CARRIE and the terror flick DRESSED TO KILL, not to mention CARRIE & DRESSED TO KILL were probably DePalma's 2 greatest movies ever made and directed by him of all times.<br /><br />The bonus features on this CARRIE DVD also contain a lot of the co-stars like Sissy Spacek, Nancy Allen, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, and Piper Laurie along with De Palma telling us about their experience while making and filming the movie CARRIE like how Nancy Allen and Betty Buckley had to keep rehearsing the slapping scene out on the football field about 30 times till they got it right, in order to make it convincing for audiences.<br /><br />In addition to that bonus feature; De Palma explained how tough it was for all the lady co-stars in this movie who did a nude scene in the girls lockerroom at the beginning of this flick and how it created a lot of tension for them, which even contributed to some of those lady co-stars balking out and crying in the process since it made them feel uncomfortable having to waltz around with a lot of tits and ass in front of the camera in real-life showing off their Womanhood while filming this movie, especially since at least half of them had to be buck-naked which probably made this the hardest scene of all to do in this entire movie, despite the fact that all of Sissy Spacek and all her co-stars, including Nancy Allen and PJ Soles weren't even teenagers anymore when De Palma filmed this movie back in 1976 since Spacek along with the rest of her co-stars were already adults in their 20's, 30's, and 40's, except Spacek, Allen, and Soles still looked young enough to be teenage girls in high school back then in order to make this flick a success.<br /><br />Nancy Allen also added on that bonus feature behind the scenes on the movie CARRIE by explaining how she ended up enjoying that adolescent nude scene in the all girls only lockerroom afterwhile since it actually ended up working out very well in a way since that nude scene made Nancy Allen and all the other female co-stars in that movie bond together beautifully since it helped her and some of her other lady co-stars in this flick,including Sissy Spacek and PJ Soles overcome their fear and tension of being butt-naked in front of the camera while filming this movie during that lockerroom scene at the beginning of CARRIE along with the fact that movies rarely start out with an intriguing nude scene beaver & all, which was another thing that kind of made the movie CARRIE quite genuine.<br /><br />In addition to that; De Palma added in the bonus feature special that a lot of the lady co-stars and extras in this movie were great troopers at doing the nude scene in the girls gym at the beginning of this movie, especially the gals who were shown in full-frontal nudity, but that in actuality they had filmed Sissy's nude scene in the girls lockerroom showers before they had actually filmed Carrie's classmates/Sissy's co-stars in the nude in order to give Sissy's co-stars a lot more self-confidence to be completley naked with the 3B's(Breast, Bush, Breast)during the girls gym scene at the beginning of this flick in order to convince all the female co-stars in this movie that if Sissy Spacek could do a nude scene in the girls lockerroom showers without any qualms that the rest of the female co-stars can do the nude scene in the girls lockerroom too, not to mention that whole nude scene at the beginning of this movie also shows us how gals groomed themselves a lot differently back then in the 70's than they do nowadays on top of that.<br /><br />Therefore, De Palma and all the film editors had spliced the nude scenes with Sissy showering in the ladies lockerroom stalls and the nude scenes of the rest of her female co-stars in the girls gym to make it look like all of Carrie's classmates had showered at the end of their P.E. class before Carrie White(Sissy Spacek)took her shower in those same shower stalls alone to make Carrie look like an outcast, but De Palma and the film experts had revised the scenes when they spliced them out by revising and rearranging the sequences of each scene in the order they wanted them shown in this flick in order to give the rest of the female co-stars enough confidence to do that remarkable skinteresting, titacular, mufftastic lockerroom scene in the girls lockerroom with lots of female genitalia.<br /><br />Additionally, P.J. Soles had explained in that bonus feature how she was originally scheduled to only be on the set for only a few days, but De Palma had decided to keep her on longer and to do more scenes and that De Palma got the idea for PJ Soles to wear her cap in every scene when he met P.J. Soles for the very first time when she came to audition for the part of Norma Watson since P.J. Soles was already wearing a cap in real life and felt it was catchy.<br /><br />Therefore, De Palma had PJ Soles wear her hat in every scene she did in the movie with the exception of her nude scene in the girls lockerroom showers at the beginning of this flick when P.J. Soles shows off her sexy genitals.<br /><br />It was also interesting seeing Bill Katt before his GREATEST AMERICAN HERO days and John Travolta in this movie during his WELCOME BACK KOTTER days and before he became famous and popular as well as before doing the movie SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.<br /><br />It's just too bad that they didn't end up picking Jamie-Lee Curtis to be a co-star in this movie too, because I think Jamie-Lee Curtis would've been awesome in this movie, kind of like she was in the movies PROM NIGHT, HALLOWEEN, and THE FOG, not to mention the 1980's flick PROM NIGHT was a tad similar to CARRIE since PROM NIGHT was like a cross between HALLOWEEN & CARRIE, but this movie CARRIE takes me all the way back to memory lane to life in the 70's such as sex, drugs, Rock & Roll, Disco music, Bell-bottomed pants, fluffy poofy hairdos, going to your high school Junior and/or Senior Prom, etc.
0805079831|5.0|This is a most provocative book.  And no, Klein does not say that capitalism is incompatible with democracy--despite other reviewers' comments.  She calls for a \\"3rd way\\" between hard-core Social Darwinist, Friedmanite \\"Jungle Capitalism\\" and Marxian Socialism/Communism.    Her emphasis is on sovereign democratic peoples deciding their own futures through democratic means.  Hardly a radical idea for most Americans who profess an allegiance to our democratic republic and constitution.  But most definitely, a radical idea for would be and real royalists, autarchs, plutocrats, fascists, dictators, etc., etc.      Personally, I don't care whether a nation's people want to DEMOCRATICALLY set up a paradise of workers' cooperatives, \\"Small is Beautiful\\" small to mid size business firms, or a corporate friendly environment.  Whatever works for them and has some reasonable degree of social decency to it.  I neither subscribe to the bloody fanged, Social Darwinist, plutocratic corporate state or a Marxian workers paradise.  Let the peoples of nations decide in fair and democratic elections how their societies and economies shall be shaped.  Let them have full access to all of the pertinent facts.  Different nations will have different outcomes--for obvious reasons.  Different cultures have different values.     Her chronicling of the history of \\"Shock Capitalism\\" is more than a little eye opening.  Despite the right wingers firing away in their comments, I find myself largely in agreement with her.  There seems to be a consistency to the behavior of the American business and political elites when dealing with the less powerful countries of the world.  Pinochet's Chile was not the first appalling misuse of American power in the 20th century, but it certainly is one of the most memorable ones.  I was unaware that the present President of Chile, Bachelet, was held captive along with her mother, and tortured by the Chilean military during the 70's.  The military also murdered herfather who was a military officer because he opposed the coup.  Nixon, Kissinger....  Truly timeless.  It's good to know that Cheney and Bush keep in close contact with Kissinger.  I bet you those are some really interesting conversations.    I would only quarrel with her on two points.  The first would be about the re-building of New Orleans.  Regardless of the levels of competency and malevolence of the Bush regime, the New Orleans' 9th Ward is well below sea level.  The soil is sinking, the sea is undoubtedly rising, and hurricanes may become more frequent and violent.  Hardly the recipe for successful rebuilding.  Secondly, I do think that illegal immigration from Mexico is a very real problem.  Different nations and peoples can have real and legitimate conflicts.  Immigration laws and controls are issues of national sovereignty.  Other nations or peoples do not have the right to ignore the immigration laws of neighboring countries.

B000PWQPAC|5.0|This GITS movie accomplished everything I hoped it would. The continuity between the television series and the movie is all there, complete with a beefed up budget for improved animation and action.     I have always wondered how prophetic the GITS universe is given our changing times, and this movie evokes those same kinds of questions. In an increasingly wireless society, what are the perils of human beings becoming consciousness-floating entities of the Net? With greater freedom and power comes the freedom to die or become maimed in unimaginable ways by new evils.     Seeing this film for the first time there's no way you will understand or catch everything; that's a strength, though, not a weakness. This isn't a simple throw-away-after-one-view movie. It has a philosophical angle lurking in the background, making you think. By \\"lurking in the background\\", I mean that this aspect isn't in your face or preachy (as some anime has a tendency to be).     Ghost in the Shell is unique in the anime universe as far as I know. Too much anime suffers from a lack of seamless pacing, realistic animation, or well-developed characters in a richly complex world. I have enjoyed other anime series to be sure (Gasaraki, Samurai Champloo, RahXephon, X, etc.), however none of these has the same philosophical possibilities or intriguing futuristic vision. Whereas some anime can seem like entertainment escapism, GITS occasionally causes me to hit upon formerly undiscovered nuances about human nature or the nature of technology itself - the challenges technology presents to a society and the opportunities it creates for alienation, exploitation, and human consciousness. I highly recommend anything in the Ghost in the Shell universe. It will hack into your psyche...and I mean that in a good way.
080701429X|4.0|This book was exactly what I expected and was oddly similar (but obviously not as cruel) as basic training.  I liked his story, he's a very brilliant man.  \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" basically cronicles this psychologists' (Viktor E. Frankl) experiences at Auschwitz extermination camp in World War II.  Frankl gives the reader an inside look at his day-to-day life, what he thought about while away, and essentially how he was lucky enough to survive.
1592402038|5.0|It's a grammar reference book that I've read cover to cover twice. Nice trick, innit? That must be why the genre is listed as Reference/Humour. Obviously she's preaching to the choir here, but I don't care. I love the book. Read it if you haven't before. Read it if you have before. It's all good.
B00009Z576|2.0|Unfortunately 80s were not good times for Yes at all and this record is the beginning of te downfall period... In this album there are only two good things: the cover by Roger Dean and the first song Machine Messiah... this is it, the rest is just the average rock music, where such great musicians as Chris Squire and Steve Howe played (didn't help a lot either). The absence of Jon Anderson was a great blow of course, so it is not a surprise that the album was not successful... the songs are boring and too long, a very great dissapointment after Going for the One and Tormato...  P.S. I forgot the bonuses, which are rather good... it s interesting to listen to the last tracks what may have come out of Yes if Anderson and Wakeman stayed...
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Un disco magnifico (igual que la pelicula).  Vale la pena pagar un poquito más (muy poco) y hacerse con ésta versión deluxe.  Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo ya sean fans de \\"The Beatles\\" o no. La buena música es lo que tiene.  Muy a tener en cuenta la versión de \\"Let it be\\".  Saludos desde España.
B0012NVGHU|2.0|I didn't make it past the first five minutes.  The language, when I could understand it, was profanity-rich (f-bombs galore). The first song was okay, but I turned the film off before the second song ended.<br /><br />Perhaps it got better, but I wasn't inclined to invest the time to find out.
B0000048CP|5.0|I really can't put in to words how good this album is. Its simply one of the best metal albums iv ever listened to. It's fast, raw, dark, and epic. It has the elements of black and viking metal (leaning more to viking). The guitars are lighting fast, drumming tight, bass...lets face it when do we ever hear it in any song lol. But what really got me, besides the catchy riffs and blazing solos, was Quorthon's vocals. Sounds something like a raspy shriek from hell. The only bad thing about this album is the production. Its not as bad as most black metal albums it just tends to kinda quiet. No worries though, just crank up the volume. If your just getting in to black metal, viking metal, or you just like metal pick this up. You won't regret it.    R.I.P. Quorthon
B0011MZOEI|4.0|A PG-13 Die Hard?  Half the fun of the original was the symphony of obscenity that came out of the mouth of John McClane - for once, almost integral to the character rather than merely gratuitous.  The buckets of blood give way to more explosions and CHiPs style violence that a surprising number of people (bad guys excepted) walk away from.<br /><br />And yet...this toned-down version seems to work.  It veers into unabashed fantasy a few times, but it's still a rollicking good time.
B00005JPXY|5.0|I felt like I was in the middle of a monster attack myself.  It was much more interesting and exciting than your regular Godzilla movie.  Enough of the plot was given away to satisfy the audience yet want them leaving more.  As for the complaints of motion sickness, it shouldn't be a problem on with the DVD, since the screen is smaller.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is by far the greatest collection of DVD's for Alien fans.  The supplimental DVD's are as interesting as the movies themselves. I'd recommend this set to anyone who has followed the \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\"

B000P12LWY|5.0|Great performances! History of King Henry VIII and the church in England. The acting is worthy of an oscar. Outstanding in all aspects.
B000M4RG42|3.0|I think it's very difficult to create this sort of film, based on such charged material in a timeframe when the public was blind to the machinations of the man behind the curtain.  Based on the book of the same name, in an effort to raise funds for the war, the government conscripts the aid of three soldiers who were photographed raising the flag on Iwo Jima to tour the nation and use their experiences as propaganda to bolster the public view of the government.  Aside from the personal conflicts the soldiers have at being used thusly, they experience moral conflicts regarding the way in which the flag actually was raised.  The names and details included did not reflect the event accurately, and the soldiers were forbidden to let this fallacy be known.  Narrated by one of the surviving soldiers to the son of another survivor, the film tells the story of these men and that of the men who died at Iwo Jima.<br /><br />Common to the many war genre films that have saturated the market the last few years, this film delves into the brutal realities of war, the effects it has on soldiers, and the political agendas driving mass death.  In this regard it is not terribly original, but carries the torch in raising the awareness that win or lose, war takes a terrible toll on all involved.  The film is rather graphic in some scenes.  One of its more original angles, however, are its intense examinations of the treatment of Native Americans in the military at that time.  Adam Beach stole the film for his portrayal of Ira Hayes, the Pima man who finally spoke the truth of raising the flag.<br /><br />While I feel that Eastwood directed a great film, the editing in it was quite choppy.  I enjoy nonsequential revelation as much as anyone, but the transitions were quite rough and in the end the storytelling suffered for it.  The acting was superb, the cast conveyed wonderful chemistry.  This film's success lies in its honest delivery of the message that society creates heroes of people who just want peace.eace.
6305754969|4.0|First off, let me start by saying that, contrary to the popular belief here, El Dorado is definitely NOT a remake of [[ASIN:B000O599WG Rio Bravo (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. Yes, there are a similar themes that run through both: A drunken lawman, holding up in the jailhouse waiting for the U.S. Marshall, a sexy love interest, and a crusty old deputy to name a few. Howard Hawkes, who directed both films, was fond of saying how much he liked to steal from himself. But the plots are completely different. A perfect example of a remake is the 1957 film [[ASIN:B000TGJ82Q 3:10 to Yuma (Special Edition)]], starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. In 2007 a remake of the film ([[ASIN:B000XR9L50 3:10 to Yuma (Widescreen Edition)]]), starring Christian Bale and Russell Crowe was released. Same characters, same exact plot. Only the sequence and action was updated. That is a remake. In Rio Bravo the Sheriff is holding the brother of a rich rancher for murder and the story takes us through how the rancher tries to free his brother at any cost. In El Dorado, based on the Book [[ASIN:1568496648 The Stars in Their Courses]] by Harry Brown, the main plot revolves around a range war between two ranchers, the tough but fair Kevin MacDonald (R.G. Armstrong) and the land-grabbing Bart Jason (Ed Asner). This is not a remake.<br /><br />John Wayne plays Cole Thornton, a hired gun whom Jason is trying to hire to help drive MacDonald off his ranch so that Jason can steal the water rights. What Jason doesn't know is that Thornton is an old friend to the local sheriff, J.P. Hara, played by Robert Mitchum. Of course, Thornton turns down the job. But unknown to him, MacDonald has been mistakenly warned that Thornton was working for Jason, which leads to Thornton accidentally killing one of MacDonald's sons, Luke (Johnny Crawford of The Rifleman Fame) and then getting shot by a MacDonald daughter (Michele Carey). The killing of Luke haunts Thornton to the point where he feels he owes the MacDonalds but can't face them, leading him to leave. This all happens in the first 15 minutes of the film and sets up the rest perfectly.<br /><br />As the story progresses we meet \\"Mississippi\\" (a young James Caan), a man who had spent two years chasing down a group of cowboys who murdered his friend. Christopher George plays Nelse McLeod, a gunman with an interesting sense of fairness who joins Jason. And we find out that after Thornton left El Dorado his pal Hara turned into a drunk because of a \\"wandering petticoat.\\" It's up to Thornton, Mississippi, and Hara's deputy \\"Bull\\" (played wonderfully by character actor Arthur Hunnicutt) to put Hara back together before McLeod can take advantage of the situation. What follows is some of the best gunfights that a mid-1960's western could produce.<br /><br />Throughout the film we're treated to great action, wonderful lines (Bull's \\"Well I'd be a suck-egged mule\\" is still one of my favorites), a bit of comedy relief here and there, and some good-ole fashion sex-appeal coming from Charlene Holt and Michele Carey. Just what every guy back in the 60's loved about going to see a John Wayne Western at a Saturday matinee.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to any John Wayne/Robert Mitchum/Western fan.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|I must admit:  I'd rather wash dishes than watch a film with Will Ferrell.  Wrapped as he was around Maggie Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, I put down the dishrag and gave it a chance.  The premise is that Harold Crick's life is being narrated and only he can hear the narration, which portends his soon death.  A rather methodical and predictable man, on his quest to isolate the circumstances behind this fate he enlists the help of a literary professor who attempts to sort out what sort of plot Crick's life may be.  As the duo rifle through the criteria comprising great literary works Crick meets the woman whom he feels is writing his destiny. The issue here is that this renowned author is known for always killing off her main characters.  As Crick endures the meltdown of unraveling his destiny, the linear way in which he lives becomes more organic, more fulfilling.  Although the conclusion becomes somewhat predictable the journey to that resolution is nothing short of humorous and thought-provoking.<br /><br />The plot of this film is unique.  To observe the twists and witticisms along the way is worth the watch.  I'd like to have seen more of Gyllenhaal's character.  She was very well developed but not really used to her potential.  Her more bohemian way of living was to be that of a foil to Crick's organized method.  The culmination there was clear, but it just didn't give her character enough screen time.  That said, the stellar cast surrounding Ferrell mellowed his usual take on comedy, elevating it to rather smart repart&eacute;e on all counts.  The film moves quickly, pacing consistently throughout, it ending no less a sudden powerful impact.  Ultimately the film asks the question:  Who's authoring the story of your life?
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram, Gregory David Roberts, is a great novel. The reader can feel the real life experience of the writer in this novel. The novel put the reader in Mumbai as a foreigner coming to spend an undermined amount of time there. First the fear, the shame of being different, and little by little a real feeling of belonging there.     Shantaram is a great novel that will let you breathless.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|As far as LotR music goes, this soundtrack doesn't disappoint. It's everything a true LotR fan could hope for. Listneing to it, one has but to close their eyes and you could almost see the movie playing out, scene-for-scene, right before your eyes. Compared to the first two Complete Recordings, I'd have to say this one is my favorite, especially since it has the song 'The Hours of Healing' (featuring Liv Tyler). All I have to say is, if your a hardcore Lord of the Rings fan, this soundtrack is a must-have.

It's full of beautifully taken photographs of just about every recipe that is included in the book and even all the tools and equipment you would need.  And I don't know about you, but I certainly like to see pictures of what I am making.  All the advice about the tools needed was great and Martha's great tips with every recipe and even variations you can do to some of them are helpful and fun.  If I hadn't gotten it as a gift I would have most certainly bought it.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This film is an inspiring account of the stuggle of William Wilberforce and his contribution to elevating society.  His tireless efforts to end the slave trade are realistically portrayed in an intensely dramatic few hours.  It is good story for young people, especially in demonstrating that doing what is right is not easy and not popular, but you can change hearts with persistence.  In the film, William Pitt says that Wilberforce never wavers, is never swayed from his purpose.  The film has compelled me to ask: Can anyone say that about me?

B000W0DFDM|2.0|First of the good things:  1. This book is useful in reminding you to stop making excuses for the bad things that guys do.  Through its constant repetition of the phrase \\"he's just not that into you,\\" you should get it drilled into your head, that really, he's not, and its best to cut your losses and move on.  If you find yourself constantly in bad relationships and constantly making excuses, this might be a book to read.    The bad things:  1.  It is repetitive and not really funny.d  2.  The sample sizes of their \\"surveys\\" are never given.  I suspect it may be Greg's 10 closest buddies or coworkers.  3.  It is very one-sided.  I like getting a guys' perspective on these issues, but I would rather it be much more than one guy.  Greg is 'all or nothing', as Liz acknowledges, and sorry, but not everyone is like that.  It's akin to saying that all women need their guys to make a lot of money or have a powerful job.  Just not true!  4. Guys' might be a bit more simplistic when it comes to dating than women, but I am a highly-educated woman who has been involved and continues to be involved with highly-educated and thoughtful men.  I have intimately known guys who do NOT think like Greg, and since reading the book I have surveyed more male friends.  Some agree with Greg, some don't.     5.  It is NOT inspiring or uplifting.  At the end of each chapter, writing things like \\"you're hot girl!\\" and \\"you deserve better\\" and \\"he should move mountains for a desirable lady like you\\" are things that a lot of us either know, or honestly, are unbelievable.  Because c'mon, if you are 275lbs and having dating problems, you might--and probably are!--a fantastic person in many ways and totally worth dating, but...hot?  Yes, some women believe they are, and that's great for them, but to just blindly tell everyone she's hot, or desirable without providing some context as to why she should think that is not, to me, very helpful.  6.  Did I mention it's not funny?  In fact, I find Greg tobe obnoxious.    So in summary:  rent it from the library, peruse it in the store (its a quick read), but don't waste your money!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Another fantastic movie from Tim Burton!!!  Ewan McGregor does such a wonderful job at these types of movies!!!!
075640407X|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss's \\"the Name of the Wind\\" is probably one of the best fantasy Novels I've ever read. The 661 pages of the book (I notice many speak of 900+ pages, I expect this is an issue of which edition of the book people bought) were at no point boring, it took me three days of reading to gobble down this excellent story.    At this point I'd like to respond to some of the criticism published about the Name of the Wind and Patrick Rothfuss. Firstly, those people who did not like the novel seem to have expected more of the present time story written in third person narrator form. It is true that the passage from the common third person narrator form to first person storytelling as I'd label most of the book seemed odd at first. But after a hundred pages or so I had become totally entranced by Kvothe's recollection of the past and found little interest in the present story. I believe this trilogy will deal entirely with Kvothe's past, it's the story of a warrior/wizard who has outlived his own legend, who has no place in present day society yet is unable to die or fade away. Others will have to solve the present day problems, let the Blacksmith's Apprentice and others deal with current problems and let Kvothe once more dwell in a less painful past.    Another criticism I have noticed is about the length of the book and the apparent lack of climax. I can partially agree with this, but then it should be considered that this story was not written from the start as a trilogy, rather as a single large volume which had to be divided into three parts. Personally I'd have made the split a few pages earlier even if it meant giving the book a different name (as Kvothe only spoke the Name of the Wind in the last few pages). But I don't know how the next book will continue and will assume that the author and editor know best. So indeed there is no strong climax, no villain slain, no great feat of heroism. But that's the charm of this entire story I feel, we are experiencing the life of a then 15 year old (genius), the book would be boring if he'd slain a true dragon instead of a giant dracus, the the continuing story would make little sense if Kvothe and Denna had made a fortune selling the Resin and corpse of the dracus. We, the readers want something in common with the protagonists in the books we read, in this case it's the imperfection of Kvothe, he makes mistakes, he miscalculates, he is not born a hero, he slowly becomes a hero which in turn slowly destroys him. So 661 pages of this first book are entirely justified as they show us the slow evolution of Kvothe the Edema Ruh to the Legendary Kvothe Kingslayer. The road from Child Genius to Legend is a slow, twisting one and needs time to map. It's the little twists and traps along this road that make the book so interesting and I would not want to miss any of these.    Lastly, many seem to compare the Name of the Wind with Harry Potter in both positive and negative ways. I think this is unfair, Rothfuss started work on this story long before Rowland published the first Harry Potter novel. I'm sure Patrick Rothfuss was somewhat inspired by the work of other authors including Rowland, but it's definitely not a copy of the same story. Rather the contrary, Rothfuss paints a much more realistic, grim picture of adolescence and growth. Kvothe is not predestined for his path, he is not all powerfull, rather he slowly gains his powers to become a legend. Harry Potter is a book for children, light entertainment without true debth, the Name of the Wind on the other hand is a book full of surprises and realism.    In conclusion, the Name of the Wind is an excellent read and I expect will remain a Fantasy besteller for the coming decades. Patrick Rothfuss in turn will become one of the greatest writers of Fantasy comparable to Tad Williams, George R.R. martin or even Tolkien. That is also why I give this book 5 stars, I tend to grade low as I expect excellency, this book is not perfect but indeed excellent therefore I cannot do other then give the maximum grade.    I cannot wait to lay hands on his next book. It will be a long year till April 2009, not to speak of 2010/11 when we migth expect the conclusion of Kvothe's Trilogy. But I expect we won't regret the wait.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|I still am having a hard time thinking why t.a.t.u.'s music is looked down upon by many fans of pop music.  This IS pop music, plain and simple.  And some of the greatest pop music that I've heard in a LONG time.  I bought this cd after hearing \\"All the Things She Said,\\" because I just loved the dark, trippy-esque atmosphere of the song.  If you're a fan of albums that have a certain \\"feel\\" or \\"atmosphere\\" to them (like me), this is a great record to by.    I mean, they are not your average pop rock band, If you are able to push aside all of that hubbub about lesbians and not writing their own songs. You need to look at it for what it is.....a electronic pop record.  If you don't worry about who wrote the songs or the sexual appeal of the videos, this is a GREAT album.  I still listen to it on occasion.    Ever have an album that you just listen to at night?  For me, things like Portishead's \\"Dummy\\" and the Gorillaz' Self titled debut are just a few of my \\"night-driving\\" cds......And now I'm adding \\"200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane\\" to my list of albums for the night.  While it's really hard to explain the atmosphere of this record, I'd like to again point out albums like \\"Dummy\\" and \\"Gorillaz\\".....every song just works off of one another so well that the cd, as a whole, actually has an \\"atmosphere\\" to it.  And THAT is when you know that you have some good songs.  All-in-all, this is a GREAT record, ESPECIALLY for fans of atmospheric moods or tendencies.  Again, try and listen to it at night!  It makes the album twice as good, in my opinion!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|A classic film, so I will not review it here. If you haven't seen it, see it.     I bought this DVD mainly for the special features, which are awesome. For anyone who liked the film, the special features are well worth the price.

141935972X|5.0|This is part of an amazing series! It's so fantastic that I own 5 of the 6 books in unabridged audio CD's! Diana Gabaldon's talent is revealed over and over and the Narrator Davina Porter brings it all to life...you'll never want it to end....I have listened to this many times and each time I catch something new. Through this audio book series I have traveled with Jamie and Claire and fallen in love with them over and over! Start with Outlander and follow the series sequentially.  I just know you're going to love it!
B00005NB8K|1.0|If you love the real Doors, stay clear of this miasma.     The Doors, I always thought were the greatest rock band of all time, but this vapid flick, created by a brain-dead Hollywood dodo makes the late, great Jim Morrison and the rest of The Doors look foolish, idiotic and talenless goofballs.    This travesty of a flick basically left me fairly angry. I may just have to re-read (for the third time) No One Here Gets Out Alive, and will surely play some Doors music to get rid of the aftertaste left in this viewer's mouth by the rancid Oliver Stone attempt.
B000P2A256|5.0|Love the CD.  As always Adam Levine writes about relationships gone bad...in varying degrees.  Normally, that would be depressing (at least for me) but the lyrics are so well written and set so well, you can't dance along to his pain.
B000H5TVKI|3.0|Rambo:First blood is a classic action movie that I haven't seen in about 15 years before I decided to buy the Blu-Ray. That being said I cannot comment too much on the transfer except to say that it looks great for something that was filmed in 1982. The picture is pretty clear and there are no jagged lines present, but I thought the explosions could be louder. I read alot of 4 and 5 star reviews before I bought this flick. I found the movie entertaining but I wasn't blown away.     Stallone plays a war veteran that walks into the wrong town and gets harrassed by the cops. After he breaks out of jail he escapes into the mountains and every cop in town comes looking for him guns blazing, but it won't be easy becuse they're in Rambo's territory now! \\"you want a war? I'll give you a war you wouldn't believe\\" says John Rambo. This is definately one of Stallone's better flicks(given that he has about eight lines in the whole movie) next to Rocky IV. A must for any true Stallone fan!
B00008DDSC|5.0|I love James Spader - have since his teenage movie days into Less than Zero and then Sex, Lies & V / White Palace / Crash and so much more.  He is so adept in being able to portray real-life people and situations.     Big kudos to the writer/director for portraying a BDSM relationship as it is meant to be - consentual.  And with both parties aware of the roles and enjoying them.    Finally, but not last, a big plus also to Maggie Gyllenhall.  Great acting showing the evolution of her character from damaged to someone strong enough to be submissive to another person.  It takes a very strong character to be able to so do.
1595141715|5.0|I found out about this book on myspace.  I read the synopsis, was intrigued by the premise, so I immediately went out and bought it.  I couldn't put it down, finishing it in a day.  This haunting and tragic tale about beautiful Hannah and her reasons to end her life will be a must read for teens for a very long time.  Thanks Jay.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|I'm not going to repeat what other reviewers who have also given this production of Persuasion 1 star have said - they have been exactly right - I'm only adding my one star to bring the rating down as a whole.  I pre-ordered this sight-unseen based on other British productions of Jane Austen which have at least striven for authenticity.  Watching this version of Persuasion was truly horrible and my copy is going into circulation as a used version to keep people who don't know better from buying directly from the producers.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|Fun, funny, energetic, joyous, witty, positive, and hopelessly optimistic. It also has a wonderful message about differences, tolerance, and acceptance - of others as well as yourself. I dare you to not smile, laugh, and tap your toes to the music!

B000EMGAGW|2.0|This album was just not the sound I was expecting from Mobb Deep even if they did sign with G-Unit. I miss that Infamous, Hell on Earth sound. I guess its gone forever. I know you can't duplicate an album like \\"The Infamous\\" but did it have to come to this? I wasn't expecting another \\"Infamous\\" or \\"Hell on Earth\\" but I wasn't expecting this either. I'm starting to think it's true what people have been saying for a while, that since Jay-Z took a shot at Mobb Deep they've lost their fire. The only songs on this album that really stood out to me were Put Em In Their Place, Speakin' So Freely and Click Click Click. The rest were average to garbage. I've been a Mobb Deep fan since \\"The Infamous\\" album and I own almost everything by Mobb Deep. I actually had high hopes for this album after hearing the J-Love \\"Mobb Misses Vol. 4\\" mixtape. That whole mixtape was classic, raw, dark, grimey Mobb Deep. This album is commercialized, weak and production is sub-par. This album is not on par with older Mobb Deep albums and if this is the direction that they're going I guess I'll just have to enjoy their old stuff. If you're an old school Mobb Deep fan save your money and buy the \\"Infamous Archives\\" double cd instead. It has classic previously unreleased tracks with Havoc's signature sound and P's original flow. Most of them you might have heard on old mixtapes. At least it's the classic Mobb Deep you'll always remember. You won't be dissappointed with it. Peace.
B000VSBX34|4.0|'Help!' was released about a year after 'A Hard Day's Night' (HDN), but the growth of the group is evident. The story revolves around a strange cult that must scarifice the wearer of the 'ring'. Unfortunately, Ringo is that person. Let the fun begin!    While the story is a little weak, the music and laughs are great. It was still a time when the lads were still enjoying the fame. John's humor, that we saw in 'HDN', is still present.    The songs are great and have developed from the songs in the first film. It is sad (as a previous reviewer stated) to think that not long after this film, things begin to change in the group and the world. It is also very sad to think half of this great group has been lost.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|The third installment of the Spider-man franchise again has our hero fighting bad guys and trying to advance his relationship with Mary Jane while trying to keep his identity a secret. The new wrinkle in this is that he is exposed to an alien life form that starts to change his personality. That's all the story I am going to divulge.<br /><br />Is it worth watching? Yes, especially if you are a fan. Is it as good as its predecessors? It depends on what criteria you use to judge but I thought it fell short of 1 and maybe even 2.<br /><br />The experience on Blu-Ray was terrific. It looks really detailed and sounds very good. There were some areas that really worked the subwoofer and all five channels. I watched it in 720P on a 55 inch LCD rear projection and my sound is only Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1. Even with these compromises it looks and sounds great.

0316113077|2.0|The cookbook has beautiful pictures, quite well done and the pages are a nice glossy finish.  That's why I gave it 2 stars.  Otherwise the recipe content is very lacking.  The recipes don't seem accurate to me.<br />I tried making the red velvet cake and after adding 2 cups of oil and a 1 1/4 c. of buttermilk it was just a wet mess.  There was 3 1/2 c. of flour but something just wasn't turning out right.  I wasted a lot of money on this recipe because it also calls for 1 lb of sugar! ouch, quite pricey to just dump in the garbage.<br />The other recipe I made was the white cake and baking for one hour was a bit too much.  I wish I'd read the other reviews first. And the chocolate cake tasted like grape cough syrup.<br />If you're thinking about buying this book, check it out at the library first.  Unless you're a professional baker the cost of these recipes and all the costly colorings, baubles, and such you'd have to buy you're better off just calling a professional from the start!<br />Don't recommend for the mom with kids, there weren't any really cute cakes for kids.  These were cakes/cookies in the shape of slippers and purses, and you needed 8 pounds of fondant!  geez.
0143038419|1.0|I could not make myself finish this book.  Not only is the author self-absorbed and annoying, her narrative is BORING!!  In her book, Gilbert states that she can make friends with anyone . . . her ex-husband and anyone who spends more than 30 minutes with her might have to disagree. I could only suffer through about 100 pages of whining, complaining and neediness before I closed the book.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|I was so excited to watch another BBC version of what is my favorite Austen novel but what a disapointment it was. The actors don't quite fit with the characters and it seems that all of the humor of the book is lost in this movie. The changes at the end and the running through the streets were just too much for me. Save your money on this one.
045146110X|5.0|As I liked the previous installations of this series I like this one. It feels both exciting and realistic to me, which is rare. It has a different tone than the previous books because the machinery of war and politics isn't there (much). There is none of the sense of a nearly inevitable horror, where there isn't really any side which seems to be right or wrong, but only people doing their jobs and people trying to be good or people being \\"bad\\".  This book is about the \\"good\\" things of war: trying to take care of your mates be they men, women or dragons and trying to do the right thing without caring too much about how much does it cost to you.
1594489505|5.0|I read A Thousand Splendid Suns having just finished Kite Runner. I would like the opportunity to live life again (who wouldn't?), if only to have a chance of reversing the order of this experience. I suspect tat had I read A Thousand Splendid Suns first then none of the criticisms I raise about the book would even have been imagined, let alone expressed. A Thousand Splendid Suns is a wonderful book, a compelling and gut-wrenching story of two women, Mariam and Laila, who share a husband throughout the years of Afghanistan's tragedy and turmoil. The fact that Khaled Hosseini can sustain expression, narrative, emotion and interest across two novels with ostensibly similar themes in the same territory is testament both to his supreme skill and the depth of the country's despond.<br /><br />Where Kite Runner tells the story of two boyhood friends approaching maturity, separating and reuniting, A Thousand Splendid Suns presents two women who are forced together by arrangement. As in Kite Runner, Khaled Hosseini presents ethnic and social class differences as the givens of the story. Similarly, Afghanistan's turbulent thirty years from the mid-1970s is more than a backdrop: it is the very substance of the idea, eventually revealed as the flesh on the story's bones, the driving force of circumstance that creates the inevitability of the characters' fate.<br /><br />And this is why I wish I could read both books again in the different order, because too often in A Thousand Splendid Suns I felt I had been there before. The backdrop came just too much to the fore, in some parts so much so that I felt Mariam and Laila became puppets of its detail and demands.<br /><br />That, I suppose, may also be part of the point. Whereas Kite Runner concentrated on male experience, A Thousand Splendid Suns focuses on women and, given what happened in Afghanistan over those decades, it may be that the sense of subservience to the turn of events is the very essence of these women's experience. Thus, it is almost true to say that they were not, themselves, protagonists. They were done unto.<br /><br />Mariam and Laila differ in age, ethnicity, birthright and social class. They both, and for different reasons, finish up unhappily married to the same man, Rasheed, older than both combined, brutish, bigoted and sadistic. Rasheed is thus a symbol for the traditional male role without declaring himself as such. In Western terms, we read this \\"tradition\\" as misogyny, however, and it is here where I find the book's weakness. In my opinion - for what it's worth, and not much at that - A Thousand Splendid Suns would have been an even greater novel had Rasheed been cast as a more liberal figure and had he also suffered as a result of his own conflict with the requirements of changing times. But Khaled Hosseini made A Thousand Splendid Suns from the women's stories and a more complex role for their husband might have deflected attention from them.<br /><br />The two women had quite different experiences of youth, and demonstrate quite different capacities to relate to others and even to life, itself. But they have enough in common to need to act together, to need to form a relationship, less than an alliance, more than acquaintance. Pragmatism might have been easier, but the two women develop a real bond, a relationship that shares out the pain, disappointment and unfulfilled dreams of their marital confinement. There is tragedy aplenty and ultimate resolution of a kind.<br /><br />And then it was the eventual similarity between Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns that prompted me to take my eye off the ball, to lose a little bit of interest in the story at mid-point. But if this is a criticism then it is an extremely minor one. As I suggested at the start, had I read the two books in the opposite sequence, I would probably have levelled my criticism differently. But having also said in a review of Kite Runner that I would not criticise the book for a lack of explicit position on the politics, I feel that in A Thousand Splendid Suns Khaled Hosseini ought to have said more about the status and role of women. Mariam and Laila live a tragedy, but they are also offered as icons for something bigger, which is women's position in the society at large. In A Thousand Splendid Suns I thus wanted the author to offer explicit comment on the plight of his characters, at least some general comment, even a dose of polemic to merely label absurdity. Alternatively, as I stated earlier, he could have made Rasheed, their aging husband, a little more complex, a tad more endearing in order to offer a source of the social attitudes without the need to justify them.<br /><br />But these are all minor points. A Thousand Splendid Suns is, in its own right, another supreme achievement by Khaled Hosseini and a further reminder to all of us that ideology imposed blindly can be a blunt and dangerous instrument.at in A Thousand Splendid Suns Khaled Hosseini ought to have said more about the status and role of women.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw the movie and immediately ordered the soundtrack. The music is so moving that I started to cry when I heard it again (1st time in movie).  It can be a bit of a downer though and so cannot listen to it all the time.  I highly recommend this soundtrack.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The movie itself is a masterpiece. I taped this off of TV on my VCR as a kid and wore it out. Errol Flynn introduced me to Robin Hood and then other larger than life stars like John Wayne and the two were the epitomy of their respective genres but both were the true pioneers of action adventure films. This is a personal favorite and I have to say quite possbily the finest DVD packaging ever. It is loaded with inexplicable extras for a film that is 70+ years old!!!! A MUST OWN for any movie fan.
0399230033|5.0|My two year old (26 mos) adopted from China just LOVES this book. As his grasp of English and French are too minimal to listen to long stories with a lot of words (he just wants to turn the pages faster than I can read), this minimal text storybook is just the thing for him. As an other reviewer noted, you can go through it quickly, or more slowly pointing things out etc. He is very observant and loves finding the mouse and banana, toys, slippers, the keys etc. As I have mimed and pointed out things, he now \\"reads\\" it to me, pointing out details, mimicking facial expressions, showing appropriate surprise (the zookeeper's wife), copying the gorilla's sheepish \\"discovered!\\" grin, miming the gorilla and mouse climbing under the covers at the end (with his hand under his shirt). He will bring this to me daily and have me \\"read\\" it three times in a row. Before this he wouldn't sit through more than a four-spread book without wanting to flip ahead. I highly recommend this for kids \\"new\\" to books, not just the suggested 3-6 yr old age .
0195170776|4.0|Disclaimer: I have not read this entire book ;-)<br /><br />This is a great dictionary and if you want a _real_ dictionary that you can put on a PDA then the combined package is a terrific deal.<br /><br />However... I bought this in large part for the software.  I saw a version of this dictionary for MobiPocket at $60 that I wanted to use to look up words while reading eBooks.  That seemed pretty steep.  Then I found this.  \\"Terrific\\", I thought.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the software does _not_ integrate with MobiPocket as the $60 version presumably does.<br /><br />Still, the software works well on its own, and I'm glad to have it.  However... There are some entries missing from the electronic version, such as \\"Saturn\\".  The definitions also suffer regular errors, such as the fact that alternative word forms are always run together with no space in between.  In addition, the hyperlinks don't work.  The application has also crashed once or twice and required a reboot of my device to get it to run again.  (The device itself did not crash).  The foregoing applies to Version 1.0 running on PocketPC 6.0.<br /><br />The print dictionary is a little disappointing at first glance.  It _does not_ include the word \\"euhemerism\\" and related words which _are_ included in my 1987 copy of \\"The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd Ed., Unabridged\\".  Sure it's an oddball word.  I don't buy a dictionary to look up words like \\"car\\" and \\"dog\\".  So I won't be able to get rid of my old dictionary, but it did include every other oddball word I tried so I won't have to get too much exercize getting out of my chair and power-lifting another huge dictionary.<br /><br />Despite the drawbacks, he book is of good quality (acid-free paper and all), contains a huge number of definitions, includes a PDA version far more complete than anything else I'm aware of, and the combination is a bargain at this price.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Most dramas resolve into a limited number of different plot types. This, to my knowledge, is new. The main character, evil and inhuman, but with good motives, has to outmanuver all the good characters--his friends and coworkers. This creates a dynamic I have never seen before, and it is pulled off by what I think is the best group of actors in any drama on television. In lesser hands, it could be either campy or over-dramatic. There are about seven really good actors on this show.
B000ERU5EK|4.0|A solid set of great tracks. You've probably heard some of it on A State Of Trance if you pay attention. Great vocals, great beats, you'll listen to this over and over and never get tired of it. I've probably already got 20 plays of Alone Tonight in the couple weeks I've had it. Truly fantastic stuff. All the tracks are mixed together nicely, the CD flows smoothly. There's a little bit of upbeat, and some slower songs; if you like trance, you'll love this.
B00007GZR5|4.0|There are already so many reviews describing the movie so i'll skip the synopsis and just get to what i think. I'd give the visuals a 4.5 out of 5 (based on the year this was filmed it was amazing and still holds up for the most part besides a few scenes here and there) and the colors and set designs are amazing. I'd give the plot a 3.5. Just take it all in as someone's view of the afterlife and of love and it makes for a pretty heartfelt, moving and unique story.

B000XA5K48|2.0|Let me start off by saying that from time to time I do enjoy a film that is light on plot and heavy on action and style. This film got the weak plot aspect taken care of and it DOES have a TON of action... but too much over the top action to even make it enjoyable for me (and i liked the first Transporter!). I wanted to enjoy this, i really did. I love Clive and Paul but they couldn't save this for me. The jokes and one liners were eye rollers and the action just too outrageous. I understand the concept but feel it was poorly executed. Come to think of it, i was rolling my eyes during all the action sequences too at how ridiculous it was. Some people enjoy that... i guess this time i'm not one of them.

It is compact enough to travel easily and helps me to stay focused.  While I have other journals, the ability to keep this one with me at all times, allows me to record my thoughts while they are fresh. Without a doubt I record in it on a daily basis. It is a perfect addition to my lifestyle.  I would highly recommend it.
0525950079|5.0|I've read around 6 previous Follett books, though not Pillars of the Earth. Enjoyed them all but this one is my favorite by far. Although it is long,  it is amazing that it never seemed to drag. I never had the feeling that there was any extraneous description I could do without.  It's absolutely amazing to me that an author could write a book this long with so many characters spanning decades and have the perfect touch for pulling all the details together in just the right way from beginning to end. It gave me almost a month's worth of enjoyment in my limited reading time and I was sorry it had to end.  Definitely going to read Pillars of the Earth now and can't wait!
1591841666|3.0|The sub-title says it all, in fact, for some, that may be all you need to read: when to quit and when to stick. That's Godin's simple message.<br /><br />Some may find it profound--the truth that some people quit too soon while others don't quit when they should. Given that we are all always told never to quit and that we are guilting into thinking that a quitter is a loser, the message is an important one for people easily swayed by common advice.<br /><br />\\"The Dip\\" is not a how-to book.

If you read it hoping to determine whether your dip is a dead end or a short cut, you'll likely be frustrated.<br /><br />\\"The Dip\\" is a motivational book that encourages readers to think long term before making the decision to quit or endure.

Music created by talented musicians and real, down-to-Earth people, the songs do not whisper, \\"life is good,\\" they shout \\"go live life!\\"

B00005JKHP|4.0|Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) with his crew (Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelly, George Takei, James Doohan, Majel Barret, Walter Koenig and Nichelle Nichols) joined by two new members like Decker (Stephen Collins), Bald female alien Illea (Persis Khambatta) as they take a new mission on their newly reinvented U.S.S. Enterprise. Their mission is to find a mysterious alien spaceship that has wiped out a few Klingon ships before it heads towards Earth and destroys it.<br /><br />A very good if slow start of the popular Star Trek film installment which is based on the timeless TV show of the same name. The original cast is reunited after 10 years in this film event of 1979 that made audiences believe that Star Trek can live again but in a motion picture, director Robert Wise and producer Gene Roddenberry does a nice job of bringing the show on the screen. Jerry Goldsmith's score is phenomenal as it later became the main theme for \\"Star Trek The Generation\\" and the special effects were good for it's time especially the production design, yes it doesn't have much action like it's sequels but rather more on atmosphere.  But this brand new cut really improves on the film itself with remastered sound and never before seen footage plus newly remastered special effects, it still is a good beginning for the franchise as it's sequel is even better.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent picture and sound with nifty extras like three retrospective documentaries, interviews, Teasers and Trailers, TV Spots, 5 additional scenes from the 1979 theatrical cut, 11 Deleted scenes from the 1983 TV version, Storyboards, and a promo for \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\".
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Watched the pre-aired pilot about 6 months ago thought to myself wow this show rocks. Watched the aired pilot, plus the 2nd and 3rd eps (Gnotith, The Turk) and it just keeps building on the story line I look forward to monday night so I can catch the next new episode. This is one of the few shows out that I can see myself watching for years to come. All I can say is a big frell ya and a boooooooooooooya
B000TERHD0|5.0|This CD, from start to finish is addictive.  If it's not playing in my stereo it's playing in my head. Smart, witty lyrics, Annie's BEAUTIFUL voice, the unusualness of it.  I've recommended it to several friends who have thought like 99% of those who have reviewed this CD on Amazon..simply amazing.   A \\"gotta have\\" CD if I ever get stuck on a deserted island....

0618918248|2.0|I ordered this book almost right when it came out, and with all the hype I was hoping for something special. Don't get me wrong here, Richard Dawkins is an intellectual giant, and a great scientist, but I prefer authors like Harris and Hitchens to him anyday. I think Dawkins would do best if he stuck to evolution, and leave religion alone. Shane Lindsley, author of Enemies Among Us
B000P12LWY|2.0|As soon as I heard about this series, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD  since I'm not a Showtime subscriber. What a disappointment it has been.    The historical inaccuracies are annoying but forgivable. My biggest concern with this version of Henry is that JRM plays him in a way that makes the character very unsympathetic and unlikable. This Henry is only arrogant, obsessive and cruel. Does he truly care about anyone? There is very little vunerability or true kindness ever shown. Without showing a more multi-faceted, complex character, it's very hard to care how things play out for Henry and his court. If not for the other characters, the costumes and photography, this series would be not be worth watching.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Great Movie!!! I love Al Paccino   He is the man!!!  Great Actor!!  I adore him.
B000HT3PPG|4.0|Awkward, formulaic, even leaden at times: there's just something about the sentiment in this movie I can't resist.     This isn't a great movie, but it's a good one. The very premise -- standing up to common sense at a time of the year when we want so much to believe in the inherent goodness of people -- can get you right where you live if you're willing to give yourself over to it. Edmund Gwenn and (a very young) Natalie Wood help us to do just that.     The rest of the cast is a bit stilted, but it just doesn't matter. Besides, the 90-second screen debut of Thelma Ritter would make any movie a gem. (Naturally, she manages to do in those 90 seconds what most of the cast struggles to do in 90 minutes: make us believe that what we're watching could be real.) A great story, some great performances and a truly great sentiment.
B0009X7664|5.0|I remember several years back watching one of those AFI \\"Top 100\\" shows, this time relating to the top 100 heroes and villains in film history.  It was easy to predict that Hannibal Lecter would be the top villain.  But as the countdown progressed, I wondered who would be the top hero.  My personal film hero has always been Atticus Finch, but as the Superman and Indiana Jones characters were being named in the final few slots, I didn't think the AFI voters would agree with me.  I was genuinely surprised, and very, very pleased, that the top film hero named was, indeed, Atticus Finch.<br /><br />I then started to think why it was I considered this character a hero, because certainly in Atticus Finch's mind, he wasn't doing \\"heroic\\" things.  He defended Tom Robinson not to be looked upon as saintly or holier than thou, but because he wanted to set a good example for his children -- and, very simply, he thought it was the right thing to do.  I think Atticus Finch's quiet devotion to his children, and his belief in doing what was decent and right in his life and profession, made this character a hero in my eyes.  As an attorney, I think often of Gregory Peck's summation in the film when I'm preparing for a trial.  I always find it inspiring.<br /><br />This is a film I revisit at least once a year, and it never ceases to move and inspire me.  Harper Lee must have been so proud.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Northanger Abbey is in my opinion the funniest of Jane Austen's novels.  Written as an intentional parody, it is lighter fare than her other works, with still enough social satire for it to be thought-provoking as well as entertaining.    I was nervous about seeing it adapted for the screen.  I haven't seen the old versions because of there overwhelmingly bad reviews, but as I loved and read the book, I felt that it would be very difficult to adapt for the screen.  As someone else mentioned, much of the humor is in Austen's wonderful narration and frequent side comments to her readers.  Also, the work is a parody of two genres not well known anymore:  the \\"innocent girl enters society\\" novels of writers like Frances Burney, and the original Gothic novel as typefied by Anne Radcliffe.  Even for readers of the book, it is disjointing when the parody switches genres halfway through when Catherine leaves Bath for Northanger Abbey.    Luckily, the film adaptors handled it masterfully, disregarding most of the parodying of Burney-type works for a consistant ribbing of gothic fiction played out in Catherine's over-acted fantasy scenes based on the novels she is reading, which also serve to familiarize the modern viewer with the genre being lampooned.    The only serious problem is roles Catherine is romanticizing in her fantasies.  Catherine seems to fantasize about her abductors and captors, giving excited and inviting looks to the imaginary robber as he fondles her gold necklace, and grinning rapturously at her prison guard before fainting into his arms.  This is not what Gothic heroines do, at least not the one's Catherine idolizes.  What they seem to have missed is that there were two genres of Gothic fiction going on at this time.  In Anne Radcliffe's books, the books that Jane Austen actually shows Catherine reading, rape and seduction constant threats, but are never successfully perpetrated, or at least never on the main characters.  Villains are never glamorized, and in fact exist only to put the heroines in situations from which they need to be rescued by their real love interests.  Their popularity stemmed from the \\"savior-on-a-white-horse\\" fantasy.    At the same time, books like \\"The Monk\\" and \\"Tom Jones\\" were being written by a different set of authors, in a different style, for a different audience.  In novels like these, the villains are the main characters, raping and seducing their way through the novels in scenes described in intentionally erotic and provocative language.  Though the characters are punished in the end, there are definite elements of sadomasochism, and no nice young lady would let herself be caught reading them.  These two genres are sometimes called the \\"female\\" and \\"male\\" Gothic, because the more innocent novels were often written by women with female protagonists and aimed at a female audience, while the gender was reversed in the second type.  (It is unknown how many women read works like \\"The Monk,\\" but we have evidence that there were a lot more men reading works like \\"Udolpho\\" than society perceived.)    Jane Austen would never write a protagonist who would read such novels, nor one who would fixate her desires on her abductor rather than her rescuer.  In fact, John Thorpe's relish of \\"The Monk\\" and the fact that he would actually recommend it to young lady is yet another clue that he is not a good or proper young man, since he enjoys that book in the first place, and in the second, does not realize how improper it is to tell Catherine to read it.  Catherine is too naive to pick up on this, but Austen's readers at the time would have.    Not that this is something the movie should have portrayed (it's way too subtle and not really central to the plot), but it would have been much truer to simply portray scenes from the books she actually is portrayed reading and had her looking at the heroes with desire.  It's not true to the book, or the time, or Catherine's character, and seems a really cheap way to add edginess to what is among Austen's most innocent stories.    But it's a minor issue that only the over-educated would probably catch.  Overall, it's wonderfully written, skillfully acted, and beautifully shot.  The humor is note-perfect, and let me conclude by saying that I'm now even more in love with Henry Tilney than I was when I read the book, and that his actor not only captured his charm and wit perfectly, but is extremely nice to look at besides.
B0007XAWB2|5.0|I purchased this \\"Movie Tie-In Edition\\" of Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander to complete my collection of the 20-odd volumes that O'Brian wrote on the partnership of Jack Aubrey and Stephan Maturin during the Napoleonic wars and after.    I had read the original and was concerned that this volume might have more to do with the movie version than on the actual book. This an unfounded concern. Although the cover (and price) reflect the recent movie, the text is true to the original, except for \\"americamizing\\" the spelling of some of O'Brians english idioms.    The book is exactly what I expected and I recommend it highly to those who delight in getting their media entertainment from the written page and not DVDs, CDs, iPods or such like BS. If you enjoy the prospect of having a cohesive, well-written and well-researched series of historical novels to enliven your reading, this book and the series behind it are for you.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I truly loved the music with the movie is excellent.  I was very impressed of the singing of the movie stars.
B000G73UEU|1.0|Every rendition on this CD except the last one is horrible. It is a huge mistake on anyone's part to attempt to give new interpretations to these songs, because without Cohen's deep voice and boundless spirituality, these songs would be just words+melodies instead of poetry. Rufus Wainwright's voice is particularly disturbing.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out and watch it every christmas.  It came quickly and in good condition.
B000YA82F6|5.0|The fingernails her baby already has? The trashy receptionist at the clinic? Whatever the reason, Juno chooses to forego an abortion and instead joins the somewhat crowded recent movie ranks (Waitress and Knocked Up) of single women in unwanted pregnancies who decide to keep the baby.  And, as with those two movies, it's a choice audiences can be glad Juno made.      Funny, fast, clever and generous, Juno completely deserves its Oscar nomination for best picture.  Ellen Page, in the title role, is a big part of the reason.  Her Juno is smarter and wittier than most everyone around her -- and it's a tribute to the excellent underplaying ensemble cast that viewers understand that.  But when her scheme to have her baby adopted by a yuppy couple who advertised in the Pennysaver hits an unforeseen roadblock, Juno is sixteen again, lost as the control she has carefully and cockily imposed on her situation, herself, her parents, her boyfriend (Michael Cera, at his clueless sweet Arrested Development best) and the adopting couple threatens to unwind.  It's this blend of a child having to act like an adult, some adults acting like children, and -- occasionally -- adults acting their age that makes Juno both true and so human.  It's a great movie.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Zach Snyder's \\"300,\\" an adaptation of Frank Miller's glorious graphic novel, tells the famous tale of the battle of the Spartans against the Persians at Thermopylae.  This is not a historically-accurate rendering of the battle, but a highly artistic, surprisingly refined imagining of one of Western civilization's most cherished stories.    Virtually everyone knows the tale of the 300 Spartans, who stayed at the Gates of Fire to battle the Persian horde even though their death was assured. Even today you can see the stone memorial chiseled in their honor, with the Spartan King Leondidas' epitaph still legible.  Gerard Butler heads a strong cast - dominated by men, naturally - in this wild movie.  Flashing pecs and abs of steel, Butler personifies Leonidas - martial dignity incarnate.  Indeed, the poster for this movie gives away its a-historical bent - the Spartan warrior was a bronze-clad tank, not a whirling dervish of destruction.    But who watches a movie like \\"300\\" for historical accuracy?  Nobody with a brain, that's for sure.  This is a pure entertainment.  Ang Lee, in his commentary to \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\\" remarks that martial arts movies are like musicals, only instead of breaking into song, the actors beat each other up.  \\"300\\" is that type of movie.  The violence, while extreme and graphic, is poetic.  The Spartans wage war with their souls, and \\"300\\" captures that martial spirit.    A heavy-metal soundtrack may seem anachronistic, and a political sub-plot somewhat tacked on, but \\"300\\" remains a thrilling, chilling, mesmerizing movie that goes into the recordbooks as one of the top 10 action movies ever made.      Check it out.

B00005JPXY|2.0|The giant alien rips off the head of the statue of liberty from downtown manhattan.  Downtown Manhattan, and not ellis island.  The seemingly invincible giant alien/monster spews little clones of the arachnids from starship troopers which are not invincible.  Add to that the fact that the movie seems like it was filmed by a fish flopping around on dry land, and we have a movie.  The holes in time with no holes in story, the lack of story anyway, as the whole movie is based on character reaction, and the classic runny nose \\"I'm sooo scared\\" scene from the handheld camera, and we have a legendary source for bad-movie jokes.      Aside from all that, the movie was ambitious.  It was creative and outside the box.  It attempted to show power and emotion in reality as opposed to romanticizing a story, and it's use of effects of taping over a previously recorded tape was a nice way to add to development.      I say it's a completely bad movie, but it's still much more worth your admission price than several of the multiple oscar winners of the last few years.  The kind of movie they attempted here should be watched, and remembered for their ambition to make a good movie that doesn't follow the standard formula.  It shows that there are still good movies to come.  I did enjoy it.
B000TGJ8AS|2.0|Esta serie me encanta, pero en esta ultima temporada no vino ni subtitulada ni doblada al español y deseo saber porque y si en algun momento tienen pensado ponerla en venta con esta sugerencia. creo que al igual que yo, hay muchas personas a la espera de esto para conseguirla y tenerla dentro de su colección.  En ese mismo plan estan otras series que he estado coleccionando pero desde hace un tiempo solo aparecen en inglés. Quisiera que fuera como antes cuando uno podía conseguir estas series en el idioma deseado.
630463949X|5.0|Fleetwod Mac haven't changed, except to have become more 'real', and this concert shows that clearly.  There are just a couple of new songs, the rest are oldies but goodies, sung with more passion than their earlier recordings, the same but not the same, and very definitely better.
B000AL730O|5.0|Mr. McCartney never ceases to amaze me, he has some great music in this CD. i thoroughly recommend it!
0767812166|4.0|I never understood why this movie never hit the top ratings - despite it's mistakes (and there are a few) it really is thorougly enjoyable and almost believeable.  Jeff Bridges is just fantastic in this movie.    An alien spaceship enters Earth's atmosphere and us attacked by the USAF.  It changes course and crash-lands in a remote area a long way from its intended destination.    An ethereal alien emerges and finds its way to a nearby house, where it finds a lock of hair and using the hair's DNA makes itself into an image of the man the hair came from, the dead husband (Jeff Bridges) of the woman living in the house (Karen Allen).    The story follows the initial 'abduction' of Allen's character as the alien, now in human form, demands that she get him to his destination within two days, or he will die.    As they drive they begin to understand one another better, and initial terror is replaced by understanding, then affection, then love.    In several places the directing was lacking, some of the lines were far too corny for the movie, and there were several bad takes that should have been done again.    But the movie is captivating and the story is wonderful, and Jeff Bridges makes what otherwise could have been a bad movie into a very very good one.

B00006LI4S|5.0|This is one of those music DVDs that when it started I wondered if I had just wasted my money.  By the end, I wanted to hear it again, and again.  There are a couple of flat spots, but mostly this is an absorbing and interesting concert, and it keeps finding its way into the DVD player.    Part of the appeal is that so much of David Gilmour's personality comes out.  He's a normal human being, and a nice one too.

B00001U0DP|5.0|I just watched the film for the first time and I have decided that I will purchase it and watch it from time to time.    A romantic film mixed with great humor in the good times and the bad times of the Nazi War Camp make it an exceptional film that is very different. It is  filled with joy, laughter and tragedy which make it very emotional.    I can't believe the people that knock this film because of displaying humor in a Nazi War Camp.  I see nothing wrong with having some humor in a horrible situation.      Guido displays a great zest for life.  The humor in this film makes it great and I love his devoutness and love that he has for his wife and child.

0743486285|5.0|The Heroin Diaries by Nikki Sixx is an awesome book and took my breath away. I read it within 3 days and was amazed that Nikki Sixx is still alive and kicking.

B000WCBPOG|4.0|The Across the Universe soundtrack is a very good example of what a talented director can do when given the proper time and money.  The music is shown in a manner that is very ostentatious, but deserves its place as a proper musical soundtrack.  And while the album is good, it lacks I WANT YOU (SHE'S SO HEAVY) - Dana Fuchs, Joe Anderson, & T.V. Carpio, and it is also missing WHY DON'T WE DO IT IN THE ROAD - Dana Fuchs, and while Dana Fuchs singing is not very pleasant to my ears, as I was not a huge fan of Janis Joplin, those songs are two heavy omissions from what is otherwise a perfect deluxe soundtrack.  And while I would be remiss if I did not state how excellent some of the tracks are, like WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS - Martin Luther McCoy, and I AM THE WALRUS - Bono & The Secret Machines, there are some faulty and so to say lame songs on the album.  But for those two mentioned songs alone, I would buy this album as I believe Martin Luther McCoy's version of WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS is better than the original.  Overall I am satisfied with my purchase
038572179X|2.0|I don't know why I bought this book when I didn't like Amsterdam either.  I guess I'm just not the Ian McEwan type. The characters do not engage me, the \\"details\\" feel like filler.  I basically skimmed the book to see how things turned out for the main characters & was done.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|With the enormous success of Arcade Fire's debut, \\"Funeral,\\" there would be a lot of success if the band's sophomore release would live up to the magnificence of the previous release. After listening to \\"Neon Bible\\" I believe the answer is yes. \\"Neon Bible\\" can be described in one word: Huge. Not because it's a long album but because the sound of the band and the vocals is just Huge with a capital H. Arcade Fire offers us a huge spectrum of colors and sounds in the orchestration of this album. The listener is assaulted with guitars, organs, strings, toy pianos, glockenspiels, brass and on the penultimate tour de force that is \\"No Cars Go,\\" a full orchestra supports the band. It's a listening experience that raises your heartbeat and your body temperature.<br /><br />The production is also clean and more polished than \\"Funeral\\" and so the sound is more amicable to my tastes at least. While the band's debut is amazing, the sound quality is a little fuzzy, whereas \\"Neon Bible\\" offers a crystal clear sound that has as much substance and density as a Powerbar. Win Butler's vocals also seem to be a lot more controlled on this album than Funeral, which is an improvement that I welcome with open arms as the vocals on Funeral were the thing that hindered me from seeing it as the masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />The lyrics make beautiful poetry. Just look at the lyrics for the opening track \\"Black Mirror\\" and you'll see what I mean. I love it when there are lyrical elements that tie an album together and \\"Neon Bible\\" has this consistent thread of religious imagery and water imagery throughout the whole album. As for what the lyrics are trying to say collectively as an album, I can't say. The lyrics themselves are quite subjective and obscure, but this makes for an even better listening experience in some ways as the album's meaning becomes a personal part of each listener.<br /><br />Arcade Fire has done a great job. It makes me incredibly excited to hear the next album. Because if they can surpass this, somebody better be standing by to give me mouth to mouth.ss this, somebody better be standing by to give me mouth to mouth.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|\\"American Gangster\\" is a powerful film.  The cast is exemplary and wonderfully led by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  It has been apparently overlooked for Oscar nominations and this is both a surprise and a mistake.<br /><br />The film is set in the late sixties and early seventies and covers police corruption in the exercise of drug enforcement in the New York City area.  The apex of this corruption is Frank Lucas, as played by Denzel Washington, who is a smooth but thoroughly brutal importer of heroin directly from the golden triangle.  He distributes favours and skilfully supports a web of personnel based mainly in Harlem.  He manages to largely slide under the radar until he is spotted in ring side seats at the Ali versus Frazier fight in Madison Square Garden.  How is this \\"no one\\" able to have such a seat?  Who is he?  It is at this point that his world begins to unravel.<br /><br />The forces for law are led by Richie Roberts, played by Russell Crowe, who is an apparently incorruptible cop based in New Jersey.  He is relentless in his pursuit of Lucas even though this has personal consequences.  In the end, he gets his man.  He also manages to implicate a vast swathe of his fellow law enforcers.  Lucas's network extends far and deep.<br /><br />I found this film to be absolutely enthralling.  It moves languidly until interspersed and confronting violence drags the viewer's attention back to the forces at work.  Washington and Crowe are great in their roles.  The support cast is commendable and the soundtrack is powerful as it evokes images of the late sixties and the era of Vietnam against which backdrop the film evolves.  I can thoroughly recommend this film.
B00006F2TV|5.0|I'm not a comics fan (though I used to be), but I took this video out of the library's collection, and I'm glad I did.  You don't even have to be familiar with the original book to appreciate it, though if you are, you'll see immediately that the scriptwriters have been careful to remain true to it while still updating it for the 21st Century.  What's more, it retains the angsty and sometimes dark flavor for which Marvel has long been famous.  Hero Peter Parker starts out as a nerd--a science whiz who serves as the butt of jokes and small-scale bullying by the more conventionally popular boys in his high school (his only real friend is Harry Osborn, whose father Norman has long served as his own substitute dad), and whose lifelong object of worship, Mary Jane Watson, hardly knows he's alive.  Then, on a class trip to the Museum of Natural History, he's bitten by a hybrid spider that has been exposed to \\"the largest electron microscope on the East Coast,\\" and overnight develops astonishing powers--his vision normalizes, he gains superhuman strength and speed, he's able to sense approaching danger and to shoot sticky webbing from ducts on his wrists.  At first he uses these abilities with little thought, but when his beloved Uncle Ben is killed by a carjacker while waiting for him (unaware that Peter had signed up to \\"spend three minutes in the ring\\" with a notorious wrestler in hopes of winning $5000 to buy himself a car), he realizes that \\"with great power comes great responsibility,\\" and remakes himself as \\"Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,\\" a sort of one-man vigilante force who strikes out at muggers and purse-snatchers, rescues people from burning buildings, and arouses the ire of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson.  Meanwhile Norman Osborn, desperate to save his high-tech company, has exposed himself to an experimental process intended to create superhuman powers--and it has, but with terrifying side effects: he becomes the Green Goblin, an airborne mischief-maker who soon realizes that only Spidey has what it takes to stop him.  For some time Osborn doesn't even realize what his new alter ego is doing, and when he does he's terrified, but a move by his Board of Directors to force him out brings all his latent negative personality to the fore and he becomes the Goblin consciously too.  Yet there's still hope for him: his final words to Spidey are \\"Don't tell my son!\\"    Of course, the best part of the film are the effects, which are splendid, especially the sequences in which Spidey is seen swinging through the \\"topless towers\\" of New York by his webbing.  Yet the complex storyline and carefully studied and developed personalities of the major characters (the only one whose motivations aren't very well explained is Jameson, who seems to hate Spidey just out of sheer ill temper!) give them an added dimension that will make the movie enjoyable by more than just the classic teen-and-twentysomething audience.  Old-time members of the Mighty Marvel Marching Society will delight in its accuracy, and strangers to the Marvel Universe will be provided with a tight and fascinating introduction to it.  This is a DVD I'll be adding to my permanent collection as soon as I can.
B000002NHN|5.0|Both this album and The Visit are amazing. While every song is good there are 2 that are truly exceptional and haunting - Dantes Prayer and Skellig - never get tired of them.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This is easily one of the strongest indie albums of 2007.  The lyrics are subtle and thought provoking.  Singer Matt Berninger's deep baritone sounds like one more perfectly played instrument in the band.  His voice and the rest of the band are beautifully unique.  Their music is oddly beautiful - never odd simply for the sake of being odd.
0393324818|5.0|Mr. Lewis observes that the persistence of Sacred Cows and inaccurate thinking in a market as lucrative as MLB has sobering implications. The reader is encouraged to reflect on the likely discrepancy between his own perceived and actual value in the workplace.      Billy Beane's story of redemption adds to the evidence that Baseball is indeed the manliest and most heartbreaking of games. A good read, especially for a fan.
0805086846|5.0|I read the book a long time ago and was really happy when I found it at amazon.It is a very good story about how the west was really won and the crimes and the shames of how it was done.
0394826817|5.0|This book represents a childhood favorite of both my children.  It is no longer available in book stores, so I was delighted to find used copies available so that I can buy it for my new grandson.  So far I have been telling him the stories just from memory, but the original is priceless.  We especially adore the \\"Pig Will, Pig Won't\\" story which teaches kids to have a positive attitude.  The Pig Won't character is a wonderful example of what NOT to be, and is also great fun to imitate while reading the story.    Who will buy this book?  \\"I will,\\" says Pig Will.      \\"I won't,\\" says Pig Won't.    So Pig Won't will miss all the fun.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|I purchase the three complete recordings of Howard Shore's TLOTR trilogy, and all i can say is that the top of my movie music collection. Esplendid masterpieces that have received a well deserved de luxe treatment editions. I wish that the John Williams's STAR WARS scores received the same type of editions, but i'm afraid that will not happen, at least soon enough.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|A seriously great mix. Can't stop jamming to this beat. Small complaint though, don't know whether it's Amazon's fault or the USPS's fault. My jewel case came in cracked and broken, but the CD was just fine. Put some emphasis in product protection Amazon, so USPS won't break things!
1592289444|5.0|This book could be read fast but I took my time to contemplate what it was they went through. I followed the path with Google Earth and found the  landscape forboding. The story is totally believable as there are some people that think they coulndt cross the desert. You have to realize that when in a concentration camp where water is rationed, your kidneys adapt to conserve water, this served their purpose while trekking accross the GOBI. As for the bs about how his records couldnt be verified, bla bla bla; I dismiss this as KGB style disinfo.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Blade Runner was an excellent movie to begin with in 1984, but the revisions on the newest version are visually beautiful, as well as the sound tract.  This movie gets a two thumbs up!!!
B00005JPXY|4.0|Quite possibley the most disorienting blockbuster I've seen in recent memory, [[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]] man JJ Abrams makes a movie that is one part 9/11 response, one part Japanese Monster B-Flick and a final part [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], then slaps it with the nonsensical title \\"Cloverfield.\\" I have to admit, I've been wanting to see this ever since the viral trailer of the Statue Of Liberty's head flying along the NYC streets first hit the web. And while the movie is pretty darn good for what it is, the hype may have crippled my expectations.<br /><br />The first 10 minutes are an introductory send-off party for Rob, put together by his galpal Lily and brother Jason. Rob's bud Hud is given a shaky videocam to gather testimonials and work up a sweat over Marlena. All his rather self-absorbed friends cluster in the apartment for a late-night booze-up and to spout off bad dialog. Seems Rob's being promoted to some hotshot VP position in (he heh) Japan, when his girlfriend Beth shows up and it's made clear she is about to become an ex. Just as Rob is pouting about crappy girlfriends blowing him off, a very Japanese monster crash lands in Brooklyn with a such a clatter, so everyone rushes outside to see what is the matter. The aforementioned Statue Head goes flying and, before you can say World Trade Center, a collapsed building has our vacuous party-goers (with Hud still holding the camera) fleeing a wall of debris racing up the street.<br /><br />So just like those old 50's B Movie Monsters of old, \\"Cloverfield\\" substitutes a creepy lizard for our anxieties about creepy Islamofacists. After being forced to watch these yuppie wankers party for about 20 minutes and not giving a rat's beak about them, the movie suddenly kicks into high gear and never lets up. Since everyone else here has griped about the single camera theory, I'll add my two cents. It Was Not Necessary. I mean, even the less expensive DV's these days have stabilizers. However, the racing-up-the-street shots and the subway tunnel piece add to the panicky, claustrophobic nature of \\"Cloverfield,\\" as does the stumbling comments by our remaining four bewildered would-be rescuers. Seems Rob got a call from ex-Beth, he's feeling valiant in the face of danger, and he somehow manages to convince Hud, Lily, and Marlena to follow him on a rescue mission.<br /><br />That is the plot, in a monster-shell. Hud dutifully films away and cracks bad jokes, but the humor does help blunt the sharpness. The effects - aside from the Dramamine Camera Work - are pretty stunning, too, like the apartment buildings crashed into each other that our rescuers are forced to scale. The military battles are crazed and frenzied, and the mini-monsters that drop off the Mother Monster are inventive. The Monster itself is given added bonus points for being more scary by NOT being seen, then when Hud finally gets a good look at the creature near the movie's end, it really does shock you.<br /><br />The ending was a bit corny, frankly. The Coney Island underlying recording seemed contrived in a movie that is already all about the gimmick. Along with the dizzying camera work, it's the sole other bum note in a movie that nails its genre desires right on the head. By keeping \\"Cloverfield\\" to a very taut under 90 minute running time (take out the cuss words and this would have been a Sci-Fi channel movie of the week), it drags you along for the thrill-ride and stops just before you get tired of its one trick filming style. By then, you're tabulating the influences and trying to backtrack, which made this a satisfying if somewhat unfulfilling movie for me.eet shots and the subway tunnel piece add to the panicky, claustrophobic nature of \\"Cloverfield,\\" as does the stumbling comments by our remaining four bewildered would-be rescuers.

B000EWBKKI|1.0|I just received this title on Blue Ray together with another Warner Bros titles, and all i can say, comparing Warner releases with this ones is: Lionsgate, if this is all you can do with high def. titles, leave it; please. Because this version looks far worse than the Artisan Extreme Edition current dvd edition. A movie like this can't be released with so poor sharpness, so much grainy picture; making that the menus look far better than the movie itself.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I've been listening to this CD just about every day since I bought it the first day it came out. It sounds better every time I put it in my CD player. Every instrument is perfectly clear to my ears.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The detail is amazing. Sound and picture quality is phenominal! I often wonder how the camera person gets the footage they capture. It really helps you to appreciate how incredible our planet is and that there is so much more to this world than just our back yard. A must have for any DVD library.

I have a class waiting for these books.
1594481717|4.0|Our Future: Left or Right?     Before now, it was acceptable to succeed in life using only math and science skills.  In Daniel Pink's book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, he discusses the differences between the logical left side of the brain versus the more creative right side. However, he explains that in the ever-approaching Conceptual Age, we must learn how to tap into our more creative mind in order to succeed in the future.  In order to combat the abundance of the same products, outsourcing to Asia, and the instant gratification of computers, we must think more creatively to assure that we do not become an accessory to this extinction.    Pink believes that there are six senses that we must adapt into our everyday lives and careers in order for this to occur; Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning.  Due to the fact that you cannot purchase a simple toilet bowl brush without taking into account how well it will match the décor of the rest of your bathroom, design has become a major part of our economy.  Pink feels that facts will not teach the masses anymore; He believes there must be a story as well in order to catch the attention of the reader.  For example, at the beginning of each chapter in this book, he tells a story about his or someone else's life to make a point and keep the reader interested.  And to tell the truth, it worked!  There was never a moment while reading this book that I ever got bored or started to daydream.  Pink related everything to my life and brought it to my level of speaking. When it comes to outsourcing jobs to Asia, Pink believes the solution lies in symphony.  We should have more skills so that we are more valuable than those overseas that can perform only one job.  Empathy for others will make us more humane to others, a quality that computers certainly do not possess.  As important as it is to focus on our work, Pink feels that it is equally important to expand our minds by playing aswell.  In one of his examples, Pink explains how doctors that spend a few hours a week playing video games perform better in surgery.  Lastly, it is vital to search for meaning in our lives.  As Pink explains as the last sense \\"People have enough to live, but nothing to live for; they have the means but not the meaning.\\"  What is even better about knowing these senses, Pink provides you with a \\"portfolio\\" at the end of each chapter giving you a multitude of ways and techniques to enhance each of these aptitudes in our everyday life.          This intriguing book is written for the everyday person.  Pink's ideas seem unorthodox at first, but his many examples put everything he says into perspective.  His writing is clear and concise.  Each of his examples flow right into the next and is written as if you were having a conversation with him.  It's friendly and funny at all the right places and not boring at all.  I would recommend this book to everyone I know so they can know what to expect and how to prosper in the ever approaching Conceptual Age.
B000YA82F6|5.0|Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), 16, a high-school junior and proud misfit, becomes pregnant in a why-not moment of boredom one autumn afternoon by her somewhat nerdy best friend Paulie, who she calls by his last name, Bleeker. She doesn't quite believe it when she realizes, only after an ocean of Sunny Delite and three pregnancy tests, that she IS, in fact, pregnant; her snappy conversation with the nosy and slightly-creepy pharmacist establishes, however, that she finally has accepted the reality and that now she must do something about it.<br /><br />Her first move is to call the person I would really style as her best friend, Leah (Olivia Thirlby), and recruit her into helping her face the problem. It helps to know that these two are actual best friends off-screen; there is undeniable ease and trust between them, and they go about working out what needs to be done. An early visit on Juno's part to an abortion clinic is, well, abortive; she runs full tilt out of the building and, with Leah's counsel, decides to find the right young childless couple looking for a baby.<br /><br />The manner in which this 16-year-old girl goes about such a serious matter is a joy to watch. She is initially flummoxed by the problem (\\"the sex was premeditated, but not the pregnancy\\" she tells Leah), but once all the votes are in, she accepts complete responsibility and forges ahead. The scene where she tells her parents - a sweet, slightly daffy couple played by J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney - shows that she is willing to do whatever she has to to see that everything comes out right for all concerned. Having her best girlfriend back her up in everything is great to watch as well - as is the fact that her parents, while not happy about the situation, do not fault her for it but stand by her all the way.<br /><br />An earlier reviewer styled this a man-hating film, which I do not agree with. I see it more as a young girl who marches to her own drum facing a bump - you will pardon the pun - in the road of life with pragmatism, humour, and dignity; not turning on the father of the baby, but still including him in her life (if not the decision about the baby); and coming out remarkably well. Kudos for all the performances - everyone did a magnificent job, including the would-be adopters of Juno's baby, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman (hard to think of him as grown-up, somehow). I highly enjoyed this movie.th pragmatism, humour, and dignity; not turning on the father of the baby, but still including him in her life (if not the decision about the baby); and coming out remarkably well.

B000PY52EU|4.0|Upon first seeing previews of Black Snake Moan, I honestly didn't know what to think of it.  Seeing a scantily clad Christina Ricci chained up in the house of Samuel L. Jackson is certainly eye opening enough, but beyond it's exploitation-esque gloss, Black Snake Moan is a surprisingly heartfelt and even touching excursion from Hustle & Flow writer/director Craig Brewer.  Jackson plays Lazarus, a down and out blues musician whose wife has just left him for his own brother, while Ricci plays Rae, a trailer-trash nympho whom Lazarus finds beaten up and left for dead after a wild night.  Realizing the girl has some serious problems, Lazarus chains her up in his house for her own good in an effort to save her soul, and in the process, save his own.  What makes Black Snake Moan so good are the performances from Jackson and Ricci, as two lost souls who receive a form of healing that neither would have expected.  Also worth noting is pop-star Justin Timberlake, who turns in a surprisingly good performance as Rae's Iraq veteran boyfriend who comes home in search of her, and gets quite a surprise indeed.  Despite its lurid presentation, Black Snake Moan is a surprisingly heartfelt story of blues and redemption that is more than worth seeing, and the fact that the film manages to stay with you after the credits roll is what's most surprising of all.
B00005LK95|5.0|I love this movie, it reminds me when I was a good. It's an oldie but a goodie! =)
0439882826|5.0|My 7- and 4-yr-old grandsons grab this great Star Wars book as soon as they arrive, right after Grandma hugs.  It's not just an ordinary pop-up book - each page has multiple smaller pop-ups in addition to the the big one in the center.  They each tuck into a small corner for safekeeping.  The grown-ups are equally enthralled with the engineering of these wonderfully imaginative creations - how they expand, then fold up so neatly.  You even get a peek at Darth Vader's evil face before the visor clamps shut!  COOL!
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|This DVD ran cleanly and should be rated 5 stars.  The movie was beautiful and action packed.  The story was fascinating with magical characters.  The ending to the story really helped the movie to be fantastic.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have been a fan of JM from 2003 and he is one of my favorite artist. First time I discovered him in TV in a one evening...was playing music video \\"bigger than my body\\". I loved that song and started to find him on the Internet.     I got \\"Heavier Things\\" CD form local store and after few months got \\"Room for Squares\\" from Amazon. And This \\"CONTINUUM\\" was great and it shows he becoming more and more matured with great lyrics. It has some of song's live versions are awesome. He is incredibly great on live concerts. One of my friend call him, john Mayer will be a next generation's Eric Clapton. I heard MP3 Downloaded version but definitely going to buy this CD. I see 100% great of him and no down side. Go on JM...These are my favorites of CONTINUUM...    Waiting On The World To Change  Belief  Gravity  Vultures  Stop This Train  Dreaming With A Broken Heart  In Repair  I'm Gonna Find Another You
1416523359|2.0|Yes folks! I've done it! I have read every single page of Lisey's Story by Stephen King, one of my favorite author... If you go through the reviews about this book, you will see that I'm not the only one who had a hard time finishing Lisey's Story. The book seems ENDLESS! The story is weird although the main idea of a writer's widow on a psychological quest about his husband demons is not completely silly. The first hundred pages are horrible, boring and hard to follow. Numerous flashbacks and a secret language between Lisey and her husband brings the reading to a high level of subtility. If this is your first \\"King\\" please do not rate the author on the basis of your appreciation of this book! Check for his early era writings, most of them are great reads and page-turners.     If the book would have been 300 pages shorter, maybe I would have given it 3-4 stars for writing quality and originality. But obiously King was taken away in a weird autobiographical phase !
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Today there are roughly twice as many people working in the field of public relations as there are journalists.  To some that might be seen as a disturbing trend.  So one side of the health care issue in this country you have the armies of PR people and high powered lobbyists working for the pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies.  --Legions of individuals that are paid to convince you of the \\"evils of socialized medicine\\" and the superiority of the U.S. system.  On the other side are a handful of journalists and Michael Moore, and most of the American people.<br /><br />Michael Moore's film begins by saying that the movie isn't about the millions who aren't insured, it's about the millions who are insured and their stories.  You'll see insured people battling insurance companies for lifesaving treatment-- denied coverage because it was deemed \\"experimental.\\"  Stories of volunteer workers that worked in the rubble on 9/11, who because they were not on the government payroll did not received insurance benefits, now suffering for chronic breathing conditions.  Michael Moore also looks at the comparative benefits of systems of universal healthcare in Canada, England and France.<br /><br />From a film making standpoint, this is Michael Moore most beautiful film to date, the photography is absolutely wonderful.  The pacing is good, never dull.  And like all of Moore's films, it will make you laugh and make you cry.<br /><br />There has been much controversy and criticism about this movie, as is the case with all of Moore's films.  People have said that he portrays the Canadian and European systems as perfect, when of course they are not.  So if you're really looking for a detailed reviews of their systems, buy a book on it.  The intent of the movie is a detailed review of our system, and the potential benefits of a universal system.<br /><br />The other point of criticism, as usual, is that Michael Moore doesn't stick to the facts.  That, I suppose, is probably a matter of judgment.  My experience with Michael Moore is that he does his homework, his information comes from sources.  Some in the mainstream would argue that his sources aren't reputable, and he would probably argue the same about mainstream media sources.  If you really want to know which is better, you'll have to look them up and decide for yourself.  Don't go by your gut, be skeptical of everything.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone of any political affiliation because it's a darn good movie, and that, I think, should transcend politics.  Like it or not, this film has succeeded in bringing health care into the forum of debate and it will be up to the American people and the politicians they elect to decide what's right for America.ience with Michael Moore is that he does his homework, his information comes from sources.

0375424474|5.0|Shubin joins the ranks of the best science popularizers with \\"Your Inner Fish.\\"  A cross-disciplinary romp, from arctic fossil beds to genetic laboratories, Shubin shows how the human body carries within evidence of its simpler beginnings.  Along the way you'll discover that dolphins have the genes to make odor receptors--but that the genes are \\"broken\\" because smell conveys little survival advantage to an air-breathing animal in the sea.  That drinking makes us dizzy when alcohol invades the gel in our inner ear, creating a vertiginous lava-lamp-like concoction.  And that \\"lotsa blobs\\" can be a useful scientific term.  A lot of fun, the book still requires a little work, but the patience is well-rewarded with rich insights and provocative ideas.  No one can walk away from this book believing that evolution is anything like a \\"theory in crisis.\\"  There was a fundamentalist book several years ago subtitled, \\"From Goo to You by Way of the Zoo.\\"  Shubin deftly and entertainingly demonstrates that this attempted insult not only contains elements of truth, but disgracefully misrepresents how awe-inspiring an understanding of the evolutionary process can be.  Highly recommended.  Would make a great companion volume to Carl Zimmer's \\"At the Water's Edge,\\" which shares a similar reverently giddy tone.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|This is a great step and great CD. Sound Quality of the CD wasn't  great but acceptable. Admirable step both Metallica and San Francisco Symphony as everyone knows these two are too hard to combine with. But they have done it and I loved it so much. Already I watched it over and over.    Down side of this concert for me was the song \\"Nothing else matters\\". I think they haven't good enough with that song. It is all time great song of Metallica and it could have been batter. That's the only reason I rated this CD four star.
B000002G87|5.0|There's a reason people consider Layla and other Assorted Love Songs a classic album.  It's because it IS!    The album has a variety of moods and is mostly a songwriting album, and for those of you who are sick of hearing the song \\"Layla\\" on radio stations all the time, you should check out the album anyway, because there's a lot more here to enjoy besides that same overplayed song all the time.    I love Clapton's singing on the opening track \\"I Looked Away\\".  Really emotional singing style with a brilliant vocal melody.  \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" is thankfully no longer a radio staple, which means the song still remains fresh and will continue to remain fresh as many times as you feel like playing it.  \\"Keep on Growing\\" features some excellent guitar soloing that really proves the album has some variety, since the first three songs are drastically different from each other.    \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\" is a powerful slow blues rocker.  It's not boring either.  I like the lyrics too.  The lyrics are exactly what you'd expect, packed with some emotions to elevate it WAY above average.  \\"When you finally get up on your feet again, everyone wants to be your long lost friend\\".  Amazing!  Some of the guitar soloing near the end is quite fantastic.    \\"I Am Yours\\" is just a really nice song.  It stands out in a positive way, just being so simple and pleasant.  \\"Anyday\\" is a big WOW song, because the vocals and guitar playing is really sweet.  \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad\\" is the same way.      The final song I want to mention is \\"Key to the Highway\\".  It's a stomping blues track that's not really anything like the other blues number on here (the \\"Nobody Knows\\" track I mean).  It's a really good song.      Just buy the album already!

0974872407|4.0|Debo admitir que sus prol&iacute;ficas p&aacute;ginas no me defraudaron, me recrearon a placer sold&aacute;ndome a la trama, hoja a hoja. Sin embargo opino que el final se extendi&oacute; mucho en finales de corte soso e innecesario. La novela debi&oacute; terminar en la p&aacute;gina cuatrocientos cincuenta y cinco; hay que dejar ese misterio irresoluble a la imaginaci&oacute;n del lector, cada persona se identifica con los personajes a trav&eacute;s de sus propias experiencias personales, pero Ru&iacute;z Zaf&oacute;n desnuc&oacute; esa posibilidad con resoluciones rosa al estilo novelesco de televisi&oacute;n. Este trabajo ten&iacute;a potencial para una trilog&iacute;a que bien pudiera cuajar, alg&uacute;n d&iacute;a, en versi&oacute;n para Hollywood, o algo por el estilo. Hubo tambi&eacute;n ciertos personajes que promet&iacute;an ser muy importantes al comienzo, pero que luego no desarrollaron nada y fueron irrelevantes a los protagonistas principales y al relato mismo, como fue el caso de Clara y de su t&iacute;o Barcel&oacute;, por citar algunos. Tiene tambi&eacute;n varios errores de ortograf&iacute;a, pero el error garrafal de decir que Bogot&aacute; est&aacute; en Venezuela, deja mucho que decir de las pruebas y supuestas correcciones por parte de la poderosa editorial Planeta, sencillamente imperdonable. Posee di&aacute;logos extempor&aacute;neos y ciertos anacronismos, durante la ambientaci&oacute;n se comieron bastantes \\"sugus\\", pero tengo entendido que estos caramelos no llegaron a Espa&ntilde;a sino hasta 1961. Asimismo pienso que hubo una excesiva descripci&oacute;n del clima Barcelonesco, demasiados cielos grises, demasiados vahos, neblinas y humos azulados por tanta lluvia, tanta humedad y tanta penumbra. Por lo dem&aacute;s me gust&oacute; mucho, buena idea desarrollada, trama intrigante y divertida. Cumple con la misi&oacute;n de entretener. La recomiendo.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since I was 10.  Haven't missed a tour since 1986.  So I guess you could say I am a devoted fan.  However, I claim to be unbiased.  Some of their work has been forgettable.  A handful of Rush albums are notably below par: Rush, Caress of Steel, and Presto; and the last three studio albums: Test for Echo, Vapor Trails, and the silly EP of 60's tunes.  I expected more of the same this time around.    Well, this album is beyond my expectations.  I like every song, which I haven't been able to say since 1986's Power Windows.  This isn't the second coming of Moving Pictures, which is a timeless classic, but the songs and performance are both extremely good.    Geddy Lee's vocals have improved.  Not only does he sound excellent on Snakes and Arrows, but he was just slaying these songs live.  After seeing them so many times, I noticed a big difference this time around!    I have some objections about the sound of Snakes and Arrows.  The mastering is awful.  It's one thing to compress audio to maximize volume, but most of these tracks maxed out the limiter and the result is a chopped off square waveform.  There are better compression techniques!  Some tracks have other digital anamolies.  I think the equalization is OK, but it's artificially warm (post-processed).  Somehow it's listenable, but I wish Rush would concentrate on making an honest recording, and hire better engineers to achieve it.  They haven't had a superb sounding album since Counterparts.  Rush has not had consistent studio engineering since Terry Brown was producing, and it's a shame.    Back to positive things, I like the subject matter of the songs.  The thinking man is thinking about war and religion, and this is a timely thinking man's album.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|You know, before I bought this album, I was looking at the song titles.  \\"A Love Supreme\\", \\"Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord\\" and \\"Meditation\\" gave me the impression this was gonna be a very mellow album with lots of grooves and atmospheric sections.....    I was WAY off!  This is a VERY LOUD and INTENSE guitar-dominated rock/jazz album!!!    When I found out my favorite guitarist John McLaughlin and my other favorite guitarist Santana played together on an album in the early 70's, I was extremely happy!  These two guitarists together can only create extremely impressive results, and that's exactly what happened.    I have no idea why neither Santana or Mahavishnu Orchestra fans hardly ever mention this album.  It's really an interesting, exciting, and extremely heavy listen.    1. \\"A Love Supreme\\" really showcases BOTH musicians talents.  It has a slow and mysterious groove in the background from Santana, while McLaughlin is laying down possibly some of his greatest moments as a guitar player.  A really great track.      2. \\"Naima\\" reminds me of that one classical song from \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" (which is another masterpiece album that you MUST own).  Despite the fact the two songs use different instruments (the one here in an acoustic track) the two songs are written in the same way.      3. \\"The Life Divine\\" continues the underrated intensity of McLaughlin with a fairly lengthy guitar jam, while other parts sound like they'd fit in perfectly with Santana's \\"Caravanserai\\" album (ANOTHER classic album).  I also love the way the chorus repeat over and over behind some amazing guitar playing, giving the song a hypnotic feeling.  Excellent.    4. \\"Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord\\" is nearly 16 minutes long, and it's about the craziest rock jam you've probably ever heard in your life.  Anyone who makes the mistake in thinking 70's rock is old and dated and doesn't stand up today in terms of purely rocking out, well, I have news for you- this song packs anincredibly severe punch that not even Deep Purple or other bands would be able to pull off.  Wow.  I can't say anything else about it.    5.  \\"Meditation\\" is just a short harmless jazzy piano song that ends the album nicely on a mellow note.      Overall, Santana and Mahavishnu Orchestra fans MUST own this great forgotten gem.  Guitar lovers everywhere- buy it NOW!!

B000V6BE6M|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Peter Jackson's magnificent trilogy (especially the extended editions) knows the power and majesty of Howard Shore's epic score. The first two film scores have been released over the past couple of years and I was trembling with anticipation when the full, extended score for \\"Return of the King\\" was announced as being ready for release. Except you could only get it in the States. So, onto [...] I hopped and ordered my copy.  I picked up my parcel from the Post Office yesterday and immediately put the first of the 4 discs into my stereo. I was always a little bit disappointed with the original soundtrack release - mainly because the tracks  were not in the order they appeared in the film - but all these doubts were swept away as the music poured from my speakers.  From opener \\"Roots and Beginnings\\" through to the sweeping \\"Lighting the Beacons\\" and the climactic \\"Crack of Doom\\", Howard Shore weaves themes from the first two movies along with fresh and powerful new ideas.  The overall effect is mesmerising and a little exhuasting. But in a good way.  Anyone who already owns the first two complete scores cannot miss this one. Anyone who doesn't...well, give the \\"Fellowship...\\" one a try. Then BUY THEM ALL!!!

B000002VCQ|5.0|This album  came out when I was just a baby. I remember it vividly. I love all her songs, but the greatest love of all brings tears to my eyes and I still love the song. She was just 21 when it was released. This cappulated her to where she is today.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|This is by far the best special edition of any movie ever. There are all the different cuts of the film each with commentary tracks. After you are done watching the bonus features you will know more about blade runner than you ever thought possible. The only downside to the collection is that disks 2 and 4 (the making of and bonus features) are standard dvd and not blu-ray. The advantage of this is that if you have an upscaling player you can at least upscale to 1080 unlike the special features on Pirates 2 which were on a blu-ray disk and therefore unable to be upscaled. So not perfect but at least you arent forced to watch special features in 480.
B000JJRIP2|2.0|Had this been done earlier. For instance, if none of their albums weren't ALREADY available and they were just now releasing them on Disc. But since the \\"KISS\\" albums for the most part were already re-mastered way back in '97 up to \\"Crazy Crazy Night's\\" anyway, there really wasn't any need for this box set save for the re-master of \\"Alive 3\\" & the unreleased \\"Millennium\\" concert. Just another part of the M-O-N-E-Y game, the all mighty dollar. Sure, this is a great place to start, if you're just getting into KISS, but who didn't already have everything in this box set except the \\"Millennium\\" concert? If they'd just finished re-mastering the catalog where they left off at and released the \\"Millennium\\" show separate, that would have saved alot of people some Money and also we would have had the rest of the albums re-mastered.
B0002BO05S|5.0|I just saw this film for the second time yesterday. It remains one of the most engaging, wondrous, and sublime artistic endeavors that I've ever witnessed. Yes, the way the film was shot is nothing short of amazing. With its grand sets and distant frames it gives one the sensation of being transported back in time. Von Sydow was an unlikely candidate to play Jesus in my mind, but here he turned in one of the most memorable performances in history. All of the transcendence, authority, and goodness of which we imagine Christ to have possessed are exuded by his character.<br /><br />The Greatest Story Ever Told remains highly entertaining, but, more importantly, it renews one's faith. The scripture that makes up so much of its dialogue was truly inspiring and gives a spiritual shot in the arm unlike what we can find anywhere in the self-help aisle of a bookstore. We live in times where the only things that are seemingly important are finding better ways to stimulate and please ourselves. Here we are reminded that there are far more essential things in life than food, drink, accumulating stuff, and having fun. It is a most timely message as is the notion that perhaps our lives were not supposed to be easy. The Lord did not make His earth a comfy chair...and we would be wise to thank Him for that. If you need some uplift put this disk in your the DVD player.

0446607274|5.0|[[ASIN:1432708155 The Margin]]<br />I took a short hietus from Connelly's mysteries in favor of Stuart Woods. I like Woods and plan on reading all his work, but recently completed Michael Connelly's Angel's Flight and had to write this review.<br />AF is another well researched police procedural. Mix Harry Bosch, and his down to earth crime fighting perspective, as well as authentic social events of the decade and you have the makings for a thought provoking, complicated mystery chuck full of the dark places we readers like to go.<br />Howard Elias is a successful LA attorney who made a name for himself filing and winning law suits against the beleaguered police department, mostly for excessive force during arrests of suspected criminals that happened to be black, Elias himself an African American.<br />Bosch is tapped to investigate this potentially volitile crime, although the murder didn't occur in his district. Why? Because his boss knows the cops are prime suspects and Harry's relationship with the rank and file is different, sort of a love/hate relationship. He didn't have many friends on the force, only a partner or two, and he didn't have many enemies either, but he did have almost everyones respect. A claim IAD couldn't make. This investigation had to be done right, no room for error. Bosch gathers his team and they begin the arduous hunt for the killer.<br />Don't start this novel at bed time, you might end up late for work.<br />Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin, a mystery.

My purpose was to read carefully through both, analyzing the arguments, and presenting my own objections to either in a written record.    I have not read far enough into either of the book to give an accurate review of the content of this book.     However, I would recommend that anyone who is interested in this book ALSO  download an mp3 of a debate that took place between Dawkins and Lennox.  You can find it online by searching \\"Lennox vs. Dawkins mp3 download\\".    It also wouldn't hurt to pick up a book on logic and debate technique too, because what I've read in this book so far has demonstrated more rhetoric than you'd hope to find from someone claiming scientific fact and truth.

B00005V0X5|5.0|When I was first looking to get into Megadeth, I decided to start with what many considered their best album: Peace Sells. After several listens, I determined that I simply didn't get why everyone loved the album. It wasn't terrible or anything, but aside from a couple of tracks it was totally unmemorable. That dissatisfaction was very nearly the end of my experience with Megadeth. Fortunately, I happened to find a $4 copy of Youthanasia at a used CD store, and wisely decided to give them another shot. After falling in love with that album, I quickly snapped up the store's other Megadeth albums (Countdown to Extinction and the bulk of what are generally considered their lesser recordings), and bought the ones I couldn't find there online... except for this one. The reviews I'd read seemed mediocre at best, I hadn't been impressed with Peace Sells, which had the same line-up as this one, and the fact that So Far, So Good... So What? was competing with Risk for the title of \\"least-favorite Megadeth album\\" made me think that perhaps their earlier stuff simply wasn't my thing. Still, the thought of completing my Megadeth collection was nagging at me, and after a month or two of resisting it I finally caved and bought this album.    Having now owned this album for quite some time, let me just say, I was an idiot to hesitate for so long. I have four main Megadeth albums that I listen to constantly: Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction, The System Has Failed, and this one. Of those four, this is without question the one I listen to most, although that's as much a function of its short running time as its awesomeness. This album is my standard \\"short\\" album selection when I'm listening to music, and competes with only two or three other albums for most played CD in my entire collection. It's a half-hour (I skip the rather pointless demo versions) of fast-paced, non-stop thrashy fun. The band is much heavier and more raw (which is not to say tuneless, which was one of my fears from the reviews I'd read) here than they are on any of their subsequent releases, and it definitely works to their favor. I can't think of a single track I dislike, and picking one or two favorite tracks is tricky because they're all so good. I suppose I'd have to say that overall \\"Loved to Deth,\\" \\"Killing is My Business,\\" and the phenomenal \\"Looking Down the Cross\\" are my favorites, but as I type this it's \\"Chosen Ones\\" (another exemplary track) that's stuck in my head.    Bottom line: if you like Megadeth, don't deprive yourself like I did... buy this album now.

1416523359|3.0|I am a King fan but I felt the writing in this book was uneven.  Part of the reason I am such a big fan is because I usually really like King's characters and find myself rooting for them even when they do things I don't like but I did not like Lisey until over halfway into the book.  Also, the fantasy sequences were uninteresting and far too drawn out.

Gone is the campy comic book themes from the previous films and instead we have beautiful and stirring music.    Hans Zimmer is one of those composers who always does a good job.  Batman Begins is one of his best.

B000VJ271A|5.0|Those looking for a traditional \\"Manon\\" had best stick to the Sills or Gruberova versions.  Anyone open for innovation and theatricality will have a marvelous time with this Liceu prodcution.  Robert Carsen and Willy Decker have made me wary of overtly reimagined stagings, but this is a brilliant take on a familiar old friend, combining music, dance and story theater into the kind of inspired spectacle that Peter Hall has made famous over the years.  Dessay and Villazon are as good as one could hope (as is Manuel Lanza as Lescaut), but remarkably, they're only part of the picture here.  Usually I find a lot of stage business distracting to my enjoyment of the singing (which is, arguably, the raison d'etre for opera in the first place), but in this case the goings on are such an integral part of the world that director David McVicar has created, that I feel it actually enhances what the singers are doing.  (And thankfully, McVicar knows when to cool it, calm things down and let the singers shine.)  Bottom line, this is a vibrant and imaginative take on a repertory classic that is both respectful and innovative, and a very welcome addition to the DVD choices out there.

B000A2H9BQ|5.0|I own all of John Martyn's albums and I would rank \\"Bless The Weather\\" as one of his best. There is a certain back to the roots feel to this disc; Martyn had yet to fully delve into his exploratory period of recording his guitar with the echoplex, and this album is largely acoustic. Martyn's playing is excellent throughout the album, his guitar work on \\"Head and Heart\\" is a mix of jaw dropping technical profiency and improvisational genius. In my opinion, Martyn was really coming into his own as a songwriter during this period of his career, and there are songs on \\"Bless The Weather\\" which are stunning. I don't think I have ever listened to \\"Just Now\\" one time without repeating it again, a beautiful and soulful vocal and piano and guitar arrangement. Martyn also duets with his wife Beverly on \\"Let The Good Things Come\\", which is another one of his best songs of a haunting nature. I would recommend this disc to any newcomer to John Martyn's music, it is some of his most accessible work and a great collection of songs and performances. Needless to say, if you are already a fan of his music and don't have \\"Bless The Weather\\", this is an essential purchase.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this set for my dad as gift and we watched the first DVD (of 5 in the set) together.  I'm not necessarily a fan of wildlife documentaries but I was immediately hooked.  The camera work is incredible - they get impossibly close to the animals and show areas of the planet that few people will ever see (like massive underground caves!).  I found it very humbling to see how incredibly violent the animal kingdom is and how much man (the top of the food chain) takes for granted. There are many scenes of animals being killed by other animals but that's the brutal reality of our world. Despite these sad scenes, I believe that this would be an ideal series for schools to show in Science or Social Studies class.      Dumb as this sounds, watching these programs has left me in a bit of existential turmoil.  My measly 80-year life span is nothing in the greater scheme of things and all the problems I experience through my life are mostly self-made or imagined. It's a daily race against the grim reaper in the wild; always looking over your shoulder for predators and spending much of your day seeking your next meal or drink of water.  Most of us who live in the developed world can't imagine this life.  We're damn lucky and this series really brings that home.  We take so much for granted.      I highly recommend this set and this price is great.  Enjoy!!
B000YENUI6|2.0|It is always an uphill battle to criticize a great filmmaker like David Cronenberg ([[ASIN:B000E1126G A History of Violence]], [[ASIN:B0009298N4 Dead Ringers]]).  Especially when he has two of the brightest actors around in Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts to work with.  But somehow Eastern Promises managed to be a disappointment for me and I'm quite sure my negative opinion of it will not be popular, so I will defend it as effectively as I can.  First though, let me provide a brief overview.<br /><br />Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) works at a hospital in London.  She oversees the death of a pregnant 14 year old Russian girl.  The child survives and Anna is left with the girl's diary.  It leads her to a restaurant owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a Russian crime boss.  Anna wants to track down this girl's family so she can find a safe place for the baby that survived.  Anna's uncle helps to translate the diary and they discover some key secrets regarding Semyon and his son Kirill's (Vincent Cassel) crimes against the baby's dead mother.  Kirill's sidekick is Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen).  Nikolai is enigmatic and cold but his potential has him rising quickly in rank for protecting the often irresponsible Kirill.  Obviously there are some key plot points that are better left unrevealed.<br /><br />The twists in Eastern Promises have been praised but really, place the film in New Jersey and make the gangsters Italian-Americans and sorpresa!, a predictable and formulaic mafia film.  Although, the twists are certainly worth keeping secret and many viewers will probably find them to be enjoyable, they didn't work for me.  I didn't predict them outright but it wasn't difficult to see the intentions that undermined each character and a twist seemed inevitable throughout.  I actually felt a twist or two looming over the film the whole time.  I also thought the major twist in the film's climax to be unconvincing altogether after it happened.  And it wasn't just the twists that seemed like an ethnic proud mafia film all over again.  The different cultural things Russian gangsters hold dear was no doubt an education to some but I was only a little interested and there is a scene at the restaurant were Semyon is enjoying some live music that was just too reminiscent of the tired clich&eacute;s repeatedly borrowed over the years from [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather]] and other such films.<br /><br />As far as the performances go, Viggo is great and so is his accent.  Naomi Watts has never been bad in anything she has done, even when she was [[ASIN:B000059H98 Jet Girl]].  I thought the remaining supporting cast was absolutely disposable despite what many others have said, and unfortunately I include Vincent Cassel here, who I really like.  On a positive note, Cronenberg's pacing is strong and he once again enlists his favorite cinematographer, the incredibly talented Peter Suschitzky, to help the film look great.<br /><br />Now, about the controversial naked Viggo fight scene.  Cronenberg definitely wanted this scene to stand out and it does, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.  Of course there is a double standard and that is almost forgivable, but if it were Naomi Watts in the naked fight scene the film would unquestionably have gained an NC-17 rating and earned a hardcore exploitation label right down there with the likes of [[ASIN:B0001LJCRU Ilsa the She-Wolf Warden of the SS]].  I'm probably guilty of adhering to the double standard too as the film might have received a higher rating for that.  Not to knock the authenticity of the fight scene though, it was certainly compelling and original.  I won't forget it for some time, that's for sure.  All in all, I'm taking the high road from the status quo here.  Eastern Promises did not work for me but it certainly may for some.eemed like an ethnic proud mafia film all over again.

Dark, beautiful and awe-inspiring, her ability to evoke feelings in the listener with her compositions as well as her voice is quite powerful.    Tarja's compositional style is more balanced between softer and heavier songs than hard core metal fans might like.  Their quality is superb in their own right, nonetheless.  When I'm in the mood for more hard core metal, there are other bands out there.  Some songs are very heavy and remind me of the old Nightwish, but overall the compositions sound like an epic fantasy movie soundtrack.    It is unfortunate that Tarja and Nightwish had to separate, and I still miss the combination of Tarja's voice and Tuomas' compositions.  But this CD is fantastic in its own right and, while a bit different, I'm very glad we got something this great in its place.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|What can I say to the fans of LOST??  It is one of the most intriguing shows ever created!  You miss so much during the show because you are so caught up in the drama, that you really need to buy the DVD's to go over the past season, to get ready for the next.  There are so many little things that I missed while the show was running, that I was able to catch on the DVD, for instance:  Did you catch the picture on the on monk's desk when Desmond went in to say goodbye?  Were you able to see Jacob in the chair while Ben and Locke were arguing?  You need the DVD's to slow down or pause, so you can catch all the hints!  Buy it, you will love it!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|We bought this and are sharing it with everyone who will watch it! I read a news article indicating that the government in Great Britan has distributed it to all the schools there so that every child will hear this message.  I think that's great!
1843104954|5.0|I think this book is a must for people involved with teaching or caring for Children. They will find that the knowledge gained from this easy to follow language, an insight into becoming better teachers and carers. Secondly for any adult who has gone through life knowing they were different, here you will find many answers.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|If you are a fan of Lost then definately purchase Season 3! This was the best season yet!
0385512058|5.0|Keith proposes a revolutionary new way of looking at networking and relationship management in general: giving freely, and openly, and asking for the same in return. According to the book, most people are surprisingly accommodating and receptive to this approach.    If you're looking for an overnight plan to becoming a master networker, magician manipulator, or overall hypnotist in the business world this isn't the book for you. If, however, you're interested in discovering what some of the most successful men and women in America (Keith included) have done to reach where they are today, don't pass by the opportunity to find out!
0618680004|4.0|The only other Dawkin's work I have read prior to this is The Selfish Gene.  I am beginning to for the opinion that Dawkin's is a rare form of writer.  He manages to tackle what could be rather delicate issues without coming off as a partisan loon.  Don't get me wrong he is clearly an atheist but he supports his decision with reason and with a minimum of mocking of \\"the other side\\" (a few jabs here and there but nothing egregious).  This is a well written book, and though I don't agree with everything he says (claiming religious upbringing is possibly more harmful than childhood sexual abuse may be a bit over the top, though he does at least attempt to back up his statement as opposed to just making the assertion and moving on like many are prone to do) he makes a lot of good points and if nothing else he forces you to think while reading.  Regardless of whether one is a believer or not if you read this book with an open mind I think you have to respect his position, even if you don't agree.  All in all I would recommend this book to believers, fence-sitters or dyed in the wool atheists.
B000063DHL|3.0|The band is eclipsed in their first album.  This album did not impress me much at first with not much singing as I thought there should have been.  When getting the album from cassette to cd I had renewed interest in the band and the songs had different meaning and seemed more classic metal than before.  The new line-up as I learned along the way had Bruce on vocals now and does a decent job but again it is nowhere near the consistency in terms of atmosphere and picture as Iron Maiden's first album.  The album cover and art is A+ and the music does compliment the original art and that I will give credit due. The long distance runner is a great song with open ended drumming and soloing on guitars that keeps in  best compliments with the original Iron Maiden structure.  I would say that is the best song on the album.
1593080255|3.0|This is a very interesting story by the immensely quotable Wilde.  It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed.  He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead.  This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable.  Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound.  Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person.  Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub.  He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake.  One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could.
B000063COX|5.0|There are no NWOBHM albums even close to this one.  The picture on this album for the time period is comparable to Black Sabbath's self titled album.  To me these are twin albums in different time periods both expressing consistent pictoral atmospheres to be heard.  Strange world is really all needs to be said and the flip coin runnin free is a must have classic drumming sequence and song.  The energy and vibe continues with sanctuary and the album is mirror sided duplicating energy on either side of the album with atmosphered effects on guitars.  The changes in phantom of the opera are none better in the time period unless like I have mentioned Black Sabbath in its self-titled album.
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|I love this show! Having the whole season on dvd is addictive...I can't stop watching epidodes once I start. I definitely recommend this product.
0143038419|3.0|I so wanted to like this book, given that everyone I know did. I borrowed it first, and gave up after Italy. There were just too many \\"on the floor of the bathroom sobbing\\" scenes, not to mention the number of times the author is \\"literally shaking\\" or \\"visibly shaking\\"--I can count the number of times on one hand this has happened to me, and it's been when I've had the flu, so I'm not buying this \\"literally shaking\\" bit. I then decided to try again and bought the audio book. Ms. Gilbert's voice, like her writing, tends to the overly dramatic (even the chapter headings are read with much angst if it's a particularly heavy chapter--check out the breathy, morose \\"four\\"), and her sibilant s problem really got in the way for me. The icing on the cake was her gross mispronunciation of the word \\"realtor\\" in Indonesia. It's \\"real\\" then \\"tor,\\" Lizzie, not \\"REElator.\\" Duh. Who edited this? Who directed this? But ok, I did enjoy Italy quite a bit, particularly the scene where she and Sophie eat pizza in the south. And India was interesting to me. I was desperate to finish Indonesia. Listen to your pal from Texas, Ms. Gilbert--\\"are we still talking about this topic?\\"
B000VAPZM2|5.0|This movie is so cute!! I love it!! I know I may be older than all of the general \\"popular\\" group it is intended for but since I saw the first HSM I knew I had to see this one!! I love the songs and the storyline is good too..
B000002G8J|3.0|Funny how some music you thought was so good at the time turns out to be almost forgetable. Thus is the case with this title from Eric Clapton. I'm a music junkie but even junkies reflect and reevaluate. I love his other titles like the stripped down [[ASIN:B000002MFE Unplugged]], the dueling guitar duet blues of [[ASIN:B000I5X81A The Road to Escondido]] and the superb  [[ASIN:B00065VTU4 461 Ocean Blvd. [Deluxe Edition]]] but this one doesn't have enough of what makes Clapton, Clapton. You know, smoky vocals, reminisent of old time blues players and guitar licks that have lots of feelings. This is not a bad disc but not one of his best either. It's like he's going through the motions on some tracks. Favorite tracks are few but here are a few  worth a drop to my (your) I-Pod. Here they are. \\"Roll It\\" features the guttural vocals of Marcy Levy that is straight out of the old r&b tradition, coupled with multiple sweet guitars and a driving , infectious beat that sounds like muscle schoals revisited; nice slide guitar too. \\"I'll make love to you\\" is vintage Clapton at his finest, simple lyrics, dark, brooding vocals that matches his bluesy guitar. For some straight up blues, try \\"Early in the morning.\\" This song sounds like circa 1950 Jimmy Reed, complete with harmonica and slide guitar, a down trodden sack-'o-woes bag of lyrics and you've gotta case of the blues. It has that \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" feel to it too as a bonus. If you want something melancholy but a little more poppy try \\"Promises.\\" It's a catchy tune , the type you want to sing along with after a few listens; it has  that instantly familiar quality. Good stuff. That's it folks. For die hard Clapton fans only. For the rest of us, try some of the aforementioned discs for your introduction to old slow hand.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|This movie is great. A group of guys gangbang rape a woman on vacation. Later she all seduces them to their gory ends. I loved the blood and gore and parts of this film made me laugh. I should not have laughed though, especially during the rape sequences. But I did.
B000YENUI6|4.0|An in depth intense look at the Russian Mafia. If you enjoy intense dramas like \\"The Departed\\" or \\"Donnie Brasco\\", you will probably enjoy this one. Several excellent performances. Viggo Mortensen is great as a driver for the mob that has a sketchy past. Although there is some bloody hardnosed intense moments it will still appeal to most members that enjoyed \\"The Godfather\\", which was not exactly truly family friendly either. The trailer gives a fairly accurate idea of what the movie is about. A mafia member rises in the ranks by killing people but may not be what he appears to be. Overall a great story, directing, acting, and music. Although I typically don't recommend buying dramas this intense, this is one of those that stand out like \\"Taxi Driver\\", and are a must have. Good DVD with good replayability.
B000005HCM|5.0|CLASSIC BLUE NOTE ALBUM FROM LEE MORGAN IN THE MID 1960'S.  EARLIER I HAD REVIEWED ANOTHER LEE MORGAN FROM THE 1960'S \\"DELIGHTFULEE MORGAN\\", AND DID NOT GIVE IT A GREAT REVIEW.  THIS ALBUM IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER, IT IS EVERYTHING THAT ALBUM IS NOT.  IF YOU WANT TO HEAR LEE MORGAN RIGHT AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME, THEN BUY THIS ALBUM, YOU WILL LOVE IT. GREAT JAZZ, WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A BLUE NOTE RECORD FROM THE 60'S. BTW, JOE HENDERSON IS AWESOME ON THIS RECORDING AS WELL, ESPECIALLY ON THE FIRST TRACK (YOU CAN HEAR A LOT OF COLTRANE INFLUENCE IN HIS PLAYING).
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I'm not a big fan of your typical zombie movie. When I heard about this movie coming out, I was interested, cause it looked like it added a humorous twist to one. I wasn't sure that could actually be pulled off, but when I finally saw this movie, I was definitely impressed. Hilarious. Hilarious. Hilarious. This is one \\"killer\\" comedy. I loved it so much, when \\"Hot Fuzz\\" came out, I had to see that too. I ended up loving that movie as well!! If you don't buy this movie, you must be living dead!
B000002GQL|4.0|THE THING ABOUT THE MOODY BLUES IS THAT THEIR MUSIC WAS JUST SO DAMN MELODIC, IF NOTHING ELSE.  THAT'S WHY THEY WERE ALWAYS ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO.  THIS ALBUM WAS THE LAST OF THEIR ORIGINAL SEVEN ALBUMS, RECORDED BETWEEN 1967-72, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE BEST AND MOST ORIGNAL PHASE OF THEIR RECORDINGS. I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, AND HAVE LISTENED TO IT A LOT OVER THE YEARS.  THEY WERE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE OTHER BRITISH ROCK BANDS THAT WERE AROUND AT THE TIME, NOT BETTER, BUT DIFFERENT.
B000RJO57I|5.0|It's not often a movie comes along that has a bit of every type of genre. In fact, I can't think of one! But \\"Hot Fuzz\\" has just that. Comedy, action, horror, suspense, and even a bit of drama. I mean, this movie has it all! I was a big fan of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", so when I saw this movie coming out, I HAD to go see it. I saw this movie in the theaters, and it was worth every cent. If you like great movies, you'll LOVE this one!! A must see!!
B00005B58Y|5.0|Hot Jazz; If you are looking for a second \\"Kind of Blue\\" album , then \\"Milestones\\" will disappoint. Also, if you are looking for some nice background jazz music while you have your dinner party this is probably not the album for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for an album that features five of the most talented musicians ever to play jazz, cooking on some really great tunes and playing together like they've been doing this all their life then this might be the album for you. This one does not contain (as one reviewer stated) the same lineup as \\"Kind of Blue\\". Milestones has Philly Jo Jones on drums and Red Garland on piano. This is an album you really need to listen to closely to appreciate.  Contains some seriously virtuosic playing;  A Jazz Tour de Force
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Am really enjoying this DVD. It was a gift for someone else, but something that I can share in too. I highly recommend it.    I was also very pleased with the fact that my order arrived in time for Christmas even though I initially made the mistake of ordering the HD version.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|My husband and I saw this at a I-max in 3-D.  It was amazing. Why can't we get a 3-D DVD. I would even pay extra for this feature.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I loved this album. I downloaded it the day it was released last fall. It is a very dynamic, smooth album that will please Radiohead fans. I hope that they keep it going.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|I am one of the low-brow types that liked the first theatrical release version. It had an entirely different feel to the move. The voice over explained many of the things that perhaps the director thought should have been self-explanitory. I think that Harrison Ford's flat delivery of the voice-over emphasizeed the idea the he was a burned out cop. I really did not get that in the non-voiced-over version. One man's trash is another man's treasure.     Although, I was not extremely interested in the other versons of the movie, I think that it is important to include them as part of the whole Blade Runner saga. I feel as if I got more than my money's worth in this
B00104W8T6|5.0|Saw this movie this past weekend!  Soo glad I did, it was SO good!  I expected it to be corny like Napolean Dynamite but it was so the opposite.  I honestly couldn't tell whether the songs were written for the movie or vice versa!  It was THE BEST POSSIBLE soundtrack to go along with this movie.  It created feelings that caused me to be completely immersed in the story.  It was wonderful all around.  Purchasing the soundtrack right now!  I agree with the last review, try and watch the movie w/o wanting to go out and get the soundtrack, it's impossible!!!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|A fantastic adaptation of Austen's novel, I originally caught the ending on PBS, went to YouTube to find the rest, and eventually had to purchase it when it came out on DVD. Imagine my surprise when I realized that the YouTube version was the original full version while the DVD/pbs version has some scenes edited out. I especially missed one scene where Henry, Eleanor, and Catherine go out apple picking. Overall I am happy with the adaptation I just wish I had known beforehand about the cut scenes. Perhaps I would've gotten the Region 2 DVD which I'm pretty sure is not cut.
0060763280|5.0|I bought 'Secrets of the Millionaire Mind' by T Harv Eker as a Christmas gift for my husband.  It sat on his bedside drawer for 2 days.  I thought I would just have a 'lil peek' at the introduction... and I got hooked!  Couldn't put the book down!  It was so good, I had to order another copy and both my husband and I studied this gem like mad!      It has changed our understanding of money and uncovered our deepest thoughts about how we felt about money and how we treated it.  We now have re-programmed our money blueprint and have new files to run from.  And now money seems to be running straight to us rather than away from us!     I see this as a Millionaires Manual to Success - all you need to do is learn and apply what Harv says in this book and you are half way there!  Harv shares some of the greatest secrets about wealth creation that people pay hundreds and thousands to learn - and you have it all here in one package!      If you are either fighting with your partner about money... or worrying about money... or ALWAYS in debt, maybe all of the above??? GET THIS BOOK!    It will change your life forever.
B000WC3864|5.0|After so many reincarnations (Book of the Dead, THX release, etc), this is the Ultimate Experience in what is known as the Evil Dead.<br /><br />My review is not about the movie. There are plenty of those already. This is a review on the latest release called The Ultimate Edition. With this edition, you get three DVDs chock full of movies and special features that should whet the appetite of any possessing demon that should come your way.<br /><br />DVD 1:<br />This DVD contains the widescreen version of the movie in Dolby Surround 2.0, Digital EX and 6.1 DTS-ES. It contains audio commentary from Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert. Also included is a 50+ minute documentary called \\"One By One We Will Take You: The Untold Saga of THE EVIL DEAD\\". This new special from Anchor Bay interviews the cast and crew of the movie and goes into such in-depth detail of how this movie was made. Do you think you know everything that happened? You may and you may not, but you'll definitely learn more with interviews with Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly and others from behind the scenes. The picture itself of the movie is as pristine as you can get it to be.<br /><br />DVD 2:<br />This contains the full screen version in Dolby 2.0 and contains the commentary from Bruce Campbell. Again, wonderful, pristine picture and it also contains a 59 minute feature of deleted scenes and outtakes entitled \\"THE EVIL DEAD: Treasures From The Cutting Room Floor\\". There is no commentary with it, but still, it's a wonderful introspective into the making of this film.<br /><br />DVD 3:<br />Wow. What can be said. This is just chock full of Evil Dead treasures that should keep you possessed. You have numerous features concerning the \\"Ladies of the Evil Dead\\". There are plenty of videos from conferences with the cast and crew, including a reunion panel, make-up test, trailers, TV spots, still gallery and more. Also included is a two-side poster containing the original \\"touched up\\" Evil Dead poster and on the other side is the original photograph before it was touched up. There is also an Easter Egg on the 3rd DVD that has a panel discussion after the movie was released in 2001 by Anchor Bay to a capacity crowd at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood.<br /><br />Overall, this tops them all as far as what it contains. It is well worth the price to own this Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror. It has swallowed my soul!e original photograph before it was touched up. There is also an Easter Egg on the 3rd DVD that has a panel discussion after the movie was released in 2001 by Anchor Bay to a capacity crowd at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood.

B000V6BE6C|2.0|I'm a huge fan of A7X, they are my 2nd favorite band right behind Metallica, but this album is the worst one by far.  Just listen to \\"Waken the Fallen\\" and then this album and you will be asking yourself \\"What happened?\\".  Now I know he had voice problems, but what happened to the hard and heavy of A7X, this self-titled ablum sounds too radio friendly. \\"City of Evil\\" was great, but this one is bad.  The only songs that sound like they could be on a previous ablum is \\"Critical Acclaim\\", \\"Almost Easy\\", and \\"Afterlife\\".  I know they were trying new things this ablum, but some fans enjoy the old things more.  Thats one thing I hate about some bands, they think they have to change their sound all the time, just stick to what you know, what got you there!
0714843377|1.0|Typographically interesting, but corny graphics. Just when I started to think \\"oh, this is interesting, what gem will he have to say on this?\\" he pulled the rug out and moved on to a completely different thought on the next page. I am not happy this man got my money, but commend him on the cover advertising that tricked me into thinking this was worth reading.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a wonderful ugly duckling/cyrano de bergerac fable about a talented chef who happens to be a rat. You might think that this would be an insurmountable handicap in the chef-business, but I can assure you that true ratliness would be a step up for a few in the profession. Anyway, the ratchef, Remy survives a series of threats to his life and comes to pursue the career for which he has such aptitude.<br />The animation is wonderful, someone obviously paid a lot of attention to how things happen in kitchens. The dialog sparkles and the message of triumph over prejudice doesn't get in the way of a taut little story. What struck me particularly was that this was a completely new image of fine food and the people who create it.<br />For years, the chef and the gourmet have been portrayed as snobs, boors, egotists and phonies. This is the first cartoon and one of the first films of any kind to take food and eating seriously and to respect both the talent and the labor that go into making them happen.<br />Pixar is also to be congratulated for showing the enjoyment of wine as part of the enjoyment of life and food. It's very rare that kids get to see images of wine being enjoyed-and delighted in-by responsible adults. It's no wonder that so many young people grow up with the idea that abstinence and drunkenness are the only ways to deal with wine and beer in their lives.<br />It's also a pleasure to see an awkward adolescent (Linguini) coming slowly into his own. Images like that are reassuring for kids-and indeed for many of us.<br /><br />A truly heart-warming movie and one that will make your mouth water.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of [[ASIN:0131186361 New Short Course in Wine,The]] and the watershed  [[ASIN:1601640005 bang BANG: A Novel]]
B000OONTFU|5.0|The Matrix in stunning high-def...what more needs to be said.  Excellent for any movie collector.
B000M341RI|5.0|There are now people who use the phrase `the full monty' who have never heard of, much less seen this witty, low-key film. The expression means `to do something completely and without reserve'. It originates in the story line: a group of recently-unemployed men in sooty olde England decide to form a Chippendales style dance troupe. Their plan, at the end of their act, is to remove the last velcroed jock-strap and expose `the full monty'.<br />The story line is crowded with the usual film tropes: relationships with family and friends are strained and tested. The men, initially overwhelmed by the decay of the industry that's been their livelihood gain strength as they take arms (and legs and torsos) against their sea of troubles. The men themselves are charming and their story is inspiring.<br />It is worth noting that \\"FULLY EXPOSED EDITION\\" is a canard. The ending reminds us just how daring their plan really is-it was too shocking to be shown on film.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of the totally revealing<br /><br />[[ASIN:1601640005 bang BANG: A Novel]]
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It has alot of vulgar language but that doesn't bother me any.  If your looking for a great mob movie or any movie I highly recommend and the high definition is quite excellent.
B000066AXE|5.0|There is not much more to say about this movie except that it is excellent. You may have to watch it more than once to really understand the seriousness of mental illness. Anyone that has any type of mental illness in their life-whether themselves or a family or friend will completely be able to relate to this movie. It is done beautifully, tastefully and carefully. Also a true story.
B000Q6ZG6G|4.0|I'm not sure how anyone can be a Kubrick fan and not LOVE this movie. The cast is great, and the plot is twisted properly. Anyone who says this movie is too long lacks the mental criteria to appreciate the Emotions, the Visuals and the Dialogue. The scoring of this film is quite good as well.      Kubrick combines the secret life of high-class elite, and the rawness of males guilty fixation on sex.    Anyone who can appreciate Full metal Jacket for it's unique realism, and can appreciate the edginess of A Clockwork Orange should be able to keep up, and/or love this film.
B000GFLEJA|5.0|One of Depp's best movies. He is really showing some insane acting skills in this one. A crazy journey from start to finish! If you were on lsd while watching a movie, this is how it would be :P
0938045695|5.0|Buy this book before buying a kettlebell or starting a kettlebell workout.  I know there is some good information available free on the web, but Pavel's book really gets into the mechanics and why something is good or bad with these unique exercises.  I wish I had this book before I got my kettlebell, as I may have bought a different size.
B000M3452Y|5.0|When I gave this record a spin, it was a sigh of relief.  I had noticed James Murphy as LCD Soundystem when I heard some of his superb singles that came out before his debut album.  Enjoying these singles a lot, I purchased his debut album and I was quite disappointed with the first disc (the new material), although the collection of singles on Disc 2 was worth the price.  I wasn't expecting much out of his second album, figuring that his flame had quickly burnt out after those first few singles.  Giving this album a spin, I was surprised that he could write such great songs.  I mostly enjoyed his long dance/rock freakouts but didn't know that he could write such brilliant pop songs.  This album is a surprisingly exciting listen.
B000VUDSH6|4.0|I got to this review page searching for when this movie was really made.    I considered JC's action scenes in Rush Hour III as an indication he was ready for the \\"Over-the-Hill Gang\\", and told myself Robin B Hood was dragged out of a Taiwan vault.    But I was sucked in by the hype on the box, and it did live up to it. The action scenes are reminiscent of earlier films, and it was good to see it was made recently.    Confusing? Absolutely, especially in the first half. Thongs, Landlord and Octopus' characters in the early action scenes segue not at all into some of the other first-half \\"personal\\" scenes. I had to rewind to connect Octopus to the early action scenes with the later scenes of him being a total jerk to his wife.  Is this that guy we saw earlier, dear?      But, I agree with another reviewer: this is not an American film. Maybe we are too used to characters and plots that follow steps 1,2 and 3.    In the end, I think the plot and character relationships were resolved satisfactorily.  Not perhaps to the standard of a professional thriller, but definitely beyond the expectations of a B-action movie.
1932100660|2.0|Its a bit hard to write a review of this book because I am not sure where to start. The title would be the best place, but that is where the greatest flaw lies. The title of the book talks about the China Study, unfortunately very little coverage is given to the actual study except to say how it was conducted and a brief review of the results. The rest of the book is filled with aggressive arguments for the reader to become vegetarian, moaning about the current state of nutrition, and talking about how great the author thought he was by receiving multiple grants. The argument for the conversion to vegetarianism dominated the majority of the available pages. The author cited journals but often used older journals and drew some quick conclusions. While its true that there were some good points in the book, I would suggest reading a condensed version on Wikipedia. That way you can learn about the research without having to hear the author talk about his friends and how great of a job he did in the oft mentioned but rarely discussed China Study.
B000089RV6|5.0|Back In Black is the greatest rock album of all time.. And it's the biggest selling rock album of all time with around 44 million or so in sales!! This is what you call a \\"killer with no filler\\" album because there are no bad songs on BIB!! Still after almost 27 years when it was released, it STILL sounds fresh and great. The same can't be said for most albums that came out at the same time!! New generations keep picking up on this album and that's one of the reasons it keeps selling and always will....If you like rock and roll you should already have this gem!! If not, then pick it up and start rocking!!! Long Live AC/DC!!!
1416550518|5.0|This was a book that I did not want to end.  It hooked me from the beginning and although some things might've been preditable, it DID NOT take away from the enjoyment of the story.  I will be looking for more books from this author.
B00008WT5E|5.0|Powerage is my favorite album with Bon Scott! Every song on this album rocks the house down!! \\"Sin City\\", \\"Down Payment Blues\\", \\"Gone Shootin'\\", \\"Rock N Roll Damnation\\", and I can't forget the 2 songs that will rock ANYBODY, \\"Riff Raff\\" and \\"Up To My Neck In You\\"!!!!  If you like AC/DC then you have to pick this up!!! YOU WON'T be sorry!!! Long Live AC/DC!!!

1895565375|1.0|My mother gave me this book this summer and I only read it once before I vowed never to open it again.  It stinks of everything unhealthy about a relationship my mother would love to have with me.  It supports an unbalanced, clingy, unhealthy and codependent relationship between a mother and her son.  I cannot support this book in any way.  I hope that people will think twice before exposing their children to unhealthy relationship examples such as this one.
B000053VAF|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of British Comedies (ex. the Vicar of Dibley) and yet I never thought an American Director could do such a classic job of creating a film that put such a comedic spin on religion in general.  This film is VERY well thought out and brilliantly directed.  I, myself, and well studied in theology, religions, and philosophy.  I just can't get over how well thought out this film was and how funny it was.  I HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who enjoys religious/anti-religious comedy.  Whether you are a theist, agnostic, or atheist there is something in this film for everyone!!!!  I give this film a 5 star rating.
B000W07EKW|5.0|The Jason Bourne collection is a trilogy of action movies that is more than just mindless action.  They each have their own genuine plots that combine into a giant three-act story, and the action sequences are more \\"real\\" than the gratuitous explosion-fest movie typically seen in summer release movies.    Also check out \\"Ronin\\" with Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno and Sean Bean for an action movie with a brain and \\"real\\" action.

B00009R6J7|5.0|One of the key issues when photgrahing panoramic views is making sure the horizon is level.  This is not always as easy as it sounds, so having this little gadget in your camera bag is a big help.  This is even more critical if you're plan is to take several shots and stitch them together where you'll want to ensure that the multiple photos are all at the same level and inclination.
B000MZHW40|3.0|While not a favorite of the African Tourist Board, Blood Diamond tells an important and violent story. The 3 leads are all good here but the images that will remain are the violent scenes, many involving children. The movie could have been a great one but gets hindered by 3 Hollywood cliches that find themselves in the plot:  1. While DeCaprio is good in his part, he does struggle with the Rhodesian accent. Aren't there a lot of real Rhodesians who would just nail that accent?  2. The 3 main characters are a diamond smuggler, a simple fisherman, and a young journalist. Yet they make more miraculous escapes than Superman, Rambo and Wonder Woman here.   3. The overall \\"Let's Blame America\\" tone of the movie. The movie cites America as the dominant consumer of these diamonds- HOGWASH. The fact is that the EU, the Midle East, and Asia are all major consumers of diamonds today. Gone are the days when the US was the dominant consumer of anything, except maybe lies that single them out for the blame. Even in 1999, when the movie was set, it would have been much more truthful to say that the US was one of many major users of diamonds.   In bringing the plight of Africa to the attention of the world, the movie deserves great credit but in loading down the story with typical Hollywood cliches and bias, I can only give it 3 stars.

B0009JAENU|5.0|I found, in this CD, one of the best performance for this Mozart's beautiful sonatas.  Hilary Hahn is, as usual, excelent with the violin.  Natalie Zhu a great partner with an excelent work with the piano.  As a great summary, this is a CD to enjoy.   Highly recommended.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This film is a dramatic snapshot of a bygone age, formula 1 at its rawest, these were the days before corporate sponsorships, car or track safety, when the death of a driver and to a lesser extent a spectator was almost accepted as part of the scene. There are no run off zones, tyre walls or armco here, just the occasional hay bale and serried ranks of telegraph poles. Set at a time when a driver could literally make their own car, bolt on an engine and have a realistic chance of winning. The story follows four disparate drivers as they compete for the championship, the stars as played by the actors are not too loosely based on real characters in F1 and the supporting cast is the real thing and as such may be forgiven the odd wooden line delivery. Graham Hill was a superlative driver, acting however clearly wasn't his forte.   The plot has been described as \\"soapy\\" and to an extent this is true in that it follows believable characters interacting in the arena of their choice. It's plausible, there are no conspiracies or villains (unlike the current F1 scene) to detract from the real stars and they're all four wheeled. The races are stunningly filmed without histrionics and the pre CGI nature of the film only enhances the excitement. People can tell the difference, reality is thrilling and computer generated fakery usually disappoints. This is the real deal and if racing cars are your thing, it's easily the best of its genre and shouldn't be missed. If you're one of those that don't get auto sport, you'd be advised to look elsewhere.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|Die Hard 4  DVD<br /><br />It's hard to believe that it's been twenty years since Die Hard first showed up at the theatres.<br /><br />The more violent, profanity-laden unrated version is included on this DVD so that we can watch the film the way it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />The first disc includes an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, actor Bruce Willis and editor Nicolas De Toth. Right from the get-go, all three men address the studio-imposed PG-13 rating thing and how they went ahead and shot an R rated version anyway. There are quite a few lulls as the three men tend to get caught up watching the film but manage to deliver a fairly decent track.<br /><br />The second starts off with \\"Analog Hero in a Digital World: Making Live Free or Die Hard,\\" a feature-length documentary that can also be viewed as 10 separate featurettes. Wiseman admits to being a big fan of the series, especially the first one, and this motivated his decision to accept the gig. Various other aspects of the production are covered in detail, including casting the main roles, set design, stunts, editing, visual effects, and sound. This is done in an accessible way that is entertaining and informative.<br /><br />\\"Yippee Ki Yay Motherf*****!\\" Filmmaker Kevin Smith interviews Bruce Willis in this fun, entertaining extra. Smith flat out asks Willis why he decided to do yet another Die Hard sequel. He admits that mistakes were made on the second and third films and with this new one he was more conscious about not repeating those mistakes. Smith asks good questions which Willis answers them honestly.<br /><br />There is a music video for \\"Die Hard\\" by Guyz Nite, a pop punk band. The song pays tribute to the Die Hard films with a montage of clips from all four films.<br /><br />\\"Behind the Scenes with Guyz Nite\\" is forgettable look at this rock band as they talk about themselves and their music.<br /><br />\\"Fox Movie Channel Presents Fox Legacy\\" takes a brief look at the Die Hard franchise, giving a little back story.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Bruce Willis fans and fans of the Die Hard Movies.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008theatrical trailer.      Highly recommended for Bruce Willis fans and fans of the Die Hard Movies.    Gunner  January, 2008

B0009P42S2|4.0|The strangest thing about Steamboy is not that it's amazing, but that so much of the original was missed by european audiences.  I saw the original uncut japanese edition at a film festival when it first came out - I was astounded to hear how much shorter it was-  to explain simply, the english version (hitherto released as the standard on DVD) cuts twenty (yes, that's right) minutes off of the end. Twenty minutes which actually make it a decent ending, as opposed to a pathetically predictable one for persons so stupid they can't take an original twist on standard three-act structural narrative directions.  But, back to the film. In essense the film blends modern animation - both 3d and 2d - better than any previous film, making possibly the most visually stunning animation picture ever produced, to date- you never stop to think, oh, that bit's 3D, because it never is obvious.  A skillfully developed storyline means that unlike other anime blockbusters such as Akira, it never feels that the action is forced into too small a length of time, or that the storyline falls prey to a predictable and long setup, which seems to be the norm for hollywood cartoon films (bar pixar's work).  The story is a parable of science, the pursuit of power, and why americans shouldn't have access to the world's latest technologies (I don't think Japan's quite over Hiroshima yet). At the end of the day, don't listen to some fat manga-head who insists that the film isn't up to scratch in terms of their cultural preconceptions of what Japan is 'all about'. Like any film, this should be appreciated in it's own right, and in that, it is splendid. One of the few watchable manga films in the world.  Best on the largest screen you have.    Now to the release itself. The 'Directors Cut' is, in fact, the original Japanese version, replete with original 20 minutes missing from the \\"standard edition\\". If you watch it in english, be prepared for some of the worst voice-acting in the history of cinema,as americans laughably try to pass themselves off as cockney in typically terrible fashion. It doesn't work, and makes the film utterly ingratiating to watch. Ignore this. Listen to it in Japanese, you'll be fine. Nothing wrong with the Japanese voiceovers, as is usually the case. The quality of the sound is great, as it should be, and is one of the best aspects of this film, in my opinion. Image quality leaves a lot to be desired, but should be alright on a standard tv.  If you watch this on a lcd screen or computer monitor however, be prepared for a grainy, weak image quality. Why this should be is beyond me, but clearly the encoders haven't done their job particularly well. None of this matters during the later parts, which are usually fast-moving action sequences,  but it is fairly noticeable in the earlier sections.  Buy it. This film deserves to go down in recent history as one of the great modern cartoon films-  m@
B000E5KJES|2.0|This film is one of my all time favorites BUT the HD DVD transfer is awful,the picture is dark and grainy with little or no 3D pop.  I was also expecting more extras with the HD DVD version but I was sadly mistaken,if you like extras then get the two disc \\"Special Edition\\".

The history, along with the recipes, are easy to understand; they explain why you should do it this way, or not - which helps alot of people, including me. I had to get over using raw eggs, which I did, and the very first batch of ice cream was excellent! The most difficult thing about this book is deciding which recipe to try next.

B000WO251Q|5.0|Dear John is about a young man named John Tyree, it starts off in 2000, he is in the army and spending his leave with his quiet and introverted father, when he meets the girl of his Dreams Savannah Lynn Curtis. Savannah and John share a summer romance before he goes back to the army. The two stuggle with a long distance relationship and try to make it work, but as 9/11/01 happens he re-ups in the army, and the long distance wears on there relationship. And he eventually gets the Dear John letter while he is fighting in Iraq. Years later he looks up savannah to figure out what went wrong. This I like this story because it's relatable, and understandable. The characters aren't perfect, and i like that they have flaws and they aren't cookie cutter characters that usually see in his books.  It's not a story based on two people romantic  feeling for each other, but it also taps in to other issues, very real issues that many of us deal with such as the war in iraq and autism.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I have enjoyed hours of watching the different versions. I especially like how clean and bright the final cut looks. I had never seen the work print before - it has the most differences of all the versions (the commentary for this version is the most informative in my opinion). I found the deleted and alternate scenes an added bonus. They are linked together like another angle on the same story. I wish they had packaged the DVD movies by themselves, the collector case and items are OK but the movies are the meat of this purchase.

B0011HOEY4|3.0|There's no doubt that American Gangster is a great film overall, especially if you're into this sort of movie. The cast is excellent, and I'm particularly thrilled that Ruby Dee just won a SAG Award for her supporting role in the film. It just serves as validation for a lifetime of incredible work. And of course Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington deliver spot on performances as always, bring the perfect amount of intensity and vibrancy to their characters.<br /><br />But there's just something about the story, the way in which it was structured, that just didn't connect with me in the way I'd hoped it would. The story is broken up so that we bounce back and forth between Washington's character, as he builds his drug empire, and Crowe's character, as he mounts his investigation to find and take down this man. Both characters are, as I've already said, excellently portrayed, yet I could never quite find reason to become emotionally involved with either. Frank Lucas (Washington) seems a cold-blooded killer who shows no hint of concern as he brings his brothers into his business, and I never quite understood why this man became who he was. From the very beginning, he is driven to better his predescessor and to rule the underworld. But I never understood exactly why, and in life, there's always a reason for people becoming who they are. I'd like to have seen what Lucas' reasons were. Crowe's character was better fleshed out, but the fact that he seemed to be the only clean cop in New York just rang a bit strangely in a film based on real life. Nothing is ever quite that black and white.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was that because we bounce back and forth between Washington and Crowe, we get scenes from each of their lives, but again we never get emotionally involved with either. For me, anyway, it's that emotional investment in a character that makes a film truly compelling. And while I found nothing technically wrong with this movie as a whole, it seemed to be done in a semi-documentary style that took away from the underlying story of who these two men were. And in such a movie with such intense violence and action, you'd think the ending would be good. But because the film does not end with the final confrontation between Washington and Crowe, and what develops after that moment, it seemed somewhat anti-climatic. I think that disappointed me more than anything else.<br /><br />Overall, it's not that American Gangster isn't a great piece of cinema. It's just that for me personally, the story fell short of really taking me inside the head of these characters, and never really gave me a chance to feel empathy for either of them. Which is surprising because all of the other elements are there, and Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are definitely at their best.<br /><br />If you want to see a great, entertaining mob movie, this is one of the best. If like me, you like to get involved with the characters and learn something about life and how it molds and shapes us, I'm not sure if this is the film for you. You should however watch and decide for yourself.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks, authorsemi-documentary style that took away from the underlying story of who these two men were.

0895260131|5.0|Judging by the amount of abuse that Robert Spencer receives from islamonazis and their jew-hating allies, Robert Spencer's work at Jihadwatch which embodies as its basis the research of this book, this book and his work are important revelations to the uninitiated of the facts of islamic doctrine in the roots of modern popular islamic fascism.<br /><br />It is a scholarly work from a man who has a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies.  Condemned by his enemies as a Jew, the epithet, of all nazis, islamic or otherwise, in an attempt to obfuscate the truth, Robert Spencer is in fact, not Jewish, and this work is significant in understanding the mentality of islamists and their relentless programs of propaganda as exemplified by organizations such as C.A.I.R.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|As a huge fan of Russell Crowe (I don't even know if the word `huge' can really relay how much I do absolutely love this man) I obviously had to see `American Gangster'.  It was just a huge plus to have greats like Denzel Washington and the under-seen Josh Brolin (what a breakout year for him this was) included in the cast.  I mentioned this movie a bit when reviewing the stunning `Zodiac' and while their similarities are few I can see why some would link the two together.  They both utilize lengthened scenes to enhance a moody atmosphere, `Zodiac' leaning towards the creepy unsettling feeling of never catching the bad guy (whom they never catch) but `American Gangster' uses these scenes and apparent slowed pace and long running time to accomplish something else, fuller characters.  I think that's probably the one thing that I loved most about `American Gangster' is that by the time the credits began to role I felt as if I knew everyone, even those with few scenes, those with limited speaking lines; I still felt as though I knew them inside and out.<br /><br />Many have noted that `American Gangster' brings nothing `new' to the table; that it adds nothing to the crime genre but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  `American Gangster' may, in the sense of plot formula, add nothing new but it does take that `same old same' and add layers of class.  `American Gangster' feels so genuine; it feels so realistic, gritty and raw that you feel as though you are walking the streets with drug kingpin Frank Lucas.  The wardrobe (I feel weird calling them costumes), the music, the buildings; even the way the actors walk all bring to life the time in which the film takes place.  Everything is spot on authentic and genuinely engaging.<br /><br />I feel a need to defend this film because so many have attacked it for the buzz and accolades that it has garnered.  Many feel pressured to compare this to last year's megastar `The Departed' and this serves as a disservice to `American Gangster' because it substitutes to glitter and Hollywood glam of `The Departed' for grit.  `American Gangster' feels like an older film.  This is a positive in my book but some have turned this into a negative.  The other problem many have with `American Gangster' is that it didn't prove to be `Training Day Part II' as many had hoped it would be.  Denzel Washington does not reenact his Oscar Winning role here but is much more subtle and reserved.  I have my reservations about his performance which I will get to in a minute but in my defense of this I will say that Frank Lucas is not Alonzo and it's unfair to expect him to be.  Neither of these complaints carries much weight with me for they take nothing away from the film in general.<br /><br />`American Gangster', as many are probably privy to already, follows drug lord Frank Lucas' rise to infamy in the Harlem underworld.  It also tracks his pursuit by Detective Richie Roberts.  It almost plays as two films, two companion pieces.  We have Frank Lucas building his drug empire, amassing great wealth and prestige and then we have Richie Roberts falling out among his peers and losing his family life but retaining his conscience as he works to incarcerate Lucas.  Lucas and Roberts have their own sets of demons but they share some enemies, namely the crooked cops that permeate the area.<br /><br />The cast is extensive and for the most part marvelous.  Josh Brolin sizzles as crooked Detective Trupo.  I've been a fan of Brolin's for a while and I am so happy that this year he was given the opportunity to embrace his acting talents and take off so-to-speak.  Ejiofor also delivers a great performance as Lucas' brother Huey.  He's sorely underused but what he contributes is memorable.  In fact his few scenes had me wishing he would have been cast as Frank instead of Washington, but I'll get to that in a minute.  RZA, Common and T.I. take a break from rapping to act and all do well.  Cameo performances like that from Cuba Gooding Jr. and the sensational Ruby Dee are also captivating.  I was wondering what happened to Cuba and I was glad to see him embrace his few moments of screen time to give us a memorable cameo, but it was Ruby Dee who delivered one of the most powerful performances in the film.  I don't even think you can call what she did acting.  The way she let her hands grab her knees in excitement or the way she trembled in frustration you felt her emotions so purely, so naturally.<br /><br />But this movie of course has two bigger stars battling it out for your attention; Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  Well, to be completely honest, and I say this with no bias, Russell Crowe is the champ here.  Denzel just doesn't grasp who this man is.  Yes, Lucas was a man that believed in a low key profile, a man who stayed purposely out of the limelight so as not to attract the kind of attention you don't want but Denzel takes this too an extreme he didn't need to take it.  He never let his charisma shine.  In some of his final scenes alongside Crowe (in the interrogation room for instance) we get a glimpse of the sarcastic and confident side of Lucas and it made me angry that Washington waited until the very end to show us what he could have done all along.  He has his moments (mostly with regard to his brothers) where he dominates his character and delivers beautiful scenes but for the most part he was kind of boring.  Crowe on the other hand masterfully got inside Richie to flesh out his demons and his admirable qualities and always did so with charm and in a manor that drew you to him.  You wanted to watch him.  Crowe had such a knockout year with this and `3:10 to Yuma' under his belt that it makes his Oscar snub so undeniably heartbreaking.  Crowe's ability to lose himself inside his characters is one of the many things I love about him.<br /><br />In the end I feel that `American Gangster' is a very strong film, a film that stands on its own merits and delivers beautifully.  Is it the best film out this year?  No, but it's far from the worst.  In fact it's a very solid film that manages to engage it's audience and deliver thrills, chills and that feeling of satisfaction we receive when we watch something that truly entertains.  This feeling is all thanks to the marvelous Ridley Scott who just adds yet another mastered genre to his resume.  Scott is probably one of our greatest American Directors working today.  He's taken genre after genre (unlike some who never leave their comfort zone) and delivered consistently solid work.  From swords and sandals epics to war films to sci-fi horror films to cross country dramas to the gangster film Scott has stamped his signature mark on modern cinema with flair and perfection.  Please, someone, give him his Oscar.uby Dee are also captivating.

Truly a talented, wonderful ( not to mention gorgeous ) individual. Words can't do it/her justice. You will need to listen to a few songs and see if it is for you. I would think there is a very small minority of people who would not enjoy this album.
B000001FS3|5.0|I've been listening to it for twenty years now.  This is the best album of any genre ever recorded.  The only other one to come close is \\"Kind of Blue\\".
B000WTNCQS|5.0|I got this as a gift for my husband - I loved every aspect of this, including the way it was packaged! I was very happy and so was my husband!  Thanks!
1604590483|5.0|I purchases this in both book and CD format for my husband.  I have received so much from Joseph Murphy.  Initially his style of writing did not appeal to me.  Each page tells events in others lives and how these people applied the principles taught by him, allowing Infinite Intellegence to work in there lives.  In time I adjusted to his style and have been able to apply these principles in my own life. Now I am collecting as many of his writings as I can.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have never seen something that looks so good on a TV before. I have a Sharp Aquos LCD with 1080p, so I have the equipment to run this. I get full use out of the 1080p. The shots they have in this show are amazing, and it all looks so real. The resolution gives you a great sense of depth perception; when there is a mountain range in the picture, you can really tell which mountains are where. If you own a blu-ray player, you need this. Plus it is $100 in stores and $60 on Amazon. If you have people over, you can just turn off the sound and play it in the background if it's a loud party. Great product.
0307387151|5.0|Atonement escalates in substance as the story unfolds; the elongated beginning is prerequisite to the heart of the story and becomes significant to plot development.  This is a book that I had to read without background noise (kids and husband asleep) because the language is pretty intense as it is beautiful.      Just as much as McEwan writing style is verbose, Cormac McCarthy's is sparsely written.  Two vastly different styles, but I put them on the same pedestal as being the best minds at work in literature today.
B000VBJEFK|4.0|I enjoyed the movie tremendously for its beautiful graphics and technical excellence. However, I didn't get the same warm fuzzy feeling from the other Pixar movies like Toy Story or Finding Nemo. I couldn't relate with most of the characters in the movie, especially with Linguini. I'd still keep a copy around the house as reference to a well-put-together-animation movie.
0790729369|5.0|This movie is so good.  Sad that someone would stay in a marriage for their kids.  If you have an open mind, this movie is great.
0553260111|5.0|I have read quite a few action/suspense type novels lately and am a pretty big critic of most writers.  This one is one of the best I have read.  I liked the movie quite a bit too but was happily surprised to find that the book and movie weren't that similar.  I like to not be able to predict what will happen next.  Several differnt nicely complex plot lines.  Fantastic.  Highly recommend it.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Purchased this for granddaughters. Consider it a great family film, though have not watched it myself.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is awesome! Recommended by two co-workers independently. Game lives up to the recommendation. Complex enough to be fun for adults, not too complicated for my 9 year old. He was able to completely grasp the concepts and game play after one practice game. Nice online resources, best new game I have played in a decade.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|I've apparently reached the age (or at least I'm so fed up with reality shows) that I've developed a strong need to show my children what counted as entertainment when I was a kid.  The whole family has thoroughly enjoyed this collection.  The DVD format is great, since it allows you to access specific scenes quickly when they come up in discussion.  The is a must-have for any home movie collection.
B0000549B0|5.0|I had been searching for movies (Harvey, Jeff Dunham video, and others) in many different stores.  I was able to purchase the videos I wanted at Amazon.com with very little trouble.  My purchase was delivered to me at my door (didn't need to use my car or gas).  I am very satisfied with my purchases and expect to now do my Christmas shopping at Amazon.com (no crowds, no parking problems, and no running out of steam!).
B000BCE918|5.0|This pack is wonderful.  My kids watched them all in a marathon when we received them, and we repeatedly watch them as a family and on trips in the van.  There aren't as many bonus features as I would have liked.  Still, it is wonderful to have access to all three of these films in DVD format.  I recommend this pack for anyone with kids who like dinosaurs (and who aren't tremendously picky about the science associated with such creatures!).
0439882826|5.0|I have to say that this Star Wars Pop Up Book is so cool that if you are a fan or know a fan of Star Wars this is the book for you! You will not believe how outstanding this book is. One of the most incredible parts is that the light saber really lights! The Pop Ups are so intricate you won't believe your eyes. This is not a book for little children. It's a grown up Pop Up book! Just get it you will be thrilled with your purchase!<br />Matthew Reinhart you did a heck of a job...
B000VBJEEG|3.0|This was a cute video.  I'm not a big fan of \\"Ross\\" so that kinda spoiled it for me. Sorry, I loved Friends, but he's just too over the top for me.  Also I have this thing about rats and even though they were animated, the idea of thousands of rats climbing on someone and running around the kitchen gave me the willies.  Silly, I know, but it did.  Cute story line though.
B00008K7AM|4.0|Yes, as many have pointed out, The Hot Chick is a stupid movie with a stupid plot. However, if you are looking for some outrageous laughs, this is the DVD for you.<br /><br />Rob Scheider is cute, funny and his performance is a scream. I am not sorry I purchased it. So, sue me.
0312995423|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and my son really enjoyed the book.  He wants me to read it next.  He said he couldn't put it down and read about half of it on the flight home.
0486268659|5.0|I ordered 30 copies of this Dover Thrift Edition of A Christmas Carol and used them as stocking stuffers at work.<br /><br />This is a great item for the price, lower than some greeting cards, and I suspect appreciated a tad more than the usual overflow of candy around at holiday time!

0307155102|5.0|This wonderful book has been around for years, teaching generations of kids the wonderful world of words. Richard Scarry organizes words under categories, such as tools, the playground, the supermarket, etc. It's a fun way to learn, and the illustrations are fabulous and vibrant.<br /><br />If you have children in your circle, you should make it your business to give them this book -- and give them the gift of learning!
6305428050|5.0|Great fun movie for the family,one of my family's favorites,never get tired of seeing,and always provides a laugh as well as some sweetness!!!
0394818237|5.0|The title of this book, Richard Scarry's What Do People Do All Day, pretty much sums it all up! Here are page after page of action packed illustrations and clever little stories of how people work!<br /><br />Even young children who haven't learned to read will be able to follow along, understanding the activities being described. Richard Scarry's books have entertained and educated generations, and this book is proof of his amazing abilities!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Oh, how amazing is this!!!!  It is totally blowing our mind with the beauty of the photography, the \\"how in the world did they get that picture\\" moments, the oohs and aahs of each breathtaking scene, and the narration....all together is such an interesting and educational series.  Our grown kids and their children were all here for Christmas and were mesmerized by it and couldn't wait to go and purchase a set.  One home schools her children and said it would be wonderful for that.  I will buy this for gifts in the future and will enjoy it with visitors to our home and friends for years to come.
B000065BPB|5.0|I'm not a big audiophile, so take that into account when considering the fact that I loved these freaking headphones.    I came off a pair of Plantronics gaming headphones, which I came to discover were anything but. Hours of gaming left my ears sore, and were a real pain with my glasses.    However, these 280 cups are amazingly comfortable for long periods of time. They cancel outside noise very nicely, and put crisp, rich sound into your ears. Fully adjustable for all size heads, and it's like the cups are put on gyroscopes, since they can adjust to any angle to fit comfortably on your ears. The cushioning is very soft and as I mentioned above, is very easy on people who wear glasses while wearing headphones.    They are a bit heavy, but that is due to very strong materials used in the construction of these, which are very sturdy. I'm sure they could take quite a bit of abuse without breaking. The only thing that bugs me is that the cord is coiled, which can be cumbersome. However, that doesn't take away from the overall experience of these in terms of sound and comfort, which should be the first two considerations in any pair of headphones. I would recommend these to anyone, and have done so.
B0009QZ4CE|4.0|An excellent album, but I simply don't find it as memorable as Pawn Hearts or H to He. Even with two bonus tracks, it feels short, and neither Sleepwalkers nor The Undercover Man really seemed to grab my attention. Scorched Earth is easily the best track, with Arrow coming in second.     Nothing on the album is bad per se (though parts of A Louse if Not a Home grate on my ears after a while) but it simply doesn't quite measure up to earlier VDGG masterpeices

0142004235|5.0|This is among Steinbeck's best novels, and it is usually ranked among his top three or four, but not quite as good as \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" I have read most of his works including the present, which is a must read for Steinbeck fans. It has excellent prose and good drama but the story becomes a bit predictable for the last 100 pages of the 600 pages. That is the primary difference in terms of literary merit or being a good read. It is a pre-World war I novel set in northern California, and it is set partly in a small town and partly in a rural settings. The story is about family interactions, especially parent child relations, and uses three generations of characters from two families. There is less politics than in some of his other novels.<br /><br />John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has over ten million copies in print.<br /><br />Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.<br /><br />I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels. The present work is a longer novel, 600 pages, which covers three generations of two families split between Connecticut and the Salinas area of northern California. It is a long and descriptive story but not as descriptive or as intricate as \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" That Pulitzer novel tends to spiral down emotionally. Here in \\"East of Eden\\" we have a few peaks and valleys and a number of emotional hooks. Steinbeck manages to work in some clever literary ideas and names by using references to biblical passages. The characters are interesting. However, because of the similarity in the families, generation to generation, the story becomes a bit predictable towards the end, more predictable than his other works, and many readers will be able to guess the end by page 500 or 530.<br /><br />This is a good book and it has good characters including the mother Cathy, and it has a number of interesting secondary characters. Also, the subplots, the overall structure, and the prose are good.<br /><br />It is not a heavy read and takes a few evenings to read. The middle part of the book is very compelling, almost a page turner.

B00004VVNB|3.0|I bought this movie but I wouldn't recommend it.  Never mind buying it, it would be hard recommending anyone to go watch it, although I did like the women's hairstyles in this movie.  Best of the 70s.  The lead actress is pretty easy on the eyes.  Apparently, they don't wear bras in the future either. And how great was it to see Farrah Fawcett! She was Farrah Fawcett-Majors at this time - another movie about the future that is in fact a time capsule!  Farrah Fawcett's part, however, is pretty short - I'd guess less than 5 minutes total screen time.  And while it was fun digging on the shopping mall interior design that was supposed to be our 'world of the future', finally I was left wanting something more.      The plot is intriguing enough - at least the basic idea is.  I just thought the movie dragged.  I kept waiting for it to be over.      There are parallels between this movie and the \\"Planet of the Apes\\".  And maybe \\"Rollerball\\", neither of which were big hits for me, although I think I liked \\"Planet of the Apes\\" better than Logan's Run in terms of the actual watching experience.    I don't mind low-budget effects movies as long as the story engages, but it didn't for me in Logan's Run.  One thing that bugged were those cheesy spaceguns that lit up when they would shoot, and then a minute later you would see an explosion rigged to go off near the person they were shooting at.  A year before Star Wars and you'd think they could do better than that!  Still, this is not the movie's biggest problem.      I remember being intrigued by Logan's Run, the TV series, when I was a kid, and since I couldn't find it on dvd, I opted for the movie instead.  I don't regret seeing it (and there are quite a few movies that I can't say that about), but it may be better to rent this one if it's a matter of sating your curiosity.  The main premise intrigues, but the rest of the movie's about as exciting as flat coke.  I give it 3 stars for the originality of it's idea - for the movie itself, two would be more than fair.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is a Great movie!! I know its a lot of computer graphics but the story alone is worth it. Fast shipping, would recommend.
B000PY52EU|5.0|A friend brought this over for us to watch while I was recuperating.  When I saw the cover I was like \\"O boy\\" another stupid movie by Craig Brewer but to my wonderful surprise it was excellent.  Didn't know Justin Timberlake could act. Loved all the characters.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought my own copy.
020530902X|5.0|Very good reference to improve your writing. This book will enable you to produce better essays. In addition, it is also recommended by the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence, an alternative route to teaching in USA. A very handy pocketbook, you can take it anywhere. Remember, the more you practice writing, the better it gets. So, practice, practice, practice.
B0000067L3|3.0|The studio material veers from the inspired (\\"White Room,\\" never mind that Jack Bruce and Pete Brown seemed to play a kind of see-and-raise on Eric Clapton's earlier \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses,\\" though Clapton unfurls one of the finest rounds of controlled wah-wah fills and solos of its time; \\"Sitting on Top of the World,\\" which sounds first too reverent until Clapton spins a spellbinding solo and Bruce supports him with a neatly climbing bass line; \\"Born Under a Bad Sign,\\" in which Ginger Baker's Latinesque polyrhythm competes neatly with Clapton's stinging Albert King-like lines; \\"Those Were The Days,\\" maybe the second-best song Baker wrote for the trio) to the modest (\\"Deserted Cities of the Heart,\\" \\"Politician\\"), to the mundane. (\\"As You Said,\\" which sounds still as though it were composed and executed on some particularly skittery controlled substances, though the cello lines save it from total disaster.) And, also, to the autobiographical---it was too easy to dismiss Ginger Baker's recitation of \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" (it was the flip of their non-LP single, \\"Anyone for Tennis,\\" by the way) as self-indulgent whimsy until you realise the poem (which Baker originally hoped to have his young daughter recite for the cut), and the explosive finale in which Baker and Bruce ramp up one of their trademark concert-style raveups over a spidery Clapton guitar solo, speak metaphorically about the trio's pending split-up. (The easiest hint: \\"Captain Madman\\" was a nickname hung on Eric Clapton by his bandmates.)    The live recordings veer from the transcendent (\\"Crossroads\\") to the well-intentioned (\\"Spoonful,\\" which tends to lag in a few places, in spite of several bursts of what made Cream so formidable as a freewheeling, improvisational concert unit), to the dubious (it's still hard to know whether \\"Traintime\\"---a superior take has since emerged on the BBC sessions---is inspired or exhausted, though the idea of chugging Bruce's harmonica to Baker's snare and hi-hat wasa welcome relief, and the vocal is probably his most impassioned on the set), and to a combination of the three. (\\"Toad\\" was always more impressive for Baker's drumming---as colouristic as you'll find in rock of any era, never mind how many caterwauling inferiors it inadvertently inspired, than for its basic music bookends, the last of which you can barely hear through the mix under the crowd sound, anyway.)    As a whole, \\"Wheels of Fire\\" isn't quite the master blend of eclectic blues and pop adventurism \\"Disraeli Gears\\" was, and you wouldn't lose a thing if you skipped \\"Passing the Time\\" or \\"As You Said\\" (both way better as ideas than as executed songs). But in the best moments Cream lives up to the better sides of its reputation. Maybe the sense that they were about to decide on packing it in pervades too greatly, but for the better moments it's still worth the price.    (As an historical note: \\"Wheels of Fire\\" was the first double-LP set to be awarded a platinum record, an award presented to Cream before they kicked off the Madison Square Garden appearance that concluded their 1968 farewell tour.)

0440238153|5.0|Some readers may be disappointed with the ending of the trilogy but I most certainly was not - starting from fairy tale of the first volume, an adolescent part two, this volume is the most mature and decidedly the best of the three. Pullman adds final touches to his invented universe and makes with true talent. The story which developed slowly and unravelled before our eyes finally makes sense.<br />It would be a crime to reveal any details of the plot - but get ready for twists you never expected and be prepared to have your preconceptions challenged. Pullman's vision does not necessarily have to be embraced as your own but you must give him credit for creating a world of great strength and integrity! Five stars!

B000NA28I4|4.0|If your DVDs of the Lord of the Rings have been worn thin it may be the time to give Eragon a chance. This is the kind of movie which works fully only in movie theatre - you need big screen to fully enjoy the effects. DVD is decidedly second best but if you want to spend an afternoon watching a kid movie (with your kids, preferably), it is still a fairly decent choice.<br />The story is slow to develop (approximately as slow as the hatching of a dragon egg) but once it starts you will get a share of spilled blood, monsters and trolls (which seem very closely related to those you know from Lord movies...) fighting against the very small and select band of the good.<br />Camera loves Ed Speelers so if you have a soft spot for cute blonds you will have one on the screen basically all the time (I know it's a spoiler but he does take his shirt off!) even though he should learn some more about acting before embarking upon another leading role.

B0009HKH6Q|2.0|This is a case where viewing the original after the remake is a mistake.  I have seen the remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo several times and have enjoyed it each time.  In watching original I was disappointed on many levels.  The acting by all involved is forced.  The soundtrack is like many from  60's movies, loud and annoying.
B00008DDRX|3.0|First a warning.  DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH WOMAN WHO IS NOT A RACING FAN.  To be fair I should probably say don't watch this with ANYONE who isn't a racing fan.      When it was made in the early 70s this was a great effort at making the best racing movie ever.  If I were rating it then I would have given it a 4 or a 5.  The annoying sound track, the silly and poorly developed side story about the fellow racer's widow and the lack of updated surround sound for the race sequences limits this movies appeal when viewed today.    Where the movie still succeeds is capturing the feel of a great racing venue on race day.  If you have never been to a race you might not beleive all the layers that exist around the event.  I think the movie also captures the interactions between drivers and teams without the theatrics of some later movies (think Days of Thunder).

0316067598|5.0|This is one of the absolute best military-related books that I've read. The author includes entertaining stories and accounts of growing up in East Texas. He talks about the small-town culture in Texas and how it shaped his views and sense of patriotism. He then describes the process of joining the Navy and transforming from civilian to Navy Seal. I found this part of the book to be interesting and quite amazing. His accounts of BUDs and hell week as well as his self-process are described in great detail. He then begins to give his account of operation Red Wing. This is where the book becomes nearly impossible to put down. Plenty of action and heroism mixed in with spurts of humor and real tragedy. This is an unbelievable story of bravery and the will to fight to the end. It's true that the author more than touches on his political views and the role of the media. However, one must understand that he feels the media and general pressure from the American left directly played a part in the deaths of his friends and teammates. All in all this is a great book. I thank Marcus Luttrell for his service and for this book.
1847242537|5.0|I bought this book because of its good reviews, because I love Sweden, and because I'd read about the sad and premature death of its author.<br /><br />I don't often read mysteries, but this one had me hooked pretty quickly.  You can't help being sorry that there will be no more new books from Larsson, but it's a relief to know there are two more books to come in this trilogy, because the characters he created are strong enough to carry that many and more.  It's like having a wonderful first course and knowing there are still two to go.<br /><br />Mikael Blomqvist is a complex protagonist, dogged, humane, flawed and sometimes insecure.  His sidekick, the resourceful Lisbeth Salander, who hates to be compared to Pippi Longstocking (thereby making the comparison for us), is even more complicated.  Personally, I liked her, and I'm intrigued to know more about her, which will hopefully happen in the next two books.<br /><br />Plot-wise, this kept me guessing right to the end, with many satisfying twists and surprises.  The writing is plain and unadorned, but with a story like this you really don't need lyricism.<br /><br />All I can say is, I hope the translator is working fast on the sequels!
1594481717|2.0|Daniel Pink suggests in his book \\"A Whole New Mind\\" that we are moving into a new \\"Conceptual Age\\".  A work world no longer dominated by knowledge workers such as MBA's and engineers, but by creators and empathizers like designers.  While knowledge workers will still be essential, their services are able to be found elsewhere through abundance, automation, and Asia.    Considering the extreme technicality of the brain and the world we live in, the book is an easy read which breaks what would be difficult to understand terms and ideas into user friendly phrases everyone can understand, such as \\"high concept\\" and \\"high touch\\".  Other than the brain, \\"A Whole New Mind\\" is about the working world and economy of the near future. Jobs being sent off to Asia. Automation doing jobs better and faster. Abundance causing indecision because so many of the same things are available. What is to be the savior of America against these three A's? The use of the creative right-brain in coordination with the analytical left-brain is the key to survival.  Pink's conclusions are however meaningless.  Asia is filled with right brain thinkers.  It is populated by artists, musicians, and story tellers.  Pink is apparently writing this book under the assumption that all Asians do is sit in front of a computer and do calculus.  Although there are many workers coming from places in Asia like India, I disagree that they do the job at the same quality.  Engineering schools there and the overall quality of much of the education there is substandard to the quality of the typical four year American institution.  Pink's conclusions are unsubstantiated.  When he gets some real support, I will listen, but until then, I'll keep going with my knowledge worker education and let designers worry about design.  The book was required reading for my English 102 class at Drexel University.  For all the other college students out there.  Stay away.  This book will not do you any good.  It might make you question yourself a little bit, but you already have enough to worry about.  Do not trouble yourself with the claims this book makes.  If you're some kind of art student, good.  You'll be fine.  If you're some kind of science or engineering student, good.  You'll be fine.  Don't let Daniel Pink tell you otherwise.  \\"A Whole New Mind\\" discusses three forces driving our society into the \\"Conceptual Age\\".  There are so many products that offer the same quality and price that the only way to set them apart is their visual appeal.  Abundance.  Pink mentions several jobs like computer programming and engineering that are outsourced to Asia to workers who do the same if not better work for a great deal less.  Asia.  Pink states that many jobs that require analysis derived from a series of steps are now able to be done by machines.  Automation.    Pink derives that you must ask yourself three questions about your job, \\"Can someone overseas do it cheaper?  Can a computer do it faster?  Am I offering something that satisfies the nonmaterial, transcendent desires of an abundant age?\\"  If the answer to any of those questions is yes, Pink says that in order to survive in the new world created by the three A's, you must use the six senses: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning.  In the new world, things must be visually appealing so that they may compete with their lower priced counterparts.  Design.  People don't remember facts, they remember stories.  Pink tells a story about how he bought a bottle of wine because it had a story on the bottle telling where it came from and that the proceeds benefited a charity.  He didn't buy the other bottles because there was nothing special about them, just ingredients.  Story.  People must be able to see the big picture and put all the pieces together like language and culture.  Symphony.  People must be able to feel what their clients feel so that they can know what they want.  Empathy.  Seriousness is not always good.  It can place too much stress on people and doesn't let the mind flow freely.  People must be able to open their minds and enjoy their work.  Play.  People must have purpose.  They can't just do.  They have to be working for something and feel there is something else greater than themselves.  Meaning. (Gudrun Krebs)

The Sony V6's (Same headphone shell different driver) were my first real pair of headphones and they are also the only pair that has survived the whole time (about 17 years now) and still work flawlessly. Just have to change the ear pads every few years. So when I needed a second set I decided to upgrade to these. Better sound and the same durable build. There are better sounding headphones out there and you can pay a lot more for it, I have many times over, but if you need a workhorse on the decks or in the studio that you can rely on, these are it. I use them for dj'ing, studio work, and just listing to tunes.
0446310786|5.0|Like the prose and symphonies of centuries past that yet today evoke memory and emotion, To Kill A Mockingbird epitomizes the definition of \\"classic\\".      It is a story of the most important time in people's lives; when morals are made, when lessons are learned, when lasting friendships are born and time takes forever and then is forever gone--childhood.    This thoroughly heartwarming tale chronicles the struggles, strengths and weaknesses of Atticus Finch, small town Alabama lawyer and widowed father of two in the 1930's.  It delves into the spiritual and moral dilemmas aroused by fear and prejudice. As he defends a young black man accused of a crime against a white woman, it becomes as much a trial of fatherhood as a test of justice.      The story is seen through the eyes of a 9 year old girl, Scout.  She and her older brother, Jem, have critical issues of their own to deal with.  Scout wants to get out of having to go to school, so she takes up cussing, hoping her father will assume she's learned these new words at school and immediately withdraw her.  Another time, Scout and Jem build a snowman that looks exactly like their next door neighbor.  When the offended neighbor complains, Atticus tells them that a snowman is not supposed to be a caricature of a real person.  Jem replies, \\"It's not a caricature.  It looks exactly like him\\".    Scout, Jem, and Atticus develop strong bonds they must cling to as they juggle a tedious balance between the ideologies of chidhood, fatherhood and the temperamental mores of a tumultuous place and time.
B000WTBMBU|1.0|Apparently there's something I'm not getting here <`shrug'>. I like dubstep--in fact, I like all sorts of dance music, from Detroit techno to Chicago house, from electro to ghetto tech, from drum `n bass to disco. And since Burial's sophomore album got even more hype than their self-titled release, I figured, how could I go wrong? How, indeed! What I expected from \\"Untrue\\" were some of the sounds that drew me to dubstep in the first place: deep warbling bass rolls, oblique synth modulations ricocheting through phased echo chambers, and tight shuffling drum patterns winding down vast expanses of empty space. What I got sounded more like a bunch of irritating r `n' b vocals slathered over second-rate glitch beats, pressed onto a record then dragged through the mud and rubbed over the erogenous zones of every record reviewer from here to the river Thames. This description is not merely intended to be clever or cruel. I like some glitch and, yes, even some r `n' b; however, this album manages to take the most annoying elements of both genres. The vocals consist mainly of those grating, emotionally-effusive moments of pop r `n' b filler tracks endlessly looping through goofy envelope filters without the slightest regard for pitch or melody. The beats all sound like those extraneous Clicks and Cuts tracks that somehow feel off-beat even though they were made with midi sequencers--those tracks that you automatically skip past because listening to them gives you the uneasy feeling of ogling a passerby whose walk is impaired by a severe physical disability. From there, the producer only adds insult to injury, throwing in some reverb-laden drones to make it sound deep, sprinkling on some gurgling static textures to make it seem experimental, and all the while the insipid r `n' b crooning never ceases!     From beginning to end, \\"Untrue\\" feels like trying on a pair of painfully skinny low-rise jeans under the buzz of flickering fluorescent lights in a dingy fitting room as twodifferent radio stations blare from both sides in a nauseating cacophony of diva trills and rock riffs. I suppose my rather harsh opinion ultimately comes down to individual taste. I put my trust in a myriad of reviewers (on Amazon and in dozens of respectable music magazines) whose tastes evidently differ dramatically from my own. Clearly something about this album is deeply affecting people, and I don't want to take that away from anyone. But in my own humble opinion, this is one of the most overrated albums of the decade, and with the passage of time, I imagine it will be perceived as such alongside indie-rock artsy-fartsy noodlers, Animal Collective. Believe the hype if you like, but the album's title says it all.
1594481717|4.0|Right brain or left brain? Which hemisphere is more dominant and vital for today's changing economy? According to Daniel Pink in his book A \\"Whole New Mind,\\" right-brainers will rule the future. The right hemisphere is the creative side that sees the big picture. The left hemisphere uses logic and solves problems in a systemic and detailed manner. Pink calls the last century the information age because \\"knowledge workers,\\" who used L-directed thinking, were the most successful. However, because of the three A's, Asia, abundance and automation, only jobs that are difficult to replace, or ones that add a certain flair of high concept and touch, will survive the conceptual age.     Prepare the young children, expect the worst, and arrange for a new career today. Daniel Pink makes his message clear; whoever utilizes the six senses of the conceptual age the best will be the most successful in the coming years. But what will become of the millions of Americans with L-directed jobs? A percentage will lose their jobs to abundance, Asia and automation, but Pink makes a much bigger deal out of the conceptual age movement than he needs to.     Pink is right, everyone benefits from a strong right hemisphere, but that does not mean that we should abandon L-directed thinking. If we cannot keep up with computers and Asia using our left brains, how will we ever surpass them using our right brain? The left-brain has provided the capability for us to advance and evolve, and the educational system is based on L-directed learning styles. The left brain is dominant and the majority of L-directed jobs will remain intact. It takes time for the job market to cross the corpus callosum to the right hemisphere. There is no reason for such an uproar to occur; even basic industry jobs are still being developed in the western world. Pink's predictions are insightful, yet rash. The job market is changing but the left brain is essential to keep up.    Pink argues that a well-designed environment improves the quality of life. Well-designed information takes the form of a story, a great way to preserve information in an interesting way. Stories give us the whole picture and appeal to our emotions. The ability to empathize with others is a valuable conceptual age skill that no computer can replicate. Studies show that when doctors empathize with their patients, healing time decreases. Also, through happiness, resulting from play and laughter, a person's overall health will improve. Pink states that a main goal in the conceptual age is to achieve happiness and meaning in life. Earning lots of money at a prestigious job is no longer enough. In the conceptual age, Pink believes that people will reach out to spirituality to find happiness.     Pink offers an interesting perspective on what the future entails. He emphasizes the importance of the arts and provides unique techniques that develop the six senses of the conceptual age. Pink believes that we must use every opportunity available to improve the right hemisphere. He provides fundamental examples of how each sense is vital and applicable to his own life. Pink utilizes these techniques in his own writing which engages the reader's right hemisphere. An overall good read, but the theories might be too extreme for our time.

B000NVIXFK|1.0|Well all I can say is that I'm a sucker. I actually bought this aluminum/plastic Frisbee called \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" by Rush. It really, logically, shouldn't have happened, based on the fact that Rush has been supplying us with a steady stream of fecal matter since 1987 and haven't thought twice about it. Well I'm a former fan and old habits die hard I guess, and I can't remember (in recent times) when a Rush album had so much publicity/excitement running behind it ( a new and young \\"hot\\" producer, revitalized band members, endless media love, cool new single and music video ect) so I actually caved in and gave this CD a whirl despite my better judgement.<br /><br />Take a guess what happened when I played it....... go on......................<br /><br />It was horrible.<br /><br />Probably worse then Vapor Trails, Test For Echo and Counterparts combined and that is saying something because all 3 of those records were horse pi$$.<br /><br />No, not just horrible, insulting. I've watched this band slowly destroy itself over a 20 year period with turd releases. Something has gone awry. After listening to this all I can say is I'm done. I won't even dignify this by mentioning song titles or describing the sound in detail. All I will say is this is what happens when you hire one of your fans as a producer. Nick R. apparently (because of his age and work with other P.O.S bands like Foo Fighters) had no idea what he was doing. I guess he couldn't say \\"no\\" when he heard something bad because Rush are his heroes, so as a result he minted this fresh bowel movement called Snakes and Arrows.<br /><br />Why didn't they at lest hire a professional producer for this? They have the money to afford ANYONE, and they choose this Nick R. @ $ $ hole.<br /><br />WTF were Alex, Geddy and Neil thinking? Are they going senile?<br /><br />So that's it, I'm done with this band. I'm done with watching these former legends make a joke out of themselves with bogus CD releases and stupid decisions. Peart can no long write songs, plain and simple. The former poet now penning odes to teenage angst and whiny, ignorant lyrics.  Geddy has been reduced to acting like a moron on stage and Alex just doesn't give a $ h i t anymore. You can see it on his face and in his guitar playing. He hardly does solos any more, he just got physically and musically lazy l guess. Seems like none of them even cares anymore, I mean when your band is now reduced to putting washing machines and chicken ovens on stage then you know something is wrong.<br /><br />I'll just pretend they don't exist anymore and retired in 1987. It's better that way...<br /><br />So please, just stay away from this pile of fecal matter. You'll save some money and a trip to the psychiatrist.mple.

B000YA9R3C|4.0|I must confess that I had high expectations prior to seeing There Will Be Blood, and from the previews I expected Daniel Day-Lewis' character to be much more violent that he proved to be.   This film is an amazing tour-de-force for Mr. Day-Lewis; he is on screen in almost every scene and so absorbed into Daniel Plainview that you forget this is acting.  Plainview is a man who not only distrusts the world but has nothing but suspicious contempt for those around him.  Paradoxically, he wants to portray himself as a family man and palms off the child of one of his deceased workers as his son (nicely played by Dillon Freasier).  He cares nothing about having a family but reacts violently to the mere suggestion that he is less than a perfect parent.     Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is so large that it tends to dominate those of his fellow-actors but Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, the local preacher of the Church of the Third Resurrection is equally amazing.  Like Plainfield, Eli is performing for the local townspeople and there is a fiery scene where Eli casts out a \\"ghost\\" that is giving elderly woman arthritis.  An interesting performance is turned in by Kevin J. O'connor as Plainview's presumed long-lost half-brother.  The meekness of O'Connor's performance is quite a contract to Day-Lewis' and for a moment in the film Plainview has somebody who he really believes to be family and gives him a job.  Cairn Hinds has a small role as Plainview's right-hand man, the one he sends on errands he does not want to do and, unfortunately does not have enough screen time.     The film begins with no dialogue for several minutes as we watch Day-Lewis digging what seems to be his first oil well alone, gradually changing into a scene years later where he has a small crew of workers. The music by Jonny Greenwood is quite a pastiche with the music sometimes a bit disruptive and sometimes very interesting. I was a bit puzzled by his use of Violin Concerti by Mendelssohn and Bruch as they didnot really fit the scene for me.      I have read comments on how There Will Be Blood is the first great American film of this century but I think the statement is overblown.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted a truly gripping film but it is very limited in scope. The film is marvelous in depicting the mistrust Plainview has for the world and everyone in it but there is little character development and I found the film on the long side, wondering how the story was going to wrap up.  In fact, the film does not have closure and is a sequel waiting to be written.
1594200823|5.0|The general premise in Michael Pollan's book about industrial agriculture being a brutal and corrupt business is not news to me.  But he did manage to make my eyes open even wider and stop and consider what is going on in this country in regards to the raising and slaughter of our farm animals. This is not a book that aims to necessarily convert people to vegetarians, but rather to educate the reader about the many reasons why they should stop and consider just where their food is coming from and how it is being raised.  Also explores the difference between the \\"organic\\" food movement and real organic sustainable farming.   Pollan goes on his own personal journey to look at the process of meat eating, and encourages all meat eaters to do the same.  If you are going to eat meat, it's  your obligation to consider the life of the animal that is feeding you.  This is not a book just for vegetarians but for anyone who is interested in the politics of agriculture, the health and quality of the food they put in their mouth, and anyone who has respect for the creatures we rely upon to be a bulk of our American diet.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|Keep in mind dear readers, that this is ENTERTAINMENT! If you go into a film expecting some life-altering experience everytime you are bound to be disappointed. By viewing \\"There Will Be Blood\\" for what it is, a brilliant and wildly entertaining piece of filmmaking anchored by 3 masterful performances, you can come away satisfied that you got your money's worth and with a new admiration and respect for the director. That's it. Daniel Day-Lewis is so great and has been for so long that we almost take him for granted now. The man is a genius. Paul Dano perfectly balances lust, innocence and evil in his role as Eli Sunday and provides the film with it's most humorous moments. The final scene in the bowling alley had a decidedly \\"Kubrick-ian\\" feel to it and is an ideal summation of all this films ideas and ideals, not to mention the terrific way it (literally) bludgeons home the meaning of the title! Don't miss it.
0226264211|1.0|Yes, there's nothing quite like reading about the Absence of Freedom written by a privileged white male because, really, who else in American society is less free than white men? Funny, isn't it, how the very same people who rally their readers with calls for \\"Freedom!\\" are the very same people advocating for a return to the most inhibiting form of capitalism available. How is this relevant, given its monumental failures throughout South America during the 70's and across the world in the past two decades?<br /><br />Cut taxes? Trickle-down economics? Deregulate and let the rich create more jobs with their excessive wealth? Why didn't it work after Reagan cut the highest tax bracket by a whopping 20 percent? Why did the number of charitable contributions by the wealthiest Americans drop during this time? Why did the middle class begin dropping out? Why are free market capitalists so unwilling to relate any of these questions to the exact same occurances in Chile during the 70's when Pinochet put Friedman's disciples in charge of his economic policy?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Naomi Klein's \\"Shock Doctrine.\\" Educate yourself on the massive failures of the free market system that have already occurred. This is nothing new. Free Market capitalism is a tired re-tread of laissez-faire capitalism, with the exact same results.
0716748789|1.0|This textbook is terrible. I am currently taking an intro level Inorganic chemistry course, and find that the text does a horrible job of explaining the concepts. It may be that to some professors this textbooks seems like it is fairly well written, but simply because they already understand the material.    If you are looking for a textbook to actually learn inorganic chemistry, do not get this book. The topics aren't very explained and the overall setup of the book is terrible.    The only good thing about this book is that it can be very useful if you are in a hurry on your way to class and have to go to the bathroom, only to find that there is no more toilet paper ... it might not be as comfortable as two ply toilet paper, but it gets the job done.
B000000W5N|5.0|Let's party! The Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers (1971) epitomizes the phrase \\"Sex, drugs and rock n' roll\\" probably more than any other studio album in the history of rock music. Nearly every song references sex and/or drugs, and it's all terrific rock n' roll. Classics abound, and this was right in the middle of that 1969-72 period that was the band's finest hour. It opens with the lusty and rockin' Brown Sugar, and what a take they got on this! Rarely does a band cook like this in the studio, but Brown Sugar is a perfect example of rock n' roll making magic. And you gotta love that great sax solo! The rock-star-in-heat anthem B*tch rocks as hard as anything The Stones have ever done, and Wild Horses is their greatest and most eloquent ballad. As you listen, you can almost feel the sorrow and regret sadly mixed with absolute devotion.<br /><br />I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie<br />I have my freedom, but I don't have much time<br />Faith has been broken, tears must be cried<br />Let's do some living after we die<br /><br />It's an extraordinary song, and a perfectly rendered performance. Can't You Hear Me Knocking is a cocaine buzzed, street prowling rocker with extended guitar and sax solos, and it sounds fantastic. The guys pick up the acoustic guitars for the blues You Gotta Move and the minor-key withdraw nightmare Sister Morphine (which includes some fine slide guitar by Ry Cooder). The Stones go needle-and-spoon country rock in Dead Flowers, and get bluesy again with the aching I Got The Blues. Sticky Fingers is a classic, one of the band's best, and probably the most pure and intense Rolling Stones album there is.
B000002OX5|5.0|The Who's third album titled The Who Sell Out was released in December of 1967 in the UK and January of 1968 here in the US.<br />Up to Sell Out, The Who were a singles band and their first two albums The Who Sings My Generation and A Quick One (Happy Jack) all had their moments but the band were still trying to find their feet as a band. While their first two efforts did well in their native England and had a US Top 30 hit with \\"Happy Jack\\", The Who (comprised of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bass player John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon) toured the US and gained a following. By the time The Who Sell Out was released, The Who were poised for superstardom as I found out when I first heard the album in June of 1989 on the double album repackage of this and A Quick One (Happy Jack).<br />The whole premise of the album is that it's a concept album about an outlawed British pirate radio station program complete with fake commercials connecting the songs. In fact, some of the commercials become full-fledged songs.<br />We open with Radio Jingle 1 which segues into \\"Armenia City In the Sky\\" which is a great British psychedelic rocker. Then after Radio London 2 is The Ox's \\"Heinz Baked Beans\\" (funny track). Next is \\"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hands\\" which is a nice acoustic piece (an electric version appears as a bonus track). Then after the Premier Drums/Radio london 3 jingle is Townshend's \\"Odorono\\" which is sung superbly by Pete and is a great rocker. After another Radio London jingle is the tongue-in-cheek \\"Tattoo\\" which would be a concert staple for The Who over the next 15 years off and on. Following that is another Radio London jingle which gives way to the lovely \\"Our Love Was\\" with its razor sharp electric guitar break coupled with Townshend's beautiful clean electric playing and Entwistle's French horn accents. After this is Speakeasy/Rotosound Strings 1 which gave way to the ultimate Who single \\"I Can See for Miles\\" which is a great rocker and was The Who's biggest hit here in the US hitting the Top 10.<br />The second half starts with a country-ish Charles Atlas commercial which segues into the beautiful \\"I Can't Reach You\\". Next is another commercial penned by The Ox called \\"Medac\\" about an acne cream. \\"Relax\\" follows and is a nice number. Then (on th re-issue) is Rotosound Strings 2 before The Ox's tale about a Scrooge fellow names \\"Silas Stingy\\". Next is the beautiful \\"Sunrise\\" which is just Pete and his guitar. we end the original album with \\"Rael\\" which was a mini-opera along the lines of \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" (which appeared on the previous album). Some of the themes here would creep into the next Who album Tommy.<br />The Who Sell Out was another Top 20 hit album for the abnd in the UK and was the band's first album to hit the US Top 50 peaking at #48 in 1968.<br />When the album was re-mixed and remastered in 1995, it featured loads of bonus tracks.

B0000DJZAH|5.0|The Who's fourth studio (and fifth overall) album Tommy was released in May of 1969.<br />The Tommy album by The Who was the make or break for the group because if Tommy had failed, The Who would have probably disbanded due to lack of funds despite their concerts selling out based on Pete Townshend's guitar smashing and Keith Moon's drum kit demolishing at the end of each gig.<br />Guitarist Pete Townshend, under the gun after \\"I Can See For Miles\\" failed as a single in the UK (although it was their biggest ever hit here in the US) came up with a rock opera about a deaf, dumb and blind kid named Tommy whom becomes those aforementioned things after witnessing an event as a child that traumatized him (his father killing his step-father whom he considered his father).<br />Originally considered to be a single length album, the band felt it didn't make sense so they expanded it into a double album and the result is one of rock's Top 10 greatest double studio albums in history (alongside other classic double albums like the then-already released Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland and The Beatles' White album and would help pave the way for more classics like The Rolling Stones' 1972 masterwork Exile on Main Street, The Who's 1973 release Quadrophenia, Elton John's 1973 classic Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Genesis' 1974 masterwork The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Led Zeppelin's 1975 classic Physical Graffiti, Pink Floyd's 1979 masterpiece The Wall and Bruce Springsteen's 1980 classic The River among many others).<br />Alot of classics appear on this album like the \\"Overture\\", the classic Top 20 hit \\"Pinball Wizard\\", \\"Amazing Journey\\", the \\"Underture\\" (best instrumental on here which is basically a repeat of the album's other instrumental \\"Sparks\\"), \\"Go to the Mirror\\", \\"I'm Free\\", \\"Cousin Kevin\\" (one of bass player John Entwistle's greatest compositions), \\"Fiddle About\\" (about the perverted Uncle Ernie also penned by The Ox), \\"Tommy's Holiday Camp\\" (another excellent ditty written by drummer Keith Moon whom did an excellent rendition in the film version of Tommy in 1975) and the classic finale \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\"/\\"See Me Feel Me\\".<br />The other tracks on the album \\"It's a Boy\\", \\"1921 (You Didn't Hear It)\\", \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\", \\"Christmas\\", \\"The Acid Queen\\", \\"Do You Think It's Alright\\", \\"There's a Doctor I've Found\\", \\"Tommy Can You Hear Me?\\", \\"Smash the Mirror\\", \\"Sensation\\", \\"Miracle Cure\\", \\"Sally Simpson\\" and \\"Welcome\\" are all great pieces as well though tend to be overlooked.<br />The album made The Who legends for good and peaked at #4 on the Billboard chart and was their first Gold seller (eventually Platinum).<br />In 1996, the album was re-released as a remastered CD but used a first generation master tape for the remixed reissue.<br />In October of 2003 (a few months before Tommy's 35th Anniversary), Geffen Records (formerly known as MCA) re-released the album as a 2-disc Hybrid SACD with the original 1969 mix on the CD layer and a killer 5.1 mix on the SACD layer and this version uses the very original tapes that were found in Universal's vault after being said that the original tapes were destroyed by Kit Lambert in a fire. As a result of the discovery of the original tapes, the sound quality is amazing on here.<br />Disc two has great outtakes and demos like \\"I Was\\", The Who trying to record Sally Simpson with hilarious results and instrumental versions of Tommy Can You Hear Me, Christmas and Tommy's Holiday Camp among many other rarities (like Dogs Part 2, Cousin Kevin Model Child) plus a cool booklet with rare photos of the band recording the album.<br />Highly recommended.er Keith Moon whom did an excellent rendition in the film version of Tommy in 1975) and the classic finale \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\"/\\"See Me Feel Me\\".

As a result of the discovery of the original tapes, the sound quality is amazing on here.   Disc two has great outtakes and demos like \\"I Was\\", The Who trying to record Sally Simpson with hilarious results and instrumental versions of Tommy Can You Hear Me, Christmas and Tommy's Holiday Camp among many other rarities (like Dogs Part 2, Cousin Kevin Model Child) plus a cool booklet with rare photos of the band recording the album.   Highly recommended.
B00005JNEI|1.0|We really liked \\"bowling for columbine\\", My husband and I watched this and were soooooo drawn in .......then right after we watched another docu. called FAREN\\"HYPE\\" 911. in which almost everyone from the original M. Moore film were interviewed. Most were angered by how their comments were edited and put in this film.  I was blown away by how many of those interviewed were misrepresented in this film. Leading me to believe if Moore chip chopped and edited their interviews to suit his own viewpoint, how much else of the film was actually true? I am sure a lot but now I do not trust him and I am certainly second guessing the info he provided in B-F-COLUMBINE.      SEE BOTH FILMS JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
B000O176Q6|2.0|I was really looking forward to Enter the Dragon on Blu-Ray. I had the vhs, laser disc, dvd, and now blu-ray. Unfortunately Warner really jumped the gun. the video has hair balls, specks and missing frames. Sure it's sharp but why couldn't they get the film out of a cleaner can. I'm really disappointed.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Horror films are definitely a mixed bag when it comes to quality. There are some horror films that are really good, meaning they have a solid story, genuine thrills, and leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Examples of good horror films are \\"Final Destination\\", the `Scream' trilogy, and the classic \\"Halloween\\". But for every really solid effort in the horror genre there are about 10 terrible entries that give the genre a bad name, most of these inferior entries consist of sequels to average or above average horror movies that are made for nothing more than cashing in on the original film's success and hopefully making a little money before fading quickly from the public's memory. In 2004, amidst a crop of forgettable horror releases, one horror movie caught audiences completely by surprise with its in-your-face brand of terror that hadn't been seen in most horror films, with a surprisingly strong story that was full of twists and turns that would make any mystery fan happy, and a fairly solid cast of actors that didn't consist of fresh-faced teenagers that barely have any acting experience. The movie I'm referring to was the smash hit \\"Saw\\" from director James Wan (\\"Death Sentence\\"), and starring Danny Glover (`Lethal Weapon' series), Cary Elwes (\\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\\"), and Monica Potter (\\"Along Came a Spider\\").    \\"Saw\\" focuses on a deranged serial killer who feels that it is his mission in life to teach those who take life for granted a lesson by capturing them and forcing them to choose between fighting for their lives by surviving horrifying circumstances or giving up and dying. His latest victims are a successful doctor (Cary Elwes) and a young photographer (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay). These two unwitting participants in the killer's twisted game must try to work together to solve the mystery of why they are being held captive, while determining the means of their escape from certain death. Meanwhile, a former detective (Danny Glover) is trying to put the pieces together regarding the last case he was working when he left the force, which unbeknownst to him is directly linked to the two captives who may soon become the latest victims of this methodical killer, with a simple message of, \\"Live or die, make your choice.\\"    This is one of those movies that I was a little mixed in my opinion of. The first time I watched \\"Saw\\" I didn't really care for it all that much, I thought that it was a better than average entry into the horror genre, but was trying too hard to cross genres with being a horror film and also a thriller in the vein of \\"Se7en\\". But after watching \\"Saw\\" for a second time, I feel it was a much better horror movie than I initially believed it to be, and was also an adequate mystery thriller that set itself apart from most horror films by actually having a decent story and not relying on some supernatural killer, that for some unknown reason audiences are intrigued by, to propel the movie forward. In fact, you barely even see the killer in this movie, which is even more surprising for a horror film these days, having a modern horror film that actually leaves its killer shrouded in mystery is unheard of, and was very much appreciated here.    Now, some of you may be wondering where I came up with the comparison of \\"Saw\\" and \\"Se7en\\", well here it is. Both movies feature villains who feel it is their sole purpose in life to teach others a lesson about what they've done wrong in their lives. Both villains are patient, smart, and incredibly deranged in their view of the world, and feel completely justified in the pain they inflict upon their victims. I also feel that director James Wan was aware of this comparison, and purposely paid homage to \\"Se7en\\" with the use of the exact same type of notebooks that were used by the killer in the movie \\"Se7en\\" spread all over Danny Glover's apartment in this movie. With all the various types of notebooks out there why choose that same exact one, unless you were meaning for people to recognize it, and therefore draw comparisons. Now, James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell may not have intended for there to be as much comparison between the two films as I have seen, but the similarities are there all the same. With all that being said, I don't feel that \\"Saw\\" as a film, suffers from its similarity to \\"Se7en\\" (granted its not as strong of a mystery thriller as the latter, but it's adequate), the two films are different enough in their execution (no pun intended) that the similarity is nothing more than an obvious influence for their story.    The actors were of a much higher caliber than one normally expects from horror films these days. Generally the cast of horror films consists of some of the newest actors Hollywood has to offer, and generally will focus heavily on talk of sex and feature plenty of nudity from its attractive leading ladies, thus ensuring plenty of teenagers (especially guys) will give the movie a generous box office return and maybe even repeat business. But, \\"Saw\\" went a different route by casting veteran actors such as Danny Glover and Cary Elwes, along with the not as well known Monica Potter to bring their characters to life. Most of the cast were very effective in their roles, even screenwriter Leigh Whannell as the other man trapped with Cary Elwes, was surprisingly good as an actor. But the weakest link in the acting chain was Cary Elwes. For an actor who has been around as long as he has, it's kind of a surprise that he's never managed to elevate his craft from anything more than that of an average actor who has a tendency to overact in his dramatic parts, but excels when it comes to comedy which is probably why \\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\\" and \\"The Princess Bride\\" are the two biggest movies of his career. The decision to give Cary top-billing for this movie seemed odd, since he's not that big of a name, and from a talent perspective, I figured they would have given that honor to Danny Glover, but I'm not the one making those decisions.    One more thing regarding this movie that also further set it apart from most movies of this genre is the lack of blood and gore that was actually seen in the film. Most horror films opt for putting as much blood and gore on the screen as they possibly can, leaving nothing to the imagination, and frankly most audiences are numb to it at this point. But \\"Saw\\" went with the approach of implied gore; yes, there were moments of bloodshed on the screen but not much more than what is shown in an all-out action movie. Although the blood and gore were implied, the film still delivers on the horror, by forcing the audience to envision in their heads what could have taken place onscreen. However, in place of actual blood and gore, the director and writer included plenty of disturbing traps and images, along with creepy music and quick, frantic editing, that gave the audience the impression that the film was much more violent and gory than it actually was which may cause some viewers to dislike the film due to an implied sense of an overabundance of gratuitous graphic violence.    \\"Saw\\" is without a doubt a very creepy horror film that delivers plenty of chills, but also gives audiences a solid story that will keep them guessing what will happen next. A word to parents, this is one horror film that's rating should definitely be heeded, as I don't feel that viewers under the age of 17 should see this movie without parental approval.    \\"Saw\\" is available in both rated R and unrated editions both contain violence and language.
0143038419|5.0|I actually expected to not like this. I really don't like memoirs because of how self indulgent they are(*cough* MILLION LITTLE PIECES shootmenow *cough*). But then I think to myself...I could have picked up that fiction book right next to the memoir and I wouldn't have to read about someone's self absorbtion so it's really my own fault so ahead I read!<br /><br />It was great. I really really enjoyed this book. I love Elizabeth Gilbert. She's funny, painfully smart and the unconventional route she took to find herself was amazing. She hooked me right in the beginning with her honest veiws on her marriage and having children. I find I don't have many women to relate to in the context in which she speaks of those issues but none the less...I found the book interesting and uplifting. Her take on God is right up my alley. This book was refreshing for me.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I loved it.  Very entertaining.  The costumes are sumptuous.  Can't wait for season two.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is all that can be had of what may be the most important adaptation of Philip K. Dick science fiction.  Other authors have had their work explored in various forms of cinematic style, but none seem better suited to the original work than approach of Ridley Scott.  He had an understanding of this stuff!  From Dick's philosophical underpinnings to his use of imagery and metaphor, Scott managed to get it all into this film.  All of it comes through in the several versions, but you can view them all and decide which has what advantages.  From the first theatrical release to the foreign version, the storied work-print, and the enhanced Final Cut, it's all here.<br /><br />The originality of the production and the dedication to the work of the author hampered some of the commercial appeal of the first release, mostly due to the studio getting nervous about audiences being able to \\"understand\\" it and modifying it badly. But the director and fans have perservered to get all there exists of usable footage included in this set.  Finally, there can't be any moaning about what could have been because it's now been put together so that all of us can see what has only been rumored or in such limited release that we could hardly imagine what the discussion of \\"better\\" versions might have been like.<br /><br />The only thing that could have made this better would have been some candid commentary in a discussion between Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford about all of the versioning and hacking at the originally filmed material.  The infamous studio interference in this masterpiece and what it took to bring it around to where at least the director was satisfied with it should be a part of the history included in this set.  But not everyone wants to be frank.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|My favorite show of the past was friends. I have all seasons , but wait for it..............     I think this show may be better. It is always funny and I just like all the characters. I hope this goes on for awhile, but unfortunatly for now it's not due to the writers strike!
B000654YRY|4.0|This DVD doesn't contain many songs, but what it does have are some of Dire Straits' hits from albums such as On Every Street, Brothers In Arms, and others.  It's great to watch Dire Straits play these songs.  Mark Knopfler's guitar playing is great as always, as is his unique voice and singing.  The vocal harmonies on some of the songs (i.e. Walk Of Life) sound excellent.    The downside to this DVD is that it only has stereo audio (no surround mix), and the video is in the 1.33 aspect ratio (square, not wide screen).  There are also no extras, and the DVD doesn't come with any notes or anything.  This is why I only give it 4 stars; however, this is a great concert overall.  One nice thing about the DVD is that it is region-free.  I would recommend this for any Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan.

B000ZK4466|5.0|The 4th album from the mars volta takes a few changes. they changed drummers again, and this album has the full live line up. the new drummer is great. he is the most agressive drummer they had so far, and the music is also more agressive too. i acully think it worked well. the more heavy sound added a really good intenseity to the album. now mars volta are still very much the mars volta. and i think this is some of the strongest songs they have written so far. they just added some balls to their sound. They also took their progressive influence further on this album. The playing is off the wall in every aspect, and omar is a incredible guitarist. one of my favorites out there. His duels and melodys with the sax player are awesome, and the song \\"Goliath\\" is by far one of their best songs yet! i also apriciate that they dont have so much filler on this album. The amount of filler \\"noise tracks\\" on their last album was kind of annoying. This album is over 75 mins of great music! the vocals are typical mars volta. He sounds great like always.     very strong album!
0060763280|5.0|Have you ever wondered why some people become millionaires and some people just can't seem to dig out of their financial rut? Judging by the sheer number of people who purchased Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by Harv T. Eker, I'd say there are a lot of people who are definitely curious.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the title because I realized that millionaires were obviously doing something I wasn't.<br /><br />The subtitle is: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth. I'm a big believer that abundance and wealth are inside jobs. If you don't believe you're wealthy on the inside, you won't see it or achieve it in your outside world.<br /><br />Harv Eker writes to us, the readers, knowing that if we aren't where we want to be financially then we're sabotaging success and wealth from a much deeper subconscious level. He likens it to having an \\"inner thermostat\\" that's set for reaching only a certain level of success and money.<br /><br />The entire premise of this book is that you have a financial blueprint that you've been following since childhood. If your financial blueprint isn't set for success - nothing you know or do will make much of a difference.<br /><br />Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is divided into two parts:<br /><br />Part One: How we think and act about money.<br /><br />He begins exploring the money messages that begin in childhood. Harv's premise is that thoughts, negative or positive, lead to actions and your actions create the results that you're currently experiencing in your life. To achieve wealth, you have to understand and get a grip on your consistent thoughts. It's about revising your mind's money file.<br /><br />I agree with him 100%!<br /><br />Part Two: Rich people talk, think and perceive differently than those who aren't rich.<br /><br />Millionaires view the world as having more than enough for everyone - there is no sense of \\"lack\\" in their consciousness. The middle class focuses most of their energy on trying to increase or keep the status quo of what they already have. The poor lament about getting by and hoping to make ends meet. Can you see how the inner thought patterns are fundamentally different?<br /><br />Harv Eker makes a few things perfectly clear in this book:<br />1. Use what works for you and throw away the rest.<br />2. Your income can only grow to the extent that you do.<br />3. 80% of people are never as rich as they'd like to be<br /><br />I was never bored with this book. There are scenarios to illustrate key points, activities to reinforce key concepts and declarations to affirm your millionaire mind. I also enjoyed his use of humor along with his seriousness.<br /><br />Secrets of the Millionaire Mind can get you motivated and moving only if you truly desire to change. To me, it is more motivational than educational. It helps you search for answers as to why you may not be where you'd like to be financially. If you're looking for a nuts and bolts book on finance, this is not for you.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking to change your mind-set and internal programming toward greater wealth, this book is a great start. After reading this book, you'll probably be saying, \\"I have a millionaire mind!\\"hoping to make ends meet. Can you see how the inner thought patterns are fundamentally different?

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I adore this film. I love the look and feel of it. The acting is superb and the singing is surprisingly lovely especially by Ewan McGregor, who did a fantastic job. His performace was endearing. I am not normally a fan of musicals, but it is so different from all the rest that I couldn't help but love it. And the soundtrack is one of my favorites. The music is gorgeous and catchy, its possibly one of my most favorite soundtracks. Plus, there are plently of speaking scenes if you don't like the 100% singing movie. It has a great mixture of both and I recommend it to anyone.
B000VE439Y|5.0|Some people may tell you this movie is sacrilegious.  It isn't.  Only twice in the film are depictions made of Jesus, only once of the Nativity and these depictions are quite tasteful from my Christian point of view.    Despite the fact that the film is going on 30 years old it's comedy and political satire still makes me laugh like a moose on cheap Norsky vodka.  \\"The Latin Lesson\\" scene always puts me on the floor.     It's not a sacrilegious film.  It's a comedy about what people usually make of themselves when they take themselves to seriously.    Wink Wink, nudge nudge, say no more.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|This is an adult movie. What I mean by that is children wouldnt understand the point of this film. I mean come on, culinary art? Why would that even interest kids? It didnt even interest me and I'm 24. It wasn't funny or cute it was just odd. Of course the computer work on this is fantastic, but that is where it stops. I do not understand why so many people love this film. I was utterly bored and dissinterested in it from the beginning.
0517147688|4.0|The Jane Austen collection is a complete volume of her novels that are being presented this season by Public Television stations across the USA.  I like this book because it provides me with the actual novel from which the TV productions were derived.  The only problem with the book is that it is a bit heavy to hold.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|I have never read the book, but the film seemed a bit rushed. And I don't know why it would be titled Northanger Abbey when the location was barely in the movie and only then, towards the end. Some of the characters could have been better developed, and the film could have been a bit longer and it would have been a truly nice viewing experience.
B0010ZR160|5.0|If you are a masochist who likes depressing movies, this is the product for you.<br />A young couple tries to run a detective agency in a not so high class part of Boston, and gets involved in a missing child case, which very soon and very fast outgrows their capabilities and experience. She has soft knees, while he tries to find his way through amazingly unclear constellations, which force him to  take hasty moral decisions.<br />The basic story is not mainly about corruption, as the Amazon text above claims, but about various shades of vigilantism and abuses of the judicial system for other ways of personal enrichment.<br />Ben Affleck may have found his calling as a director; his Boston is nearly on par with Clint's in Mystic River, both based on Dennis Lehane novels. His brother is the right guy for the Parsivalesque hero. So is Ed Harris in his version of a cop, finally not in a silly part like in National Treasure.
B0010ZR160|2.0|I had heard a lot of good about this film so I decided to check it out. Well, I was truly into it and the mystery surrounding the characters that I had my hopes up for a (finally) great movie in 2007. Weeeellll, then the end happened and I think my jaw dropped because I was in such shock. And not because it was good, but because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was just so wrong and odd and ridiculous that it actually made me hate the movie altogether. It truly was a great film until that point. I could not believe I had wasted my time. What a dissapointment.
0060872675|3.0|Where's My Cow? is a tie-in with Pratchett's Discworld novel Thud!. It is ostensibly a children's book, although the target audience is quite obviously Discworld fans of all ages. This is perfectly in keeping with the burgeoning number of Discworld-related books that have been cranked out lately.<br /><br />This is not, as might be expected, the version that appears in that book. Instead, Where's My Cow? is about Sam Vimes reading Where's My Cow? to his son, just as he did in Thud!. Mild silliness ensues. The problem is that there isn't really anything here that wasn't also in Thud!.<br /><br />There have been a lot of complaints about Melvyn Grant's illustrations, mostly about his depiction of Vimes. Well, that's artistic expression for you. There's nothing terrible about the illustrations, even if they aren't great.<br /><br />Where's My Cow? is really for serious Discworld fans only, most of whom will only be inclined to read it once. If you aren't a Discworld fan, you won't get it.<br /><br />TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|I admit, it had me guessing and even surprised me. But all in all, I thought it was just good, not great. It had its moments, but it was bland at times and not too thought provoking.
B0011NVCO8|4.0|If you like American Gangster, you will love \\"Mr. Untouchable.\\"  It is a real life DOCUMENTARY on Leroy \\"Nicky\\" Barnes, who was in the same era as Frank Lucas, and did the exact same thing.  Barnes owned more of Harlem than Frank did.  This movie didn't portray Barnes a whole lot, in my opinion, Barnes was way more ahead than Frank was.  The movie was more drama than action, Mr. Untouchable is RAW and has the actual people from Nicky's gang through the entire thing.  Rent it, you will not be dissappointed.  On another note, I think it's funny how these guys were both big and bad and yet when they get busted, they ratted out everyone.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This film is very effective in portraying what I imagine was an utterly horrible time in history. And it really is all thanks to Adrien Brody who was utter perfection in this. He never overdid it and his performace was gut wrenching. Everybody should see this movie. Words can't really give it justice.

B00001U0E1|4.0|This movie is almost perfect. It has the perfect amout of comedy and to counteract that, the perfect amount of angst. It is delectable almost. The acting is so pure and refreshing that I couldn't help but smile at times. I really enjoyed the interactions between Gwyneth's character and Josheph's. They looked perfect together and completely believable. Bravo to both of them. The supporting cast was just as perfect supplying the comic relief and the best of times. I can watch this over and over again.
B00003CXSM|2.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater and was just really glad that my date (and not I) was paying of us to see it.  Boring, derivative, predictable.  The whole premise is bad to begin with.  If you're going to make a movie about people behaving badly (or isn't betraying your fiancee any big deal anymore?) then at least have the courage to let them actually behave badly.  No, this movie is all tame sexy (she gets drunk and rubs up against him like a cat in heat - he turns her down, (and my memory is fuzzy here) I think because she's drunk, not because of the nice girl he'll be marrying in a few days.  Or does she kick him out?  Who cares?  In real life if the man is on a date with another woman who knows his fiancee, he's certainly not going to turn into a gentleman at the last minute.  Everything in this movie is kind of half-hearted and weak, including the acting.<br /><br />But this movie does get two stars.  You know why?  Do a web search on either star and look at them for a while.  An hour and a half of that is worth at least one star.
B00080ZG10|4.0|The acting in this is top notch. Everyone did such a fantastic job, especially Leonardo and Cate. Perfect casting. The film itself was maybe a tad overlong, but it did a great job in conveying the emotions of the character role and what he went through. Howard Hughes seemed like a complicated character and I thought Scorsese did a fantastic job of portraying him. The imagery in the film is also quite stunning. If you like character driven films, this is a great choice.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful, well-made movies I have ever seen. Pai's story is truly touching. Watching it pleasantly and realistically reminds me of the time I spent in New Zealand.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|When the five disc Complete Collector's Edition of Blade Runner was released in December it was a cause for rejoicing among the many Blade Runner fans who made Ridley Scott's 1982 film a cult hit. The film, based upon Phillip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was a critical failure when it was released but with constant tweaking by the director has reached cult status. The presentation offered in this package is probably the must complete coolection of edits and variations of any film on the market today and Warner Brothers must be commended for the effort put forth here.<br /><br />The package opens with the 2007 Final Cut of the film. Introduced by Scott as his perferred cut the film features added materials (albeit one short scene) resynched dialogue in a few scenes and a face replacement that was long overdue in another critical scene. The Final Cut is essentially the Director's Cut of the 1982 International Version without the voice over. The Final Cut features three commentaries: by Scott;by writers Hampton Fancher and David Peeples with added comments by Producer Michael Deeley and Production Executive Katherine Haber; and by the films design team including Syd Mead, Laurence Paull, David Snyder, Douglas  Trumball and others.<br /><br />The Second Disc features the 3.5 hour making of feature Dangerous Days. This film interviews all of the surviving member of the cast and crew and presents possibly the most in depth making of feature I have ever seen.<br /><br />Disc Three is the film archive and presents the three versions of the film that  have been seen in theatres up to now. This was one of the reasons that I bought the set. It is here that the casual viewer finally gets the  long unavailable Theatrical Cut from 1982. This is the version with the voice over narration that Ridley Scott is so critical of. This version has many fans and there have been complaints over the years about its lack of availability. In my own view this is the version that I  perfer the best having only been able to see the \\"Director's Cut\\" in the late 1990's. The International Theatrical Cut (1982)is  presented next with its few seconds of added violence. This version also contains the voice over narration. The 1992 Director's Cut minus voice over and with the infamous added unicorn scene rounds out the disc.<br /><br />Disc Four is titled Enhancement Files and contains a plethora of bonus features divided into three catagories: Inception, Fabrication and Longevity. These may be played all together or separately. If played together make sure that you go back and listen to the audio only interview clips with writer Phillip K. Dick for his unique insight on the production. There are also three separate features on the importance of the poster design, a discussion of whether Harrison Ford's character is really a replicant and a discussion on the film's influence on other filmakers.<br /><br />Disc Five contains the rarely seen Workprint Version of the film. This version with some 70 plus variations from the released versions is closer in spirit to the Final Cut. Do not miss the commentary on this version by author Paul Sammon. Sammon wrote Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner and his commentary is probably the best of the four commentaries presented. Also on this dis is the featurette All Our Future Varients detailing the  differences between the versions and the Final Cut.<br /><br />All in all this is a detailed set which may be too much for the more casual fan but it does give a complete look into the making of the film and is highly recommended.ving only been able to see the \\"Director's Cut\\" in the late 1990's.

B000EULJLU|5.0|This Album is more then creation. It shows the complex works of Adam Jones<br />at his best. This is by far the best Album ever produced by Tool. There is a dark secret that lies within the lyrics of each song. Adam Jones is the modern day Jimmy Hendrix with his complex and unique playing style. I highly recommend this agressive then subtle Album by Tool.

B000002U82|5.0|What more can be said after winning Album of the year twelve years in a row. There is no comparison to Waters Barrett and Gilmore. Forty years of non stop creativity and still going strong.
B000V39KDO|1.0|I love action and fighting movies and history.  I was excited that a movie was being made about Battle of Thermopylae.  I thought this movie had a chance to be great.  The slow-mo and fantasy aspect to me was less thrilling than a more realistic movie.
B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|I have bought over one hundred of these DVDs. So many people were not aware of the complicated mind and lyrics of Adam Jones. This DVD takes it one step further. Tool does rock and rule the music Industry.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This is the perfect addition to any Madonna fan.  The CD has an awesome collection of music with each song a little different from when she originally released it.  But, that's the case any time she's in concert.  The real winner here is the DVD of her concert.  Madonna goes all out with everything she does...and this is no exception.  You will want to watch it over and over.
B000000993|5.0|This CD is like taking a journey forward in time. Tool has the creative ability that lacks in the music Industry. Maynard plays his role well in this awesome CD by Tool.
B000002N3N|3.0|At first listening to this CD, the music sounds a lot like that on the Watermark album.  But upon a second listening, the music sounds different, though of the same style.  The tone and pace of the music on this album is similar to that of other albums, but the melodies are different.  This album has both instrumental and singing, and both are enjoyable.  This album makes for great background music, whether over dinner, eating, or napping.
B00000099Y|5.0|A complex autimation of ones mind is how I define the works of Tool in<br />this CD that lies hidden away from the normal Tool fan. Being a Professional musician I am able to relate to this off beat Album produced by Tool.
B000I2JKFQ|5.0|First off, I'll let everyone here know that when i saw this movie I've never seen [[ASIN:0782009980 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]](shame on me) and so cannot compare it to that movie. I've never seen a re-make of it before, nor have I read the book. I went into this movie with (mostly) an open mind expecting some virus fun, and that exactly what I got.<br /><br />Walking out of the theaters on opening night, I remember my sister calling Invasion a \\"glorified zombie movie\\" and I could not agree more. No, this is not a \\"Zombie\\" movie in any strict sense of the word. The infected talk, drive cars, never show emotion, and remember their past lives. They do not try to eat their victims, and cannot tell right away who is and who isn't infected. That said however, there is just something about the way they move, the way they don't require nourishment, and just walk around mindlessly infecting others with their alien virus that makes them very zombie like. They're not [[ASIN:B0002IQNAG Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)]] zombies, and they're not [[ASIN:B000TJBN80 28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)]] zombies either; these binges are a completely new sort of zombie, sort of the Stephen King zombie for those of you who've read [[ASIN:B000JSDPQO Cell: A Novel]].<br /><br />Anyway, to the movie. It starts out pretty awkwardly to be honest. The shuttle crashes and from the very beginning we can tell that something is wrong, other than the guy turning into goo in his bed. We start to notice, very slowly, that some people are just... not acting like people. They're smiling too much, they're too nice, they start throwing up in your coffee, you know, friendly stuff like that. At first everyone thinks there's some sort of flue going around but pretty soon we start to realize that something terrible, or maybe not so terrible, is going on.<br /><br />The horror is that some alien virus has infected most of the world's population without us even being aware of it. this virus, with is passed from one person to another though bodily fluids much like in 28 Weeks Later, changes a humans personality so that they become very mellow, emotionless, and their only drive is to infect others and kill the immune. As the virus spreads, instead of worldwide chaos and anarchy that we see in most virus movies, wars and violence seem to stop everywhere it goes. US troops pull out of Iraq, Israel and Palestine end years of fighting, and President Bush meets with Chavez from Venezuela. Almost all the world's problems end overnight as this virus takes a hold.<br /><br />And that's the terror and dilemma of Invasion. Is this virus something that should be stopped at all cost, or is it a god given cure for our aggressive tendencies? Is it the cure for violence, war, and poverty? Should we fight this change in our human nature, or should we accept it? That question is always in the back of your head while watching this film, but at the same time once you look at the infected, you know you don't want to be one of them. Even though you know that the world would be a much safer place if we were all like them, you still know that it is better to be violent and human than peaceful and without a soul.<br /><br />The only real problem I had was that the ending was a little too convenient and abrupt. I mean, I liked the concept that they were going for, but they needed to milk the ending more than they did. The movie was going on all cylinders and then, with little warning, it ends. Despite this though, I found the movie very enjoyable. I walked out of that theater praising Invasion as much as I could, and you should too.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, I've finally gone back and seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie as well as its 1978 remake. As much as I loved this version of the classic tale, I have to admit both those versions are much better then this and can understand why some older fans would give this one a negative review. This Invasion is no where near asgood as the older versions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.<br /><br />Re-watch value; high.n't make it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.     Re-watch value; high.
B000OCY7JE|3.0|The infamous Danish director Susanne Bier has established herself as the so-called queen of piercing relationship melodramas (bordering on soap-operas), filmed in a style reminiscent of Dogme (natural lights, handheld DV cameras), only with a script and a soundtrack. Her \\"Open Hearts\\" dealt with the consequences of physical paralysis, and what that does to a blossoming relationship. \\"Brothers\\" told a story of two, um, brothers, one of them back from torn Afghanistan, competing for the affection of a beautiful woman (Connie Nielsen).   Bier's poignancy, the immediacy that carry her films, and the truthful dialogue that resonates have, so far, overshadowed her over-reliance on close-ups of the protagonists' eyes, insistent sentimentality, and a pessimistic tone that can frankly be a major downer. Bier's US feature debut, \\"Things We Lost in the Fire\\", got criticized for an overexuberance of those latter qualities. Though \\"After the Wedding\\" is a stark and powerful drama, it also suffers from an unremittingly dismal tone. It seems as if Bier, instead of infusing her films with a much-needed sense of humor and love for life, has delved even deeper into the sadness and wretchedness that people can inflict upon each other.   Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) works in an orphanage in India. It faces closure due to financial issues, so he goes back to Danemark to ask for a grant from multi-millionaire Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard). Jorgen immediately begins to play mind games with Jacob, telling him he will \\"consider\\" him as one of the main contenders for the million-dollar grant, but needs a few days to think it over. Since Jacob has nothing to do, Jorgen invites him to his daughter's wedding. Jacob arrives, suspecting nothing. And then he recognizes Jorgen's wife...   From this point on, the film goes into plot complications that I will not divulge. I will say one thing - it's all downhill. As lies are unmasked, and old secrets surface, things only get worse.   Granted, \\"After the Wedding\\"is a class act. It's assured, mature filmmaking, with a clear sense of purpose. The acting is beautiful throughout - it really is hard to pinpoint a stand-out, everyone's so good - as is the script, the film's deliberately slowly unfolding plot  gradually revealing its many mysteries. But the film is also claustrophobically depressing, with barely any humor relief from all the drama. There's even a clumsily added (seemingly last-minute) sub-plot involving the daughter and her new husband's infidelity, which seems wholly unnecessary, apart from adding even more weight to an already weighty drama.   As for the film's Dogme-like style, its pretentiousness distracts from the plot in some crucial spots as much as it entices you to watch in others. I'm a big fan of Dogme films, but here, after the 100th aforementioned lingering close-up of someone's eyes, artistry is toying with self-parody, and that's not a good thing for a film in which the inter-weaving of style has to be seamless.  So, while better written, directed and acted than the majority of Hollywood dramas, \\"After the Wedding\\" will not appeal to those who try to avoid depression-trip movies. In typical Bier fashion, it raises a lot of questions of love, death, the choices that we make and their consequences, and only provides answers to some, while leaving the rest for our deliberation. Maybe it's time for the director to attempt a new approach; she can remain an auteur but try a different genre, for example. As it is, \\"After the Wedding\\" is competent: powerful but unoriginal.   And depressing. Boy, is it depressing.
B000XA5K48|1.0|I have never seen a movie, where the opening scene is so terrible that, I wanted to walk out and not even attempt to watch the rest. If you like dull, aimless characters who literally \\"shoot\\" everything.. from umbilical cords to gunshots during a sex scene, this is the movie for you. It even has lactating prostitutes and the main character acts like bugs bunny, always with a carrot in his mouth.     I can't believe Clive Owen made such pointless trash. I normally find something redeemable about bad movies.. but this didn't have anything to save it, in my opinion.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|Now this isn't a conventional film by any standards. The always-inventive director Julie Taymor (\\"Titus\\", the underrated \\"Frida\\") gives the finger to such things as a straightforward narrative and character development, and focuses instead on magnifying her hallucinatory visions, to the Beatles soundtrack. The result is a series of beautiful sketches, pretty to look at... but to relate to it would be impossible.   This is not a biography of the Beatles, for those naive enough to  expect that. Nor is it a musical exploration of the changing 1960s. \\"Across the Universe\\" does take place in that decade, but never approaches anything close to making any sort of a statement. The best way to define the film would be: it's Julie Taymor's allegorical glance at the 1960s, through Beatles glasses.  Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and Jude (Jim Sturgess) fall in love. Then Lucy's brother Max (Joe Anderson) gets shipped off to Vietnam. That's basically the rough premise of the film.   The Beatles have always had one foot planted firmly on the druggy side, what with all the Yellow Submarine trippiness and otherwordly vibes. Taymor exploits that side of the Beatles, not in a grungy Oliver Stone's \\"Doors\\" sort of way, but in a lyrical, personal one. The film's alignment of music and images is hit-and-miss though, depending on your interpretation of the songs, and as means of supporting the already feeble thread of a plot-line it fails quite miserably. The film never stirrs, not as a love story, and not as an anti-war film. The images vary so much in color intensity and mood, that watching \\"Across the Universe\\" is like being inside a kaleidoscope and not knowing on which acidic color to focus.   The actors do a good job singing and conveying the emotion of each tune, and yet - though the lack of character development is intentional - at times the film cries out for at least a shade of genuine human feeling, and not a stylized interpretation of one. Julie Taymor does an excellent job conveying her personal hallucinatory perspective of the Beatles, and it's fascinating to the eye, but she falls quite short on exploring the timelessness of either their music or their time, and that's a disappointment to the heart.
0743486285|5.0|Wow! I learned alot about junkies as well Nikki Sixx. I read this in 3 days because it was impossible to put down.
B00122O34O|3.0|Great movie, great soundtrack, blah blah blah. Problem - when i pop it in my computer, the album name and track titles don't match the CD booklet - my computer reads it as a Moldy Peaches album and all the title tracks go with whatever songs were on The Moldy Peaches self-titled album. Does anyone else have this problem or did i just get a funky CD?
B000PE8DXM|4.0|My son loves this parking garage.  It is a durable, classic, wooden toy.  This is a cherished toy that will be kept to pass to future generations.  My only complaint is that the ramps are not attached.  The garage has short pegs which fit into the holes in the bottom of each ramp.  They don't lock into place and come off frequently.
015626224X|4.0|The specifics and cultural differences concerning poverty between Paris and London are fascinating in their own right -- even to the extent that such differences affect the pace and style of Orwell's writing. The time in Paris is compressed, dense and descriptive, charged with interaction, chasing down chances at money or employment, complete with full-on brushes with the category of people known as \\"the employed\\". London is more mannered and given to lists as the dispossessed endure institutionalized segregation from society, making forced marches from one \\"spike\\" to another as the loitering laws so clearly demanded.<br /><br />Yet even though Orwell's prose is concerned with the specifics of poverty during the 1930s, 75 years later much of what he identifies as the stigma surrounding those that suffer in poverty persists and even grows. Because here, a few moments into 2008 we learn that those living in poverty in the United States increased by nearly 5 million people since the beginning of the \\"new\\" millennium, with doubtless more joining the ranks as punitive credit rates and the sub-prime mortgage scheme raid neighborhoods and livelihoods. Let's keep this book and Orwell in mind and remain aware of what has sadly proven to be an all too reliable marker against which human progress must still be measured.
B00000DHTF|5.0|I love this collection. It has tons of material never previously released and it's so cool to discover all of them. Some real standouts for me are Loose Ends, Sad Eyes, and Thundercrack. With over 50 Springsteen songs to enjoy you just can't go wrong-there's something that fits whatever mood you're in at that moment.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie has all the aspects I love witches and pirates and a little strife between the main couple!!!!!    If you buy this movie trust me you'll like it if not love it!!!!
B000ZK4466|4.0|I first stumbled upon The Mars Volta when I was in college. Not really into the progressive rock scene at all, I was stunned to find that I not only liked their first album, De-Loused In the Comatorium, but simply couldn't get enough of it. I spent countless hours rocking out to it in my dorm room, annoying roommates and probably the whole hall as well. Their second album, Frances the Mute, was equally as impressive, and perhaps more intriguing and challenging than their first. Therefore, it was a bit disheartening for me when they released their third album, Amputechture. It seemed to lack the focus of their previous works, often placing emphasis on extended complex freak-out sessions and putting secondary importance on Cedric Bixler-Zavala's vocals. Melodies seemed patched together, and afraid to take center stage. As a huge fan of vocals in music (indeed, it is almost always the most important thing), I was completely disenchanted with this approach and was equally as disappointed in the album. The Bedlam In Goliath has similarly disappointing sections, though I am pleased to say that the album as a whole is a step in the right direction for The Mars Volta.<br /><br />Opener \\"Aberinkula\\" opens the album at full force, charging out of the gate like a bull. The song features a trotting bass line and absolutely mind-blowing percussion from new drummer, Thomas Pridgen. The vocal melody is uncomplicated, but still somewhat catchy. Cedric belts out \\"Have you seen the living, tired of their own shells?\\" in the chorus, and his piercing voice is well-suited to the musical chaos that it accompanies. The song eventually breaks down with a freeform saxophone solo, which the Mars Volta has basically perfected at this point. An infectious, guitar-led groove carries the song to it's end, and everything sounds great.<br /><br />Amputechture's biggest problem rears it's ugly head again on \\"Metatron,\\" where the music once again takes priority over the vocal melody. Cedric's voice is biting and forceful, but it is second to all the organized chaos that envelopes it. It's a shame too, as the lyrics are some of the album's more interesting. The instrumentation is unrelenting, as it is throughout most of Bedlam, and if you find yourself placing importance on that, \\"Metatron\\" may be a favorite for you. It is definitely reminiscent of \\"Tetragrammaton.\\" \\"Ilyena\\" is a much cooler song in general. It begins with an incredibly distorted, wet vocal solo. When Cedric sings, \\"I need a brand new skin,\\" it is undeniably awesome! After about a minute of that, the song busts out with a funky guitar riff and salsa percussion that just begs to be danced to. It's a very jam-band type of song, and doesn't scream of the forced complexities of many Mars Volta songs. Every aspect of this song is virtually flawless, and you'll undoubtedly find yourself singing along or dancing after a few listens. It's got a very cool drum outro too that is unfortunately ruined by some unnecessary distorted vocals.<br /><br />\\"Wax Simulacra\\" is filled to the brim with typically cryptic lyrics (\\"I bring an avalanche of Toltec bones. Contaminated cravings if you choose to play something that aches for a spill.\\") It is a very vocally intensive song, but it sounds as if they are constantly doing battle with the instrumentation to see who will be the focus of the song. In the end it's such a mess that it's hard to focus on anything. Fortunately, \\"Goliath\\" completely voids any problems that it's predecessor had simply by being relentlessly amazing. Mars Volta fans will immediately recognize the song as a reworked, sped-up version of \\"Rapid Fire Tollbooth,\\" a song from Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's last solo album (and from the band's live show in the past). It is, without a doubt, the standout track on the album. It's the first time on the album that Cedric gives us a vocal melody worth remembering, and despite it's 7+ minute runtime, it never feels too long or repetitive. Indeed, if anything, Ifound myself wanting it to continue. The band feels focused and tight throughout, only getting out of control when absolutely necessary.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the momentum built by that song is instantly crushed by \\"Tourniquet Man,\\" a song that sounds entirely too much like Limp Bizkit's cover of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" for me to take seriously. All Mars Volta albums have had a radio-friendly song, and this one just sounds like a failed attempt at one. Despite a convincing performance from Cedric, it gets a big \\"meh\\" from me. Likewise, \\"Cavalettas\\" struggles to find any meaningful reason for existence. The longest track on the album, it is unbearably repetitive and uninteresting, which is something I never thought I'd say about The Mars Volta. The band seems to get lazy and can't find a way to transition from one section to the next, opting instead to just drop out all the instrumentation for a few seconds before jamming back in. This happens 7 times (really). Not even manic sax and flute solos can save this song from the skip button.<br /><br />\\"Agadez\\" picks things back up. Again, the band comes together and blends perfectly, resulting in a much more satisfying experience. Cedric syncopates, \\"I'm nowhere near this place you wear. It's unforgivable. It knows that I am visible,\\" over some truly great instrumentation. The song breaks down at 3:45 and adds in some ethnic drums and more subtle vocals before picking things back up for a more appropriate Mars Volta-esque freak-out. It's a great song! \\"Askepios\\" is really just a waste of time. It's 5 minutes of uninspired drivel. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why the band insists on continually squandering any ounce of momentum that they have for stuff like this. \\"Ouroborous\\" is a very vocally focused song. As such, I instantly connected with it. It features Cedric crooning softly over some harmonium-like synths, singing, \\"Of all the warnings that you gave me with all components in the fault. Have you heard me scraping? It'll be hard to hold.\\" It's one of the album's cooler moments, and by far its most unique.<br /><br />\\"Soothsayer\\" begins with enchanting strings and a lazily moving guitar solo. Cedric's vocals are haunting as they sing, \\"This deceit has no arms. Bended will, take what's yours.\\" It is a beautiful song that never overdoes it, and everything just seems to work. Surely the strings were an excellent touch that pushed the song over the edge. The songs end with creepy \\"Requiem for a Dream-ish\\" violins and a reverbed choir. It's a very nice touch. Bedlam's closer is \\"Conjugal Burns\\" and once again, Cedric treats us to some impressive vocal stylings. When he sings, \\"I got a pain inside that'll rip through the fabric of time,\\" I literally perked up because it was so unexpected. It's a solid song and it keeps it at a relatively short runtime (for a Mars Volta song, 6:35). It seems out of place as a closer though. Musically, \\"Soothsayer\\" seems much more appropriate. Still, I can't detract from it's greatness.<br /><br />The Bedlam In Goliath is undoubtedly The Mars Volta's loudest album to date, and long-time fans will undoubtedly be pleased with what they hear. Unfortunately, there are a few songs that just don't work and should have been left in the studio. Indeed, at nearly 76 minutes in length, The Bedlam In Goliath could have used a nice trimming. As a result, the album feels less cohesive than their previous albums, and is definitely more enjoyable to listen to in small doses. However, I have found myself entirely satisfied with the album's better moments, and can therefore overlook its missteps along the way. For fans like me who felt a little disenchanted after Amputechture, rest assured that The Bedlam In Goliath is a much better album and worth picking up and investing your time in. Like all Mars Volta albums, it is not for everybody, but it is definitely something that deserves to be noticed.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Aberinkula\\"<br />2. \\"Ilyena\\"<br/>3. \\"Goliath\\"<br />4. \\"Agadez\\"<br />5. \\"Ouroborous\\"<br /><br />7 out of 10 Starse of the album's cooler moments, and by far its most unique.    \\"Soothsayer\\" begins with enchanting strings and a lazily moving guitar solo.

B00005JPUN|4.0|To say that The Invasion had a troubled production history is a mild understatement. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel set out to make an artier and edgier take on Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel, [[ASIN:0684852586 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]. However, the studio did not like his version and producer Joel Silver brought in his pals, the Wachowski brothers to rewrite the ending and director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) to reshoot it. The result was a film that flopped both commercially and critically. Now that all of the dust has settled and it is finally being released on DVD, The Invasion can be reassessed. Is it really that bad?<br /><br />There are a few annoying jumps in logic, like Carol abandoning her vehicle for no good reason and dropping a gun on two occasions that she could have used later on. For a supposedly intelligent character, she doesn't make very smart decisions at times.<br /><br />This is the fourth adaptation of Finney's novel and so far all of them have paled in comparison to the first one, directed by Don Siegel, which was also the most faithful to the source material. The reason that this story keeps being remade is that the allegory for the stifling oppressive nature of conformity is so powerful and still relevant after all these years.<br /><br />While the aliens offer a world without pain and suffering, it is also one without joy and happiness. The Invasion updates this classic story for our times as it channels some of the anxieties of our age: avian flu, SARS, 9/11, the Patriot Act, and so on. In a nice change, this film also deviates from previous adaptations by going in a different direction with how it ends. Some may cry sell-out but it feels true to the rest of the film. The Invasion is hardly as awful as some critics would have you believe. If you go in with low expectations you may come away pleasantly surprised by the end result.<br /><br />\\"We've Been Snatched Before: Invasion in Media History\\" examines how the Body Snatcher films commented on the times in which they were made and this new one is no different. This featurette also examines the fears that the film addresses, including virus-based threats and how he deal with them, in this informative extra.<br /><br />\\"The Invasion: A New Story\\" takes a look at how this film updates Finney's original story for our times in this brief, pretty standard promotional featurette.<br /><br />\\"The Invasion: On the Set\\" examines how they shot on location whenever possible and picked Washington, D.C. because it is the centre of power in the United States.<br /><br />\\"The Invasion: Snatched\\" takes a look at how the alien menace spreads in the film.e times in which they were made and this new one is no different.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Amazing second album for a truly great band. Even better than previous release 'One Day Remains'. From the fast paced intro \\"Ties that Bind\\" to slow moving ballads such as \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Watch Over You\\". \\"Rise Today\\" is a great single but this album offers so much more and you will not be disappointed. Forget Creed, this is a fresh taste and hopefully just the tip of the iceberg of what Miles and Mark still have to come.
0452287022|4.0|Johannes Vermeer, one of the famous Dutch painting masters from the seventeenth century, in the middle of his career created a portrait of a girl with a pearl earring, in a turban, often called \\"The Dutch Mona Lisa\\". The girl from the painting looks at us with mysterious expression, sometimes appears sad, sometimes hiding a smile... What is her story?<br /><br />Tracy Chevalier created one possible version in her novel \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" where some historical facts mix with fiction to create the beautiful story, vivid and colorful, reminiscent of Vermeer's paintings... The atmosphere of the book is incredible, unique, as if it were an account of an eye-witness and not the figment of the author's imagination.<br /><br />Griet, a sixteen-year old daughter of a glass blower from Delft, disabled after a work-related accident, , from an impoverished, but hard- working family, inherited her father's artistic sensitivity. She starts a job as a servant at Vermeer's house and the painter becomes intrigued seeing her vegetable compositions. When Vermeer notices Griet, her life changes - she becomes his aide and, finally, a model for the famous portrait. She get a chance, but at the same time enters the different world, full of obstacles unfamiliar for her, and she needs to be careful. Their fascination with each other cannot last long...<br /><br />In Holland of the 1600s the social order is strictly defined. The Protestants are completely separate from Catholics, the poor from the rich, the masters from the servants. This is why Griet and Vermeer do not even think about a romantic relationship, despite their similar view of the world. Johannes has to paint to feed his ever-growing family and satisfy his possessive, jealous wife, Catharina, who except being the mother of his children does not have much in common with him, and his mother-in-law, the greedy and conniving Maria Thinks, who manages very well to get more and more orders for his paintings. The portrait of a servant and the growing, although mainly spiritual, intimacy of the artist with Griet cause tension in the family and after a while Griet's dismissal seems inevitable and many intrigues and repressions from Vermeer's family members and friends make her leave.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|The hotness of Rupert P-J is the only thing this version of Persuasion has going for it.  Horrific, distracting acting in some key supporting roles (such as Charles and Mary Musgrove) is part of the problem, but worse is that this adaptation chooses long moments of Sally Hawkins staring meaningfully into the camera over actual development of the characters and advancement of the plot.  The 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds does a much better job of capturing the mood of the book and is infinitely more engaging.  Rent this one (or catch it on tv) for the eye candy if you like, but buy the earlier one for repeat viewing.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|I'm appalled that this CD only costs $13.95. Are you kidding me? I witnessed God's will manifested through J Dilla in the form of pure hip-hop on this Donuts LP. From a producer's standpoint, the level of complexity of Dilla's sequencing of music samples, voices, patches, and drums is of an almost unearthly quality. He's doing things with the MPC that will take more than a few generations of beat-makers and producers to figure out. Dilla's use of Motown influences, rare breaks, and soul vocal group harmonies, proves that he was a student of all music, not just hip-hop. How J Dilla was able to make this record fluid, cohesive, interesting, and completely bangin' throughout, with so many different influences, is completely mind boggling. It just has more soul than any recording I've heard in a long time. No disrespect to real emcees, but personally, I don't want to hear any rhyming over J Dilla's tracks. I don't know if it's just this album itself, or the fact that I grew up on the type of music that Dilla is sampling here, or maybe the fact that I'm a producer as well. But in my opinion, and from a producer/deejay/musician's standpoint, J Dilla's Donuts is a masterpiece. Brilliant. Ask Questlove. If you're not a person who digs through record crates, or spends major scrilla on those rare soul CDs, or a producer who grew up listening to soul music, you're not gonna fully get the significance of this record. Pete Rock, I'm sorry brotha. J Dilla's Donuts just took the place of PeteStrumentals as my favorite hip-hop instrumental CD. Although, I did rock PeteStrumentals for 10 years straight. I thank God for sending J Dilla to us, and I thank J Dilla for providing us with the perfect sonic soundscape. This CD is unparaleled in it's creativity, and the depths of it's soul cannot be measured.

1594481717|5.0|Daniel Pink offers a quick test to see if his book pertains to your life. All he asks is for you to answer three questions. In regards to what you are doing for a living, ask yourself the following: Can someone oversees do it cheaper? Can a computer do it faster?  Is what I'm offering in demand in an age of abundance?      If one of the first two answers was \\"yes\\" or the third was \\"no,\\" then Pink believes that his book \\"A Whole New Mind\\" will allow you to overcome these problems.     Pink is spot on with his remarks about the coming Conceptual Age. He keeps the book at relaxed pace which never makes it feel to daunting. The stories from his personal life give the book a friendly tone as he uses them to help show how his points pertain to real life situations.     Abundance, Asia, and automation are the three obstacles affecting American jobs. The surplus of goods is allowing consumers to be pickier about which ones they purchase. The lower production costs brought on by Asian workers and computerized machines is lowering the prices of many goods. These are all tasks performed by the left side of the brain, the one that synthesizes. Six new skills will be needed to make goods and American workers competitive again. These skills are oriented more with the right side of the brain.     Design is the first one that Pink covers. He states that design is one of the few things that can make products stand out from others in a time when all goods are equally priced. Story is the next one covered. Pink makes the argument that human brains are geared to understand stories and not logical sequences. Powerpoint presentations, he says, should be more story-oriented. Symphony, the ability to see the big picture, is a skill that will be needed in the future. Empathy is a skill that has still not been able to be replicated by computers. This makes it crucial in the future workforce. Play is the fifth skill. Activities of the future will be more productive if they mix work with play. Finally, meaning is the last one of Pink's six skills. Here he suggests finding something else, possibly a spiritual belief, to help one find happiness in life. Each section is followed by a sub-section explain how one can go about strengthening each of the six skills.     This is a great book for anyone who wants to know what jobs will be in demand in the future. It seems to be the perfect companion to Thomas L. Friedman's [[ASIN:0312425074 The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century]]. Pink has accomplished his goal of explaining that the future will be ruled by those who use a whole new mind; a mind that effortlessly combines that strengths of the left and right hemispheres.
1558908382|1.0|This movie is horrible. Most of the material in the movie is irrelavent. Most of the parts that are supposed to be funny, aren't. Frankly, it's a boring movie. Whoever wrote the script either had a boring personality or an odd sense of humor.

B000ZK4466|5.0|I really like the direction that they went here. There are four more songs on here than amputecture and they are all pretty lengthy, there just seems to be alot more material here compared to the last albums, there is no white noise, each track is a full song (except for maybe tourniquet man). llyena is probably one of the coolest tracks on there, and the soothsayer is just eerie. There seems to be lest instances where the music quiets down for a giutar solo, which was popular on amputecture, also there doesn't seem to be any really different guitar effects, you can tell omar really has his tone dialed in on this album (even more so than the last album) and a reverse delay seems to make an appearance on alot of different tracks, also there is plenty of wah. Awesome album, I guess if I could explain it in one word I would say \\"timeless\\" I think it will be around for a long time and I think that I will be listening to it for years to come, an instant classic.  Oh yeah....could someone post the album booklet pics, I bought mine from the mp3 store lol....
B00005JPXY|5.0|After reading the reviews posted here regarding this movie, I went to see it with nearly no expectaions. WOW! this is one of the best monster movies I have ever seen. It felt so real, because of the first prospective style, that I felt like I was there with them. The camera jerkiness is appropiate and not as overwhelming as I expected. There is a little bit of everything in this movie; Some shots of the falling buildings and running crowds will unfortunately remind you of the 9/11 tragedy, so watch it at your own discretion. The small nasty looking creatures are similar to some oversized face huggers from the movie ALIENS and some shots in the movie will remind you of that. Yes there is virtually no explanation about the origins of the monster and it's actions, but this is not that kind of movie. I also felt that the end was not disappointing either (definitely open for a sequel), this is an amateur movie shot by a bunch of people who were unlucky enough to get stock right in the middle. By the way, the monster is seen enough to get an idea of what it looks like, and it is about as big as godzilla but the arm span is much wider. Overall:EXCELLENT!
1594481717|4.0|Daniel Pink begins A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future discussing the brain. He explains the left and right sides of the brain. The left deals with logic and analyzing while the right is more creative, recognizing patterns and emotions. Pink states that the once more important left side will be replaced with the right side as the higher valued side.   Pink gives a number of reasons as to why this is happening. He claims an abundance of products has devalued left brain thinking. Right brain thinking is now needed to be creative and set these products apart from each other. Another example is the large number of jobs going overseas.   Pink says we are moving from the information age to the conceptual age. One of the six essential senses to master is Design. Design is composed of two elements, utility and significance. Utility is simply the functionality of the item. Significance is being creative beyond analytical thinking. Story allows people to connect on a deeper level by adding an emotional context around fact, says Pink. For example, medicine is incorporating right sided thinking into their approach towards treatment. Students at Columbia University Medical School take a narrative medicine class for this. Pink explains that another part of right brain thinking is Symphony, the ability to see relationships. Pink argues that symphony allows people to find relations which aren't normally seen, leading to new ideas or inventions. This invaluable aspect can be used for almost anything.   Pink talks about Empathy and how important it is to have compassion for others. The next sense was Play. Examples of Play are video games, which allow people to relax and actually increase certain right brained abilities. Humor is also a powerful tool for Play. The last trait, Meaning, which in is personal happiness and purpose in life. Pink talks about people using labyrinths to assist in finding meaning. In conclusion, Pink's book will allow people to learn touse their \\"whole mind\\" in order to be successful in life.
B000002TQV|4.0|There are many very informative reviews for Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\", but I decided to go ahead and put in my two cents worth.  I am not a long-time fan.  I just recently bought a few of their albums.  After listening to them, I came to the conclusion (as have others) that this would be the best place for someone new to the band's music to start out with.  The reasons are simple.  The Bends is one of the bands best albums, and it is indeed the most approachable.  One of the things I dis-liked the most with \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\" was the vocals.  The Bends definately have the most comprehensible lyrics of the three.  So, Like I said, this is my recommendation of the place to start getting into Radiohead.  If you like this one, then you can explore further, but be cautious.

B000ZK4466|4.0|(The Bedlam in Goliath\\" by The Mars Volta)<br /><br />On their fourth studio album, The Mars Volta have definitely decided not to take it easy.  From the very moment it starts until its ending 75 (!) minutes later, the band works in full steam ahead hyperdrive mode, rarely stopping for breath.  One could be halfway through the album before realizing the first track is even over.  On the upside, it shows a band determined to prove they're now the hardest working men in show business; on the downside, the songs tend to blend together into a massive rush of LOUDERFASTERNOW!!!  Although working with the same prog-punk blueprint they've been developing over the years, here they seem to reject the more jam-band approach of [[ASIN:B0007GAEW6 Frances the Mute]] or [[ASIN:B000GPI1BO Amputechture]].  All of the songs on the new album fall below the ten-minute mark, which for them is concise (disgruntled fans of the first album may want to check this one out).  Their love of latin rhythms continues, however, aided ably by new drummer Thomas Pridgen, who gives the impression he's actually two men.  The twin guitar attack of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and (former Chili Pepper) John Frusciante, while using every style they can think of (including feedback noise), here they at least stick to the song at hand.  This is not to say they're not coloring outside the lines, but they play it at such light-speed that the impression one gets is of Miles Davis' [[ASIN:B00004VWAF On the Corner]] interpreted by meth-addled robots.  Meanwhile, vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala sticks mainly to the upper registers of his voice and lets the words tumble out at such a rate thay a lyric sheet is necessary to know what they are.  This is not to say \\"understand,\\" though, \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\" is billed as (what else?) a concept album about a seemingly cursed ouija board that the band acquired in Jerusalem.  Hey, I don't make the news; I just report it.  If any of this sounds a bit daunting, that's probably because it's supposed to be.  The Mars Volta obviously don't appeal to casual listeners; in fact, die hard Rush or Tool fans may even run screaming from the room.  One of their major inspirations, Carlos Santana, would probably also be baffled.  Still, if you're already a fan of the band, or just want to test your fortitude as a music fan, this is the album you've been longing for.  Though one wishes they'd slow down sometimes--this album is all crescendo, all the time--this is no return to the form of their earlier work but another creative level entirely.  With their maximum-firepower approach, if The Mars Volta aren't the best band ever, they're certainly the most.it's supposed to be.

1594481717|4.0|Daniel Pink's book is a fun, interactive, and relaxing read.  No tough concepts here!  Pink dwells on topics that make us all feel comfortable, namely his sense of \\"Play\\" and the accompanying concept of laughter.  His occasional jokes and quotes provide the amusing aspect that continuously interests the reader.  \\"A Whole New Mind\\" progresses smoothly because Pink's concepts are related and easily comprehensible and because he does not dwell on any subject too long.  His \\"Six Senses,\\" above all are very understandable and applicable to most of us; his real-life and often personal examples strengthen and clarify his points.  Pink's book is a nice, fun, short read that can be simply a book of advice for some or a bible for future success for others.         A new \\"Conceptual Age\\" is on the rise.  Are we prepared to enter a new, right-brained era?  Pink argues that we have become very logical, analytical thinkers in a high-tech society.  Our technology has helped us succeed economically, until now.  We now see an abundance of inexpensive goods that seem bland and generic.  The United States economy is not growing as quickly since Asian countries produce most of our goods and services at unbeatable production prices.  Most importantly, Americans have computers doing much of our left-brain, logical thinking for us!  Pink's remedy involves reviving our right-brains: using instinctive and contextual thinking, utilizing our creativity simultaneously during tasks, and being able to piece ideas together to see the big picture in any situation.  Pink explicates six aptitudes that can help us exercise our right-brain thinking.  The first, \\"Design\\", requires that we use our creativity to produce more attractive items to compete with the bland and inexpensive goods from Asia.  Utility must now be matched with creativity.  \\"Play\\" is a sense that enkindles happiness and inventiveness in those who are able to unwind, especially in the workplace, and also has rejuvenating effectson adults.  \\"Story\\" assists us in arranging our ideas in the form of creative and effective narratives.  \\"Symphony\\" enables us to understand the details, but also to zoom out to see the big picture of an argument or the context of an idea.  \\"Empathy\\" opens a door to our connections with others and enables us to determine what we can provide for them.  The last sense is \\"Meaning.\\"  In a world of plenty and abundance, what better way than to pursue our purpose and spiritual fulfillment guides us to make goods or provide services that others truly need?         A Whole New Mind allows us to easily ponder how we could adopt Pink's ideas and goals because they are very plausible and within everyone's reach.  The portfolios he includes after each sense, the interactive part of the read, provide a creative link from \\"reading\\" to \\"doing.\\"  I doubt that most readers would complete all of the activities Pink suggests at the end of each chapter, but they reinforce his concepts and ideas very well.  Another reviewer sums up Pink's book: \\"Pink has not discovered a sure-fire cure for the job problems of the developed nations, but he deserves high marks for tackling forthrightly a baffling complex issue and coming up with specific suggestions that many people may find useful\\" (Cornish, par. 15).  I came across Pink's book in a persuasive language class and I found it to be a good hint for me, an engineering and \\"left-brain\\" student.  This book was a heads-up for me in other words.  My objective now is to not only strengthen my \\"right-brain\\" thinking, but to become a better-rounded person.  Pink writes that we should just be more creative; we should be more proficient in as many areas as possible, such as spirituality, physical health, etc.  Other college students, many of whom may be in my position, should take a look at this head-raiser!

0765357151|5.0|Richard Matheson wrote this book in 1954, and imagined into a future that was 1976.  It's a pretty amazing piece of writing for any time, but the very bleak nature of the entire book was pretty unusual for 1954.  It obviously came out of that whole paranoia about us destroying ourselves in an hydrogen bomb holocaust that was so prevalent in the '50s and '60s (ON THE BEACH, DR. STRANGELOVE, FAILSAFE, etc.)<br /><br />It tells the story, in about 150 pages, of a suburban man (Robert Neville), probably around age 35 or so, who is apparently the last man on earth after a horrible plague has infected the rest of humanity...leaving everyone dieing...and worst of all, the people who die come back as vampires.  It's almost like a zombie story...and in fact, the details of just what the vampires can do are the least interesting parts of the story.  What I really enjoyed were the very specific observations on Neville's emotions and actions during his time of extreme isolation and desolation.  He's lost a daughter and a wife to his disease.  He's now holed-up in his home...venturing out during sunny days for supplies, research books, and to shore up his home's defenses.  At night, he drinks a lot and endures the howls from the vampires who assemble outside his house each sunset to sunup.<br /><br />Neville is, after months alone, a man tormented by the past, by his own desires, and by sheer loneliness.  He lives wrecklessly, but not wrecklessly enough to actually want to die.  (Although there is one very exciting sequence when he's forgotten to wind his watch and he makes it back home a bit late.  Talk about tense!)  And occasionally he turns his attention to the idea of a \\"cure\\" for this plague, or at least an understanding of what it is.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie...there are few similarities.  A similar plague has swept mankind...but the Robert Neville that Will Smith plays is very different from the 1950's sensibilities of the suburban white man that populates the book.  Smith did a fine job, and his character wins our sympathies too.  But the Neville in the book is a man seemingly even more tormented and more alone.  And he has no science to help him and no DVDs to divert him.  He's alone with his whiskey, his murals and his depression.<br /><br />Also, the endings of the two stories couldn't be more different.  The reason for the title of the book is completely different from the movie.  Again, this is a bleak book indeed.  It grips you quite powerfully, and when the climax comes in the final few pages...you will be dismayed.  The story doesn't leave you hanging...but it doesn't exactly take you where you might have hoped either.<br /><br />Matheson's writing style is solid and no-nonsense.  This guy wastes no words...I venture to guess that many lesser writers would have doubled the size of the book and accomplished half of the intensity.  It is taut, terse, exciting and yes, it feels just a bit like it came from the 50s.  But it is unfraid to examine its subject matter and its main character...and that's what makes it so great.<br /><br />A true classic...yet to be filmed properly.job, and his character wins our sympathies too.

The song format is a bit different (shorter tracks) to the epic song structure the Mars Volta used in their previous two albums.

B000XUUQQK|1.0|Let me warn you: this is NOT a sequel to the remake of Boogeyman starring Barry Watson and it actually has nothing in common with the boogeyman. It's working title likely might have been Urban Legend Part 4. To compare the first one to this would be like comparing White Noise to Halloween. There is nothing supernatural in this movie! That said, the main character is played by Danielle Savre who could not have done a better job -she's a great actress. The same cannot be said for all of the cast, in particular the girl in the hospital with an eating disorder. She has a pointless topless scene that shows her saggy boobs and then another pointless sex scene. (Yay, great for pre-pubescent boys and middle-aged guys who can't get any!), but her death is without a doubt, the greatest one in the movie that also goes with the theme.<br />The plot of this movie although devoid of anything Boogeyman, does steal from a group of other movies. Fear dot com where your worst fears kill you -and that idea was stolen from Japan fyi, Saw because there are torture devices and oddly enough Tobin Bell is a creepy man in this movie too, Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer/Urban Legend for the whole masked human killer stalks messed up teens idea, and I'm sure you can find more.<br />I agree that if they decide to make a part 3, it should connect to the actual boogeyman.

Six simple words that could determine success or failure for tomorrow's left-brainers.

It is in this era as well, what he deems the \\"Conceptual Age\\" that right-brainers will come to the forefront and rule the job market.      Americans can now get anything they want for a cheaper price due to mass-production and outsourcing to Asia.  The three A's of abundance, Asia, and automation could spell doom for an up-and-coming accountant, engineer, or other technically inclined professional.  Although the future seems bleak for left-brainers, Pink offers six simple \\"senses\\" they can utilize to ensure success in the future.  These six are design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning.      Design is a crucial element to products because, as Pink puts it, \\"Why shouldn't it be beautiful, especially when you can buy a good-looking one for less than forty bucks?\\"  In other words, many of today's products are as cheap and reliable as they can possibly be, and the only way to differentiate between them is their appearance, or design.  Many find it is hard to stray from a great orator while he in the middle of a story.  Pink recognizes this when he says that story is something everyone should integrate into their business lives.  Salesmen will have an easier time selling if they incorporate story into their pitches, and the customer will feel like the product could be giving them an experience.  The merger of the spoon and the fork is a great example of symphony because it brought two important utensils into one, convenient package known only as the Spork.  Symphony takes two things and puts them together to make one great thing.  Pink feels that by going to an orchestra concert or drawing aself-portrait, we can develop our skill in symphony.       Pink tells us that empathy is not just seeing but feeling.  A doctor who can examine a patient scientifically and empathetically will be much more successful than a doctor who cannot.  Pink's sense of play is that play and, especially, humor should be integrated into the workplace.  According to Madan Kataria, a physician and \\"laugh doctor\\" laughter can help the workplace because it activates the right side of the brain and reduces stress.  Finally, meaning is simply finding meaning in one's own life including finding purpose, happiness, or spirituality.  By becoming spiritually active, Pink cites that we can become healthier and live more fulfilling lives.      My impressions while reading this book were those of sheer awe.  I cannot believe that after all my life of honing in on my left-brain skills that I now have all over.  It appears that right-brainers are going to be ruling the future, and if I do not want to be a right-brainer, I will be left in the dust.  Pink's offer of six senses to improve my chances of not living on the street after graduation do little to improve my confidence.  I feel that I either used these ideas to get me where I am today, or I will never incorporate them into my life.  To be fair, I did enjoy reading A Whole New Mind, and it did predict some things I feel I should watch out for in the future.  Finally, I believe that although Pink feels a new age is approaching, the six senses could have applied to anyone in the past.  I do not see any harm this could bring about someone and I do not feel these are an ingenious new way of thinking.  Despite my skepticism of Pink, I would still recommend this book to anyone who is on the edge about a career choice, or who is looking for a quick, interesting read.
B0009K8L5W|5.0|This 1996 album best exemplifies why so many of us fell in love with Shakira  Mebarak. This Catholic Lebanese-Colombian singer is best known for her belly-dancing routines and \\"Hips Don't Lie\\", but read this review to get to know the early Shakira better.<br /><br />Reviewers mistakenly state that this is Shakira's debut album. Not so. This is her THIRD studio album, but the first on a major label. Her first two albums - \\"Magia\\" (from when she was 13), and \\"Peligro\\" (at age 15) were commercial disappointments, and consisted of worn, badly produced Spanish love songs.<br /><br />But \\"Pies Descalzos\\" (translation - \\"Naked Feet\\") is where it all came together. This is my second favorite Spanish language album, right after Gloria Estefan's legendary \\"Mi Tierra\\".<br /><br />Now more than a decade old, its timelessness and lyrical brilliance continue to dazzle and win new fans each passing year (its one of the highest selling Latin albums of all time, and still sells hundreds of thousands of copies every year). The secret behind it is simple - this is perhaps the only album to capture Shakira in all her honesty, without pretense or marketing drive to fuel her 'image'.<br /><br />The result is a stripped-down, acoustic album with complete dedication to simplistic folk-tunes and some acoustic rock elements. The lyrics, even if you are not a native speaker, are the highlight. But up front is Shakira's beautiful voice. In my opinion, her voice peaked on this album and has never sounded as good.<br /><br />\\"Estoy Aqui\\", the lead single, might be why people remember this, but the best songs are all toward the end of the album. Her finest moment here is \\"Vuelve\\", a shape-shifting, strange song that will get lodged in your subconscious without any effort on your part. This is stellar. As interesting is \\"Donde Esta Corazon\\", a plaintive love ballad where you can just imagine the artist sitting on her sofa with a lonely guitar. Beautiful.<br /><br />The reason I say that this entire album is Shakira's best effort EVER, is because the CD she released right after this was more rock-oriented and commercial (in the best and worst ways). Later, of course, she bleached her hair blonde, went lighter, and started singing English songs. I do enjoy some of her English work, but they are not a patch on any of the songs here.<br /><br />For longtime fans of Shakira, we still hold this album dear, because it defines the very best of her work, and reminds us of who she was before she started mass-marketing herself to be successful with North American audiences. Get a copy of this immediately to discover who she was when she started out - this is a classic, essential Spanish language album, and your collection is certainly incomplete without it.<br /><br />Five Stars.cause the CD she released right after this was more rock-oriented and commercial (in the best and worst ways).

0316067598|5.0|This is a great book about the reality of special services warfare.  It's a very well written book, that gives a first-hand account of training as a Navy Seal, and then the horrendous experience of a real mission gone sour.  It's amazing that Luttrell lived to tell the story.  Highly recommended for anyone wanting to get a frank description of the life of a Navy warrior.
1594481717|3.0|Daniel Pink's A whole new mind is a light-hearted book that  lists the six \\"senses\\" that the conceptual age will force people to develop so they can keep their jobs.  He tells the reader to ask the questions: can what you are doing be done cheaper by someone overseas? Can it be done faster by a computer? He advises that in order to answer \\"no\\" to these you must develop the six senses.    Design, to cater to the beauty-loving consumer.  Story, to make your input more memorable.  Empathy, and genuinely care about people and their stories.  Symphony, seeing how the parts of the whole fit together.  Play, because laughter is good for you, and meaning, because it is important to find something in life that matters to you.  At the end of each chapter there is a kind of self-help section that gives you resource so you can better hone each \\"sense.\\"      This book was helpful, and an easy read but I found some things wrong with Pink's argument.  For one, how can people overseas do our finances but develop their creativity?  I think that these senses could be incorporated into the workplace overseas just as well as they could be here.  Another problem I had was that Pink was telling us all this but not really proving it.  His book was set up in a very \\"L-directed way\\", to use his word.  He set up everything up in lists and bullet points.  He did use pictures, which I thought was creative, but he did not take that idea and run with it.  I also wonder about the portfolios at the end of the chapters which are supposed to help you develop the senses.  I believe you can learn to draw but I question whether people can really learn to be empathetic by reading a book.  I think it would be worth your time to read A Whole New Mind, but don't take every word as an absolute.  Scott Berkun has similar arguments about Pink's work and I agree with him as well.
0553381407|5.0|This book, quite simply, changed my life.  If you have unreconciled and unresolved issues with your parents ... especially if they are no longer living ... this book will help you through them.  Do not hesitate to buy it.  It really will help you.  I've also given it as a gift to people I know well enough (it's a pretty intimate gift...) and have been thanked profusely.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I bought this album when I was 10 years old and probably listened to it a million times.  Over time I varied my taste and hadn't heard blink-182 for about 5 or 6 years until very recently.  The second Dumpweed came on all of my old memories of repeat listens flooded back.  But this is not a nostalgia record.  It is full of simple, incredibly catchy, pop songs.  No its not \\"punk\\", but so what? Sure there are only about 4 chords in the whole album but its so short that they don't get old.  On this album blink-182 never tries (except the slightly dumb Adam's Song) to be more than they are.  This music is so devoid of pretentiousness that it is timeless gold.  When I am 80 years old I will turn on blink-182 and remember the good old days.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|Christina is on top of her game. The stage show is elaborate, the band is comprised of top musicians, and her voice is in fine form. VERY impressive concert and it shows that she just keeps on getting better and better. I like the Back to Basics theme, gives her more of an outlet to really show off her great vocal range, much more so than her last album, Stripped. Anyways, this dvd is definitely enjoyable and a must have for Christina fans.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|There's something about sci-fi done right that no other genre really captures.  Torchwood has that something.  It's the ability to take very human concerns (such as Gwen's quest to maintain her own identity in new circumstances) and combine them with ideas and plots that stretch the imagination to the breaking point.  It's the things that move us set in a fantastical new reality.  Some movies and shows do it better than others.  Torchwood does it as well as it can be done.
B000VZPBNU|5.0|Jimi Hendrix is one of my all-time favorite musicians and I picked this up a few weeks ago on the cheap. That's one of the best things about download mania because so many used CDs are now available at an inexpensive price. Just about everything that a fan of Hendrix--looking for a quick fix--needs is here on this collection. Certainly all of the classics are, but I recommend listening to his live stuff as, in the flesh, he was even more of a standout than in the studio. Personally, \\"The Wind Cries Mary, Hey Joe, Little Wing, Red House, Manic Depression, and Crosstown Traffic\\" are the Hendrix tunes I treasure most. If you don't know his oeuvre though then I would not be surprised if \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"Foxey Lady\\" were the ones to immediately impress you most. Those were the tracks I could not get enough of as a boy. Hail Jimi! Gone but never forgotten.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Barry Lyndon is a remarkable film presenting the unusual voyage of an Irish commoner into the great European courts and aristocracy.    There is irony in the telling of this brilliant film, (like Voltaire's Candide) but also there is great humanity in Barry  Lyndon.  Through Barry's imperfect life, one cannot help to experience an intense compassion for this charming man.  The music is haunting and powerful, it is a beautifully made film; I highly recommend it.
0195170776|3.0|A very good dictionary. I really like the definitions. That said, it is very disappointing that such a high quality dictionary does not have an alphabetical index with cutouts for the index finger. Everytime you look a word up, you have to run through the alphabet and match it to the gray marks. If the dictionary were smaller, like novel size, then you could thumb through it, and it would not be that much of a burden. Had I known that, I would opted for another more user friendly dictionary.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I own this set and watched the concert live in 1985. I've been reading some of these reviews and would like to clear up some myths and misstatements I've read.<br />First of all, to clear satellite time and do a live broadcast all over the world at the same time was unheard of and untried in 1985. There were some technical glitches and sometimes the feed was even lost and the time would be filled in by MTV DJ's (MTV aired the broadcast and provided commentators).<br />As far as the missing material of some of the acts it doesn't exist in any recorded form anymore. Bob Geldof asked that the show not be recorded or rebroadcast and the BBC destroyed the tapes at his request. There was no plan to make a concert DVD (there were no DVD's) and sell it after the fact to raise money. The concert was supposed to raise donations that day and awareness of what was going on in Africa. The only reason that any Wembley footage exists is that some of the tapes were lost and found years later in some dusty corner. Then they had to salvage what they found and use what could be used.<br />MTV recorded the broadcast also but a lot of the footage is with handheld cameras and substandard audio. They supposedly had over 100 hours of various types of footage and also salvaged what they could.<br />The Who are missing half of their set because the BBC had a power outage and it never made it to the air. Led Zeppelin specifically withheld their permission for their material to be used because they didn't like their performance. The rest of the footage is just gone.<br />Musicians were not paid. The reason you see US bands in London and English bands in Philadelphia is because they were touring at the time and played at the closest venue. Bands are not missing off the DVD because they wanted more money etc.<br />As for the quality the sound has been remastered to 5.1 and actually sounds pretty good for the most part. The video is not always crisp but they did a pretty good job considering they were working with 20 yr old tapes. Its a 4 disc set that's well worth the money. It's a great snapshot of some of the acts that were at the top of their game in the 80's. Maybe you can educate your kids. My 14 year old daughter actually asked me who Madonna was. I told her in her day she was way bigger that Britney Spears.<br />The money from the sale of the disc still goes to Africa so buy it!were working with 20 yr old tapes.

1844137872|5.0|Wall and Piece is a fantastic coffee-table conversation point to have, after the disappointment of Extencilism due to it's tiny size, Wall and Piece was a joy to get hold of - containing art both of funny and black humour, and a good 100 pages or so. Contains a good spread of Banksy's work... before the council drones got to it!
B000000WF0|4.0|I don't think people normally are compelled to write 3 star reviews, normally they only write when the really are blown away or really dont like something. However as a huge Verve fan, this album, although huge, is much more mainstream and doesn't reflect the sonic beauty reflected on their earlier and unappreciated albums. As other reviews had said, Storm in Heaven (and the Verve EP), is not just the best Verve albums, but one of the best albums period. It is sonic and similar to 'shoegazer' music but somehow a warmer, lusher, gentler take on the genre than say My Bloody Valentine (i know, heresy).<br /><br />Urban Hymns isn't an album in the same sense, but more a discrete collection of songs, individual, composed and mainstream. If you like Urban Hymns work your way backwards to the earlier stuff, you might be blown away. If you don't like Urban Hymns or think \\"bittersweet Symphony\\" is the Verve's highpoint, it's not, don't write them off on this forgettable offering.<br /><br />* Edit - Several years later *<br />So bumped the review up to 4 stars, have with a lot of strong tracks like Sonnet, Drugs Don't Works, Space and Time. I still prefer the earlier work for sure and the early work is still worth checking out
B0002VYQ2U|5.0|I would highly recommend Norah Jones` Feels Like Home (CD+DVD). I feel that if the original artists who wrote and played some of these pieces could be here today and listen to this girl and her band play that they would be extremely impressed. Furthermore, the newer material displayed is of equal caliber as well.
0788815490|5.0|This exquisite, if not entirely literal, adaptation of Henry James's novel of the same name, examines the relationships among three people, all of whom love each other in one way or another, but whose feelings are rooted in vastly different needs, agendas, and expectations. Through the lens of these relationships, we get a glimpse of the social limitations and values imposed by the class structure of Edwardian-era Britain.    Kate Croy, played by Helena Bonham Carter, in possibly the best performance of her not undistinguished career, is the daughter of a woman from a socially prominent family who married a poor man for love - that is to say, married \\"beneath\\" her. The marriage was unhappy, and Kate's mother died young, leaving Kate with a social pedigree on one side, but no money - and Kate's social standing, and the mores of the times, make employment impossible.  A wealthy marriage is clearly the resolution to her difficulties, but Kate is desperately in love with a handsome, intelligent, but only modestly employed young journalist (Linus Roache) and he does not qualify as that resolution.    As the film opens, Kate is living with her mother's sister, her wealthy Aunt Maud (Charlotte Rampling).  Maud has paid Kate's father off so that Kate can become her legal ward, and she is determined that Kate will not make the same mistake as her mother.  Maud intends to steer her beautiful young niece into a brilliant marriage that will safeguard her future.  Love does not figure into Maud's cold social calculations - she does not care who Kate takes as a lover once she is well married.  Kate obediently allows Maud to take her into society where Kate can be seen by eligible men, but secretly Kate continues to meet her lover, Merton Densher.  Merton returns Kate's passion but resents her unwillingness to defy Maud, marry him, and join him in his modest lifestyle.  Kate wants to find a solution to their dilemma that will allow her to marry Densher without cutting her off fromthe comforts Kate has come to appreciate.  Exacerbating matters, Maud discovers that Kate has been meeting Merton in secret, and forbids Kate to see him again, stating that otherwise she will wash her hands of Kate and refuse further help.    One evening, Kate meets a very rich, orphaned American heiress, Millie Theale, at a dinner party; Millie is traveling in Europe with a paid companion (Elizabeth McGovern).  Millie and Kate take to one another immediately and become friends.  As their friendship develops, Millie meets Merton, with whom she instantly falls in love. Kate discovers that Millie is seriously ill - she gets confirmation of the illness, and its terminal nature, via Lord Mark (Alex Jennings), a shallow aristocrat in her aunt's social circle with economic problems of his own.  Lord Mark, although greatly attracted to Kate, is pursuing Millie, who he hopes will restore his family's fortunes after marriage - and fairly soon leave him a wealthy widower, free to indulge his wishes where Kate is concerned.    Kate, however, has a better plan: she conceals her own relationship with Merton from Millie, and as the two women's affectionate intimacy progresses, Kate places Merton more and more frequently in Millie's path.  It is her hope that Millie's feelings for him, sharpened by her awareness of her own impending death, will prompt Millie to leave her money to Merton, solving Kate's dilemma.    When Millie invites Kate and Merton to join her in Venice, where the three, with Millie's companion, are thrown together on a daily basis, Kate's plans begin to look like succeeding.  At first Merton refuses to participate by pretending to return Millie's feelings, but by degrees we see him responding to Millie's spiritual depths, transparent nature, and genuine feeling for both him and Kate.  And thus, this being Henry James, the uncontrollability of the emotions begins to change the balance of the relationships among the three, alarming Kate, who has returned home toEngland to await the outcome of her plans.    The outcome arrives, but not quite as planned.  Millie dies soon and leaves a great deal of money to Merton, but Merton will not accept it, and will only marry Kate if she accepts him without the bequest.  In a departure from the last pages of the novel, the film suggests that Merton and Kate are permanently parted because Kate cannot bear the knowledge that Merton is in love with Millie's memory.  In the novel, it is not clear that Kate and Merton are permanently parted, despite Merton's declaration that he will never take the money.    Thus, in the film, Kate achieves the goal she has connived at, but loses the thing she wants most just at her moment of triumph.  The viewer watches as, in an extraordinary five minutes before the camera, Bonham Carter's face shows Kate's dawning knowledge of the price she will pay for her success - her heart breaks before the viewer's eyes.    This complex web is superbly delineated by a matchless cast.  Helena Bonham Carter, in this reviewer's opinion, was robbed at the Oscars - the last ten minutes of the film, let alone her subtly shaped portrait of Kate throughout, should have won her the Best Actress award for which she was nominated.  It is, bar none, one of the most memorable performances by an actress this reviewer has seen in a long time.  Alison Elliott is touching as the dying Millie, wiser than her friends suspected; Linus Roache makes Merton terribly attractive both personally and intellectually, justifying both women's feelings for him; and Charlotte Rampling is wonderfully brittle as the ruthlessly calculating Aunt Maud.  The production is perfectly executed.    I have only one fault to find with the script, and that is the reference to the title.  In the film, the reference is linked only to the Psalm spoken over Millie's casket, in which the narrator sighs, \\"Oh that I had wings like the dove, that I could fly away, for the terror of death is sore upon me. . .\\".  In thelast pages of the novel, it is Millie herself who figures as the dove, who has stretched out her wings to cover both Kate and Merton with her bequest.  The difference is a telling one, and James's usage far more supports the title of the work.    However, that is a minor point, overall.  This is no soppy costume drama, but an adult film about motives buried within motives - an illustration of the inherent danger of trying to control others' lives, for unintended consequences are not only possible, but likely.
B0002EXH54|4.0|Peace Sells might be recognized in history as Megadeth's coming-out party.  The band's debut album did well for an independent label, but upon graduating to Capitol Records, Megadeth had become a force to be reckoned with in the thrash metal genre.  Peace Sells is the first album of that saga.<br /><br />In 2004, Peace Sells got a well-deserved makeover.  Some welcome additions are the fattening of Gar Samuelson's drums and David Ellefson's bass.  Together, the rhythm section as a whole sounds beefier, thicker.  Nuances of Samuelson's tasteful, jazz-inspired playing are heard just as they were recorded in the studio.  Ellefson's bass lines are also given a boost in the lower frequencies, but perhaps are unnecessarily loud in the intro to \\"My Last Words\\".  Luckily, about a minute and a half into the song, the bass makes more room for the other instruments as the volumes are changed.<br /><br />Dave Mustaine was the grandmaster behind the album, and his vocals are for the most part well-preserved.  They never seem to overtake the mix, and never seem to be drowned out by the busy instruments in the background.  If prompted, I could name an instance or two where I noticed some differences, but nothing changed the music experience for me, which is a good thing.  The guitars are at times too loud, at times too soft.  For instance, the beginning of \\"Black Friday\\" is crowded with many different melodies and pattern, and volume levels become a bit of an issue here.<br /><br />Anyone who is Megadeth fan shouldn't need to ask about the songwriting.  Peace Sells was one of Megadeth's more nihilistic experiments; certain songs may make Dave Mustaine feel uncomfortable nowadays.  \\"Black Friday\\" is about an serial killer, and there are a lot of evil, Satanic themes in this song.  \\"Wake Up Dead\\" is a song that is distinctly Megadeth and features a chunky and progressive rhythm guitar style that is uniquely Dave Mustaine.  \\"Bad Omen\\" and \\"The Conjuring\\" are inspired by witchcraft and, again, Satanic themes.  The former includes some of Ellefson's trademark nimble, impressive bass playing; the latter is a rocking tune with a pace that picks up towards the end of the song.  The album's title track \\"Peace Sells\\" is a tongue-in-cheek (but, at the same time, sneering) response to the mainstream world's perception of the band.  As if the name of the band weren't a dead (pun intended) giveaway, a major theme of this album is death; the music and lyrics (Dave Mustaine, ladies and gentlemen) are dark and heavy to reflect that theme, yet is contrasted by the jazz-inspired licks of Chris Poland (lead guitar).  Poland's guitars sing when they need to; this remastered version doesn't seem to fail, in that regard.<br /><br />It's a great album for a fan of the band.  For all newcomers, Peace Sells is a great way to start your Megadeth collection.  It was a truly pivotal point in the band's career.  The album contains three mixes, the \\"Randy Burns mixes,\\" of songs on Peace Sells that never saw the light of day.  This is mostly filler material, but it's an added incentive to buy the album if you're an obsessive Megadeth fan like myself, but the remastered music was the main draw for me as I already own the original version.<br /><br />Interesting to note: Peace Sells was the first Megadeth tagged with the \\"Parental Advisory\\" notice.  On the original, this notice was written in red, across the back of the album.  This inspired the song \\"Hook in Mouth,\\" a song about the P.M.R.C. and censorship, which appeared on the next Megadeth LP..

B000YCLRBA|5.0|Anyone who likes Tchaikovsky's music, excellent singing and beautiful opera productions will greatly enjoy this DVD. Renée Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky are a beautiful couple, both singing and visually, They sing marvelously.I personally loved the set and costume design. Unfortunately, there is a defect on disc n° 2, Act 3, scene 1, between chapters 8-10; therefore I cannot say anything on the performance of Prince Gremin and the initial Polonaise. But I must say regarding the other parts: this is a magnificent stage production and also that Ramon Vargas (who, for me, looks like Schubert) is a high class tenor. People should have this production in their musical collection. Valery Gergiev, by the way, is super, as usual. With best wishes.

1594481717|5.0|Have you heard about globalization lately? If you havn't, chances are you are'nt big on reading the newspaper. In recent years, many people have been scared by outsourcing and off shoring, but one author offers a practical, simple solution. Daniel Pink believes that in the future, the Conceptual Age as he calls it, creativity is key. Being \\"booksmart\\" is still important, but no longer enough to be successful consistently.  Pink points out that today's consumers are overwhelmed with so many bland choices at cheap prices; he insists that in the future, sleek and simplistic designs will be in higher demand than the typical standardized product. That pretty pink toilet bowl cleaner in your bathroom? Yes, it matches perfectly with the rug and the shower curtain.  Of course if one is going to be creative, he or she is going to ask how. As a solution, Pink offers six traits that he thinks will help people distinguish themselves in this \\"Conceptual Age\\". He does this in a casual, non-technical way, and suggests ways to improve each sense at the end of the chapter. These traits are:  * Design: Pink thinks that in order to be competitive, products need sleek, simplistic designs that differentiate a product from the abundance of standard competitors.    * Story: Pink believes that technology has shortened our attention spans, and that the best way to draw employees and consumers in is by using interesting anecdotes.    * Symphony: The author thinks that masters of putting pieces into a whole will be able to combine ideas we never thought possible.    * Empathy: He says that emotional IQ is becoming an important complement to traditional intelligence and cites changes in Medical curriculum to prove it.     * Play: Pink claims that workers that embrace their sense of humor will become more productive. He also discusses the benefits of laughter and video games and dhow they improve our lives.     * Meaning: As baby boomers begin to retire, Pink expects them to begin to search more for purpose in their lives instead of monetary gain.   Pink uses a very casual approach to explain his main ideas. He keeps his language simple for the most part, and rarely uses any complicated concepts in the book. After reading this, most people should have a clear idea of how to think more creatively and become successful in this Conceptual Age. Pink never discourages analytical thinkers, but instead encourages them to develop their creative sides. This support is what made me enjoy the book. Pink really seems to believe in his ideas, and enthusiasm is very attractive when listening to fresh ideas. Instead of just pointing out a problem, he offers ways to take advantage of change, which I'm sure most people agree, is inevitable.

0823013626|5.0|This is an amazing book and one that you should really get to add to your collection of polymer clay books.  There are soooooo many things in here to try. I just can't wait!<br />Plus, buying it from here saved me lots of $$ over the local craft store cost and even ebay.
0765316889|4.0|I like to keep things short, so i'll just say, if you see a review where the  reviewer doesn't finish the book, keep in mind why they may have given it the poor review they have...    This book is very inventive, and while it is not the quickest read, I found it's pace satisfying and with enough spurts to make me read chapter after chapter at times...    you owe it to yourself to at least check out a few sample chapters on brandon's website and decide for yourself, just search his name and u'll find it, it's worth the time
1594481717|3.0|You ever wondered why so many jobs are being outsourced or wondered if computers would ever take over your job? In this revolutionary book, Daniel Pink tells us how to survive in a society that requires a person to be \\"book smart\\" and creative. An example of how being \\"book smart\\" is no longer enough is when Pink states that since there is so much data and information around us, it is no longer possible for us just to give an effective argument. Someone will dig up or come across some information to rebut your point. Three problems that made \\"just being book smart\\" obsolete is abundance of goods, outsourcing to Asia, and Computers. In a way Pink, is saying that to stand out in today's society you need to be creative and unique. If you are creative and unique no person or computer could replace you. Pink talks about the four ages, the Agricultural age which is run by farmers, the Industrial age which was ran by factory works, the Information age which was ran by knowledge workers, and lastly the Conceptual age which was ran by creators and empathizers. He tells us that the current age is the Conceptual Age and to survive in this age you need six essential senses on top of knowledge, Design which is important to set yourself apart from other people or things, Story is to give narrative that compelling not just a regular argument, Symphony is to see the big picture, Empathy to use your emotions and intuition, Play is to basically bring humor or happiness to your product and business, and Meaning means values and purpose to your life.

B000UX6THK|3.0|Voila enfin la possibilite d'avoir en edition complete une des toutes  meilleures series tv. Longue a ete l'attente mais ca en vallait la chandelle!     La qualite du transfert numerique est impressionant, de meme l'ajout des pistes 5.1 donne un ambiance encore plus surealiste à cette serie. Bien sur la serie a vieilli et contient quelques longueurs (surtout la saison 2), mais le charme est toujours present et les acteurs autant charismatique. Les bonus sont anecdotiques et pas vraiment pertinents. Merci pour les cartes postales mais a part pour un collectionneur je vois pas du tout l'interet de ce genre de 'goodies'.    Le point noir de ce coffret est l'absence de toute reference au francais, pas le vf ni de sous titres en francais. Y a du portugais et de l'espagnol par contre... Je suis un peu deçu surtout pour la forme, nous sommes qq millions a utiliser quotidiennement cette langue en amerique du nord, D. Lynch et Paramount aurait pu montrer un peu plus de respect et de comprehension.

B000P2A256|5.0|In the past, Maroon 5 just seemed another band which sounded like many others.  Finally, the band got a little hipper with this release.  The hit single, \\"Makes Me Wonder\\", is a crowd-pleaser.  But, there are plenty of other songs which are equally good like \\"Goodnight Goodnight\\", \\"Kiwi\\", and \\"If I Never See Your Face\\".  This new album infuses electric and funk which reminds me alot of Peter Gabriel and other 80's artists.

B000068TPN|5.0|The reviewer for the New Yorker really exposes his bias.  This event takes place in 1965, not 1968-69.  there is a big difference in that fact.  we had just escalated troop levels there, it was early in the war, morale was high and the Army felt it was vastly superior to the NVA and VC. We had not experienced the attrition associated with the long slog Vietnam would soon become. If you really want to get to the heart of the matter, watch the deleted scenes on the DVD- particularly the last deletion where Moore meets Westmoreland and McNamara in Saigon.  They are both elated, ecstatic about the success of the battle- the casualty numbers are astoundingly favorable to the US, and they smell a quick victory.  Moore nervously tells them they are seeing it wrongly, that the NVA were willing to keep coming at them regardless of the casualty rate...that they wouldn't quit until the last man.  It was quite prophetic.  The director decided to cut the scene because he didn't want to politicize the movie, which was commendable.  The tragedy back at Benning, where an unprepared army delivers casualty notification telegrams by yellow cab, and a horrified Julia Moore decides to deliver the rapidly mounting death notices herself, is as poignant as it gets in a movie.......If you want to experience the flip side of the war, where hopelessness and lack of conviction have taken hold of the soldiers stuck there, well then Platoon and Apocolypse Now tell that tale.
0891349553|5.0|I'm not near this good yet, but it definately gives me the inspiration to keep trying.  Great detail and instructions from a fantastic artist.<br />I bought this as a used book and was very, very pleased with the seller and the condition of the book.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Generally I'm the type of person who likes almost any movie I see because I take a movie for what it is, not what I wish it was (though I have become pickier as time has passed). That being said, I loved this movie. I've heard it described as \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Event Horizon\\" mixed together. I never saw \\"2001\\", so for me it felt a lot like \\"Solaris\\" as far as the pacing is concerned (but a lot more interesting).    The exact premise behind the plot is never really explained in the movie, which can be understandably confusing. The basic explanation is that a form of supersymmetric matter known as a Q-ball has infected the sun and interrupted the reactions that give us our all-important sunshine. If you want a better idea of what that means from somebody qualified to explain it I would highly recommend watching this movie with the commentary track by Dr. Brian Cox (after you've watched the movie sans commentary, of course). Dr. Cox's commentary gives you a much better idea about what's going on scientifically in the movie and gives you the sense that, while not everything in the movie is scientifically plausible, the filmmakers actually made an effort to make it as real as possible while still making it interesting. How often does that happen?    This movie intrigued me and stuck with me for a couple of days after I finished it. Psychologically, it makes you wonder how you would handle similar situations, especially as plans begin to fall apart and it becomes apparent that the choices will become more difficult to make as time goes on.    While I'm no great judge of acting, I really came away from this movie feeling like the actors knew everything their characters were supposed to know. And as Roger Ebert said, they didn't come off as action heroes, which would have ruined the movie. In case you're wondering, I very, very rarely agree with Ebert on anything.    I could go on and on about this movie but I doubt it would make much sense. The science behind themovie caught most of my interest, which I know most people don't watch for. My suggestion is that you just give it a chance.    And seriously, watch this movie with Dr. Cox's commentary track after you've already watched it at least once. The commentary is interesting and gives you a much better idea of the science behind the movie, which will definitely go over well with anybody that has even a passing interest in physics.
1933492279|5.0|Beautiful artwork, from the concept art to fully modeled photo realistic renders. It's great to see another artists creative workflow and ideas. Truly Inspiring!!!!
B0000640S3|2.0|Most reviewers seem to be focusing on the political aspects of this film and how former allies are now enemies, etc., etc. Unfortunately that kind of review has been done to death, and there is really no way to resolve this problem without checking yourself into a mental hospital. People just need to understand that things were different back then and the nature of politics is change. I really have no interest in that point of view at all when watching this film. What really bothers me is how completely unrealistic it portrays warfare and battlefield operations. Truth is, Rambo should've been dead ten times over. For instance, when the Russian gunship drops the bomb just before Rambo drops into the cave, it would've been completely reasonable to expect a bomb of that size to not only produce a larger explosion, but collapse the roof of the cave onto Rambo. Then, when Trautman and Rambo take cover from the Russian army in the trench, one has to wonder if the Russian troops were trained by the same guys who trained the stormtroopers in Star Wars. What should've been like shooting fish in a barrel became a total farse for the Russians. Just lob a few grenades in there and watch the body parts go flying! And isn't it funny how a molotov cocktail will disable a t-64 tank? I mean, I could understand if it was a t-34, but a 64? The tank doesn't even seem to suffer any physical damage, and runs fine when Rambo uses it. Yet, for some reason the Soviet tank crew seems obliged to evacuate it. Not only that, but a tank that requires several crewmembers to operate can now be driven by ONE guy when Rambo hijacks it! Not only can he act as a driver, but as a gunner too by somehow managing to reload the main gun while driving the tank at the same time! Finally, is it even necessary to state how dead Rambo would be as soon as he hit that chopper? The best one can hope for in this movie is the music, unfortunately the rest of it makes about as much sense as a G.I. Joe cartoon, but atleast with a cartoon you know what you're getting. Is it too much to ask for some level of realism in a movie like this?
B000ZK4466|3.0|THE GOOD:  Every single that was promoted from this album is pretty good. But the rest of the album.. eh..    THE BAD:  Bedlam was somewhat of a dissapointment for me. i'm not feeling the connection that i usually feel with most of the volta albums..It doesn't compare to De-Loused, Frances, or maybe even amputechture. But if i'd have to rank this album i'd say its second to last on my Volta favorites, Frances the mute being last. De-loused being the all-time favorite.
B00063F8B2|5.0|Absolutely wonderful soundtrack for this Christmas movie!  Songs are original and beautiful.  Josh Groban does a wonderful job too!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I have never seen the original version, so my point of view will probably differ.<br /><br />It is a glorious combination of spectacular animation and music. The was flowers and water lilies dance and the underwater scenes with beautiful sometimes translucent fish tales is gorgeous.<br /><br />I found it very entertaining and also very relaxing.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I really liked this movie and where it was going. Though in the end it seemed to get confused and had to throw in some very wierd almost supernatural stuff which I didnt care for and had already seen in Event Horizon.<br /><br />Not many movies get released about outer space anymore which is wierd, so it was nice to see Sunshine come out even though I missed it in the theaters. I made sure to buy it on Blu-Ray (I support both formats just so ya know), and damn it looked good on my 61 Samsung DLP. Every shot of the sun was breathtaking. When you see Mercury crossing the sun it looks almost like you are right there on the ship with them. I think I rewound that scene about 4 times watching every detail. I cant tell you much about the sound since I'm waiting on buying new speakers. But the PQ was really nice when it needed to be.<br /><br />The movie itself starts off with the crew on the ship heading to the Sun. Which is good, cause I really didnt want to see the backstory and watching family cry and waving bye to their loved ones that wont be back for years. The story is interesting, even if it is hard to believe you could even get close to the sun. I really enjoyed the whole thing until about 3/4's of the way through when the 'twist' happens. That part made me so mad and it was so cliche that they should have never done it. It went from being somewhat realistic to being a comic book in my opinion.<br /><br />I wanted to rate the movie 3 stars, but just couldnt do it. I enjoyed the movie to much at the beginning and the scenerey was out of this world (pun INTENDED).
B000002GXX|5.0|ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS THAT BRINGS YOU BACK FOR MORE. FROM THE MOMENT YOU HEAR \\"ONE OF THESE NIGHTS\\" YOU REALIZE YOUR LISTENING TO A DIFFERENT EAGLES ALBUM FROM THE PREVIOUS THREE. THAT IS GOOD BECAUSE THIS ALBUM BEGAN TO SHOW HOW TALENTED THESE GUYS REALLY WERE. THEIR WORDS & MUSIC DEFINE THAT. \\"TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT\\" IS MY FAVORITE SONG FROM THE ALBUM. CAN'T HELP BUT LIKE THE VOCAL RANGE OF RANDY MEISNER ON THIS ONE. THE OTHER TWO HITS OFF THIS ALBUM-WELL WHAT CAN I SAY--\\"LOVE TO HAVE HAD THE ROYALTIES ON THOSE SONGS\\". IF YOUR AN EAGLES FAN, THIS ONE IS A MUST FOR YOUR COLLECTION. BY THE WAY-A FRIEND OF MINE COMMENTED TO ME THE OTHER DAY ABOUT THE NEWLY RELEASED EAGLES ALBUM AND HOW IT SOUNDED SO MUCH LIKE TODAYS COUNTRY MUSIC LIKE SUCH GROUPS AS KIETH URBAN. I REMINDED HIM THAT IT WAS THE EAGLES WHO PUT THAT SOUND OUT SOME THIRTY YEARS AGO.
B000093FLA|5.0|This is a classic that should be apart of anyones libary of DVD's. Must buy and great price...
0393327655|4.0|The author presents good points of argument to look at and determine where we stand on the issues. My only criticism of this book is that the NOTES section of this book is 1/3 of the entire book!
1401211909|3.0|I was very excited to read this book because I absolutely loved the movie, however I found the novel to only be okay. The characters were never fully developed and there was no real climax. I am not sure whether Gaiman did this on purpose because the story reads like a fairy tale of old, but as a modern novel, it was a bit disappointing. They never go into why certain characters fall in love and characters are picked up and dropped at whim. Overall, Stardust was mediocre. It is a fine light read for a boring day, but do not expect any depth.
B000XUUQQK|1.0|The original Boogeyman was, well, it was bad.  Boogeyman 2 though makes the first film look close to Shakespeare though, completely disregarding any kind of supernatural thrills for a tried and true, formulaic, slasher flick that isn't only predictable, it's downright boring.  What is good to note about Boogeyman 2 is that the film doesn't pull any punches with blood and gore, but the film as a whole is so atrociously bad that you'll wonder why you even bothered with it in the first place.  The direction is tired and trite, the acting is godawful (genre stalwart Tobin \\"Jigsaw\\" Bell and Xena: Warrior Princess veteran Renee O'Connor have done much, much better than this), and the effects are almost laughable.  In an era of direct-to-DVD horror sequels that have been flooding the marketplace lately, Boogeyman 2 just may be the worst of the bunch, which in itself is saying quite a lot.  Avoid.

1594481717|4.0|We all wish we could predict the future and be able to see if we were making the right choices. It would be a near perfect world if we could. In A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future. Daniel H. Pink tries to help us get onto the right track.<br /><br />I had to read this for my English 102 class. Usually I do not like reading books for school, so I started reading this book with a negative attitude that was very quickly changed. Pink's writing style was very clear and clever. He used a unique way of organizing information for us to understand and enjoy the reading. I did not get bored at all reading this because he kept it flowing and kept switching between stories and pictures and information. I think this book was really influential. It really made me think. I want to use his suggestions and try and see how I can apply his theories to my life.<br /><br />Pink gives his ideas on how we can be successful in the future. He writes about how we use different sides of our brains. Pink thinks that the right brain is on the rise. He tells us how the left side of our brain deals with more logical thinking, while the right side of our brain is more geared for creativity. Pink thinks that the way of life led by the left-brainers is decreasing. He does not think that a straightforward way of thinking will work out anymore. We need to be more creative. He explains how we are going to have to open new areas in our mind to succeed in our technologically advanced future. Pink categorizes how we can do this into six aptitudes, design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning. He then explains each step for us to follow, learn, and understand.
0345350499|4.0|I say \\"beautifully heartbreaking\\" with much respect as I truly loved this book...however there is a lot of sadness involved.  I'm so happy, however, that the presence of the Goddess is shared with the readers.

B000IJ7Q32|5.0|This should be required reading for everyone who claims to \\"care\\" about, well, pretty much anything. I don't see how anyone who looks around, and reads the newspaper, can not be afraid about the course humanity is on. But it is a vague fear, wondering about our future, wondering whether the media reports of potential catastrophe are true.    So here we have a very intelligent, very informed writer telling us that he is concerned. There is no fear here. It is remarkably even toned. It deals with facts. Nothing political. But he is concerned. But rather than simply being concerned, he tells us why, what problems it is that concern him. And then he goes and investigates a the problems of a number of different societies. And then he leaves us with just a tinge of hope that maybe catastrophe is not in fact our destiny. Hard to believe, but at the end of the book, I really did kind of maybe believe that my soon to be born son may actually be a part of the solution rather than the problem, if we educate him.    Regardless, I came away feeling informed. I came away with more knowledge than I previously had. I came away with understanding. And a twinge of hope. This is first rate writing, actually worth reading. It's rare I wish I had the opportunity to actually thank the author personality.    Not that you're probably reading here, you're probably gathering information on your next tome meant to inform us of some of the origins of (and possible solutions to) some of the world's problems, but, Thanks to you, Mr. Diamond.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|\\"Amazing Grace\\" is an excellent film.  It touches us with the profile in courage of a man standing against slavery.  It tweaks our fancy with the hint of romance and turns our heads back to a different time.  Michael Apted who directed Jennifer Lopez's tense drama [[ASIN:B00006HAWN Enough]] was at the helm of this project.  The settings make it epic with the slave ship boats, Parliament and the Wilberforce mansion.  Ioan Gruffudd who was in \\"The Titanic\\" plays the lead.  His rugged good looks and strong performance anchor the film.  Benedict Cumberbatch who is currently playing in theatres in \\"Atonement\\" plays his good friend William Pitt who becomes Prime Minister.  Youssnou N'Dour from \\"Blood Diamond\\" does an excellent job as Olaudah Equiano, the freed slave.  Rufus Sewell who was in \\"The Illusionist\\" and \\"The Holiday\\" plays the longhaired Thomas Clarkson who carries chains around in his bag.  Romola Garai who is currently in \\"Atonement\\" plays Barbara Spooner who weds Wilberforce.  When I saw this in the theatre, I knew I'd want the DVD.  I love the discussion of God that flavors the film and guides William.  The DVD transfer is excellent.  The film also has an excellent soundtrack.  Bravo!

B0010X745K|5.0|When I first saw previews for this movie I knew I had to see it.  Being a horror movie fan, this movie was on my must see list, and I have to say it was one of the best horror movies I saw last year.  I do feel that the CGI got a bit unrealistic at times, but that was something that can be easily ignored for the story-line and effectiveness of the mist to heighten suspense.<br /><br />I felt the movie was very faithful to the book version (minus the ending, which is very different from the book ending, and I will discuss my thoughts on it later), and while not your regular scary horror movie, it was still terrifying in its portrayal of the breakdown of civilized and rational behavior when a disaster of nightmarish proportions occurs.<br /><br />The horror all starts the morning after a particularly violent thunderstorm in a small town in Maine.  The main character, David Drayton and his family (wife and young son), watch from their front yard as a very heavy mist rolls across the lake from the mountains.  Nothing that appears out of the ordinary and Drayton dismisses it from his mind.  Later, as Drayton and his son go to the grocery store in town, the wail of emergency sirens begins as the mysterious mist creeps into town.  Things become interesting when a bloodied man suddenly bursts into the store yelling something is in the mist and \\"got\\" someone before his very eyes.<br /><br />The suspense and tension begins as everyone first tries to figure out what exactly is the mist, what is out there, what to do, and when it is partly realized what is going on, how to survive in this strange, new world.  I think the movie was very effective in highlighting the various behaviors from certain groups that occur in such a chaotic and bewildering scenario.  The behavior of the \\"sheep\\", those people willing to do anything and listen to anyone to feel safe and secure, and the few people who try to stay calm, clear-headed, and try to make sense of a terrifying situation.<br /><br />I felt the ending was appropriate for such a dark, despairing movie.  It really looks like the end of the world has come, and the ending fits with such a theme.  Any horror movie (or book) fan knows that most horror stories have a dark twist at the end, or if it doesn't end on a dark note, it doesn't conclude with a very happy ending either.  There is always some matters that are left open where you get the sense not all is as it appears to be.  Or if the viewer expects the movie to end in one way, it goes in another direction entirely, stunning the viewer as is the case with The Mist.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was very good and I recommend it.  Of the most recent King adaptations to screen (I'm thinking 1408, which I also saw, and that movie was terrible) it is one of the better ones.opriate for such a dark, despairing movie.

0743289684|5.0|This is a fascinating and compelling memoir of growing up as a Somali Muslim girl in East Africa (mostly Kenya).  It's also the intriguing account of the author's first encounters with life in the West when she moved to the Netherlands.  The book goes far to answer the question how a young woman from a traditional Muslim family who didn't speak a word of Dutch rose in just a few years to become a member of the Dutch Parliament.  There's a surprising twist at the end, when it turns out that Hirsi Ali's path has led her to work for the conservative think tank, American Enterprise Institute.  Her ferocious attacks on Islam as inherently fanatical and cruel fit right into AEI's agenda.  I was left wondering if she had not overlooked the existence of moderate Islam that was actually right there in her own life experience.  Her parents, both of whom were devout and traditional Muslims, did not want to circumcise her, insisted on her getting an education, preferred political persuasion to violence, and abhorred honor killing (luckily for her).    Reading this book is a rich and thought-provoking experience.
B000YENUI6|4.0|...but very good.  Good acting and a good plot, though I felt Naomi Watts was understated and under used.  The feel of the movie is not overly dark as it may seem, but there definitely is a fair share of gore.  It is also definitely not a movie for younger viewers.  My greatest complaint would be it felt the movie ended with only two thirds of the story told, but that does not take away from the quality of the movie itself.  Recommended.

0307383415|4.0|Dreams From My Father    Chapter one is very powerful, the thought of a African man married to a white woman in the United States in the 50s; wow. The descriptions of the  ugly things that were said, were painful for me. When they got to Hawaii, I breathed a sign of relief. I grew up in Hawaii and then as now we had  every color of people one can imagine, though in those days far fewer white people than today. Then his mother meets another man at university and marries Lolo and they are off to Indonesia. I enjoyed chapter two where Lolo teaches him to box. There is a discussion about a man being killed because he was weak, that must have left a very strong impression on Mr.Obama; better to be strong!     The author moves from topic to topic very quickly, one minute he is being forced to do extra schooling, the next he is getting stitches from an injury playing. In chapter three we are back in Hawaii and in school at the age of ten at Punaho; I went to public school, Punaho was for children of privilege.     By the time I reached chapter five I was considering putting down the book, I realize we have to talk about our background to help people know who we are, but it was getting tiresome. There was a powerful line in chapter five, it was the only reason I read chapter six:    My identity might begin with the fact of  my race, bit it didn't, couldn't, end there.    Chapter six was confusing, at one point he writes that his father had died and then he talks about seeing him in jail. Fortunately we reach part two of the book, hopefully it will be stronger. The heading says Chicago, but we are still in New York and the discussion seems to be organizing people for civil rights. At the end of the chapter we go to Chicago.     Another line I think that is important in understanding the author pops up in chapter eight; he is getting his hair cut:    What's your name anyway?  Barack.   Barack, huh.   You a Muslim?   Grandfather was.    Chapter eight was fairly hard on the Christian church too, but I am sure these are all things that he experienced. On the other hand, I have to  wonder if he ever experienced a church helping a widow, or filling in at a soup kitchen, I have seen such things happen and they could have ended  up in the book.  The writing improves in chapter ten, either I am more familiar with the way he says things or he did a better job of telling a  story. In chapter 11, there is a story about Mr. Obama and a girl that he almost clicked with, but it didn't work out.    Do you ever hear from her?   I got a postcard at Christmas. She's happy now; she's met someone. And I have my work.   Is that enough?   Sometimes.    The CHA story is great though like so much of the book, a bit sad. He stays on one story for pages instead of a few paragraphs, you can sense the excitement and investment. I am glad I did not put the book down after chapter six. It ends better than it begins that is for sure. Mr. Obama was very generous to let so many strangers into his headspace. I suppose the $64,000 question is whether a reader is more or less likely to vote for him after reading the book. Speaking only for myself, I do not know, but I certainly feel that I know \\"Barry\\" ( you have to read the book to understand) better.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I fell madly in love with this show a few years ago, and I immediately bought all of the seasons on DVD. Heartwarming, dramatic, witty and FUNNY! It's the \\"perfect package!\\"
B00000251N|5.0|The soundtrack from Johnathan Livingston Seagull is one of the most beautiful, relaxing celebratory of life CDs I have ever heard.  I took my brother's record album when we were young, and I have missed the music since my record collection was ruined in the rain.  I would have paid more for this beautiful music.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|This movie had the potential to truly be a great movie, but there are some serious flaws in this movie which almost completely ruined the film.I truly enjoyed the first segment of the movie with all the great visuals,the hot chicks,stuntman mike,the gore and the soundtrack,but then it all goes downhill from there.The second half of this movie is filled with so much boring,useless and stupid dialogue that it really quite annoyed me to no end.All the female characters in the second half of the movie are completely forgetable and annoying.The main problem with this film is that tarantino should have made a horror exploitation movie of the 70's but instead he made a exploitation movie with several sub genres spliced into one,thus missing his objective.Another major flaw is that tarantino writes way too much pointless dialogue which he probably believes is good.Someone should be brutally honest with him about this because it is ruining his films and he is boring to death many audience members who are paying to see quality work which he isnt delivering.Tarantino needs to clean up his act and get with the program if he ever truly wants to be a great director like stanley kubrick or clive barker.ENOUGH SAID!!!!
B000000WFZ|5.0|Easily one of the top 5 movie scores of all time. The music haunts you - in a good way. If you do not have this score then this is a must.  Being a huge fan of Ennio Morricone and his westerns, this easily is his crowning achievement.
1598561634|5.0|For students and scholars of the Old Testament and Biblical Hebrew, this book is essential for furthering one's personal knowledge and understanding. This is the revised Babylonian text of the Masoretes, considered to be the definitive and one of the more accurate collection of the OT Biblical texts, complete with accurate vowel pointing as well as various notes and study helps (Though you will need to know some Greek and Latin to be able fully utilize these). The text is rather easy to read with moderately sized font. As far as size and weight are considered, it is fairly light and comes in a small portable size. Now, here is the main catch: The binding appears to be very secure, but it is actually very prone to fall apart if not taken care of properly. Dropping it is not a good idea and if a person needs to carry it around in a back pack, make sure that it is placed securely so the spine will not be rendered crooked by other items in the bag(this will prove fatal for your BHS' cover if these measure are not properly taken). It is probably better to carry in a small book back or satchel than a back pack, as my Hebrew professor suggested to me (his fell apart).    Aside from that last draw back, this edition of the Hebrew Bible is a must have for scholars and is an excellent resource for Hebraic studies.
0307388840|5.0|This is a delicious, provocative read...beautifully written and crafted with aching accuracy.  Rich in both historical detail, period atmosphere and character development, I daresay reading the novel is a much better way to spend your time than seeing the melodramatic film version which at least is helping to propel book sales.<br /><br />Try to avoid the movie hype if possible and enjoy the novel on its own merit.
B000WTNCQS|4.0|re: the DVD of the show in Paris...    I wasn't a real fan of the Rattle & Hum movie - also from this tour.  I found it a little pompous and over-blown at times (perhaps it was a foreshadowing of the spectacle that future tours would become).    I do NOT find that with this show from Paris that's included with the deluxe version of the re-release.  The thing that I like most about this show is that it's pretty bare-boned.  Its four guys playing music, no forced or in-your-face statements, no big production, no overwhelming technology...  It lets the songs and the music speak on their own, for themselves.  It provides a snapshot of the band at their performance pinnacle sans the technology.  They're confident, they're interacting, they're themselves and they're brutally honest.       Don't get me wrong, I like the DVDs of the concerts after this one but I find them much more scripted; where the band members seem so much a cog in the larger event.  One where they've even been choreographed at points (stand here, go there, do that, time for this move...).      This particular Joshua Tree show is about the band, the music and the performance.  Simply four musicians and their songs!  It acts as a striking portrait of the band at this place in time.  And of who each of the members are, rather than depicting them as pieces in machine that U2 often seems to have become.  And it's stunning in its openness, the portrayal of the band and the stripped-bare performance.
0786852550|4.0|As a parent and part-time librarian, I read across ages groups and genres looking for good books. I thought \\"Amulet of Samarkand\\" was a very good book. I found it hard to put down, though it isn't the kind of book I normally read. Bartimaeus was quite a character and full of commical relief in both his footnotes (which you should read) and in his overall mannerisms. The book was very descriptive and did a great job of creating a very modern and beliveable world of magic. My final remark on the book, highly recomended for those of you out who are looking for a good fantasy series to keep you spellbound.
B000X1R4S2|5.0|keeping it short and sweet...this book was gripping and kept me on edge i carried it with me everywhere reading a page any chance i got never in my life have i been so captivated by a book
B0000AK7AB|1.0|The movie is fine, but the DVD has previews of other movies that cannot be skipped over. Please don't pay money to support this practice. If you pay for the movie, you shouldn't have to pay again by watching ads.
B00000DFTG|2.0|The first real live album from the original four members .....Tony, Geezer and Bill really lay it down heavy, sounding as tight as ever... WAR PIGS, the opener, is terrific and spine-tingling until Ozzy opens his mouth.....\\"F\\"-bomb after \\"F\\"-bomb, seems like every 4th measure, Ozzy shows how light-weight and totally vacuous this guy's head is....Believe me, folks , he was not like this in the 70's....Where for aught thou, friend Ozzy???<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this release, originally, but one listen and it went on Ebay......<br /><br />I have heard that there was going to be a cleaned up version because of all the complaints the label execs received...But I've yet to hear anymore about this.  Be warned...Profanity galore, and way off key vocals completely ruin this noble effort from 3 of the 4 members.
B000ZK4466|5.0|...of their first three albums. Also boasts one of their finest album closers \\"Conjugal Burns\\". In my opinion they keep getting better with every successive album (despite what DITC & FTM fanatics may say). This cd is definitely worth buying.
B00001ZT6Z|2.0|What in the world???  Tony Iommi puts on another great solo show (I don't care what they say, this isn't Black Sabbath) with his sledgehammer riffs, but Martin's lyrics are really pushing the edge....I guess it's a Satan hero worship thing with him...Why Iommi allowed this kind of imagery, I don't know....Ozzy and Geezer really let Tony I. have it after the release of this disc....The rewards of Hell???  Have mercy..........
B000WZAE1I|5.0|What a great movie!  This is what storytelling is supposed to be like.  It's creative, funny, endearing and contains some universal truth.  It's a joy to watch and if you own the Princess Bride; you'll probably buy this one too.  This movie really made my month!!
B00005CDNK|5.0|I have 2 ABBA albums, the box set Thank You for The Music, and this one.  I really like this one, their final album (I doubt there will ever be a reunion).  It has a lot of sadness in it (the romantic liasons in the band were coming apart by this time), and it gives the songs a dark edge to them, something that is noticably missing in other ABBA albums.  I love the title track.  It's one of my favorite ABBA tracks with an edge of darkness to it, yet it's still a great pop song.  Head Over Heals and One of Us are great pop ABBA classics, and I love the closer (at least on the original album ) Like an Angel Passing Through My Room.  It's a sad, sad lullaby song, a worthy closer to ABBA's darkest album.  This reiusse has The Day Before You Came and Under Attack, which was ABBA's last single (A-Side and B-Side).  I love both those songs, and I'm glad this edition has them.  Obviously, if you're an ABBA completist, you have to have this one, but those who are even slightly interested in ABBA should pick it up too.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|The soundtrack to the wonderful movie \\"Love Actually\\" is wonderful as stand alone music.  Very well recorded and with nice soundstage for the genre, this is enjoyable music that is easy to listen to and presents a broad range of styles.  Well worth owning.
1594489505|5.0|After reading \\"The Kite Runner\\" i seriously had high expectations on this new book. I didnt know if this book could even get close his first novel.  After i began reading i couldnt put it down. Housseni has a very unique way of writing, very simple, easy to understand and it just makes you want more and more.  To a lot of western people the middle eastern culture and the women dressed in the Burqa are a mystery. With this book you see that those women are only women, just like any other woman in a different country.  I loved this book and Housseini is one of my favorite Authors. I love the way he writes and tells a story. He is very gifted!Im looking foward to his next books. In$allah soon.
0802714544|5.0|JOHN LeCARRE is not just a spy-story narrator, he is a GREAT writer! His prose is tight, imaginative and beautiful. His imagery is majestic. And his grasp of human nature is truly impressive.<br /><br />This book was his first; no matter, most of his writing skills shine to full strength. At the hight of the Cold War, Alec Leamas is a British agent on a seemingly uncontrolled downwards spiral. After loosing one of his sources (shot and killed while crossing the Berlin wall), he is recalled back to London and then he experiences betrayal by every side imaginable. He resorts to drinking, and depressive thoughts, and revisiting the mistakes of his life. But of course the Game is played constantly and one should not trust anyone. Ever. In a world where double-crossings are common and triple-crossings not uncommon, can anyone trust long enough to find love?<br /><br />This book conveyed such an original atmosphere that many suspected JOHN LeCARRE being a former MI6 insider. Those suspicions were latter confirmed (his secret agent status was blown by none other than Kim Philby, the notorious double agent for the KGB). This is definitely THE BEST spy story ever written!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000Y2WAKM|4.0|...from a man called E!<br /><br />Companioned with [[ASIN:B000Y2WAL6 Useless Trinkets: B Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996-2007 (2CD+DVD)]], this just might be all you would ever need from the Eels first 10 years.  All 36 songs are terrific and while I may miss a few favorites, most of them are here and the Eels albums are well represented.<br />Anyone new to the Eels, this is a good primer.<br /><br />True fans of the Eels probably have more or all these tracks from the albums, making this not so neccessary.  Just get the Rarities album in that case.  But for completists, this is a must as it has 12 good quality videos on the companion DVD.  So yeah, you might as well just pick this up no matter who you are.  ;']<br /><br />While I have your ear, let me recommend [[ASIN:B000C20VJG Eels with Strings - Live at Town Hall]].  It is the best concert video I have seen in a long time and a great companion piece to this Best Of CD.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for, go pick this up!  It truly is Novocaine For The Soul...
0553260111|1.0|I can count on one hand the number of books I have not finished once started. This is one of them. The movies were OK so I figured I'd give the book a try.  I managed to make it 164 pages and just can't force myself to go on.  It's pretty bad that the author can't keep track of what kind of gun is being carried by a given character.  First it's a revolver, then a paragraph or two later it's an automatic, then it's a revolver again, all describing the same gun!  Even worse, one of the bad guys is described as carrying a long-barreled revolver with a silencer.  Anyone at all familiar with firearms knows that you can not silence a revolver!  For those not in the know, a tremendous amount of blast and noise escapes from around the cylinder gaps.  Can't silence that.    I could go on but I would just be repeating what many of the other 1 and 2 star reviewers have stated.    I'm just glad I bought the book used and am only out a couple bucks.
0689870280|5.0|My daughter LOVES this book!  She is 4 months old, and we have been reading it to her for a month now as part of the \\"going to bed\\" routine.  It is simple and fun, and the rhyme includes things she can relate to - taking a bath, getting pajamas on (both of which are also part of her bedtime routine), etc.  Even when she is fussy, her face lights up when we get this book out, and she quiets down for one run through.  She has several other bedtime books that are very popular, but she will not sit through them.  Most are too long for an infant, or have content that is not as meaningful to her.

0312323867|5.0|I bought Something Borrowed at a 2nd hand store for 29 cents, thinking if it wasn't good then I would not be upset. Well I loved it and so I had to get Something Blue. I did not want to like Darcy but over the course of reading the book you totally learn to like her and understand why she acted the way she did. Both books were so wonderful and fast reads that I had to order another book by Emily Griffin. FABULOUS!!!!

B000PY52EU|1.0|the theatrical promos show a black man with a half naked white girl at his feet in chains, sort of a reverse slavery picture only of course this black man has really GOOD intentions for the white girl in chains, one wonders if the racial roles were reversed showing a white man with a black girl in chains at his feet, of course being white he would not be so unselfishly benevolant.      i mean please, the title itself should be a give away, BLACK SNAKE? whats the movie got to do with a snake?  MOAN? the sexual refrence is obvious except to the most obtuse.  this is whats now called 'playing the race card' or black exploitation film.    besides that its a film about a man who has no training in counseling, no training, in psychology, a man who couldnt keep his own marriage together being so arrogant as to believe he could 'help' someone with a serious mental disorder, (or not depending on your view) by chaining her up.    his own mental issues and internal fantasy world in which he finds he must help this half naked girl to find his own personal redemption should be the real story.      so what qualifies this person to be the great saviour of wayward nymphets?  well he is or was a musician, and we all know of course that musicians can accomplish what others can only dream of doing.  this movie reminds me of a book variable star that promotes the near deification of musicians, but in that book which is full of 'trained' counselors no one thinks twice about the girl who is going to have sex with everyman on the space ship before the journeys end.  our gal in chains was born too soon to be a fully accepted nymphet, in our time she's fair game to be humiliated, chained, and her mind altered by a blues musician to get her 'normal' again.    how about for black snake II he chain up a 'gay man' to cure him of his promiscuous ways?  black snake III will be lesbians, then Iv will be chronic masturbators.  oh the possiblities.    this movie isnt just bad, its absurd.
B000E5KUK6|1.0|I just watched Cloverfield the other day, then went and rented this 'Godzilla' movie which I hadn't watched in years to compare. This was supposed to be a remake/re-doing of an international icon, and this is what they came up with?  Cloverfield is what Godzilla SHOULD have been!        The original Godzilla in the 50's was a serious film, the people of Japan lived in fear. Cloverfield established this terror. This 'Godzilla' was a joke.  There was a huge monster running around New York City and the people in the movie acted as if it were business as usual. One scene, for example, the big lizard had just destroyed 3 Apache helicopters. Next scene, Matthew Broderick is buying coffee and pregnancy tests at drug store. The store is still open, there is still power, what's going on here?    And this Godzilla is a mutated IGUANA.  Fine, thats ok, but iguanas do not eat fish... they are mostly vegetarian.  That whole scene where they lured the monster to this huge hill of fish was ridiculous. And Matthew Broderick's character called it an amphibian, which iguana's aren't.    There are so many bad things about this movie, the acting, the whole plot in general, what is wrong with Hollywood when they allow a so called blockbuster movie like this to be made?  The teaser trailers were good, not showing the monster.  The monster itself was not a disappointment, just how the movie developed and how the whole situation wasn't taken seriously by characters of this movie. Bad movie.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|I loved this movie, but I knew that when Disney took over Pixar things would change. The extras are bleak and pathetic. Very different from the old Toy Story Pixar days. If extras are what you are after (like commentary or behind the scenes shorts) then you are better off going and renting this from your local vendor. You'll get through them in a matter of minutes. I'm disappointed but still gave it 3 stars for Pixar's latest effort... It's a great movie but the DVD has been Disney-ized.
B000UR366S|4.0|I am really enjoying this CD. It feels comfortable like an old joni \\"slipper\\" and new all at once. I'm so glad she came out with another one. She's been with me since I was old enough to appreciate music and Shine makes me feel like she will always be there and never let me down.  kam
B000UFAURI|5.0|As a band gets older, if they are a decent band they try new things and explore new areas.  If they didn't do that, they would be dismissed as derivative and they would quickly go to the bargain bin and play the county fair circuit.  Fortunately, the Foo Fighters are a great band, and they have certainly grown by leaps and bounds on this new album.  They have recorded many songs that hearken back to the earlier stuff (Let It Die, The Pretender, Erase/Replace) and they have tweaked those hard-rockin' melodies to create smooth harmonies (Summer's End) and beautiful ballads (Home).  Some have lamented the fact that the Foos have picked up acoustic guitars as of late (Beaconsfield and Stranger Things) but to me that is a sure sign that Dave and the band are more confident than ever that their music and lyrics are strong and emotional.  And I think many of their fans agree, what with the success of In Your Honor and the acoustic tour. In my opinion (and many other's opinions), this band has hit their creative stride, and they are going to skyrocket even higher.  My favorite track on this album is Come Alive, because it reminds me of February Stars, my favorite Foo track of all time.  And that's my point.  They have reached back, taken some of their earlier ideas and expanded on them to create something at once familiar and brand-new. Kudos to you guys.
0760750874|5.0|I love this book, and it's the perfect size to fit in a purse to carry with you wherever you go.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|The action packed movie with an artistic slant ranks a 5 out 5 for me, despite being a self proclaimed history buff.
B000002MH5|5.0|.....and thats not just my little opinion. Its a fact! I was SO amazed when I got this recently. If youre thinking of buying this one just for the couple of well known songs here (\\"Out There\\" & \\"Start Choppin'\\")-youre in for more than u bargained for! To me, its a passionate album. I cant explain it. But how can I explain ANY Dinosaur Jr. album? In any case- I promise youll be swept away. (Yes- Im using cheesy cliches here)but if I was impressed- which I rarely am- YOU will be too! Ill always hold this one dear to me cuz it blew me away from the start and so far hasnt gotten old....and I CANT STOP PLAYING IT! ...also check out these other CDs by J. Mascis and this friggin GENIUS band. Ive always loved 'em always will....but recently I was taken back and fell in love all over again.....(yea more cliches)<br /><br />* EAR BLEEDING COUNTRY: THE BEST OF DINOSAUR JR. (this one is good for starters. Gets u familiar with their work if youre not already)<br />* GREEN MIND (J. Mascis plays every instrument here except MURPH on drums on some of the trax).........<br />......Actually...just buy any random Dino. Jr. CD. You can do it with your eyes closed and youll buy something too amazing for words. YES. Theyre THAT good. (and the band members changed over the years but it doesnt matter to me really.)

B000VZD8TO|5.0|Excellent -author spent 4 to 5 hrs in Heaven-while \\"dead\\" on Hospital Monitoring equipment,  Medical Dr's & Nurses too busy with other Medical  Emergencies, so they couldn't check on her. The equipment showed she was gone, so they saved other patients that night.  But she came back to life the next morning. Because it wasn't her time, she was sent back. What she reports about her experience is so beautiful and wonderful, that you lose all fear of death, and know that Life  -after life here-  will be a loving, joyous experience with Christ, the Light of our lives and with your other soul mates, many of whom are with you through eons -in different roles. Heaven's Library is incredible -the beauty, the music, the flowers -Wow!! Well written, beautiful, real. Recommend for anyone grieving or facing terminal illness, as Drs thought she was. She's been on Radio & TV, a sweet and beautiful soul. This will do your heart good. I read this book about 12 yrs ago. It impresses your soul and stays with you.
B00062RCBW|1.0|Be careful and know what you are getting. Seller \\"marge1962\\" (Marge Cohen) sold me a set from here that was clearly not what I ordered. It was some kind of foreign import (Chinese bootleg?) version. The quality was inferior (looks like a 2nd generation copy, no pun intended) and she, the seller, was deceptive, rude and unhelpful.    If you are a ST:TNG fan, this isn't the set you are looking for. You need to find the current, updated series in the large green box: ASIN# B000RZIGVS (do an Amazon search for that number).

0060254920|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite picture books. I purchase this book often as gifts for friends with children. The illustrations are fabulous. This book truley promotes imagination.   I also recommend books by Beau Beaudoin. He has become my children's favorite author and illustrator.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|***WARNING SPOILERS***  How do you keep faith in anything greater than yourself, when at any moment your life can be extinguished by forces outside of your control?  This is one of the basic struggles of human existence.  To live in constant fear is really not living at all.  Our hero Theo kept his faith, even after losing his infant son to chance illness.  He keeps his faith, even after the love of his life is killed before his eyes.  He keeps his faith, even after his old friend is killed before his eyes.  He stumbles through the endless war-torn wasteland on an unclear mission, not really knowing for sure whether his actions will ultimately help save humanity.  Countless times during his journey, our hero is on the razor's edge, where the slightest single variance in his actions or the actions of those around him will lead to certain death.        Was Theo successful in his mission?  If you believe he was successful, was his success due to his faith and perseverence, or did he just get lucky?  Do we human beings value faith, determination and self-sacrifice as virtues, or are we all just waiting around for chance to shine favorably upon us?
B000OCZESC|4.0|This was a fun book of stories. Though I laughed at times when I probably shouldn't I must admit overall I enjoyed it.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because there were a few in there that were kinda lame and this is most certainly not a book for children. If I had known that at the time I purchased it I probably wouldn't have. This is certainly a must have for fans of Tim Burton.  Another book I would recommend would be [[ASIN:0978840119 Boetry]] by Beau Beaudoin. He too has a collection of macabre stories written in rhyme but suitable for all ages and the illustrations are outstanding.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This period drama is very well made. It is very romantic and Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe have excellent chemistry. I have watched this about 5 times and can watch it 5 more. The ending is especially romantic, although it differs from the book's ending. This deviation from the book is excusable in that it did make for a much more exciting movie ending. I should add that a 19th century unmarried lady would never engage in a passionate kiss at a train station, but I still LOVED IT!
B000002WYT|5.0|When I was three years old, my family lived in Kentucky, and times were a little rough. My mother was training to be a guidance counsler. My dad was shifting between janitor at a local high school and earning his Ph. D. at Siminary. I saw my dad all day, and my mom all night. Every day before he left for work he would play Crash Into Me for me. \\"I'm the king of the castle\\" was the favorite(and only) line I knew. The rest didn't matter. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard, and if I am ever shipwrecked on a desert island this is the only thing I could ever ask for.
B000ZK4466|5.0|This album is unbelievable. I think the first thing on everyone's mind is whether or not this album is as good as or better than the previous album. I personally enjoyed Amputechture, but those of you that felt a void after listening to it, rest assured, this album could be their best work to date.     Pridgen brings so much energy to this band... The first time you listen to this album you will realize the difference between this new energy as opposed to records past. Not to spark up the Theodore vs. Pridgen debate, but the drumming on this album had me grinning ear to ear as I listened through this album.    Cedric's lyrics are as dark as ever, and his singing is as versatile as it's ever been on a record. And of course, Omar still has a knack for coming up with exciting melodies.    I cannot say enough good things about this album. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not add this album to your collection. Is this their best album to date? Maybe. It is still too early to tell, but it sure does match up to all of their previous works.    Enjoy.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|The first thing I noticed about these headphones were the comfort--the material was very soft and fit just around my ears (though it may not work for others, as I have very small ears). The headband, stuffed with a little cotton, fits especially well over my head, and does not beat down on the top as some other plastic ones have.<br /><br />After I put them on, I noticed that I could hear EVERYTHING...which might be good or bad, depending on its use. It is good for closed performances (without an audience) because every tiny nuance provided by the performer is presented crystal-clear. In fact, at certain very, very quiet pauses, I even could hear the orchestra turn the page (literally)! However, it is not so good for live performances, where every obnoxious *cough, cough* or *HACKGH, HACKGH* from the audience can be heard, equally crystal-clear.<br /><br />Another trait of these headphones is that, when I let others try them, the headphones don't leak. That is, I can't hear what they are listening to unless I jam my ears against theirs, and they certainly can't hear me. This \\"containment\\" of the sound is probably the reason why the music sounds much louder through these than through the others I have tried.<br /><br />Overall, I think these headphones are worth the price. However, they don't leak as much sound as the Panasonic noise-canceling headphones, and they are especially comfortable and EXTREMELY, I repeat EXTREMELY clear.
6304698690|5.0|I love this movie, the best version of a classic story.  The screenplay, casting, acting, sets, music, cinematography, costumes, everything is first rate.  The story is the best part, told to perfection here.  I highly recommend this version. Your whole family will enjoy it forever.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|i really love the entire album, even better than hail to the thief. sublime for its music and inspiring for its initial internet release...such a wonderful band.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This movie is a really dark mess; a total waste of time.<br /><br />I once read a bio of the real Bros Grimm which said they were Linguists who collectored the fold stories told to them by persons they encountered while traveling for their research.  Many European tales are scary indeed, but we have the Grimm Bros to thank for preserving the folk heritage of central Europe.<br /><br />It's just too bad they didn't make a good film about it.  Maybe someone will yet, but it's not this one.<br /><br />SKIP this film.  Instead, read the Grimm's Bros books.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|such a great band, with a lead singer with an enchanting voice.  \\"Funeral\\" and \\"St. Augustine\\" are the star tracks...but definitely a great listen from the first track to the last.

B000VL9XE2|5.0|I haven't written a review in a long time, and the negative responses to Ire Works angered me enough to write a retort of my own.  I can only put it this way - those who criticize this record for not being like Calculating Infinity, quite simply, are not artists.  You may play music, but you are not an artist.  I'm not necessarily saying I am a great musician, or an artist at all, but I think I understand the creative process well enough to \\"get\\" what Ben and company are doing here.  This band, first of all, is not the same lineup as the one that created Calculating Infinity.  And secondly, the one person left, Ben Weiman, is an absolute genius.  He definitely has the capacity to create another Calculating Infinity.  I'm sure he's got all sorts of great riffs, solos, and spazzy jazz guitar runs milling around in his head.  No one writes music like him.  And all he did on Calculating Infinity was put a bunch of riffs together, and have someone yell incoherently over it.  I'm a fan of the record, the energy and technicality are quite frankly mindblowing - and many, many DEP fans were made on the basis of that record.  I know I was.  However it takes maturity to recognize it for what it really is, a band with tons of ideas quickly getting something creative out there.  Miss Machine, and Ire Works by extension, have made DEP into something much more than a niche extreme metal act who specialize in one \\"trick.\\"  Metal can be so limiting, which is why 95% of extreme metal acts just make the same record over and over again for their entire careers.  There are only so many different combinations of bass/guitar interlocking riffs and screaming vocals out there.  Dillinger Escape Plan has made a complete work of art with Ire Works.  They have established themselves, in my opinion, as the Radiohead of this kind of music.  That doesn't mean they're the best extreme metal band out there (I think that is Mastodon) but I make the Radiohead comparison for a reason.  Radiohead and DEP (on Ire Works) make music that reveals itself differently over hundreds and hundreds of listens.  To achieve this kind of artistic pinnacle, you must be firing on all cylinders.  There must be great lyrics, great riffs, great melodies, great instrumental performances on every song from every player, and there must be an unparalleled attention to detail.  There must be that something extra.  Both Radiohead and DEP (on Ire Works) hide little surprises in the mixes, electronic blips here and there, a tambourine mixed deep on a track, atmospherics, swirling guitars you never noticed, a buried haunting vocal scream you never heard until the 50th time, and on and on.  And they're not superfluous, they are part of the song in an important, if not immediately accessible, way.  The songs on Ire Works have revealved themselves to me gradually over the course of dozens of listens.  I can speak only for myself (though I'm sure other reviewers will agree) but this is what makes an album an \\"experience.\\"  This is what makes captital A \\"ART\\" in my humble opinion.  Ire Works, Radiohead's In Rainbows, Miles Davis' Kind of Blue - these examples are not just great musical recordings but statements that have transcended \\"popular music,\\" at least for myself.<br /><br />The criticism comes from lame scenesters and angry kids, or angry kids at heart, who cannot stomach \\"their\\" band achieving this kind of SUCCESS - it is simply beyond their comprehension.  This same old song and dance is repeated every year, a band grows, and their old fans reject the new sound.  But this situation, I feel, is slightly different.  Dillinger Escape Plan still traffics, by and large, in the same kind of extreme, jarring, very difficult heavy metal-hardcore music.  Your average pop fan or average hard rock fan would think much of this record - even Milk Lizard - is unlistenable.  Pucciato's grating yells and abrasive vocal attitude, not to mention the screaching guitars and perverse time signatures would be enough to turn most mainstream music fans away from this record, even at its \\"poppiest\\" moments.  Some of the most aggressive songs on this record would have been right at home on Calculating Infinity, except that they're even better.  They ebb and flow even while the rhythms perplex - this is called great heavy metal songwriting.  No one can pull it off like this band.  The attention to detail in the recording and mixing process, again, reminds me of Radiohead.  It's absolute headphone perfection.  So again, if you don't at least appreciate the strides this band has made from the days of Calculating Infinity, then you do not understand what art is.  It is a process, a metamorphasis, a gradual awakening.  You might prefer other Dillinger records (though for my money this is far and away their best) but if you do not at least understand that Black Bubblegum is an incredible pop rock song, that When Acting as a Particle is a great slice of ambient music, and that Dead as History is spectacular progressive rock - whether or not you like these genres - then you are not a sophisticated listener.  I hate to be judgmental, or proclaim my opinion as fact, but this is how I see it.  Dillinger Escape Plan have launched themselves into waters where few bands have dared to tread.  This record deserves to be seriously approached and respected as great art and not just as a good ole headbanging time (though it certainly can be both, and is!).  There are thousands of groups of that provide thrash riffs and screaming.  There are only a handful that demand and command so much from the listener.  Don't have it from these lame scenesters, experience this transcednece - over and over again - for yourself, in your own way.  Dillinger wouldn't have it any other way.  Also, this album rocks amazingly hard.gh to turn most mainstream music fans away from this record, even at its \\"poppiest\\" moments.

B0001M0A4I|4.0|It was inevitable that Tony Banks would 'go classic' one day. After all, he had had some classical training before turning into a rock musician, and his keyboard work for Genesis always had a slightly classical flavour. 'Seven' is his first real effort in this direction, and it works well, although it's not totally convincing. The problem with rock musicians composing 'classical' music is always that they tend to integrate the rock idiom in the music, which makes them sound either as adepts of the modern classic composers like Copland or Bernstein or as film composers like Ennio Morricone. Banks avoids these traps pretty well. The music has pastoral shades and is reminiscent of English composers like Vaugh Williams. It's all well done, but not very surprising. When you are a fan of Tony Banks, you will miss the typical Banks chord changes and melodrama. 'Seven' is a bit too neat. But a promising start; I'm sure Tony will come up with some amazing new Suite someday.
0316166685|4.0|When I first hear of the Lovely Bones then, the plot (young girl narrates her life and murder from heaven) seemed to just too hokey for me. But, after it was recommended to me a half dozen times, I decided to give it a go. I am really glad I did. Seabold walks a fine line between cheesy and brilliant here. Dead child narrators are not an easy trick, and at times the book is a little maudlin and contrived. But, the scene where the child narrates her own murder gave me chills. Definitely worth a look.
B000VNMMPM|4.0|Angel-A is a black and white movie based on a classic tale.  The movie seems surprisingly \\"Hollywood\\" in its idealized theme, especially when you consider it's a French movie.  Lovers of French film know how popular the themes of darkness and realism are. Still, Besson's skills as a master film maker shine through.  The cinematography is fantastic.  When you add in great acting, it's easier to swallow the pill of a very allegorical story.<br /><br />Acting and Direction<br /><br />The acting really is the hallmark of this movie.  Jamel Debbouze was amazing as Andre, the small time hustler with big dreams. He delivers some very difficult scenes with realism and power.<br /><br />Rie Rasmussen is also great as Angela.  In the one DVD special feature, she talks about French not being her native tongue, which makes her dialogue all the more impressive.  The director plays her against Andre using the contrasts of her height against his shortness, her beauty against his average looks and shabby clothes.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also good, no doubt due to Besson's fine direction.<br /><br />The Story and the Script<br /><br />This story is hard to swallow.  Even though Andre isn't really American, they manage to throw in some anti-American insults too.  The script is clean, yet at times forced.  Perhaps I am being too cynical.  Still, the filmmaker, cast and crew make it work.  Even a basic outline almost gives away the very predictable story line, so I won't go there.  See it for yourself and be the judge.<br /><br />Cinematography<br /><br />For those who love fine art photography or just great film in general, this DVD is a gem.  There are so many beautiful shots of Paris.  It's done very expertly in black and white.  One of the things that comes across in the \\"making of\\" feature is how tightly Besson works with his crew of many years.<br /><br />It also made me wonder, how big was the budget for this film?  How much is high-end camera equipment these days?  It's just amazing they could produce such a visually amazing movie on an \\"independent film\\" budget.  If it's true it bodes well for the future.<br /><br />DVD Extras<br /><br />While there is only the one main \\"making of\\" feature, it is loaded with actual production info.

It's a nice extra, but how I greedily wish there was more!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Overall, this is an uplifting and entertaining movie, especially if you can suspend disbelief for 2 hours.

B000JJRIO8|2.0|These industry pimps have been killing the man's music since Nu-Mixx Klazzics and they havent stopped yet(Hmmmm I wonder why). Is this album as bad as they say it is? YES! There are about three songs that are spin-worthy. The Swizz Beatz remake of Untouchable feat Krayzie Bone is okay. Dumpin feat Hussein Fatal, Papoose and Carl Thomas is the best track on here. Pac, Fatal and Papoose's verses fit perfectly over a suspenseful beat and Carl Thomas wasnt too shabby on the chorus. Dont Sleep(feat Lil Scrappy, Nutso and Yaki Kadafi) is cool. Take out Lil Scrappy's lukewarm verse and its a banger. The rest of this album is musical mutilation. Pac's Life feat T I and Ashanti makes me cringe till this day. Taking Pac's verses from This Life I Lead and putting them over a corny club beat. Disgusting and the remix with Snoop Dogg and Chris Starr is absolutely pointless. Things go from bad to worse when they drag Pac down to Jarule's poppy level with Playa Cardz Right(male and female) The female version with Keyshia Cole is painfully weak and the male version with Ludacris and Keon Bryce will put you to sleep. I like the quirky beat to What's Next but Pac's verse sounds like it was squeezed in there and the guests(A3 and Jay Rock) suck! Young Buck and Chamillionaire's verses were okay on Sleep but the beat provided by Sha Money XL is excruciating to listen to. More choas would ensue with the pathetic, clubby sounding International feat Nipsey Hustle(Snoop Dogg Jr) and Young Dre The Truth. Soon As I Get Home feat Kadafi and Untouchable(feat Hussein, Kadafi and Gravy) are just as boring as the male version of Playa Cards Right. To add more insult to injury Dont Stop(feat Kadafi, Fatal, EDI, Big Syke and Stormy) laugh out loud hiliarious and I dont think that track was intended to be funny(also does it makes sense for a song of that nature to have a clubby beat to it? Think about it). Bottom Line: Pac's Life is more butchering of the man's music by scoundrels that wont let go. We all know that Pac wouldnt have made a song with a lot of these cats on here. But on the real I have to tell you something. If you are not cool with the massacre of Pac's music then you need to stop supporting these clone albums. We already know that these records execs wont stop this madness so the least you can do is to not support it. We all love Pac but we have to draw the line somewhere and say that we cant keep supporting the milking of his legacy. Be a part of the solution not part of the problem.

B000000993|5.0|This is arguably my favorite Tool album.  It still holds the anger and heaviness of \\"Opiate\\" but the songs are structured much better, not to mention they're longer too (the songs on \\"Opiate\\" were pretty much short and to the point).  The production is top notch.  The music itself is nothing short of amazing.  Same with Maynard's lyrics.  Absolutly, hands down the best lyrics he's ever written.  If your a Tool fan obviously you already own this.  If you don't, pick it up.  I have owned this album since I was a sophomore in high school and it still holds its own.
1569242739|5.0|This book is perfect in every way. Not only does it perfect the classic cupcakes like chocolate and vanilla, but the other ideas that Terry and Isa came up with, like the apple cider and pistachio-rosewater varieties, are so creative and amazing. Before I got this book, I had only thought about cupcakes as something that went along with a 6-year-old's birthday--now I make cupcakes for almost every party and potluck I attend. And with options like gluten free and low-fat included, everyone in my social circle is happier for my having discovered this gem.

B00103584Y|2.0|If you like thumping, loud, monotonous music, you may like this film better than I did. With all the hungry, talented musicians in the world, I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.    Although I liked Potente in other films, it was difficult for me to find the characters interesting. Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love, but her boyfriend seemed worthless.    Yes, this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point. That is a good idea for a film, but I just think, in spite of the attempts at originality, the result did not bear fruit. For a more intelligent film about the possibilities arising from a situation, I think Rashomon would be a better way to spend your time.

0805079831|5.0|This book has been a great eye-opener for me. For many years I have wondered why so many countries turned to democracies only to have their whole economies slide into a complete shambles. Could all of these people who were smart enough to lead their nations to democracy be so uninformed when it comes to running their economies? This book definitely blows the lid off and exposes how the rich globalists may relinquish political power to these fledgling democracies, as well as the more established ones, but they never, ever let go of the purse-strings, and in this way they ensure the continued rise to wealthier levels for the rich, the fall to greater poverty for the poor, and the gradual, but steady, elimination of the middle class. It makes you wonder how long it will be before there is a major upheaval by the poor and middle classes and if it will come in time to bring the world back to it's senses.

B000TLTUL0|4.0|Being a total stranger to the stage version of this Sondheim musical, I have nothing to compare the movie version to - but, that being said, this version is more than strong enough to stand by itself as an excellent entry into the movie musical canon.    Benjamin Bratt (Depp) and his wife fall prey to the lustful advances of crooked Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman)  -she becomes his unwilling lover and eventually poisons herself, he is sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. Their daughter Joanna, in the years Bratt is exiled, has matured into a lovely young thing and is now the ward of Turpin, who, assisted by his revolting manservant Beadle Bamford (Spall), decides he's going to make Joanna his bride. Bratt returns, assumes the name of Sweeney Todd, and with the help of ex-sailor Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) and crazed baker Mrs. Lovett (Bonham-Carter), seeks revenge against the Judge and the awful city where his former happy life was destroyed.    Almost every single aspect of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is handled with a graceful and satisfying polish: from the acting to the musical numbers, the cinematography to the pacing, there's a kind of staccato rhythm to the entire film that complements the plentiful songs beautifully. Depp is excellent as Todd, he'd acquired a new depth of maturity of late, and portrays this older psychotic gentleman with as much effective pathos and charisma as he did almost twenty years ago with Edward Scissorhands. Bonham-Carter, for her part, makes an excellent foil to Depp's maniacal, malevolent barber: her careless, unsophisticated attitude towards Todd's misdeeds and her lazy, detached reading of the part make for a very watchable and oddly sympathetic character.    Other cast nods must go to Ed Sanders as Toby, an amazing child actor with an excellent voice, and more than capable of keeping pace with his adult colleagues, Timothy Spall camps it up beautifully as the truly revolting Beadle Bamford, and Alan Rickman's Judge Turpin is believable and malevolent and very satisfying to watch.    Tim Burton's outdone himself again with \\"Sweeney Todd\\" - the direction is beautiful: monochromatic and stark gothic cityscapes contrast with the lush scarlet of spraying blood to suggest an atmosphere of fear and tension that the vast majority of contemporary horror movies lack in spades. The appearance of Joanna and Mrs. Lovett's By The Sea fantasy sequence provide some much-needed visual relief from the grimness, and make the film's end and characters all the more poignant and compelling.     The downsides of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" for me come in the shape of Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony (I didn't buy his Lovelorn Hero for a second, he comes across as weak and tiresome), and from the fact that the whole movie does suffer from a lag towards the end: the pace if \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is slow, which is fine, but I can't help thinking that if some of the latter musical numbers, and thereby the entire film, would have been better at a faster pitch. \\"Sweeney Todd\\" makes some big promises in the first half, but reneges on a few in the second - still, the ending is satisfying enough, and overall, this doesn't make a huge change to the viewer's enjoyment levels.    For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Sweeney Todd\\" - it's not for everyone, particularly not for people who like their musicals fast and flashy, like Chicago or Hairspray. This is a slower, more sombre, and far more visceral experience - but if you're a Burton fan, or a lover of gothic drama, then give this a go. It's very, very rewarding for those viewers that can appreciate it for what it is.    Recommended.
0307387178|4.0|To find oneself in this world, one must walk into the wild.  Jon Krakauer depicts this statement in his 1996 bestselling nonfiction book, Into the Wild, in which he documents the struggle of Chris McCandless in the wilderness of Alaska.  McCandless, a young man of twenty-four years and fresh out of college, is portrayed as a well mannered, sociable, and self-sufficient man throughout this documentation. McCandless, inspired mainly by his favorite authors who include Jack London and Leo Tolstoy, decides to embark on an adventure into the wild.   The book begins by documenting the discovery of a bus in the wilderness of Alaska in September of 1992 by some moose hunters. On further inspection, they find a decomposed body later identified as Christopher McCandless.   Krakauer begins to write the bulk of the tragic story in pieces through different sightings of McCandless, who had dropped his name and adopted the pseudonym \\"Alexander Supertramp\\". Sightings of this \\"Alex\\" dated back to 1990, right after he graduated from college. According to various reports cited in the book, McCandless hitchhiked up and down the western areas of the United States, taking minor jobs such as a server at McDonalds, and sleeping anywhere he could. His journey finally ended in Alaska, where he died around two weeks before he was found.   Reasons for McCandless' departure from society are not completely clear. There are many who believe that he was an ignorant kid who thought he could defy nature, but Krakauer writes admirably of McCandless' motives. Krakauer believes that McCandless wasn't ignorant when he walked into the wilderness. McCandless appears to Krakauer as a young man who wished to find his true self, and if that goal lay in the wild, so be it. Krakauer supposes that McCandless' death was out of one fatal error, not woven out of complete stupidity. McCandless may have taken an unnecessary risk in traversing Alaska and living off of the slim game and sparse berries, but in Krakauer's eyes McCandless was a hero to him, as Krakauer writes about similar experiences in his life and in others.   Throughout the story, Krakauer shows his unique style of writing by comparing McCandless with other adventurers who had similar views as McCandless, though they differ from him each in a different way. Some men were bound by insanity and suicide while other men kept their senses out in the wilderness until the very end, however few survived. The biggest comparison that Krakauer made was to himself. Krakauer once attempted to climb an extremely dangerous mountain, called the Devil's Thumb. He nearly escaped with his life after descending, being beaten by storm after storm. After this experience, the author comes to appreciate McCandless' struggle throughout the novel.  To help the reader piece together this story, Krakauer includes several excerpts of McCandless' journal, which bring the story to a more personal level. Towards the end of the book, these journal entries show the reader that McCandless grows more desperate in his attempts to survive and thus gives a first person perspective of the story.   When I read this tome, I honestly didn't expect anything special. I looked at the cover, and thought, \\"Here comes another Survivorman spin-off\\". As I began reading it, I became curious with not only the fate of Chris McCandless, but with the emotion of Krakauer himself, entwined within this tragedy. By the end of the narrative, Krakauer had immersed himself completely in the pages; I firmly believe that any reader who picks this book up will walk into the wild themselves, and feel the pressures of society melt away as the story progresses.  I truly found myself in this book, and I'm sure anyone else who reads this book will, like me, become Chris McCandless: Alone, remote, and fighting for survival.  In a postcard to one of his friends in South Dakota from whom he hitched a ride: \\"Greetings from Fairbanks!   This is the last you shall hear from me Wayne. Arrived here 2 days ago. It was very difficult to catch rides in the Yukon Territory. But I finally got here. Please return all mail I receive to the sender.   It might be a very long time before I return South. If this adventure proves fatal and you don't ever hear from me again, I want you to know your a great man. I now walk into the wild.\\"  -- Chris McCandless
B000P12LWY|5.0|This DVD is almost as like the Showtime-HD originals (it helps to have a DVD player that upconverts to almost 1080i). If you enjoyed the first run, you'll really enjoy these (the sound is really quite qood). Henry (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is certainly not as tall as Henry VIII was, and the original Henry was nearly a \\"head\\" taller than those around him (and added a physical presence that is abset from this series). But Rhys-Meyers does an excelent job at representing the young king.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|I took the trouble to go to the theatre to see it. Kate Blanchett makes a fine Elizabeth. I tried watching the Helen Mirren performance and could only say to myself \\"it looks like one of those awful PBS Shakespeare performances\\"      The scenes with the Spanish Armada were particularly awful. Elizabeth's astral spirit runs out onto what I assume are the cliffs of Dover so she can watch the battle on the waves. The music soars and we get the impression the she is some kind of saint saving Christendom from the evil Catholic Phillip. Well I guess the British are entitled to their fantasies.     She had cut off all her hair to wear wigs but in the climactic speech to I think about 150 troops she has on what has to be the most amazing Elizabethan wig. The poor women begs for a hug from Raleigh because she's such a frustrated old maid, I guess.       A scene is inserted where an asassin forgets to shoot her. He has a gun, a clear shot, and decides that she is such a goddess I guess that he can't kill her. You wouldn't see Hammas being that weak. This never happened. I still recommend watching this one.  I have a suggestion for movie makers. How about Isabella the Catholic next?  A great role for a woman about the Reconquista of Spain after the Islamic cultural genocide.

He ditches his car, leaving it right in the middle of the roadway, and begins an on-foot trek 'home' through the streets of Los Angeles. What follows is a day of extremely temperamental and violent behavior from Foster, lashing out against a Korean shop owner who 'won't make change', Latino gang members who accuse him of invading their territory, a fast food restaurant that's 'stopped serving breakfast', and a neo-Nazi gun shop owner who already has some frightening issues of his own.<br /><br />Michael Douglas is clearly the perfect actor for the role of William Foster. Douglas' terrific knacks for subtlety and dry humor are key ingredients to making his character, despite all of his fits of violence, frighteningly sympathetic. It never appears that Foster derives any amount of pleasure or satisfaction from his violent reactions--it's as if he thinks he is merely 'bringing justice' to the inadequacies of everyday life.<br /><br />We learn that Foster's ultimate destination is to return to his ex-wife's home for his daughter's birthday. We learn from the ex-wife (played by Barbara Hershey) that she has a court order against him from seeing her or the daughter. She admits that he never actually resorted to violence against her on the daughter, but that she \\"thinks he could\\".<br /><br />Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, an about-to-retire cop. Despite the fact that it's originally intended to be Prendergast's last day on the job, he becomes immersed in the trail being left by Foster. The two finally encounter each other in the movie's powerful 'big climax'--by this time, Foster has definitely reached the point of insanity, or as he says in his own words a bit earlier on in the film, \\"past the point of no return\\".<br /><br />Michael Douglas makes it seems as though this kind of devastating emotional collapse could easily happen to just about any 'average Joe', and that's where a great deal of the film's power lies. \\"Falling Down\\" is a thought-provoking movie that really stays with you.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Michael Douglas and any man who has been through a divorce.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008d the point of insanity, or as he says in his own words a bit earlier on in the film, \\"past the point of no return\\".

B000Z0OX9O|4.0|People are not going to be clamoring to get out in to the street, jumping for joy and proclaiming that the god-of-synthesizers is back at his game.  Those days for Vangelis, since the mid-70's, have sadly passed.  Vangelis seems to be past the period of experimentation and is oddly enough rehashing former glories.  Which is strange coming from an artist who has said in numerous (and I mean numerous) interviews that he hates repeating himself.  And this is not to mention the numerous (and I mean numerous) sports themes and Olympic related events he has coordinated after that little running movie he won an Oscar for.  And the beaucoup \\"remastered\\" compilation CD's he has authorized. For someone who doesn't repeat himself, Vangelis sure repeats himself.     But fear not, not all of this is bad.  It's a pleasure to have new Vangelis music and this release, particularly the third \\"new\\" CD, certainly delivers.  In fact, if I didn't know any better, it would appear that Vangelis is using the \\"Bladerunner\\" platform to release some entirely new music that (despite a few recurring melodic motiffs) essentially has nothing to do with \\"Bladerunner\\".  So, the controversy continues (are you reading the other reviews?)!      The second CD is surprisingly ambient and appears to be a lot of backing tracks segued together.  Which, again, is not a bad thing.  It's nice to hear Vangelis spreading his musical palette, without all that bombastic melody getting in the way.  Remember, that this man used to do such strange works as \\"See You Later\\" and \\"Beaubourg\\".      So, sadly no new ground sprung here, but certainly some pleasant music sure to please Vangelis fans.
B000ZK4466|5.0|This album so far is fantastic. I won't say as to whether or not it's better than their previous ones, that's not really important. The only thing I may find a little less exciting to listen to in this album ais the drumming. The new Drummer is amazing, but jon theodore came across as way more expressive and significant to the music. But still a really great and creative album.
B000E1MTZE|4.0|Good collection and amazing pq, but I dislike WB for what they did to HD DVD.    I'll never buy another Warner Brothers DVD/HD DVD.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Easy to clean, no need to peel and giant cloves fit!  Had it for years ,still looks new..  We love it!
B000HWZ5WE|4.0|Robert Plant and Jimmy Page,late of Led Zeppelin,mellow out with some R&B/swing numbers like the Top 10 hit SEA OF LOVE and the Top 20 hit ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT. Joining Plant and Page in this ensemble is Nile Rodgers,who himself had chart success with his R&B band Chic. Rodgers had quite a workload with this album and Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN. It's understandable that Plant and Page declined to carry on with Led Zeppelin after the 1980 death of drummer John Bonham. SOL was made famous originally by Phil Phillips in 1959. The differences between Phillips' recording and the cover are no \\"buh-buh-buh-bum\\" in the cover,a key change in the cover and Plant's accenting of some of the lyrics differently than how Phillips did it. I guess that's because Plant is English(as is Page) and Phillips is American(as is Rodgers). ROCKIN' AT MIDNIGHT really swings. It got the lively 1940's sound that the fighting men of World War II were dancing to at clubs. After this album,Plant,whose solo career began in or around 1982,continued going solo. Page formed his third band THE FIRM and released an album in 1985. Recently,the surviving Led Zeppelin members re-formed with a new drummer and are currently on tour.
B000VR824S|2.0|I purchased this DVD expecting it to be at least as good as the first Cross Roads concert that Clapton put out.  NOT!!  This concert is nowhere as good as the first.  Many less top artists on this DVD.
1582701709|1.0|This is a disgustingly shallow philosophy. It really should be listed among the marketing books in the \\"how to sell frosted flakes to kids\\" section. Get it from the library. Reminds me of an old joke:<br />Can't you say anything nice about it?<br />The DVD was worse.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|What I appreciate most about this cd is that the songs collected are the originals. The album artwork is fantastic, too.
0316067598|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read.  After reading \\"Inside Delta Force\\" by Eric L . Haney, my mother of all people put me on to this book after hearing about it on the television.  I'm so glad she told me because I have never understood the words \\"bravery\\" or \\"selfless\\" until reading this book.  God bless the men that lost their lives in Operation Redwing and their families, and for all the men that have given their life for us.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Nice little package, has everything that a Blade Runner fan wants.  However, I saw the blu-ray version at a Bestbuy, wow, get that if you can.  Nice touch for them to go back and fixed some of the flaws from the original.
0060849827|4.0|This is a GREAT survival book!  I saw this at Barnes & Noble and loved it for the color pictures of plants/roots/flowers/etc. that are edible/poisonous/healing/etc. and for the helpful parts on different climates, conditions, and finding your bearings (directioning ability, not the little metal balls).  I still might get the regular-sized version, but this is TRULY a (cargo) pocket-sized book.  The print isn't too small at all.  The pictures still show fine and helpful details.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON SOME OTHER BLACK AND WHITE, CHEAP PAPER BOOK!  GET THIS ONE!!!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I love this show.All the characters are so wonderful and the stories are very well scripted.From the creaters of DR Who comes this brillent series.Oh by the way the creators of doctor who took the letters from that title and mixed it up a little an well we have the name torchwood
140130916X|5.0|I had seen the movie. Absolutely loved it, made me cry and laugh, but I wanted the experience of reading the book too.<br />I got the book at a store, and as I read it instantly started to cry, don't know why. Its just the emotion of it all. Holly had just lost the love of her life, when they had so much they wanted to do. Now she has these special letters telling her in ways that only with the courage and help from family and friends that she can accomplish, letters from Gerry. So even though I'm half way through it. I just feel this great connection to this book, though I no not the feelings or what it would be like to loose such a big part of my life. I just can't seem to put the book down. Its both heart warming and sad.<br />I would say that its possibly the best book I've ever read.
B000I2JKD8|3.0|I really think they could have done much better computer graphics with Scooby.  The rest of the main cast do a pretty good job. Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli are so believable it is a bit scarry.  Sarah Michelle Geller and Freddie Prince Jr. do a fair job but this is not some of their better work.  I know I know it is a recreation of a cartoon but I expected a lot better.  I think there is a story here that would be a good movie but I think they either did not have the budget they needed to do it right or the director needs to go back to school.  The movie does have a few laughs and would do a good job of scaring a 6 or younger  but I am not sure parts are appropriate for children of that age.  When it breaks down to a fart and burping contest between Shaggie and Scooby I think the movie hits a real low point.  It also makes me wonder how desperate they were for footage to leave it in the final cut.  I gave it three stars because I did find some entrainment in it and my 9 year old has liked it for a couple of years.  I would have only given it two stars if I were reviewing it for the older crowd above the age of 20 at least.  I am not sure if HD DVD helps or hinders it.  I am still trying to figure out what we ever saw in VHS after seeing DVD's and now that I have seen HD even up converted movies don't stack up at times.  So if your just trying to find movies to get a collection going or if you have a kid this is not a bad investment but if you want to save a few bucks I would suggest getting this and the Scooby Doo two movie together for the price you would be a bit ahead and save your money for action, science fiction, or music that would look and sound incredible on HD DVD.
B000GRTQSE|4.0|I want to thank the customer who suggested this album to me.  I bought this as soon as it came out.  It is not my favorite album, but I loved it and it is still a MUST BUY!!!!!.  Bob's voice is sadly going by this time, but I played some of his songs over and over and over before I got tired of them for a while--some are really really good.  The music has a different sound than his earlier albums, but the sound is GREAT.  Different but great.  The DVD has Love Sick done live, and I was so impressed that I bought Time out of Mind that I just love so much and more.<br /><br />I will certainly jump all over Bob's next album when it comes out.  They are worth trying out for some real gems and I certainly got some REAL SURPRISES that I was unprepared to hear like Isis in the album Desire which I consider top grade music and Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat in the Bootleg series 7 along with Masters of War in the same bootleg series and Blind Willie McTell and Foot of Pride in the Bootleg series 1-3 and of course his classic It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), which are among Nadia's choices of Bob's MASTERPIECES--among many more like Lay Lady Lay which is short but has a really creamy rich sound along with Bob's rich creamy voice that you won't hear it anywhere else like in this song except in this song.  I still think Time out of Mind is a better album, but be assured I will JUMP to purchase his next album as soon as it comes out, voice going or not.  I have several more ALBUMS to purchase, but I think I got his best albums so far.  I did miss his old voice in this album, however.<br /><br />SURPRISE!!!! I am adding this note February 12, 2008!!: See my review of Oh Mercy!!!  AAAHHH that was a surprise!!!!  I was wrong in assuming I got his best albums so far!!!  (I'll just keep that comment as a reminder that I was wrong again!)
0525950079|3.0|This is the sequel to Pillars of the Earth, but it is no where close to Follett's master work.    This book lacks a central event and it is populated with, petty, nasty people that are hard to like. It is unfortunate that when the plague arrives it does not take more of them away.    The writing is good. This is what got me through to page 1014. I guess if you like a treatment on 14th century life in ENgland, then this is the book for you.
0307387151|5.0|Atonement, by Ian McEwan, is my favorite book.  The character development is exceptional and the the storyline is intriguing.  I fell in love with Robbie and all of the characters in this story.  The book captivated me from Chapter One.  The ending is surprising, but emotional and powerful.  I love this book and I HIGHLY recommend reading it.  You will not be disappointed.  Read the book before you see the movie (which is equally impressive).
B000TKW3E2|4.0|This is a really nice score.  I enjoyed it even more than Marianelli's previous score for Joe Wright--Pride and Prejudice.  This score has several great themes.  One for the character Briony which is driving and includes a typewriter as a percussive instrument, which is an interesting addition that I rather like.  There's a beautiful love theme heard twice on the album.  A couple other cues have a theme used only once in the film.  The track \\"the half killed\\" has a menacing feel to it, and \\"Elegy for Dunkirk\\" is the standout cue of the album.  Both are spectacular tracks.  Several times the use of something from the film is incorporated into the score.  The typewriter is the obvious example, but in one scene from the film a harmonica plays a theme from the score and that solo harmonica makes it onto the end of one of the tracks, as does a church organ later on.  In \\"elegy for dunkirk\\" a choir of soldiers sings a hymn which is incorporated into Marianelli's score masterfully.  It's a very well thought out score and I would be happy to see it win an oscar.
B000P1KTW8|5.0|My wife and I have seen BS & E St Band about 40 times since 1975.  We've seen the BS & the Sessions Band once.  We watched this with friends who haven't been to a live show.  They loved it.  We loved it.  We have a DLP projector setup and the 9 foot screen looks good in Blu-Ray on a PS3.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The first time I watched this movie was the first time I was introduced to the Phantom of the Opera. I never really knew what this was about until I watched it, and I just fell in love with this movie. I will watch it on stage soon, so that's pretty exciting.
0441172717|3.0|I really can see why this is such a popular science fiction book. There is a great story.... there is a ton of detail.... and a lot of interesting characters. The last 150 pages or so of this book is really good. The ending is a little predictable but still very good. My problem with this book is the writing.     Frank Herbet's writing is very difficult to get through. He has multiple names for each character, he uses a lot of made up words that make you go.... huh..... what does that mean? You have to sit back and wonder what the word means by the context/situation it's being used in. That gets annoying real quick for the casual reader. The way he writes down every unspoken thought of every character bogs down some of the dialogue. This isn't a book you can just casually read; if you don't pay REAL close attention to every detail it's easy to get lost with what's going on.     I also thought the main character, Paul, was also a little robotic and too perfect (his mom, Lady Jessica is as well); he never makes a mistake in the entire book. That gets old after awhile.     The book overall is mostly clean... some violence and death but nothing too graphic and not much, if any, language either.       There is a good story here. It just would have been better if it was written by somebody else.
B000OV170W|5.0|I'm not sure if there is anything new that I can say about this book that has not already been written.  However, I will say that a friend lent me this book and I could not put it down.  Although the quality of the writing was not what I expected (not lyrical or nuanced in its realism), the story and the author's use of multiple narrators absolutely draws you in.  Complex in its moral questioning, this book forces you to look at the question of a girl's existence and her personal rights in a multitude of lights.  As you get to know each member of the family, along with other supporting characters, the authors succeeds in drawing out emotions in her reader of anger, sympathy, sadness and, most importantly, thought.  It is almost impossible to leave this book unaffected, especially given the novel's ending.
0380799006|2.0|The authors feel you're too stupid to learn from actually reading something.  No, they feel you'll learn best by reading a friggin' comic strip of parents and kids talking.  I finished the book because I paid money for it, but the whole time I felt as if the authors have high opinions of themselves, and not so much of an opinion for all others.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Say what you will about Michael Moore, but the man gets his point across.  And he must be doing something right if his films evoke so much debate and popularity.  Moore is sometimes dramatic, sometimes outrageous, sometimes even mean.  But Moore always hits where it hurts.<br /><br />Sicko describes the U.S. health coverage and compares it to that of some of the Western European countries.  Now, while I may not be able to make an educated decision about Moore's previous films, this one rang very true.  I lived in England for two years, and, though a foreigner in that country, I was entitled to their free, socialized health care (as presented by Moore).  Was it good?  It was more than good, it was excellent!  While in England, I developed bronchitis and a gastric ulcer (at the same time), and did not have to pay a cent (or a penny) for my health care, which was absolutely outstanding and very dedicated.  I paid only a symbolic co-payment for the medications, a payment equivalent to a price of a bottle of water.<br /><br />Immediately after England, I joined the U.S. Army, and (as Moore presents it) I received universal health care.  I never felt afraid, and rarely got sick, as all universal health care providers promote preventative care.  Since there are no insurance payments, co-payments and such, people freely do check ups, resulting in fewer illnesses and ultimately lower costs of health care.  What a concept.  It was not until after I left the military that I had to deal with the nightmare of health insurances (though I'm still very healthy from the preventative care in the Army).<br /><br />As a former soldier, it truly angered me to see a scene in Sicko in which an elderly, obviously confused woman, is dumped out in the middle of the street, in front of a shelter, because she wasn't able to pay for her health care.  This was not America I fought for - America I fought for is generous and takes care of her own!  After all, we provide full health care to all the terrorists and insurgents in our custody.  I would know this - I spent my entire military career working in the military detention facilities filled with terrorists.  I am glad Moore brought that particular issue to the forefront in his stunt with Guantanamo Bay.<br /><br />Again, love him or hate him, Moore has a point in Sicko.  As such, I highly recommend this film to all concerned citizens, and especially my fellow military folk.  We fought and fight for equality - let's truly see this equality, especially in health, and especially with our elderly and defenseless - we owe them that much.terrorists and insurgents in our custody.

B0000640VO|4.0|Amelie is one of those rare films that manages to be funny without being juvenile, sentimental without being sappy, and moving without being pretentious. To call it a 'feel-good' movie would be simplifying to a ridiculous degree, although that is essentially what Amelie is. Extremely whimisical (both in the storyline and the slightly garrish way it is shot), the film manages to capture your interest and hold it throughout (although the film is about 15 minutes too long- the only reason I don't rate it a full 5 stars).  I won't reveal any plot points (as discovering what the movie is truly about is one of the great pleasures of watching it), but suffice it to say you will be VERY pleasantly surprised if you you are looking for a lighthearted film with a much deeper message attached.  Audrey Tautou is unbelievable cute in this film, and does a fantastic job as the main character Amelie. The supporting cast are all excellent in their roles, and really add to the quirky nature of the story. Amelie is a French film, and is best viewed in French with English subtitles (to capture the nuances of the actor's performances).  Amelie a fantastic movie that does NOT follow any tired Hollywood fomulas. It is vastly original, and will leave you with a smile and a happy feeling. No kidding!   If you are looking to sample some good foreign cinema (since Hollywood churns out almost exclusively CRAP these days), Amelie would be an excellent starting point.  Amelie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
1594481717|4.0|In his book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, Daniel Pink boldly asserts that the world is moving out of the Information Age that has dominated for the past few decades and into the Conceptual Age. He compellingly argues that in this new era, workers need to shift their focus from the logical and analytical ways of left-brained thinking and embrace a more creative and simultaneous mindset, right-brained thinking. In doing so, Pink says, workers will give themselves an advantage in the economy of the future.     Pink begins by giving a brief overview of the differences between left and right-brained thinking. He explains that while analytical, left-brained thinking is necessary, it is also easily replicable. Thus, holistic right-brained thinking becomes increasingly valuable.     The reasons for the dominance of nonlinear thinking are explained in the book's second chapter, Abundance, Asia, and Automation. Pink argues that if a computer can do your job faster or someone overseas can perform it cheaper, you need to develop skills that are not so easy to replace. These include senses that are concerned with beauty, perception and sensitivity. Pink names six key qualities- design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning- that will be essential to succeeding in the Conceptual Age.    He spends the second part of the book comprehensively detailing the importance of each quality. After defining and discussing the significance of each aptitude, Pink includes a portfolio section that recommends ways to sharpen the respective sense. These sections are comprised of a multitude of websites to visit, courses to take, and simple exercises to perform to develop the creative skills Pink holds in such high esteem.      The book is a relatively easy read. Although the content within the chapters gets to be somewhat repetitive, it also helps to reiterate a point using multiple examples and types of phrasing. Pink writes in a playful and conversational manner, which makes the book substantially more relatable and engaging. His ideas are sensible, albeit a bit idealistic. Overall, however, the ideas Pink conveys in his book are insightful and well thought out.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie provides a glimpse of the terrible moral compromises and outcomes of a secret police state.  I did not feel it was biased, just accurate.
B000K15VSA|5.0|If you love Blade Runner, and have always wanted to get your hands on some real behind the scenes stuff, as well as every version of the film you could ever hope for, this is the only choice.  The deleted scenes are great, the extra discs are very interesting and informative.  The ultimate box set for the ultimate film.
0143038419|1.0|This book was *terrible*.  The author has got to be the most self-absorbed narcissist I have ever read.  In a world where so many people are struggling with illness, hunger, disabilities, war, it is painful to read this narrative of self-indulgent self-pity.  I cannot believe people actually like this book!  It was torture to read.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Great show, I hate to see it go.  The third season adds another dimension.  Very good, though sometimes a little over the top.  If you liked the first two seasons, you will like this one.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Special screening Jan. 28 in Hollywood with son of producer Bronston and daughters of Anthony Mann and Miklos Rossa speaking. This is a beautiful print of the movie, but Bronston admits that, though very wide screen, is not nearly as widescreen as the original Technorama 70 mm print which he believes was permanently lost due to bankruptcy of his father or production company.  This is a better rendition than that used in the early 1990s restored version.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This is very close to being Bill Murray's best film. You have to look to \\"Scrooged\\" for that. But lets face it, Bill was handicapped a bit here. First, he had to play opposite Andie McDowell. Unfortunately, Ms McDowell is just this side of a lump of clay as acting ability goes.<br /><br />Second, the final act of the film. Murray has to be a nice guy. Not his forte by any means. And the rest of the cast has to pick up the \\"funny\\" for the remainder of the movie. Fortunately, by that time you've had such fun that you barely notice that flaw.<br /><br />All in all, a very good movie that could've been great.
B0001I55OC|3.0|A few months before it's release, I had the opportunity to attend a screening of this film while in L.A. The trouble with advanced screenings, you're never sure if you're seeing a final cut, a rough cut, or something which will be retooled based on audience response. Overall, my impression was that it was closer to a final cut than anything else.<br /><br />The plot finds several 21st century archeologists in 15th century France, on a mission to rescue their mentor. The Professor was sent back and left for dead by the Bill Gates-like mogul who stumbled upon the time travel technology.<br /><br />Director Richard Donner seems set on a low-tech approach to the special effects. A refreshing change in these days of everything being CGI. While a bit predictable at points, the story flows fairly well and makes for a fun time at the movies.<br /><br />I can't say that I whole-heartedly recommend \\"Timeline\\". But if you've got nothing better to do and you're in the mood for a pure popcorn adventure...
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Great film about a possible future for mankind where women can no longer bear children- and the population is dying off. A very frightening scenario and with solid performances, particularly by Clive Owen. The opening scene sets the mood for the movie- all in one shot- and is brilliantly directed by Alfonso Cuaron. A thoughtful, intense, raw movie that builds to a powerful but hopeful ending.

B000XA5K48|1.0|Wow, being totally honest, and coming from me a real rental freak, this movie is the worst of the worst. I never felt so ripped off, this movie makes no sense whatsoever, how can a film like this be produced???
B0002234LS|1.0|... and you've seen this movie's basic premise produced much better elsewhere.  \\"Psycho\\" anyone?  I agree with a previous viewer that Johnny seems to have phoned this performance in ... I think this must've been strictly a paycheck for him.  Mr. Depp does have some fine films in his body of work, this just isn't one of them.  The funniest thing about this movie ... it was based on a story by Stephen King ... is the tagline throughout, which revolves around the importance of a story having a good ending.  Mr. King hasn't produced a good ending to any story he's had a hand in since \\"The Stand.\\"  That's why this film will leave you feeling like you've seen it before, and better.
B000009HF2|5.0|Although i cannot do a review that is even half as good as the absolutely brilliant review by John P. Morgan.  I will do my best to review the album in a way that is deservable to its glory.  This album is amazing, no it is an experience in itself.  I remember hearing that this was the most sold live album of all time and i figured peter frampton pfttt... why is it so popular, Frampton's not even that good, although i had heard next to nothing by him (I was very ignorant at that juncture of my life).  Intrigued however to see what was so good about it I bought the album (also i bought it because i have the sick obsession to collect all the essential albums of classic rock, jazz, blues, and prog rock).  So i bought it opened it popped it in my cd player expecting to hear a mediocre album with a third-rate singer/guitar player.  Boy what a surprise i got.  The first track of the cd started off perfectly for me \\"If there was ever a musician that is an honorary member of San Francisco Society...Mr. Peter Frampton.\\"  Then Something's Happening came in and i was swept away by the music.  This album is amazing, I listened to it over, and over, and over again.  Frampton is a fantastic guitar player and all his musicians are first rate.  The music production is pretty much perfect and everything rings with crisp professionalism.  In short all the songs on this album are incredible from the slower numbers such as Wind of Change and All I Want To Be (Is By Your Side) to rockers like It's a Plain Shame and Doobie Wah, to the hits he is most known for like Show Me The Way, Baby, I Love Your Way, and Do You Feel Like We Do (Awesome talkbox by the way Frampton pretty invented and popularized the use of it on this album).  Even the cover of Jumpin' Jack Flash is fricken mindblowing.  This album taught me to never judge things prematurely again, it is fantastic and is a worthy addition to any collection.  It is in my opinion one of rock's greatest live albums.  In short get it now and be taken away by the music.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|The story is based on a rat (Remy) that doesn't fit into his society, because he likes good food and is willing to risk his neck for it, where most of his friends will eat whatever junk they can find. Wow-is that an analogy to today's modern junk food?<br /><br />He eventually befriends someone (Linguini) who works in his favorite famous Paris restaurant. Linguini, the human, can't cook, but Remy the rat is a great chef. The two learn to work together without anyone seeing the rat who is hiding in the chef hat. Linguini becomes very successful, and it goes to his head, where he forgets that Remy is his \\"little chef\\" that is really the brilliance behind the team.<br /><br />Linguini eventually learns humility, and their friendship survives. In the meantime there is a romance, a crazy little man trying to prevent Linguini from receiving his inheritance, a huge family rat squabble, and a cut throat food critic who gets in touch with his childhood through Remy's ratatouille.<br /><br />It's crazy and unbelievable, but it's Disney, and a cartoon, so just enjoy it without psychoanalyzing it. The moral of the movie for me was that anyone can do anything, don't judge someone just because they have different values or look different than you, and we can all get in touch with what is important to us if we let ourselves.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Like pretty much everyone, while this brilliant show was wasted on Thursday nights, I was watching \\"Friends.\\" A few months later, I came across an episode on MTV. It turned out to be part of a marathon they were running. Long story short... I didn't leave the TV for several hours. By the early morning of the next day, I'd seen about half of the episodes, still wanted more but just couldn't stay awake.<br /><br />This series was supposed to target teens. I can tell you that I, in my 40s, was amazed by the depth that Claire Danes brought to her role. In fact the entire cast was magnificent. I'm pleasantly surprised that the series has made it's way to DVD. From what I hear, the story of how that came to be is nearly as dramatic as this show.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This incredible 2-DVD set shows why Led Zeppelin had no equal. Zeppelin were the greatest, most consistent songwriters, as well as best, most fierce live improvisational players in music history. Neither The Beatles, nor The Stones, nor The Who could even get into the same league as these guys in their wildest dreams and they know it. I mean, we're talking about Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, John Bonham, and Robert Plant, the tightest ensemble musicians in rock history. Not even Rush is as dynamic or as good, which is saying alot, as Rush are the reigning best working band after Zeppelin. Zeppelin is the most revered, prestigious, respected, and imitated band in music history, and for good reason. The improvs on this set will boggle your mind. Then there's the beautiful acoustic, folksy work here, the songwriting is beyond spectacular. Plus, Jimmy Page's \\"cool\\" factor is off the charts, he is the hardest rocking guitarist on the planet, a sonic wizard, decked out in his uber-cool black dragon suit. Watch John Bonham's ferocious speed, power, taste, and dexterity gel with John Paul Jones mindbogglingly fast and deep bass lines like they are glued together by psychic ESP. This set is the best bang for your musical buck, it is so jam packed with quality, even the submenus have submenus, with more buried rare treasures for you to discover, it is executed brilliantly. Jimmy Page kicked butt on the production of this DVD, as well as being the king of guitar tone. The DTS 5.1 sound is also among the best I've ever heard. If you like music, buy this now. There's so much here, it will take weeks to see and absorb it all. I also recommend the new remastered and expanded \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", which has quintessential live song versions not included here, some even tighter and more amazing than this set, ridiculously powerful improvisations that will spin your head. And get ready for Page's violin bow sections on both sets, where the sound whips around the room in 5.1 surround. Other bands just can't do it like Led Zeppelin. Buy it now.
B000VE439Y|5.0|I suspect most fans of this film and Monty Python in general already own a copy on DVD. The bonus features in this new double-disc edition definitely make it worth the repeat buy. Most of the features from the Criterion edition (two commentary tracks, five deleted scenes, radio ads) are here. (The nice 1979 BBC documentary \\"The Pythons\\" is the only feature from the Criterion version missing from this new set.)    The new hour-long documentary included with this edition is worth the purchase alone. All five surviving Pythons are interviewed and offer a lot of insight into the film, from its conception, to the controversy surrounding its opening (in the US and in the UK), to its lasting standing as the Pythons' greatest work. (Yes, I know, many fans like \\"Grail\\" even more.) I'm always pleased to see up-to-date interviews with the team, now all in their sixties.    The other significant feature is an audio reading of the original script, recorded with all six members several months before filming began. This is much more enjoyable and watchable than you might expect, illustrated onscreen with storyboard drawings and script pages. The reading is 20 minutes longer than the film, and you hear some bits that never made it past this stage.    And the film itself, of course, is a treasure. A hysterically funny, yet thought-provoking satire whose target is group-think in general, and not merely religion or superstition.
B000002J09|5.0|This album is the most quintessential single album ever released, the best of the best. There are only two albums possibly better, Zeppelin's \\"Houses Of The Holy\\", and their double album masterpiece \\"Physical Graffiti\\". These guys were unstoppable, the masters of songwriting, musicianship, production, showmanship, and execution. The masters of excitement and spontaneity. The masters of changing styles and guitar tones effortlessly from song to song without repeating themselves, one song better than the next. No filler. EVER. And live, nobody improvised like these guys. NOBODY. They make every other band look like garage wannabe's, they were the coolest group in the universe, while just being themselves. See, every song is a masterpiece, plus it has that magical haunting atmosphere that only Page, Plant, Jones, and Bonham were capable of. Jimmy Page is a wizard of sonic sculpture, the Pagannini of the 20th century. Doubt me? Throw this baby on your CD player and open your ears. You're gonna be blown out of the water. This ain't your average rock band boys and girls. They just got better and better. Buy this now, and you'll be buying the rest of their catalog 2 days later. WARNING...once you get hooked on Zeppelin it's all over, you're never gonna look at other bands the same way again.
B000002KIK|5.0|I'm a music scholar and musician by trade, so I think I'm very tasteful when it comes to good rock music. This is a great album. Don't compare it to Paranoid or the first album. Just listen to it for what it is. It's far different and daring then anything before. Air Dance is excellent, very Jazzy and experimental. You wouldn't even think it's Sabbath until you hear Ozzys voice. The rythym section is killer and if you don't think this song is good, then you can't really appreciate anything that has to do with change or taking risks. Johnny Blade, Shock Wave and Air Dance are the best three songs in my opinion. I find it interesting that Ward sings on the last tune which could have be a sign of things to come. Just open your mind and actually listen to this album without comparing it to Iron Man or Sweet Leaf. This is Sabbath far left and far right, and a little bit in between which is a fresh change without going overboard and giving up the rank of Heavy Metal kings. The title track is one of my least favorites because it sounds like a Top of the Pops tune. It's way to commercial for Sabbath's taste. Although it's catchy, it also to repetitive. This album is as good as Sabatoge in some ways and better than Technical Ecstasy which is Sabbath's downer.
0691131511|5.0|I'll lay my cards on the table and confess to having studied Byzantine History and have continued a lifelong fascination and love of the subject. Trying to explain what drives that interest as Prof. Herrin found herself trying to do to two working men however, has always been difficult to get across to others to whom it is a blank area of knowledge.  I've nothing but praise for the way she has distilled her professional knowledge into one of the more approachable books on the subject that I have read. Not decrying other books which on the whole are written for readers with at least a basic knowledge of the subject, this by and large succeeds in casting light on what is perceived to be an esoteric subject.  The maps, illustrations and tables are an excellent aid for this primer which seeks to explain on their terms what made the Empire tick without spoon feeding you. It makes you, the reader, think.  Arranged thematically, Icons, Monasticism, Economics, Warfare, Eunuchs, the Imperial Court, relations with the West, the Slavs and the Moslems, the place of women in society, its structure covers the Empires chronology. What to the modern mind are barbarous practices such as castration and mutilation are placed in context . It looks at those puzzling practices of icon worship and explains the intent. Reaction to pressures such as the rise of Islam and relations with the West and its missionary work to the Slavs are explained together as a whole rather than in isolation in a very readable manner.  I would heartily recommend it to the general reader who wishes to know more and part of me likes to think that somewhere that those two working men are sitting somewhere over a pint imagining light glinting off  golden mosaics.
0375507256|5.0|The best way to \\"read\\" this book is to listen to the audio version. The production is first rate. Each of the narratives that make up the book has a separate narrator, perfectly cast. Good voice actors can add immeasurably to the enjoyment of a work like this one, where most of the story is told in first-person type narratives: diary, letters to a friend, memoir, archival testimony, and campfire yarn. It's the difference between reading a Dylan Thomas story and listening to Dylan Thomas read it to you -- the text is the same but the enjoyment is multiplied.
B000063DFS|4.0|He was there in the 70's with all time classic rock with Black Sabbath.  He continues to rock in the 80's and there he goes in the 90's, a great pure rock album. Ozzy even got some major hits like Mama I'm coming home and No more tears. Zaak Wylde is just amazing.  A very good addition to your cd collection.  Good work Ozzy !
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|This disc was the best part of the terrible 2004 DVD release of the Star Wars Trilogy, which did not have the theatrical cuts of the movies.  Empire of Dreams is, for anyone interested in either movie history in general or Star Wars in particular, will lose themselves in this feature-length journey through the creation of a cultural phemon.  Other specials on the disc are not as spectacular, but they don't have to be.  In contrast to the vast omnibus of Empire of Dreams, the short docs on Lightsabers and such were a welcome shift.    I would recommend buying this separately, then the 2-disc version of the original trilogy (yes, I know the transfer is not anamorphic, but you can get it to fit on a widescreen tv by fiddling with the settings: it's not perfect, but it's the best we've had)  Anyway, watch this if you can, it's easily worth it.
B000002GK1|3.0|Chris Cornell has a great voice, no doubt about that.<br />I like \\"Outshine\\" a lot and few other tracks, I would say that I like half of the album, the rest didn't catch me, or maybe I didn't catch it !<br />Who knows ? If you like Grunge rock, you should like this one a lot.
0307275639|3.0|Overrated is the first word that comes to mind when I think about this book. Not that it's bad. On the contrary. It's a pleasant read, and it does show you some very touching moments of intimacy. If you had a poor relationship with your dad, you'll probably squirt a few tears when you get to the end.     But it's also about as preachy as they come. Morrie seems like a great guy, and what he's preaching -- that we are letting life slip by if we focus on anything but friends and family -- is something that you'd expect a dying guy to feel as he tries to connect. But then Albom, who seems like the biggest workaholic to walk the face of the planet, polarizes the preaching to excess: Working hard and making money is BAD. Touching and loving and kissing and talking is GOOD. But Morrie was also a very successful dying guy. He accomplished a lot in his life. What this book should be preaching (if anything) is balance. But it doesn't, which is no fault of Morrie.    Looked at another way, I'm sure there are dying guys out there who had a non stop party with friends and family, but then find on their death bed that they didn't do anything beyond talk and dance their life away. They'd probably have a different story to tell about what they did right and wrong. Who knows. But the preachy nature of this book takes away from the real point, which is a testament to a man's courage in the face of a horrible disease and the importance of family and friends in dealing with it.     For all the reviewers gushing over the book (inside cover) talking as if they've discovered some new religion, you need to get out more. And for the woman who's made it required reading for every student she's had since reading it, why not just make it a suggestion and let them form their own opinions about what constitutes a good read. They'll thank you for it.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|This new Directors Cut version is far better than the Theatrical version. The \\"incomprehensible\\" charge is no longer valid. The movie has a good flow with some additional scenes that explain the story better. The opening speedboat scenes are a brilliant start (why were they originally dropped?). Even the music has been shifted around in a series of very positive changes.<br /><br />I now rank this film up with \\"Heat\\" and \\"Collatoral\\" as a great Michael Mann film.<br /><br />I notice that many reviews seem to show little respect for the research that goes behind the film making process. Derisive jokes about the use of terms such as \\"go fast boats\\" in the script, for example...... when this is a localised term that is actually used by real life law enforcement people in Miami. A lack of familiarity or understanding with the subject matter should not be taken as a license to trash a film.<br /><br />Michael Mann is not in the business of pumping out big dumb action flicks, and his films deserve to be approached with a little more respect.<br />This Directors Cut version is a smart intelligent film, and the action scenes( when they do happen) are just excellent and very real looking.<br /><br />Just completely forget the old '80's TV show and rather, think of \\"Heat\\". In my estimation,... highly recommended.
0385338082|5.0|Let me just start out by saying that I am  using my boyfriend's account to write this review, hehe. So yeah, after seeing this book on the shelves for years I finally just got around to reading it. It is SO cute! Lots of other reviews about this book here. I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents. :)
B000001FDI|4.0|This effort by Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Rick Grech and Ginger Baker was quite good and much of it still stands up over thirty five years later.<br /><br />Coming off the \\"Clapton Is God\\" era of his career, Clapton was changing direction and really not quite sure which way to go; thus this effort, the Layla album and After Midnight album before he had to quit to get sober and straight.<br /><br />Still, aspects of this are dated. But even these dated portions are great, if you make allowances for the times and attitudes of the day.<br /><br />And worthy of owning, too.
B0001OGW2K|5.0|I am not sure that the cartoon was called Chucklewood Critters.  All I remember is Rusty and Buttons.  The cartoons are the same as they were when I grew up.  This dvd is jammed packed with cute stories for children. These cartoons allow children to be children.  Very nice product.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to say, I love this universe.<br /><br />If you like Westerns with a twist (not just that it takes place in outer space and on different planets), you'll like this.<br /><br />The sequel film is equally brilliant, too.
B000E5KJES|3.0|Everyone pretty much agrees that Goodfellas is a classic. No question there. I could only give the HD-DVD three stars though. The video is almost identical to the standard definition version, and the sound quality is nothing to write home about either. The colors were muted and lacked any clarity or \\"pop\\" that I look for in HD releases. Even though this is a great piece of film making, I would have been better off buying the standard def version.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After watching the complete Firefly series, I put in this film and sat back to watch.<br /><br />I have to say that I really enjoy this universe. It is very well considered and fleshed out with all manner and form of humanity having diverged into pockets of life that are quite apart from one another, as I imagine it would be in a future of colonised Milky Way galaxy.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything here, suffice it to say we learn some really important stuff here and it ends with the potential (!!) of more to come.<br /><br />I hope we get there from here. I really do.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Changes from the third edition: new artwork on all the pieces, and the outer ring of the board fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, so that bumping the board doesn't knock everything apart.  No big difference, same rules, still the really, really fun and engaging boardgame I remembered.<br /><br />I'm amazed this isn't more popular in America, on a scale with Monopoly, Risk and all the rest.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Absolutely loved it and look forward to seeing it all again.  It is complete with little fan trivia missing, but it's the story from the Beatles themselves.      It's a must have in one's collection and to pass down to the next generations.
B000PFUAO6|2.0|Octivarium was one of the best comebacks ever because it was one of the albums that truly sounded like DT. When I saw this in Wal-Mart (don't ask), I was so excited that I bought the album and when I got home I immediately played it. But I really do NOT like this album. In fact, I'm not sure whether or not it's good. Maybe it is a good album, I dunno. But certainly not for Dream Theater. The songs are way too long, with the shortest being 4 minutes, and the average being 7-8 minutes.  Not to mention really silly lyrics that sound like a pop band wrote them. Come on. The lyrics are terrible. Who cares about some monster or dark scary master? These make St. Anger lyrics sound like Shakespeare (They even mention \\"Eager to explore his most shocking mysteries\\"). Not to mention stale playing, and hardly a good solo except for on Constant Motion. Everything sounds forced here, and all the songs sound exactly the same (except for Constant Motion). Oh, and James' vocals are HORRIBLE on here. On the previous albums, he didn't even sing, he just yelled the lyrics... and they sounded awesome. Meanwhile this sounded like he clamped his bottom lip and decided to sing. Not to mention almost all the songs have \\"Ooooh, Ooh, Oooooooooooooh\\" parts in them. Oh and not to mention they rip off Metallica, Iron Maiden, and most of the album is just John Pettruci/Jordan Rudess battling each other. Oh yeah, and the production. Who told Mike Portnoy he'd make a good producer? The only memorable songs on here are \\"Constant Motion\\", \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\", and \\"Prophets Of War\\". The rest just sounds filler and forced.<br /><br />So let's quit now, and leave ourselves happy while we're at it, eh?
B000RL4GS4|5.0|This is by far one of the best if not the best album I've heard in a while. There is so much energy it will simply blow you away. There are no filler song, no slow songs to hold your lighter to...it's just pure rock. Period. I've been disappointed by some of the bands by their latest releases, you know one or two songs that rock and the rest, well filler stuff and b-side material. Once you pick up this album...well, get ready for a helluva ride, just don't sit in heavy traffic while listening to Runnin Wild. It's like drinking a quad espresso before going to bed...:-). If their concerts have half as much energy as this album....Long Live Rock!!
B000002HK4|5.0|If you're going to get into Dream theater, stay well away from their newest album and dissapointment \\"Systematic Chaos\\". Buy this album, it rocks. It IS short, but it comes nothing short (pun intended) of being fantastic. We get the Theater's greatest song of all time \\"A Change of Seasons\\". Follow that up with some classic rock covers and you have one of the best albums ever!!!!!! I even like the cover of \\"In The Flesh?\\" by Pink Floyd!
0141439688|5.0|One can get lost in this story and spend some time in places of beauty, both in the heart and in the world.  You will join the characters and feel the passion!
B0000C83KH|5.0|I can see people hating this album, but I really like it and it's really modern sounding. Finally a good album after all those years! I really wanted to like No Prayer For The Dying and Fear Of The Dark, but they were just depressing and slowed down and cluttered with needless songs like \\"Public Enema Number One\\" and AC-DC wannabe songs like \\"Hooks In You\\" and \\"Judas Be My Guide\\". The X Factor and Virtual XI were caca at best, and Brave New World was just... OK. Then this comes along, and I love it. It's in my top 5!<br /><br />WILDEST DREAMS: 5/5: A good opener. Catchy and singalong-able.<br /><br />RAINMAKER: 2/5: Why do people like this track so much???<br /><br />NO MORE LIES: 5/5: This is a very cool track, and sounds different tha anything else they made.<br /><br />MONTSEGUR: 5/5: Sounds like classic Maiden! I love when he yells \\"AT THE GATES!!!!! AND THE WALLS!!!!! OF MONTSEGUR!!!!! BLOOD ON THE STONES OF THE CITADEL!!!!!\\"<br /><br />DANCE OF DEATH: 4/5: What a great track.<br /><br />GATES OF TOMORROW: 3/5: Meh, OK. The intro really makes me cringe though.<br /><br />NEW FRONTIER: 10/5: The best song on the album! Catchy, great rhythm, plus Nicko wrote it!<br /><br />PASCHENDALE: 4/5: A good song.<br /><br />FACE IN THE SAND: 1/5: [...]I like the intro, which sounds like the intro to Blood Brothers, but the rest is just awful.<br /><br />AGE OF INNOCENCE: 5/5: A great song.<br /><br />JOURNEY MAN: 5/5: Awesome! One of the softer tracks, plus it has one of the best choruses.<br /><br />So this is a really good album, and buy it if you're a die hard Maiden fan, I say!<br /><br />P.S. STOP EDITING MY FREEKING REVIEWS, Amazon!!!!!!
B00006ADD5|5.0|Writing, acting, photography, pace, music--all brilliantly done.  Perfect for the subject matter.  Not totally accurate in terms of historic detail, but it's a movie, not a documentary. I would think that many younger people pummeled by movies packed with car crashes, exploding buildings, the \\"F-bomb,\\" etc. and a sadly deteriorating educational system would lack the attention span and understanding of history to appreciate this masterpiece.  And don't get me started on the popularity of Lite \\"Beer.\\" lol Ah well, times do change.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This movie is NOT for those who have pretensions; unfortunately when ever it comes to literary classics everyone who has read the book or seen the first adaptation feels as if they are a expert and are snobs when comes to further versions. Beware of these reviews!<br /><br />I had the pleasure of catching this movie 2 weeks ago on PBS I missed the first half but caught the second and what grab me was the wonderful acting the way the feels of the characters we so beautifully played.<br /><br />In fact one of my favorite scenes is of Anne running thru the streets to finally catch up to the man who she so obviously is in love with. It's a funny moment and conveys a reality to the situation.<br /><br />This movie is for those who like to see Jane Austen infused with emotion the feelings are what make this film shine above all others. Anne's poignant looks into the camera are priceless! Pride and Prejudice was my favorite until now.<br /><br />BTW the music is a major player in this movie rent the DVD and listens as the music during the DVD menu starts of soft and quiet and than builds to a loud crescendo! And you will understand what the film maker is trying to convey!
B0000009S3|5.0|This is one of Zappa's earliest works, and is entirely instrumental except for a Captain Beefheart vocal.  There is no \\"novelty\\" content.  This is a jazz-rock album in Zappa's inimical style.  It's always been the one album I can start playing while I'm doing some mundane houshold task, like washing dishes or something, and find myself a few minutes later just sitting in front of the speakers listening.  Indispensible for anyone with ears.
B00005JPUN|4.0|Sometimes a movie gets really terrible reviews and after I see it I often wonder why there is so much hate for it. I've seen movies that got bad reviews that I might have liked, but I do understand why it gets so many negative reviews. But in the case of The Invasion I really don't get all the hate this movie has gotten. The Invasion almost seems like a love it or hate it movie, while it does have its flaws I found it to be a fun ride.<br /><br />The Invasion is the 3rd remake of the 1956 classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers and so far I have liked all four versions as well as the unofficial remake The Faculty and I even enjoy some of the knock off films. The Invasion is sort of pointless sense it really doesn't add anything new to the story, though it does attempt to. I just love the concept for these movies and thus far I haven't been letdown yet.<br /><br />After The Invasion was shot it went through quite a few re-shoots and at times you can tell there was some studio tampering, Andy & Larry Wachowski did some rewrites while James McTeigue was hired for re-shoots. But none are credited and since I don't exactly know who did what I have to go based on the credits and only mention the original writer and director regardless of what they did.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Dave Kajganich and overall it wasn't bad at all. There were some good ideas presented that try and put a twist on the story and some work well and others don't seem to work as well. Overall though the script wasn't bad by any means; the characters are fairly decent, but not enough was done with them. The characters in this you won't dislike, but you don't really like as well. One of the twists on the story is the pods are gone. How can you have a Body Snatcher movie without pods? This time around the aliens instead vomit on you.<br /><br />Yes you read that right; ok so maybe it's not vomit, but they spray things out of their mouth so what would you call it? That concept is a little silly and when they do it odds are you'll get a bit of a chuckle out of it. They also infect people by tricking them into getting flu shots, which was much better than the vomit. Also some people are immune to the alien virus, which was an interesting idea that sort of works.<br /><br />Oliver Hirschbiegel makes his American directorial debut and for the most part does a good job. The Invasion runs at a pretty good pace and there are some fairly creepy moments and while they do lack a little bit it still mostly works. Oliver Hirschbiegel manages to get some decent suspense, but when all is said and done some scenes do lack and The Invasion really had potential to be a great movie, but I still think it mostly works and ends up being a good movie. The Invasion isn't as chilling as the previous 3 versions, but I do think there were a couple of creepy moments.<br /><br />What I loved about the 1978 version is the movie gets to this point to where you don't know who is one of the pod people and who is still human. Even the people passing on by who are nothing more than extras you start to wonder if they are pod people. It has this great presence of paranoia. The Invasion never quite reaches that level sadly, but there is still some suspense even if not as suspenseful as the past installments. I suppose all the blame can't be placed on Oliver Hirschbiegel, but despite those flaws I still think he did well.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays Carol Bennell and does a fairly good job. I'm not the biggest fan of Kidman, in general her movies don't really interest me, but she is a talented actress. The problem here is her performance is just sort of boring. If you didn't know any better you would think she was one of the aliens. She really doesn't show much emotion and again not a bad performance, but sort of boring. Daniel Craig played Ben Driscoll and like Kidman he also gives a good, but boring performance.<br /><br />I did enjoy The Invasion, but it is the weakest of the Body Snatcher series. It lacks the thrills and chills of the previous 3. And while it does move at a slightly better pace than Body Snatchers, it never gets as chilling as that movie was at times. But despite all that The Invasion while pointless does make for a good time. I really don't get all the hate this movie has gotten. Again it's not a great movie and the weakest of the Body Snatcher series, but overall it is a pretty good movie.<br /><br />More often than not a lot of people forget how important editing is and that is one of the biggest flaws with The Invasion. While there was some suspense and some creepy moments there could have possibly been more if not for the editing. In one scene Carol and Ben are in a room talking to each other and the next scene they are in a car trying to get away, cut back to them in the room talking and cut back to them in the car. In an earlier scene Carol is at home the next at work and the next back home again.

And while it does move at a slightly better pace than Body Snatchers, it never gets as chilling as that movie was at times. But despite all that The Invasion while pointless does make for a good time. I really don't get all the hate this movie has gotten. Again it's not a great movie and the weakest of the Body Snatcher series, but overall it is a pretty good movie.    More often than not a lot of people forget how important editing is and that is one of the biggest flaws with The Invasion. While there was some suspense and some creepy moments there could have possibly been more if not for the editing. In one scene Carol and Ben are in a room talking to each other and the next scene they are in a car trying to get away, cut back to them in the room talking and cut back to them in the car. In an earlier scene Carol is at home the next at work and the next back home again.

B000001F45|5.0|Some people think this album is inferior to and less cohesive than Demons and Wizards but I disagree. Magician's Birthday typifies the nearly lost art of mingling acoustic with electric guitar in a heavy metal record.  Keyboards and synths contribute atmosphere for more the trademark weird fantasy element, while the aggressive drums and bass prevent things from ever going soft. The pace drives along nicely and good sequencing maintains the stimulating listening experience from start to finish. Vocals are really out front, which is good, back in the day when a metal band could hire a guy to sing, instead of just bark. Wish we could return to that... So buy this album and TURN IT UP.  It's one of those records filled with Marshall stacks and Les Pauls that still sounds great at any volume level, but sounds best when it's cranked up to the levels at which it was recorded.
B000Q66HBE|5.0|I just got this album the other day and I was very surprised at the level of talent these guys bring to the table.  if you are fans of Avenged Sevenfold and Atreyu you will feel right at home listening to Bullet for my Valentine on your Zune.  It's nice to see a young band with tons of talent and upside in this genre for a change.  I'm really looking forward to picking up their brand new album this week!
B000TGCR38|3.0|\\"Black Book\\" may be based on a true story, but it often plays more like a corny wartime melodrama than a serious film about war.  Suffice it to say, it has a lot of beautiful and glamorous people running around doing a lot of cloak-and-dagger espionage stuff - all while changing the course of history.  That's not to say it isn't an enjoyable and entertaining picture, just that it doesn't rank up there in artistry and truth with the great European films about the Fascist era - classics like \\"Open City,\\" \\"Forbidden Games,\\" \\"The Cranes are Flying,\\" \\"The Shop on Main Street,\\" \\"Das Boot,\\" etc.  When you boil it down to the bare essentials, the theme of \\"Black Book\\" seems to be that there's nothing like a little hair coloring and a bar of chocolate to help an attractive young girl survive the horrors of war.<br /><br />Rachel Stein is a beautiful Jewish singer whose entire family is mowed down by the Nazis as they are fleeing occupied Holland (Rachel and her family are Germans currently hiding out in the Netherlands).  As the sole survivor of the attack, Rachel quickly becomes active in the Dutch resistance, her assignment being to cozy up to a high-ranking Gestapo officer who has taken a liking to her.  Soon she finds herself not only in bed with the Nazi but quite possibly in love with him as well.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven has directed the film much in the style of his big-scale Hollywood productions (\\"Robocop,\\" \\"Total Recall\\") - that is to say with a great deal of energy but not a lot of emotion.  The convoluted storyline often becomes muddled and difficult to follow, but Verhoeven compensates for this weakness by keeping the proceedings moving at a breakneck pace (which is a good thing since the film takes an exhausting two hours and twenty-five minutes to tell its story).  Unfortunately, the movie has been fitted with a musical score that sounds as if it has been lifted from some third-rate espionage thriller from the 1960's.  Carice van Houten has brio and spunk as the movie's heroine, running around from one dire predicament and hairbreadth escape to another - she`s almost like a Dutch version of the perpetually imperiled Pauline - but most of the other actors simply get lost in the shuffle.  And if you've ever doubted that chocolate is, indeed, the answer to all of life's problems, you will never do so again after seeing this movie.<br /><br />I must say that, even though I enjoyed it immensely, \\"Black Book\\" is probably the first serious film about Nazis that actually had me chuckling at wholly inappropriate places (some of the actors even hold their guns in a funny way).  \\"Black Book\\" may be a Dutch film by rights, but it`s strictly from Hollywood in its silliness and corn.eroine, running around from one dire predicament and hairbreadth escape to another - she`s almost like a Dutch version of the perpetually imperiled Pauline - but most of the other actors simply get lost in the shuffle.

B000V6BE6C|5.0|These guys may just be the most talented group of musicians and singers putting albums out right now!  I know that's a bold statement considering all the uber-talented bands out there (Tool, Metallica, Slipknot, etc.), but these guys have been solid gold since they started. This album, while not as dark as WTF, or not as ground-breaking as CoE, is still a very complete A7X experience that all A7X fans will enjoy.  Don't let any poster here tell you what you should think of this album; you need to buy it and give it a listens of your own.  If you are a true A7X fan than you probably have this album already and have listened to it many, many times just as I have, but just in case anybody out there is still on the fence let me kindly advise you to purchase this album and try it on.  Trust me, given only a few plays it will fit just as it should!  I'm not going to go through a track-by-track analysis here since so many people have already done that, and I don't think they do much anyways, but please give this album a chance.  You'll be glad you did!

I would think it is much better on a giant screen, where you could get the full expansiveness of many of the natural scenes. I do feel that there was almost too much of india in the film. My favorite was the soundtrack, very nice; well edited film. Check for the Matrix 2 tie-in.
0060531053|5.0|When I first went to my local homebrew shop and asked what book would be the best one to start homebrewing with, this was the one that was recommended. Charlie Papazian does an outstanding job of making homebrewing simple and approchable for someone new to the hobby. He goes into a good description of all of the ingredients and how they contribute to the flavor of beer. There are pages of good guides to hops which I have found very useful in making hops substitutions. This is becoming important as many popular hops become harder to find. My only comment is that I think his initial brew chapter has a little more equipment than you really need to start. There are many other good brew books that I have found good for my library, but this is a good one. Every homebrewer should have this book out of respect for what Charlie has done to make homebrewing a nationally accessible hobby.
1594481717|5.0|I found Daniel Pink's book, \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-brainers Will Rule the Future\\", to be both encouraging and insightful as I begin to prepare myself for the workforce. I am currently a freshman at Drexel University and reading this book was a requirement for my English class.  Surprisingly, I have already recommended it to many of my friends and family. The concepts presented by Pink are so witty and thought- provoking, it is hard not to enjoy this easy read. The book is strictly opinion-based, leaving much room for interpretation, debate and controversy.  However, his ideas were simply brilliant.   Welcome to the Conceptual Age everyone! Our country must now give birth to a new generation full of life, love and emotion.  Appealing people will give way to appealing products and appealing products are what sells in a world of a million choices. These people will use both halves of their brain to see the big picture and recognize the pieces that make up the whole.   Being able to see things as a whole requires a new mindset and Daniel Pink is well on his way to sharing the secret with the world. Understanding connections between objects and ideas around you will also allow you to see the pieces that come together to create the masterpiece. Pink's book offers many suggestions for success which all contribute to his central idea: Right-brainers will rule the future.   Pink offers three major reasons why right-brain thinking is becoming so important to the future of our economy.  Since there is an excessive amount of products now available to the consumer, these products must now be unique and enticing in order to distinguish them from a myriad of other products similar to it. Sending work overseas to countries such as Asia and India has also proven to be less costly and more effective. Many of today's jobs are being replaced by technology; computers are faster, cheaper and more efficient than the people once filling these positions. This is Pink's theory behind abundance, Asia and automation.   Pink's arguments are convincing, his ideas are revolutionary, and his suggestions for success are unprecedented. He has compiled six senses that he believes will be the key to understanding the Conceptual Age, and they will \\"increasingly guide our lives and shape our world\\" he contends. Although everyone possesses the basic attributes of design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning, most people simply need to sharpen them. . In a world of abundance, people are losing touch with many of their feelings and as they search for deeper meaning, there will be a new generation to answer their calls.   But rest easy left-brainers, Pink's book is full of silly ideas, quirky suggestions and reliable resources for exercising our creative side. By suggesting a slew of books, symphonies, websites, workshops and courses, Pink has ensured that there is something for everyone. We must look at the big picture to wholly grasp what it means to think with a whole new mind.   Not only is Pink's book written clearly and concisely, but he makes his points using a unique writing style that captures the reader's attention. Technology is beginning to surpass human intelligence, which in turn has begun to hinder the job market.  Jobs are being outsourced to other countries and workers are being replaced with computers. What are we all to do?   Read this book and take on the Conceptual Age with a whole new mind!

When his employer double crosses him, Indy barely escapes with his life, dragging singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and young Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) along with him.<br /><br />Well, Indy almost escapes.  Yet another attempt at double crossing him leaves the trio stranded in India.  There, they find a remote village that is willing to lead them back to civilization, but only after Indy has returned their sacred stone and their children from a nearby temple.<br /><br />This mission turns out to have plenty of danger.  Can Indy accomplish his mission and keep his companions safe from a very evil villain?<br /><br />I had heard rumors about this movie, but just now finally got a chance to watch it.  Many people complain about some scenes in the middle that are pretty disturbing.  In an attempt to make this movie darker then the original, the filmmakers upped the squirm factor.  Frankly, I felt those scenes were out of place and over the top, especially in a PG film.<br /><br />Having said that, those scenes are surrounded by plenty to like.  The action is phenomenal.  Not necessarily believable, but phenomenal.  I loved watching those scenes and will definitely revisit them in the future.  And there were some great comedic moments as well.  The acting was top notch when it might have gone over the top, which keeps things entertaining for the viewer.<br /><br />This has a well deserved reputation for being dark and disturbing.  As a result, you might want to view with caution.  But if you can ignore those scenes, there's still an entertaining film here.
B000ZK4466|4.0|I have been a fan since Deloused in the Comatorium and have all of Mars Volta's albums.  After 3-4 listens to this album I was hooked!  This is not their best album, but ranks #2 in my opinion.  Nothing can touch Deloused, but I think this album with it's full throttle energy comes close.  I wasn't a huge fan of Frances the Mute, but I appreciated the complex Amputecture.  Thomas Pridgen on the skins as some of the other folks have mentioned is not as complex as Jon Theodore, but he is young drummer who can pound with the best of them.  Just listen to his drumming on the beginning of Askepios.  His double-bass pounding and frenetic pace is amazing.  He is a very worthy replacement of the great Jon Theodore.    I don't need to convince you to get this album, it should be automatic.  If you like outstanding, complex, amazing progressive music - grab it now!
B000YIGNKE|1.0|That is the question I had after watching this. Why, when there is a beautifully done movie-length version already in existence ([[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]]), was this made? I was very excited to hear about The Complete Jane Austen project, and was happy to see from the previews that the casting looked age-appropriate. I was hoping that the stories would each be shown in several episodes to allow for character and plot development. What a sad, sad disappointment this adaptation was. No one who hasn't read the novel and/or seen the 1995 version would understand from *this* version why Persuasion has so many devoted fans. While the misinterpretation of Anne could partly be blamed on Ms. Hawkins' choices, the bulk of the missteps of this production are due to poor adapting and directing. It's a shame; the cast is talented (based on seeing many of them in previous endeavors), and would have benefitted from a better project.
B000000OAN|5.0|This album is best known for producing the monster Queen hit \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" which has become an all time classic still receiving major airplay more than 30 years after it's release.  The album also spawned John Deacon's \\"You're my Best Friend\\" another huge hit.  I think this was the album that introduced me to Queen back in the day and I remember being totally fascinated by it.  I had literally never heard anything like this before, and it remains a truly unique album to this day.  Queen throws everything at the wall to see what sticks and for the most part it all works.  The album contains metal, progressive rock, pop, ragtime, folk, ballads pop, hell even a song about being in love with your car!  It sounds stupid, but Roger Taylor's gritty vocals and percussion work make it irresistible.  \\"Death On Two Legs\\", \\"39\\", \\"Love Of My Life\\", and \\"The Profit Song\\" have all become Queen classics  Ya gotta love it, and this album shows everything that made Queen great.
1592402038|5.0|This is a great fun book, and I really enjoyed reading it. It has been a while since I laughed so hard. Wait, should I have said, \\"This is a great, fun book\\"? When do we use Mrs. Comma?    The author writes, \\"Punctuation has been defined many ways. Some grammarians use the analogy of stitching: punctuation as the basting that holds the fabric of language in shape. Another writer tells us that punctuation marks are the traffic signals of language: they tell us to slow down, notice this, take a detour, and stop.\\" (p. 7).    Punctuation can alter the sense of a string of words. Take the following example:    A woman, without her man, is nothing.  A woman: without her, man is nothing.    The use of punctuation is like fashion; it has its moments. One day it might be fashionable to use a semi-colon; another day it might not! Wait a second! Did I use my punctuation right? Should there have been a semi-colon after the word semi-colon? What a conundrum! And talking of semi-colons, did you know that colon in Greek means a limb (hence part of a strophe. A strophe is the first of two movements made by a chorus during the performance of a choral ode, but you all knew that, didn't you)? So a semi-colon is a half limb. But wait a minute, does apostrophe come from strophe or the other way round? Or maybe there is no relation whatsoever? Open your dictionaries!    Did you know that women use exclamation marks more than men! Wait, I really meant to put a question mark!     Did you know that most punctuation marks were invented by the early printers? Punctuation can render the written word into the way we talk. For example, poses between words, marking thoughts...    How about punctuation in text messages? Do any of us bother putting them? And how about in emails or while chatting on the internet, how do we use punctuation? Who invented the smileys and for what reason? Smileys are made of punctuation marks. For example, :-) is a smiley meaning a smiling face. Smileys are made of punctuation marks. Funny enough, I was looking for the plural of smiley (which I thought to be smilies) and could not find the word in either the Oxford or the Webster dictionary. I, however, was able to find it in the Collins and the American Heritage dictionary. I wonder why that is?! Hey, was that a correct usage of punctuation?!!!!!    Here's a nice fact: a few years ago, the average age of email users was 20. It is now 30, and climbing. More and more of us are using email to communicate with each other, and more and more of us are at a loss of how to use punctuation properly, if any. Just look at all the punctuation mistakes I have made in this short review (please don't count the grammatical errors!!!!!).    This is a book you will love reading, and you will find yourself with a smile on your face. This book does not intend to teach you. Rather, it informs you! Did you say women use exclamation marks more often than men?    The title of the book came about from a dictionary definition of panda. According to the author, the dictionary defined panda as a bear-like animal that eats, shoots and leaves. On the cover of the book, you actually see a panda on a ladder erasing the comma after eats. The sentence should have correctly read, `a bear-like animal that eats shoots and leaves.' Well, no one is perfect. (I keep wondering whether I am using punctuation correctly. What hath this book done to me? I mean to me!!!!!)     I highly recommend the audio version of this book as well. In fact, the book is based on the audio version. Throughout the audio you will hear interviews with punctuation professionals and secret societies with the sole goal of correcting punctuation mistakes. Really, no kidding! Well, maybe not that secret. One such society has as its goal to correct apostrophe mistakes. For example, its or it's? They actually write letters to editors and store owners (is that owner's?) making them aware of the correct usage of this infamous punctuation mark. Some store owners actually change their signposts to reflect the correct usage. But many don't. Amazing! Who said all secret societies are bad?     Here's a fact: The English language first picked up the apostrophe in the 16th century. The word in Greek means \\"turning away\\", and hence \\"omission\\" or \\"elusion\\". In classical texts, it was used to mark dropped letters, as in t'cius for \\"tertius\\" (p. 37).    O, before I forget, here's a useful insight: The American and British editions of this book use punctuation differently!    Wait, before I go, here's another thought: hopefully the author won't read my review and use me as an example of how horrible my punctuation is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Starring Matt Damon as the enigmatic Jason Bourne of the Robert Ludlum novels, this third chapter finds Bourne seeking clues to a past he's been brainwashed into forgetting.  Director Paul Greengrass (\\"United 93\\") doesn't spend a lot of screen time refreshing your memory about where the story left off in \\"The Bourne Supremacy,\\" preferring instead to dive right in and get the action percolating.   A British reporter (Paddy Considine) has received information from a source about a connection between Bourne and a cryptic operation known as Blackfriars.  Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), a high-ranking CIA operative, believes the leak has come from Bourne himself, whose knowledge of the secret operation could compromise national security and the CIA infrastructure as well.  He issues orders to have Bourne eliminated.   This doesn't sit well with Vosen's associate, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who wants to bring Bourne in for questioning instead.  But Bourne is at least five steps ahead of the spy agency as he engages in an elaborate cat-and-mouse game, employing his programmed knowledge to outthink, outmaneuver, and outsmart Vosen and his hit teams.   Director Greengrass has given \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" a driving, relentless energy.  Dialogue has been pared to the minimum in favor of many breathtaking action sequences.  There are assassins, good guys who are really bad guys, people who may be double agents, a nail-biting car chase, a dazzling series of exotic locations, and a conspiracy plot implicating people in high places.   Damon fits into Bourne's skin effortlessly in this third go-round.  With his focused expression, he manages to infuse Bourne with humanity.  Plagued by disturbing flashbacks he doesn't comprehend, Bourne thinks in triple time, acts instantaneously to avoid danger or warn others of it, and fearlessly takes on lethal adversaries -- all of this while deciphering clues to who he really is and trying to learn why the CIA wants him dead.   Joan Allen's Pamela Lundy has more of a role this time than in the previous films, where she simply looked efficient and barked orders.  Here, she actually appears to have a conscience and regards herself as not a team player when the team is up to no good.   Since this turnaround and warming of personality occur abruptly, without preparation, it would not be convincing were it not for Allen's skill at conveying her character.  We've come to see her as cold efficiency -- a company gal all the way.  This time around, she offers a more human face for an agency that the film otherwise paints as omnipotent, impersonal and  conscienceless.     Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) is brought into the movie about halfway through.  Her ostensible purpose is to serve as a necessary ally to Bourne, but really she's there mostly to be placed in danger and rescued by Bourne.  Though she's sharper than traditional female characters in spy flicks, she's still the resident damsel in distress.      Director Greengrass uses a rapid-fire editing style in \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" to move the film briskly and hold the viewer captivated for two hours of cars smashing, deadly hand-to-hand combat, and classification of characters by whether they are helpful or harmful to Bourne.  This dazzling editing technique works fine initially, but ultimately it is self-defeating.   I love the close, one-on-one fights featured in the Bourne films.  Usually they occur without much warning, so we are taken off guard along with Bourne.  These sequences are impeccably staged, both to be sure the actors don't actually hurt each other and so that they ring true.     By breaking up these terrific sequences into jigsaw pieces reassembled at lightning speed, Greengrass never allows us to really concentrate on a clever move, a distracting feint, or how the combatants take advantage of items in their surroundings.  The fights therefore wash over us rather than let us appreciate them as the involved, meticulously planned set pieces they are.     Greengrass makes very good use of the narrow, twisting streets of Madrid and Tangier and New York's unmistakable atmosphere.  He also knows how to position crowds and stage car stunts for maximum effect.  Happily, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" is not a movie that lives or dies based on computer-generated technology.  The stunts are actually staged the old-fashioned way, and they are staged excitingly.
B00117P0HE|3.0|I read some bad reviews of this flick when it was still on the big screen, but I gotta disagree for the most part. For a second sequel this pic was solid and delivered exciting action shots. As usual, you cannot take your eyes off Milla Jovovich. My biggest complaint about the movie is that the characters were not developed enough. Who was Claire Redfield and why does she have the power to run a convoy? Carlos was special ops for Umbrella Corp, yet he was subordinate somehow to Ali Larter's character. Why? Ashanti's character was killed before the viewer even got the chance to figure out who she was and why she was there. All in all, I enjoyed this movie, but it could have used another 45 minutes to an hour to develop some of the characters so that the viewer has a reason to be sorry -or happy- to see them get munched!

B000W4KT64|3.0|The reason I rented this video was because I watched the original with Ricki Lake a few years ago and I thought it was hilarious.  This new version was a big disappointment for me.  This version comes off more like a bad Disney after school special.  All of the musical numbers sounded the same, and were just over-the-top with their Broadway-like style. Aside from \\"Seaweed\\" the characters weren't as likable as they were in the original Waters film. In fact, even the main character Tracy Turnblad got on your nerves as she broke into song about every three minutes. And all the songs sounded the same. No variety.<br />I did, however, think that the cameo with Ricki Lake was well done.  As for seeing John Travolta dressed up as a woman, well that was worth it.  This film only made me want to see the original version all over again. Watch that one instead.

1596061472|4.0|Coraline (not Caraline if you please) is a precocious, bored young girl. She likes to explore and, in her rented home, finds a door which, when opened, leads to a brick wall. No way through, or is there? There is, and Coraline finds it, and, like Alice through the looking glass, enters a twisted world which, in her case, resembles her own but is darkly different. A woman, resembling her mom, or a doll-like, button-eyed look-alike, wants her to stay in this new world, and takes steps to make sure Coraline does stay, so as to consume her soul. No doubt scary for the young, and still entertainingly good for the grownups.    The limited signed version, (despite a typo) is a prize.

Damon becomes homosexuallly engaged with Law, a man who's already lost a drowned, pregnant mistress and is now engaged to  Paltrow.                                                                                                                                       All of Damon's tricks-imitations, false flattery, blatant lying-   go for naught as Law reveals that Damon is little more than a bore,a hanger onner with no depth.A fight breaks out and Damon kills Law, and later Law's friend from Princeton, who's able to see right through Damon. A  third murder is barely averted by chance and the police are closing in when Law's father arrives from New York with full evidence of his son's past guilt and odd behavior, thus setting Damon free with some of Law's inheritance.Free to live a life of guilt,loneliness, and suspicion of  Paltrow, Law's former fiance'.  It's a movie well worth seeing, even though one finds it a bit confusing at times.
B00005JLXE|2.0|The theatrical cut of Daredevil is garbage compared to the director's cut.  If you watch the Director's cut you will see that many great pieces of the movie were robbed by the producers.  Important chemistry between young Matt and his Father was lost in the final cut which was essential to the development of both those characters.  Catchy dialogue was cut out that remained in the Director's cut, like \\"Time to give the Devil his due.\\"  Pieces of fight scenes were cut out for time, which any fan would be displeased with.  Also, a whole sideplot with the Lisa murder and Coolio's character did not make it to the final cut.  This whole sideplot was very important to Daredevil's character as a lawyer and the audience was robbed of their movie.<br /><br />So what did they add to the theatrical cut?? A love scene.  That's it! Someone guessed that millions of fans and the general audience would need a love scene to survive through a superhero movie.  When actually this scene ruined the pace.  In the director's cut, Daredevil says \\"I have to go,\\" because he hears someone getting beaten in an alleyway.  In the theatrical version he decides \\"Well sleeping with Elektra sounds better than fighting crime.....so why not?\\"<br /><br />When I look at both films I think the theatrical version is the movie that deserves bashing from critics, because the Director's cut has so much more to offer.  It's not some UNRATED marketing scheme.  It's really an attempt to save the cut of the film that Mark Steven Johnson meant for his audience.  The Director's Cut is a honorable and loyal adaptation, while the Theatrical cut is Cut & Pasted in an attempt to appeal to more audience and pump more money in.<br /><br />See the movie the way it was meant to be seen.  Get the Director's Cut.  It is NOT a scheme to just obtain more money.  It actually has around 30 minutes of additional scenes.  Don't cheat yourself.  Get the better version.

0307383415|5.0|I am not a Obama supporter, a liberal Democrat or cranky Republican. I read this book because the more I see of the man the more intrigued I become so I wanted to know for myself, who is this man? And this book, his first, is pretty much a search for his identity. A deep, probing look at who I am, the same journey that most concentious, self-examining people will take at least once in their lifetime. Barack Obama is a deep thinker, pondering the roots of his black father and white mother and what seperates them but ultimately what unites them. His journey is a fascinating one that is well written and well thought out. I was totally enthralled by his story and while there is nothing in here that makes one say, wow, he would make a great president, there here is plenty here to say, wow, what an incredible spirit and human being.

B00005RHGL|5.0|Wyatt Earp has one of the most remarkable stories in the history of the American West. While this may take some artistic liberties (more than Costner's Wyatt Earp) it is still one of the greates westerns of all time. Russell and Kilmer are phenominal in their best performances and the entire ensemble cast is perfect. You feel like they had the best time of their lives making this wonderful movie. Tombstone and Wyatt Earp may be about the same subject but both are vastly different, nearly equally great films and while I love Costner's film I will give the slightest edge to Tombstone and rate it as one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.
0517543052|5.0|If you've never read Ram Dass, start here--this is his best book. He wrote it in the midst of his spiritual awakening in the early '70s after having spent years in India with his guru, Maharji. It's basically a literal and illustrated explanation of spiritual awakening. RD is a master at translating complex Eastern spiritual teachings into concepts that Westerners can grasp.  He has been my greatest spiritual teacher and I am eternally grateful to him. And he kindly endorsed my book, To Bee or Not to Bee (sort of an allegorical version of Be Here Now), with the following: \\"This tender allegory mirrors our learning to Bee Here Now.\\" It's now in 11 languages.

B0001US8EO|5.0|I know there are detractors of both this movie and Kevin Costner but I'm not one of them. It is longer and more historically accurate than Tombstone but just as well made. It also features a more realistically stoic portrayal of Earp by Costner and an \\"I'm no slouch at playing Doc myself\\" performance by the unrecognizable Dennis Quaid who would have been the measuring stick had Val Kilmer not been otherwordly as Doc. This film also features a GREAT ensemble cast much like Tombstone and it amazes me how two separate casts can hit such a home run on the same topic. A must own if you are a western fan.
B000002534|4.0|I just pulled out the original vinyl of this last weekend and was reminded how fine this album is. There's a great latin fusion vibe on most tracks, and Flora and Airto add much to the proceedings. Not all of the songs are great material but most are very good, and Carlos plays beautifully throughout, his tone rich and his licks not yet self-parodic.<br /><br />This is the last really jazzy Santana album, though Caravanserai is the best of that genre for him. Bill Graham became Carlos' manager after this album, and it was back to the pop charts for Chinmoy's boy. You can still feel his spiritual peace and direction here, however, and he's not too devadippy; credit must be given to Santana for being one of the least fried rock stars of the 70s.<br /><br />A very sweet and melodically jazzy record full of good vibes.
1573223026|4.0|Hornby, Nick, A Long Way Down      A Long Way Down is, in its best moments, a hilarious spoof on suicide, and on our age. I told a friend the general theme, and described one of the potential suicides to her and she stared at me, incredulous. \\"You find that funny??\\" But, with Hornby at the helm, the answer is, \\"yes, extremely\\". And if we can laugh at the stupidity of suicide, we're not going to go out and commit it. This book, ostensibly about self-induced death, is a book celebrating life - not a glorious life; in fact, a hideously mundane one, but the characters do opt to trudge it out, and that's significant, as they're the ones who have been seriously tempted by its opposite.   By looking at suicide squarely in the face Hornby manages to trivialise it and remove it from its hallowed solipsism and introverted selfishness. One becomes very aware of the short-term and inappropriate solution it offers, and of the way it fails to take into account the reactions of surviving friends or family. More than anything, the positive of existence emerges as outclassing oblivion. Hornby, through his use of humour, manages to achieve this without being in the slightest way sanctimonious or prim. No easy solutions are offered to or by his unappealing characters. Their lives are not attractive, but they opt to live them.   We see how little it takes to tip the balance between a decision to end it all and to jump, between despair and hope. Sure, there is comedy in the decision to eat pizza and search for a guy rather than jumping, but the point is not lost. There is much to learn from the fact that they are `rescued' by mundanity, not by great loves or professional carers who happen on them, but just by having someone - unattractive and unrelated - who is in some way connected to them. Merely the fact that they can form a group provides a lifeline. The fact that they met others in their predicament meant that they had a link to another human, however tenuous. That is a serious undercurrent working through the humour.  It is not a book without weakness. Hornby has a few problems extending his original theme out to a novel of its current size, and could have made it shorter to make his stew more piquant. There are times when the humour descends to the realm of stupidity. Nonetheless, I read it to the end, and am glad I did. I would have missed little, however, had I stopped at half way.
B00003CXA2|2.0|This film could have been good if parts of it were'nt so ridiculous. I can suspend belief for maybe a minute, but not for the whole movie. I am not a Tom Hanks fan, but have seen a few of his films. This is not even one of my favorites of HIS. So, even though its not the worst thing I've ever seen, its still up there as one of the more ridiculous ones.

There is no question this deserved its Oscar win.
6305327041|2.0|Like Britney Spears' spiraling descent into the pits of all her dementia, Madonna just retrogressed further and further with each movie she made. Let's see, there was [[ASIN:B00005AUJO Shadows and Fog]], [[ASIN:B00008976Z Blue in the Face]], [[ASIN:B000DZ95HG Girl 6]] and lest we not forget the repugnant [[ASIN:B0009JMKIW Dangerous Game]]. And then there was Four Rooms. In all fairness, this is likely not her worst film; that honor is bestowed to [[ASIN:0792166736 The Next Best Thing]] (but I simply do not have the strength to write a review about that dreadful concoction.)     You know, \\"Four Rooms\\" really could have been a better film. It was a clever idea, get a group of first-rate directors together for a low-budge anthology film with some of the biggest stars of the '90s. What could go wrong with that?     A lot is wrong with this film. All of the scenes are shoddy and second-rate. The picture and sound quality is lousy, even by 1970's standards. Did they get a cameraman on some type of a prison-study program? And the performances are mostly boring and abysmal. Although, the acting by Antonio Banderas isn't bad. He, especially gave a fine rendition as the harried father trying to have a good time with his wife. \\"The Misbehavers\\" segment was my favorite.     Aptly titled, \\"The Missing Ingredient,\\" Madonna's segment was abhorrent. Yes, there is a missing ingredient; it's capability! \\"The Missing Ingredient\\" was the very worst story mainly because of Madonna. I don't understand, was the director (Allison Anders) afraid to actually tell Queen-Madonna what to do? I don't care if this is a B-movie, that doesn't give Madonna the right to flounce around and act like a no-talent snob.     Madonna walks around in her cute little black witch's costume reading her lines without any feeling or energy. (I get the serious impression that a piece of wet cardboard has more life and energy than this woman.) But what's really annoying with Madonna's \\"Elspheth\\" is that she simplydoes not fit in. It's like finding an extra fork from Target and trying to add it to your brand-new place-setting from Fortunoff. It just doesn't look right.    Madonna refused to do any promotion for this film because once she saw the final cut she went nuts. And even though it was in her contract she wouldn't do a single interview in celebration of this movie. And did you notice the movie poster? How many producers allow one of their lead stars to cut and color his or her hair after all of the scenes are shot, but before the final movie poster is photographed, printed and approved? (This is almost as bad is getting pregnant during the production of a big-budget movie. Oh, who did that? Madonna, who else!) In \\"Four Rooms\\" Madonna had long platinum hair and again after she saw how she looked, she decided to chop off her hair and color it red for the movie's poster. (This was done on a whim. Someone like Madonna probably owns stock in Lady Clairol.) This is simply not done and makes everyone involved look like total unprofessional amateurs.     It's been said for the latter part of the last 30 years that Madonna is a master-manipulator who knows how to court the press and the public, if only for her own self-serving agenda. Personally, I know the woman is a genius. Who else could have done everything she did and held on to her throne for 25 years, if only out of sheer psychoneurosis? In the '80s Madonna went out of her way to prove that she was a singer. In the '90s she wanted to prove she was an actress. And, in the '00s Madonna has done everything under the sun (just short of getting a lobotomy) to make us all believe that she's a kind and loving individual. The New Madonna wants desperately to be accepted as a \\"real person.\\" But as we learned years ago, with movies like this, Madonna can't act if her life depended on it. She comes off as devious and rather obsessive. Like Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, Madonna is a very lonely woman who is incapable of showing or receiving any type of sincere affection. Perhaps, the biggest role of her life was just playing the part of Madonna?     I suppose we should be thankful that Madonna no longer makes movies. She stopped making movies 6 years ago, after that distorted nonsense that her hubby directed, [[ASIN:B00007L4OE Swept Away]]. (FYI, his career tanked after that!) Sadly, even the old Madonna, with zero acting potentiality, is more charismatic than what she has morphed into this time around the proverbial incarnation tree.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|This is great filmmaking. The acting was top-notch, the score was beautiful. Its hard to believe this was based on someone's life. Its heartbreaking but interesting at the same time. And Russel Crowe did a fantastic job as Nash. I can't believe he lost that Oscar. Its such a shame. But a great film nonetheless.
B000W4KT64|5.0|My 2 daughters and I just love this movie and soundtrack. John Travolta is a hoot in this movie. I never saw the original or any other ones but this one is alot of fun to watch. If your girls love Zac (hot pants) Efron as my girls call him then they'll love this movie. Nikki Blonsky is terrific too!
B000YENUI6|5.0|This was probably my pick for best film of 2007. It was superbly acted and I can't even begin to say how perfect Viggo Mortensen is as an actor. He embodied this role and it was perfection. I love how he is not afraid to get down and dirty, no matter what role he is in. He is a true actor. He pretty much is the reason to see this movie. Thats not a jab at the film. The actual movie is great to watch. It has an air of suspense surrounding it. You never know what is going to happen and to whom. And yes, the infamous Bathhouse scene is as awesome as everyone says it is, if you're not squeemish...
B00005MP58|5.0|This is an amzaing film. I first saw it on VHS, and when the DVD came out, bought it for my wife. We have watched it 3 times, now. Someone mentioned a \\"special ed. dvd\\" with a booklet. Our is \\"just\\" a 2 dvd boxed set, and that's all it needs to be.  The costumes and sets are wonderful as are the actors. Colin Firth stands out as the supreme definition of Mr. Darcy. Once upon a time, Dorothy Parker described Kathryn Hepburn of \\"having all the emotions from A to B\\". Watching Firth's Darcy is seeing that there are 27 different emotions between A and B! Although he barely smiles (at the very end), the change is pronounced in tiny mouth and facial motions.    Jennifer Ehle is also wonderful as are the entire supporting cast, and the wonderful interplay between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.    This is a must-have for all you romance lovers and the 4-5 hour length is just about the right time.
B0001WTWCO|2.0|I ususally love films in this genre but I was very dissapointed in this film. It just didn't do anything for me emotionally. I felt nothing. Even at the end I felt nothing. I'm not sure why, but I thought most of the film was rather bland and dragged terribly. This should have been the perfect film for me, but it was the complete opposite. Long movies do not bother me in the least, but I was getting restless half way through. Its a pity because the actors in this are some of my most favorite.
B000UNYPNA|5.0|very pretty sounding modern shoegazer. folksy and melodic; this is a really mellow, and enjoyable album.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|I love Sword and Sandal films and this is probably my favorite. It was entirely perfect. There isnt a single moment in the film that I would change. It has the perfect amount of action and suspense and its very dramatic and moving. Ridley Scott is a genius.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|For those who have acquired copies of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" before, the question might be: What do you need with another copy?  Well, the answer is that the color and details in this colorized version are almost perfect and far more impressive than the black-and-white copy. That's even though the re-mastered B&W version of the movie is fine, too.  If Mary Bailey (played by Donna Reed) were to see the color version she would say, again: \\"It's a miracle.\\"  Try as we could my wife and I couldn't find anything wrong with the colorization.  Details on human faces are incredible--shadows where there should be shadows, beard stubble on the despairing George Bailey (played by Jimmy Stewart), etc.  The only question we might have would be how Mary Bailey got her Hollywood sun tan living in Bedford Falls?  But we've wondered that before in the re-mastered, B&W version.  Other aspects in this rendering are just outstanding, too, like color posters of the South Pacific in the Baileys' honeymoon suite, colors of Ernie's taxicab, birds in the trees and on window ledges, colors of flowers, grass, trees, snow, women's dresses, men's ties, and on and on.  We'd venture to say that once you've seen the colorized version you'll never bother with the black-and-white copy again.  Special features include introductions and analyses by Tom Bosley and Frank Capra, Jr.  These were done in the early-1990's and even have a Frank Capra, Sr. interview shortly before his death.  If you or a friend are feeling down we have this advice: get this production and watch it.  You'll feel better right away.  Sorry to be corny, but it really is a wonderful life.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|I loved this movie!  It was a hot action thriller, with intense fight scenes and non-stop action. The one-on-one with Desh was excellent camera work; normally I don't like hand-held shots, but this time I felt like I was in the fight.  Matt Damon does a great job with the character, especially considering he says so little in the movie.  And I was glad to see Joan Allen and Julia Stiles back again.  Add to that a great ending, and it was a near perfect popcorn flick.<br /><br />BUT - why is there no special edition?  Surely with three movies they have some extra footage, new insights, more featurettes?  This DVD edition is sorely lacking.  Of course, the studio will wait 6 months until we've all bought this one and then give us \\"the wonderful edition.\\" And then 6 more months down the road all three films in a new \\"explosive collection.\\"  And they wonder why fans are so dissatisfied?  Pay $20 for two people to see it in the theatre (no snacks!) pay $20 for the DVD, and then again if you want extra footage or special features!  More often than not, I've been skipping the first step.  Highly recommend the film, but if you can wait, they'll be a better DVD soon I'm sure.
B000M343BM|5.0|This is a great movie. Our grand kids love baseball and this was a funny movie, that made them laugh.
B000G759LW|4.0|I enjoyed Back To Basics. Both the album and the accompaning world tour. But I think Stripped was just a tiny bit better.
B000WC39ZY|2.0|The DVD transfer for this item is NOT enhanced for widescreen TVs, just like the previously released version. It is an excellent film, but because MGM decided to pussyfoot around giving the actual film a better transfer and enhancement, I cannot justify anyone purchasing this piece of repackaged junk. If you love special features, this would be the only reason to double dip. I prefer the pristine transfer over anything else, and was deeply disappointed. As a huge Scorsese fan, this film by far gets the worst treatment of any he has directed. Even bare-bones editions of \\"The Color of Money\\" and \\"The Age of Innocence\\" are treated with more respect.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|The show continues to impress me. The only things that get on my nerve is the convention that they have to kill a couple major characters a season. They also feel the need to show a nasty side to every character as soon as we begin to like them. All in all, still the most involving show on television to me.
B000ZK4466|5.0|In what has to be the scariest, and most profound influence to ever grace the music industry, The Mars Volta's latest offering \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" will speak to you. Behind the soaring guitars, the pulsating drums, and within the crooning and wailing vocals, other things can be heard. Other voices, in the shadows, in the midst of the lyrics. There is a presence here, one that bears a very sinister feeling.     \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\" almost ceased to be during the recording process. Odd occurrences, mishaps and problems (including their drummer quitting, their sound engineer losing his mind, their studio flooding, and recorded drum tracks mysteriously disappearing), nearly caused the end of this masterpiece.    (The Bedlam in Goliath - by The Mars Volta)    The Mars Volta (TMV) are back with, what could be considered their best album to date. While nothing will ever match \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\" or their beloved \\"Frances The Mute\\", \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" comes pretty darn close, and presents a band who has fully matured and gained the ability to blend the abstract with the structured, the pop-sensibility with the avant-garde. The music on \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" is loud, intense, and it doesn't let up, even during the slow parts. The musicianship is very tight, but the lyrics and the meaning behind the music steal the show here.     In true TMV fashion, \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" is a concept album. The details of said album are very interesting, and eerie. According to the band, the album is based on their experiences with an ancient Ouija Board that they obtained. Through this Board they contacted various \\"beings\\" who clamored together to form \\"Goliath\\", a mass entity who strongly desired to return to the world of the living. \\"Goliath\\" told them a particular story, a love triangle between a man, a woman, and a mother. Creepy? Just wait, there's more. Through their communication with \\"Goliath\\" and various poems that were attached to the Ouija Board, they crafted the lyricsand concept behind \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\". But the entity was not too happy about providing the band with inspiration for free, and it desired something in return. What it demanded is not entirely clear, but during the recording process the band experienced some mishaps and problems that could only be attributed to the influence of \\"Goliath\\". Things got so bad that they had to rid themselves of the Ouija Board. According to the band, they felt that a curse of some sort had been placed upon their heads, and the only way to rid themselves of it was to set up (what they term) musical \\"Trappings\\" for the listener. By opening up the story of \\"Goliath\\" to the world, they hoped to rid themselves of their perceived \\"bad mojo\\" once and for all. The band also claims to have laced certain traits of the Afro-Cuban religion Santeria into the lyrics and music to protect themselves from \\"Goliath\\".     If you are interested in this story, check out the full synopsis on The Mars Volta's website.     Anyways,    \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" is a mammoth of an album. Monstrous riffs, intense soloing, powerful drums, wailing vocals and saxophone, and the complex and intricate workings of true TMV musicianship saturate every corner and  shadow of this album; fans and music lovers will not be disappointed. For those who weren't totally satisfied with the Volta's previous spacey and avant-garde infused \\"Amputecture\\" should find themselves very pleased with \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\". Whereas \\"Amputecture\\" was predominantly an collective of abstract freak outs with minimal structure in between, \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" is the exact opposite.     The songs on this latest offering are structured, probably more than they should be, resembling something more of a cross between \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" and \\"Frances The Mute\\". Yet, they still offer much in terms of abstract noise and avant-garde playing, and their trademarked \\"freak-outs\\" can be heard throughout the record, though this time around they are more subdued, and they never fall into the \\"boring\\" or \\"tired\\" category (as some of their lengthy jam-freak-out songs tend to get). Their musical wanderings on this album seem to have purpose, and at times  the \\"noises\\" the guitarist emits from his guitar sound very menacing and downright scary. At the end of \\"Agadez\\", the noises resemble jumbled voices screaming in unison from some unknown dimension...scary stuff. There are other scary moments, but I will leave that up to you to decipher.    \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" follows a more straight-forward narrative music wise than even \\"Frances The Mute\\" managed to accomplish. I wouldn't go as far as calling the songs on \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" radio-friendly, but the pop sensibility is certainly present, and this is a good thing! Unlike \\"Amputecture\\", the vision for each song is much more cohesive, and the band rarely strays into \\"no-mans-land\\" musically.     Maybe its because I read and was fascinated by the story behind this album, but there is a very creepy and eerie vibe throughout the music on \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\", a vibe that puts my perception into a different light when listening to it. Certain lyrics, when heard under this light are VERY revealing.     For example, on the track \\"Askepios\\", when Cedric is wailing \\"Help me come alive...\\", once cannot help but wonder if this was a direct quote from \\"Goliath\\", urging the band to assist it in returning to the world of the living.    I highly suggest \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\". This is an album that will stay with you for a long time, and one that will certainly pique the interest of those that are intrigued by the Occult, the mystical, and the mysterious.     Musically this album will blow you away, as TMV bounce across various styles and genres, yet it never once sounds contrived or forced. Their blend of Latin rhythms, Punk-rock, Progressive Rock and Avant-garde is very well blended and structured. There is even some middle-eastern tinged rhythms interspersed throughout the songs.    On amusical level The Mars Volta have evolved into a mature and highly accomplished band. This album flows like   an ocean; forceful and intense, encompassing and mammoth.     Lyrically this album will haunt you and push you to figure out exactly what each song means, what each word is meant to invoke. The vocalist is known for having odd, mystical and often dark lyrics, and \\"Bedlam in Goliath\\" is no different (even scary at times).I suggest having the lyrics close when listening, as it is often hard to hear and understand what is being sung most of the time.    Spiritually, this album will speak to you; what it says will be up to the listener, but make no mistake, it WILL speak to you. That is all I can say about that...    \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\" sounds like a band playing for its very sanity, and life.

B000NQR7NO|4.0|This album is a step forward. Do not let my title fool you. Sophomore albums are often hard to pull off.. You either get accused of sounding too much like the first or too little like the first and have taken a far-out turn. This one sounds more like the first than it does not. You have a couple of instantly likable tracks such as the three singles. Then there are gems that are hard to find, but with a few listens you learn to appreciate them such as D is for Dangerous. I found more likable melodies than lyrics. Not to say Turner has not written some catchy lines, but the melodies and driven riffs are quite appealing. If I had to say anything negative about the album is that there are a couple of dead spots in it, where as their debut only had one IMO.     As a side-note everyone should check out the B-Sides of the singles because there are some 5 star songs there for sure. Makes you wonder what this album would have been like with a couple of those. I for one enjoyed the song featuring Dizzee Rascal. Check those out and then rate this album. To all the haters; you don't get much anyway so live your life blind! -PEACE-
B00005JPTI|3.0|[...]In short, I'll sum up the good and bad for this flick:    GOOD: Will Smith's acting for the most part, the dog's \\"acting\\", most CG of deserted NYC, the interior \\"decorating\\" of Smith's hideaway, the idea that the mutants can adapt and hunt Smith's character creatively, maybe the wardrobe.    BAD: 101 minutes for $16 bucks!!, the CG for everything else, almost all of the dialogue, the other characters aside from Smith's, the rushed ridiculous ending, the lack of developing dramatic tension with the \\"mutant leader\\", the non-sensical / illogical plot happenings, shameless product placement as per usual, the location and structure of Smith's hideaway (an old house on the ground in a central location with pretty flimsy protection - look at the front door for crying out loud!). The penthouse for Chuck Heston made much more sense in many ways.     [...]
1594481717|4.0|There are ideas that affect people and continue to stick with them for the rest of their lives.  Daniel H. Pink's new intriguing non-fiction narrative \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule The Future\\", is one of those ideas.  Filled with exercises, research and studies, Pink's book is one that every age group should read.  While at times the book tends to get a bit slow, the overall book was well written.    \\"A Whole New Mind\\" is chalk full of suggestions and ideas that will make you truly sit and think.  Pink mentions that as children get older, they tend to loose creativity.  The idea of being unique is a bad thing if a child wishes to be accepted into the popular circle.  Pink fights back with the statement \\"Choose things because they delight you, not because they impress others.\\"      Throughout his book, Pink puts in phrases of wisdom and truths that people look for everyday to know that being different and self-confident isn't seen as wrong.  Pink brings in stories of others to support his theories of right-brained thinkers.    Pink addresses the issue of why people who use the right side of their brain will be better off in the future.  Pink explains the purpose of each hemisphere in both the right and the left side of the human brain.     The left side takes care of the logical, detailed and sequential duties. The right side takes care of the emotional, big picture, and simultaneous duties. Pink argues that the right side of the human brain needs the left side, and vice versa.    Pink introduces the six essential senses that he states that people will need as what he calls the Conceptual Age approaches. The six senses are the following: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning. Each of these senses are designed to make a person become successful.     As a college student, I was required to read Pink's book for my English class.  My first reaction was \\"this is going to be a very dull book.\\"  But after I stumbled through the first couple paragraphs, I found that I could apply Pink's book to my own personal life.  Like any good book you read, or movie you see, being able to relate to a character or situation makes it that much more interesting.  I believe that everyone can see themselves in one way or another relating to Pink and the information and research he shares with the readers.
B00004RFFI|4.0|I am a disaster movie lover and this is one of the best.  I lived in the tornado belt growing up and this movie gives a good depiction of tornados, the fear, the fascination, the anger, the losses and the wonder.  Helen Hunt is a very good actor, her protrayal of a women who lost her dad to tornados shows both the child's determination and woman's anger.  I especially enjoyed the financee' of Helen's ex.  Her part was priceless and she played it perfectly.
0066620996|1.0|Collins uses a brute force data-sifting method with a team of 21 full time assistants.  But since he doesn't actually conduct any statistical analysis to determine if his observations are real instead of chance or perception, he has generated something that seems filled with classic analysis errors.  Anyone who wants to read this book would be better served by reading any or all of the following:    1) [[ASIN:0470110120 How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of \\"Intangibles\\" in Business]] by Doug Hubbard  2) [[ASIN:0743291255 The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers]] by Phil Rosenzweig   3) [[ASIN:0812975219 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]] by Nassim Nicholas Taleb    The three books listed above enumerate each of the fallacies Collins makes over and over.  In no particular order, here they are:    a)\\"The Lucky Few\\":  Recent statistical analysis of the Red Baron's WWI air victories shows that he was probably more lucky than skilled.  Of the 1,435 companies Collins reviews, the 11 he chose could easily have just been the luckiest out of 1,435.  If this were a coin flipping contest, about 11 out of 1,435 would have won if the goal was to flip 7 heads in a row.  Taleb's whole book is about mistaking luck for competency or insight.    b) The Halo Effect: When we have positive perceptions on some characteristics of a person or thing, we are more likely to interpret new information about other characteristics in a positive way.  Once we select 11 companies out of 1,435 as great, then just about everything they do will be interpreted in the best possible light.  Rosenweig discusses this effect the most (as you might guess from the title) but Hubbard and Taleb also mention aspects of this.    c) Groupthink: Hubbard describes the famous Asch experiment where subjects were asked to participate in a supposed \\"eye exam\\" that was really a test of their group think.  They were told to pick from three lines on a chart the one that was closest in length to a test line.  Everyone picked the correct one when they were the only subject in the room.  But when other \\"subjects\\" (who were in on the experiment) picked the wrong line just before the real test subject, the share of real test subjects who answered correctly dropped.  At one point Asch had the real subject be the sixth person in line after five others picked the same wrong answer in front of them - and only HALF picked the right one.  Collins uses 6,000 magazine and newspaper articles as \\"data\\" for his analysis.  Once a few articles give a comany a good review, it seems that Asch could show it will make future reviews more positive.    d) The Measurement Inversion: Hubbard shows that companies rarely pick the right things to measure and probably never will until they actually start to compute the value of information.  He explains how information has a value that can be computed with some simple formulas.  When he computes the information value of various measurements that companies use, he finds out that the highest value measurements are almost always ignored and the measurements that receive the most attention are among the lowest value measurements (e.g.  companies measure small cost reduction benefits instead of larger revenue increasing benefits of a new investment).  Since measurement is a key input to major decisions, and companies get this all wrong, why do we think their success was do to any particular skill or insight?  The same could even be said of Collins' own research methods.  Unless you was using the methods Hubbard discusses (and the lack of statistics in his book would indicate he didn't), it seems likely that Collins focused on the wrong things to begin with.    Add up these effects and a few more Hubbard and the other authors discuss, and you find that Collins wrote a mostly worthless and arbitrary fluff piece on 11 companies.
0679746048|1.0|I am a big fan of \\"The Bell Jar.\\" When the \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" film was released in 1999 I went to see it. I didn't think there was anything compelling about the Susanna Kaysen character in the least. Other characters WERE compelling: Lisa, Torch and Valerie--but I think that what gave them their spark was a screenplay that had to be written by someone else, and talented actors. Susanna Kaysen was boring as hell. She very well could have offed herself and I wouldn't have cared, BECAUSE her character was not interesting. She was not any more interesting in the novel itself, and the novel really was a bore. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. I marvel at the capacity would-be novelists have to cash in on the \\"let me tell you how nuts I was once\\" story. Nothing in that novel invited me to explore her parallel universe. It was empty and not a temptation in the least. It was so disappointing I am almost angry about it...but then that would make ME crazy, wouldn't it...
B0010V4TZU|2.0|....but after a few months (had this since Sept) the songs grow tiring and tedious. A really fun band that are having a moment, but in the grand scheme of things, the songs lack a bit of heart and don't really have the depth to stand the test of time. Not so much longevity on these ones, but really worth obsessing over for a few weeks.
1401300529|4.0|For those of us who were part of the Korean war (it was never just a police action for us) reliving it by reading The Coldest Winter is a profoundly moving experience. We rarely. if ever, talk about it with anyone for reasons that are somehow too complex to explain easily, but for anyone fortunate not to have been part of it, the book should be must reading. Thoroughly researched and extremely well written, it is an invaluable contribution to our history.
0307387151|5.0|The story of \\"Atonement\\" is beautiful, almost painfully so. I could not put the book down--I was completely enraptured...and cried like a baby. You feel for these characters to the point of forgetting that they are in fact characters. The book is absolutely wonderful. Even though the film adaptation is quite moving, it does not do the novel justice. I most definitely recommend reading.
0767827902|5.0|This is Peter Bogdanovich's Citizen Kane.  He has made films since Last Picture Show, but gradually he faded and was more appreciated as a film critic. Orson Welles had been told by a friend that it was too bad he did the great one first. And so it goes.    Filmed in black and white, the small, crudy Texas town from the early 50's holds secrets that a former resident, Larry McNulty tells in a series or novels. The characters are indeed from McNulty's youth. Either your family hit oil or you lived in dirt.  There's no in-between. The kids, rich and poor, attend the same high school and the football team is everyone's passion.  The boys are real excited about what's under those flouncy dresses. Jacy, the town prom queen-rich girl is testing her sexual powers, driving the poor boys, Tim Bottoms and Jeff Bridges to fistcuffs. She dumps 'em both finally to orgy with her own kind, the newly-rich teens and their mansions in a dust bowl.     Themes of lost love, the wrong man to marry, the excitment and saddness of backseat sexuality, the dirt poor prostitues, and the good old boys collide with emotional deprivation.  Noone is more deprived than Cloris Leachman as the wife of a secretly gay football coach. Tim Bottoms has a May-August affair with the woman.  Her response with the coffee maker  after Tim's very brief marriage to manipulative Jacy is now a well deserved classic you have to see.  They still show that one in acting class.    Ben Johnson sums it up, sitting on a log he talks of lost love, a forgotten time of Texas men and women, fierce and proud, but now blown away in a new age.
B000ZK4466|5.0|One of the most anticipated albums of 2008 in my opinion, The Mars Volta have created an album that will be talked about for this year and many years to come! The Bedlam in Goliath literally blew me to pieces upon first listen and I'm still trying to get myself back together! This is a truly phenomenonal effort! Some of the standouts include: Wax Simulacra, Goliath, Abernikula, Askeipos, and Tourniquet Man. If you haven't bought this album, I strongly suggest you do so now, it might change your life!!!!
B000YENUIG|4.0|We watched this on PPV one night when the kids weren't around. It had us guessing until the end, which these days is a real treat. My wife REALLY likes Viggo and I must admit he is in very good shape for his age and an excellent actor, so we would see anything that he is in. He is very much like Kirk Douglas in his prime, but better. I am not into blood and gore, but they did a really good job with this one -- usually there is way too much for one person to spill and be alive. The scene in the bath house is really good -- don't blink! We may even get the DVD!

It's a nonstop read. I laughed so hard and the characters stay with you long after you put the book down. This is a great book for reluctant readers. The best news, there is a third diary on the way!!!!
0440238609|2.0|Philip Pullman's Trilogy was highly touted as the last great fantasy work of the 20th Century alongside C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I began to read The Golden Compass after having seen the movie, which was well produced. I found the literary quality of Pullman's work poor and would in no way classify this good or great literature. In terms of theme, the fantasy seeks to develop and explore an atheistic worldview. Thus, for example, one of the positive characteristics of Lyra Belacqua, the protagonist, is courage. But in an atheistic framework, this only amounts to self-assertion against all odds and authority. The value of such a work for our children is questionable.

1594481717|5.0|\\"A Whole Right Mind\\"  I truly appreciated \\"A Whole New Mind, Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future \\" Daniel H. Pinks book because it introduced me to information that had never before been broken down and explained to me the way Pink did.  I am a freshman student at Drexel University and read this book for my English class, for an educational read I really enjoyed it. I say go out and buy the book because its information, no matter how simplistic, that is telling the truth about our economical future.    \\"A Whole New Mind\\" by Daniel H. Pink, is about just that developing a whole new mind, that will be better prepared and equipped in taking on the challenges that the new era we are moving into will surely bring. Pink explains that as the U.S. continues to expand, out source, and automate and the more jobs that can be broken down into repeated steps or done cheaper else where, there will be fewer available here to us. He goes on to say that because of this shortage what will be in demand are the more sentimental meanings behind all the material things that we have, because that's what will differentiate a product from its wealth of competitors in this new age. Pink also breaks down the qualities that each hemisphere of our brain comprises, the left hemisphere is the book smart half and the right hemisphere is the design and creativity half. In the new age that Pink demes \\"the conceptual age\\" the right hemisphere will finally be regarded as equal to the previously dominant left hemisphere if not more important. This change is occurring because (in laments terms) the left hemispheres ideas have been overused and abused and there is ultimately nothing left, the right hemisphere however not used or regarded quite as highly will become necessary, because its ideas are much needed in leaving a strictly L-directed era behind us. Overall, what Pink tries to get us to understand is that moving forward we will have to incorporate both our Left and right hemispheres in order to be successful.  In reading the book \\"A Whole New Mind,\\" by Daniel Pink, I couldn't help but feel fulfilled as I read. As I continued to read Pinks book I felt as if I completely understood everything that he described and it all made sense to me. Some books are so intelligent that the concept is too hard to grasp but with Pinks book I felt like I was taking a wealth of knowledge away from it. The Key ideas and information that Pink claims will help me better conquer this \\"conceptual age\\" that I am growing up in, were helpful. Also, he discusses what I will ultimately have to compete in the business world with the three factors Pink describes as taking over the jobs in the U.S.  What I also enjoyed about Pinks book is the portfolio sections that he gives us as a review and a place to reference for ideas on the concepts that he introduces us to in the previous chapter. I appreciate the way he writes as if he is talking directly to us it makes the reader feel more comfortable which I guess leads us right back to the whole point of the book to begin with, that the world is becoming  more about high touch then high info.  What I didn't particularly like about Pinks book was the amount of times he repeated the same idea or concept. Pink referenced the same notion several times and although I saw the connections he tried to make throughout the book by mentioning previous ideas I feel it was a bit overused.

B000UJ48O0|5.0|\\"The O.C.\\" will always live on as a pop culture teen soap that debut when many thought primetime serials and teen dramas were over. Even the creator had no idea if the show would be a hit or miss. Thanks to exceptional writing, a gifted cast, and stunning photography \\"The O.C.\\" will always be one of my favorite shows.<br /> The story starts when a family in Orange County, California adopts a young man ,played beautifully by Benjamin Mackenzie who I think will go on to become a future movie star. The stories are fast paced and involving and you truely care as to what happens to the cast of characters. Although the show was promoted as a teen show there are many wonderful stories involving the older characters.<br /> I recently purchased the entire series boxset and I cannot say enough good things about it. The first season is included in widescreen for the first time, you get a ton of bonus features, and all 92 episodes are included. Warners did a fantastic job in restoring the picture and audio. The boxset comes in book form in the shape of a rectangle with dozens of pictures and neat info on the show. The disc are also put inside the pages safely and are single sided. The set also is encompassed by a see through plastic shell casing that protects the book and discs. Every DVD collector needs to have this set in their collection. It looks stunning!<br /> Welcome to the OC B....!!!
B000IONJH4|3.0|I really wanted to like this in HD. Really. The story of Dune is complex, futuristic and totally fit for an awesome HD experience. Unfortunately sci-fi movies from the 80's not named \\"Star Wars\\" are not typically fit for HD wihtout some major remastering. It is hard to recommend an HD DVD where blue screen clipping is present. Regardless, David Lynch did a great job telling this story. So much so that I can say this is the weirdest big budget sci-fi movie I have ever seen. the HD DVD contains the 2 and a half hour version - unfortunately, no 4-hour version exists.<br /><br /> The picture is less than exceptional - even 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen could not save Dune. The movie is set in the year 10-thousand-someting-or-other. Its really far into the future. There is space travel which is really controlled by \\"the spice\\",mined on the desert planet Arrakis. Giant sandworms exist on Arrakis that threaten the humans (Fremen) and spice miners. These sandworms are essential to the film so selling the effect is crucial to the film. HD DVD exposes every weakness of 1980's miniaturues and blue-screen effects. The scenes with the worms were laughable. Similarly, the ships the characters travel in looked like colorforms placed on a starfield background. I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatres. My friends and I would run around yelling \\"Muad'Dib\\" and pretend to use the futuristitic weapons as portrayed in the movie. I want this movie to work becasue it would help HD DVD sales. Unfortunately the HD DVD video transfer weas horrible and is in need of major post-production effects rework (how about a 5-disc offering like with Blade Runner?).<br /><br />The audio was a sufficient 5.1 mix. Little things that needed to sound pronounced and powerful did - namely, the thumpers used to distract or attract sandworms provided a nice bass tone. Other than that, there was nothing exceptional about the audio track, and that's just too bad.<br /><br />The extras were comprehensive, but nothing extraordinary, just the typical run of the mill info featurettes. While I am on this topic, the menu was generic.<br /><br />Lack of attention to the HD DVD transfer and a lack of features geared towards the cult followign Dune attracts makes it tough to advocate buying this movie. If you can get it as part of a promotion, and you are familar with the story, do it; but you won't convince any friends to go to HD movies with this., just the typical run of the mill info featurettes.

B000Q3648S|3.0|This should be 3.5 stars, but that's not an option.    Daydream Nation is a great album and the deluxe edition was an interesting concept:    Package a live CD of SY playing each song on the album live with the original album.    For SY fanatics I'm sure this is fascinating, but for the more casual listener, most of the Album tracks are preferable.  (SY strikes me as the kind of band that was probably always better in the studio than live)  I will grant that I like Kim Gordon's live vocals on \\"Cross the Breaze\\" better, though I prefer the album versions guitars.  And  \\"Kissability\\" and \\"Eric's Trip\\" sound a little bit more \\"rockin'\\" live ... at the expense of being performed as cleanly.      The real treat on the bonus CD are the four covers:    George Harrison's \\"Within you, without you\\"  Mudhoney's \\"Touch me, I'm sick\\"  Neil Young's \\"Computer Age\\"  Captain Beefheart's \\"Electricity\\"  (And what band BESIDES Sonic Youth and would cover Captain Beefheart?)    If you're just getting into Sonic Youth, I'd just buy the (now quite in-expensive) non-deluxe version and the download the four covers.  If you already own Daydream Nation and aren't an absolute Sonic Youth fanatic, I'd recommend just downloading the covers.

0767805712|4.0|Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is a \\"love child\\" - that is, he was conceived (at some time in the techno-marvel future) without benefit of the genetic engineering utilized by all sensible parents in this New Age. While this engineering cannot transform ordinary DNA into extraordinary DNA, it can eliminate potential genetic flaws, select for sex and appearance, and generally ensure that Baby represents the Best Of Mom And Dad. Vincent's parent's failure to utilize this technology results in a baby who is horribly nearsighted, and who has a serious heart defect that projects a lifespan of only 30 years. This DNA profile places Vincent close to the bottom of the social, economic, and professional scale in the New Age, where opportunity is linked to a great set of genes.  Vincent's chastened parents don't make the same mistake with their second baby, and place their hopes on their younger son, giving Vincent embarrassed, qualified affection, and little in the way of goals, expectations, or hope.    Vincent, however, grows up with more spirit than might be expected, and ultimately refuses to be defined by his genetic profile (hence the not too subtle choice of surname, Freeman).  He dreams of going into space and spends all his spare time studying and acquiring knowledge that might, with a different DNA profile, have allowed him to realize his dreams.    After years of mopping floors and cleaning toilets, Vincent is desperate to obtain a position at an aeronautics company where he can perform work that might bring him closer to his goal.  He decides to become a \\"de-gene-erate\\": someone with a low-value DNA profile who uses a \\"borrowed ladder\\", or a high-quality DNA profile, obtained from the owner of a more fortunate set of chromosomes.    Vincent locates Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), a former Olympic athlete now living in isolation, and confined to a wheelchair after an accident caused by his own drunkenness.  Morrow has a stellar DNA profile that puts him in the 99th percentile of the population. His bitterness over his lost glory and hopeless future persuade him to \\"lend\\" his DNA profile to Vincent.  This transfer requires Vincent, among other things, to have his legs lengthened in painful operations so that he is as tall as Morrow, and to change his appearance in other ways in order to resemble Morrow's photo ID and genetic description as far as possible.  Vincent has to have dental work done, has microscopically fine fingerprint covers made, scrubs off as much of his own body hair and skin cells as possible each day, and carries Jerome's urine around with him, as company employees have to submit to a urine test every day, designed to detect just this kind of deception.  Vincent even puts a few of Jerome's hairs on the comb he keeps in his desk drawer, in case of a routine check.    Finally, with the help of Jerome's \\"ladder\\", Vincent is accepted at the aeronautics company, where his superior work comes in for praise (\\"not one mistake in a million keystrokes\\").  However, complications ensue: Vincent falls in love with a beautiful colleague (his then-wife Uma Thurman) and is faced with the dilemma of whether to tell her what he really is, especially as she seems to suspect something unusual about him from the beginning - she steals a hair from his office comb (fortunately, Jerome's hair) to have tested at a DNA lab.    The crisis that propels the film to its conclusion is a murder at the aeronautics company that brings in the police.  By a fluke of fate, Vincent's younger (and supposedly genetically superior) brother is assigned to work the case with an older officer played by Alan Arkin.  Vincent's brother eventually works out who \\"Jerome\\" really is.  The confrontation between the two, and the younger brother's incredulous disbelief that Vincent has performed such high-level work with such inferior DNA, is sad and gripping.    Vincent has to use all his wits, risking life and limb to protect his new life, his relationship with Thurman, his dreams, and the opportunity he knows he will never have again if his true identity is discovered.    This story of how one man manages to confound the destiny arbitrarily laid out for him is well-acted, well-written, and well-produced.  Hawke is excellent as the determined Vincent, and Jude Law gives a fine performance as the embittered Jerome.  The evolving relationship of the two men, as they share one identity, is at least as interesting as Vincent's relationship with Thurman.    The film is not, however, without narrative issues.  One is that, although we do see Vincent reading up on space travel over time as he grows up, the idea that he steps into a position at the aeronautics company fully prepared to perform his work there, with no previous experience, is a bit far-fetched.  But an even greater issue in this otherwise well-crafted story, is that it never addreseses why Vincent's obvious intelligence doesn't register on his DNA profile, along with his bad heart and weak eyes.  Given the abstruse work Vincent later performs as \\"Jerome Morrow\\", it is not plausible that his intellectual abilities do not also appear in his DNA profile.  Equally implausible is a world obsessed only with physical perfection, but indifferent to intellecutal perfection.  Perhaps the story's creators wanted to sidestep the sticky issue of the role genetics play in intelligence, or do not accept that role; or, perhaps they viewed acknowledging such a role in intelligence as part of the problem the film explores: genetic (read: ethnic/racial) pigeonholing.  Regardless, the omission is glaring, and begs questions that the film fails to answer.    Those issues aside, this is a superior sci-fi, whose warnings are timely in an era when genetic maniuplation is marching inexorably forward, and that asks us to remember that each human being harbors a non-quantifiable mystery of individuality and possibility.

B000002G7E|3.0|I love this album.  It features my favorite two Velvet Underground songs, the title track and \\"I heard her call my name\\".  I also like \\"Here she comes now\\" and both \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" and \\"The gift\\" have a strange appeal, despite also being bizzare.  (\\"The gift\\" is really a musical accompaniment to a short story read by John Cale, \\"Lady Godiva\\" is a song with sections that are just bizarre)  \\"Sister Ray\\" is a good idea drawn out far too long.  All in all, this is the Velvet Underground at their most experimental and most abrasive moment.  It also only has six songs on it and, in terms of song per dollar, I feel cheated.      This album is also a bad choice as your first Velvet Underground album.  All four Albums have a distinct personality.    The Velvet Underground and Nico :  Mellow, Abrasives, Experimental, Conventional, Minimalistic, and extremely raw.    White Light/ White Heat; Very Expiremental and abrassive, mellow only during \\"here she comes now\\"    The Velvet Underground : Very mellow; almost a folk album.      Loaded : The Velvet Underground finally plays traditional rock & roll    If you think you might like VU's experimental, abrasive side then the first album is really the best choice, if you don't like abrasive, poorly produced music then there is some chance you might still like their third or fourth albums.      I think  \\"White Light / White Heat\\"  is an album mainly for people who loved \\"Murder Mystery\\" and the experimental side of \\"The Velvet Underground and Nice\\" so much that they are willing to over-pay for six more songs of that type.  But that won't stop me from complaing about being over-charged.
B000EGCITG|4.0|\\"I'm Not Dead\\" is the followup for \\"M!ssundaztood\\" I've been waiting for since I really can't even consider \\"Try This\\" for anything other than trying to forget it!  I love the edginess and humor in \\"Stupid Girls\\" \\"U + Ur Hand\\" and \\"Cuz I Can\\" and the passion and depth of emotion that comes pouring out of \\"Dear Mr. President\\" \\"Runaway\\" and \\"Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self\\" brought tears to my eyes.  I SO identified with \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" that I wondered when she and I had been talking about it!    P!nk's songwriting skills have improved dramatically and the songs on this album show she is truely someone to watch and enjoy in the upcoming years.
0739321617|1.0|There's not a lot to say about this book. The content is boring and empty. It offers no insights. It misses the single most important factor of Page and Brin's success. AND... the narrator doesn't help; his voice is not only banal and uninspiring - it just plain gets on your nerves! How anyone could choose such a narrator is beyond me! A good narrator can always help to sell even a weak story, but this guy just makes it so much worse. It was really a struggle to listen through it, and I couldn't wait to put it on eBay and sell it. Not only that, the whole thing just sounds like a (very poor) promotional blurb for Google. Disappointing is definitely an understatement. I wanted to give it NO stars - it is really that void of any value - but Amazon forced me to give it one. There are so many good things out there to read and/or listen to. This is not one of them!
B000XA5K48|5.0|Ok, so you think you've seen every action movie cliche that there is.  Odds are that if you watched Arnold, Stallone, and Bruce Willis blow stuff up in the late 80s and early 90s, you were right.  That is, you were right until Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and director Michael Davis got together and decided to make this movie.  The basic plot is pretty straightforward: Owen plays a drifter who happens to have one mean sense of moral outrage and a special knack with firearms of all makes and calibers.  He's minding his own business late one evening until some random pregnant woman stumbles by with a random bad guy in a random 70s Camaro hot on her tail.  Concluding that someone is up to no good, Owen decides to follow the woman--with only a raw carrot for a weapon, mind you--and rescue the poor maiden.  Random violence ensues while Owen proceeds to shoot at least one bad guy a minute for the next hour and a half while protecting the infant from an army of thugs larger than the population of lower Manhattan--all led by Paul Giamatti as a hen-pecked, cold-blooded assassin.  It's Children of Men with a sense of humor.    The violence is graphic and gratuitous, so Shoot 'Em Up is not for the squeemish.  But, neither is it the kind of torture porn that has become so popular with kids and the makers of horror movies.  Instead of the Saw series, think Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam.  It's definitly a guy film to be viewed with your buddies, a case of beer, and pretzels while the wives and children are out of the house.      Suffice to say, I laughed, I cried, I had another beer.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I first heard this band on NPR and was immediately drawn to them.  They have a very interesting, eclectic sound. Definitely worth a listen and a purchase.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Back in 1983, some friends & I headed to Asbury Park, N.J., to the Convention Center to see Marshall Crenshaw & Dave Edmunds on a double bill. Much to our disturbance, we discovered we would have to wait for Crenshaw to come on because there was an unannounced third act opening the show-a band from Texas called Double Trouble ( being unsophisticated Jersey boys, we had no idea what had been going on in Austin.) The group's set commenced with some in the crowd grumbling that they wanted to see Marshall Crenshaw straightaway. Forty minutes later, Stevie Ray Vaughan & his band had finished and the crowd, stirred to utter amazement, would not let them leave. That night I saw a man do things with a guitar with such lightning like bravado, I could not believe what I was seeing or hearing; Bruce Springsteen learned to make a guitar talk, but Stevie Ray had learned to give the six-string swagger. \\"Texas Flood\\" is a testament to what rock&blues swagger should sound like, and to what an enormous talent Stevie Ray Vaughan was and still is in the mind's of guitar afficianados everywhere.<br />From the opening twangs of \\"Love Struck Baby\\" & \\"Pride & Joy,\\" on through to last bonus cut, a live version of \\"Wham!\\" you'll be captivated by the sound & the walk-the-walk style of perhaps the greatest guitar talent ever to come out of Texas. If everything is bigger in the Lonestar State, then that includes the sound of blistering blues guitar, which Stevie Ray proves without a doubt on \\"Texas Flood.\\" This one is a keeper par excellence and one of my favorite guitar albums ever, right next to Jeff Beck's \\"Blow by Blow.\\" No valid rock&blues cd collection can be without this record. It is certainly one of the greatest of its time & its kind.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Across the Universe, like the Lennon song from Let it Be, is about some younger people's experiences as they go through life as adults.  They discover love, enjoyment of place, the desire to take a stand on something important, consequnces of rash decisions, thought-leaders, and harsh individuals who wish to run roughshod over others.    If everyone watched this movie, the world would be a gentler, more understanding place.     The movie is very very good.  Its clever in how it incorporates names and ideas from various Beatles songs, as well as the songs.  Yet, the plot is not predictable. The movie is subtle, e.g.: there are reasonable and tolerant police, and harsh police, etc.   The acting and direction is superb.    After you see this movie, you will want to watch \\"Help!\\", \\"Hard Days Night\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and perhaps even \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\"
B000H2N6GQ|4.0|This gift hooked its' new owner the first time he read it.  Adventure, well written espionage and keeping the attention are just some of his mentions.  Obviously a plot and book to enjoy.
B000H7JCG4|3.0|and i thought it was only Melrose Place that was weak in the beginning.  I'm mid-way through Season 2 right now, and I gotta say: 90210 isn't a very good show yet.  while there are a few Season 1 episodes that hint at entertainment: \\"The First Time\\", \\"Higher Education\\", \\"B.Y.O.B\\", \\"Slumber Party\\", \\"Home Again\\" - for the most part, 90210 hasn't found itself yet...
630469654X|4.0|I had not seen this movie in a long time and was delighted when I had the chance to recently purchase it through Amazon.  It was delivered still in its original wrapping and arrived sooner than expected.  The whole experience was better than I had expected.  The movie itself is not Oscar material, but is still a lovely little movie that is fun to watch.
1555175163|5.0|As somone who knows a little about Chineese traditions, it is amazing to me that such a book exists outside of the Cantonese language.  This book could only have been authored by one who developed a close personal relationship with and is trusted Ip Ching with family stories and history.  Thank-you for getting to know Master Ip Ching and for providing the insight all serious Kung Fu students desire; having a better knowledge of Ip Man and what motiviated him to learn and teach Kung Fu.
0786239212|1.0|I read this book hoping for something that would make me like it. I HATED the entire book and especially the ending!!!! It was too disjointed and the story which started out so well never came to any resolution or gave me a feeling that even with a sad ending it was a satisfying book. It was awful and I won't even go to the movie because everyone who I know who has seen it tells me how awful the story ended and they didn't understand what it was about. Critics are overpaid for their work. Save your money!!!
B0002W4SWC|3.0|I was so excited to see this movie after reading the book.  To me, it was a big let down.  The book was so much better!!!!<br /><br />The movie itself, was kind of funny and had some good parts to it but don't expect it to follow along with the book.  The left a lot of parts out that, in my opinion, should have been in there.  The ending was was way different.  The outcome was still the same it just happened different.  I think I would have enjoyed it much better had I not read the book first.
B000XA5K48|4.0|***1/2 2007. Written and directed by Michael Davis. Without a worthy screenplay, the film is nonetheless an interesting homage to the cinema of John Woo and his colleagues from Hong Kong. So quit the idea of counting how many bullets a gun can shoot and don't try to understand how the mean guys always manage to find Smith and the baby. Such details are not important in this kind of movie. Relax and Enjoy !
B00003CXUM|5.0|As many have said, the cinematography is visually stunning and really sets the mood, akin to a smoky jazz club and you're the only one there, except there are no jazz clubs in the movie and there are actually two people... neither of them you.  These people are Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung.    Some detractors of the movie claim it to be too slow or boring.  Yes, it is a very slow moving piece and if you have a short attention span, you have to take that into consideration.  If you do find that you are afflicted with ADD, try this... absorb the two main characters' acting style, notice the details, see how much they can convey through facial expressions and postures.  That alone can carry the movie, the complex desires of what is not said... or rather what is said verbally but expressed differently.  I'd say Tony and Maggie put on the best performance I've ever seen in any movie.    To those who found it boring and lacking plot, I kindly disagree with you.  While you can watch the movie and get blown over questioning the existence of subtext and symbols (some of which may be nonexistent), wondering what anything means, the movie DOES have a plot.  At the core, it is about two neighbors discovering that their respective husband and wife are having an affair AND how they come to terms with this: the little games they act out in hypothetical confrontations with their spouses, the little scenarios they act out as they puzzle over how a relationship begins, and finally the distractions they put play to put the affair out of their minds.      In particular, you may find it quite interesting and also quite realistic watching them come together by this betrayal and over time, growing fond of each other.  If you are watching this movie for the Big Breakdown or a Dramatic Fight That Clinches Everything, you won't find it here.  But there are many other pieces that can move your heart.  Additionally, the dialog has a poetic cleverness at precise moments, allowing for it to be taken both literally and figuratively.    Quite beautiful.    One thing I thought worked very well for this movie is how ambivalent the ending is.  Unlike Chungking Express where the movie ends on a definitive note or at a definitive point for each character, this movie plays more like real life.  There are no actual 'endings' and there's always the potential for great joy or missed opportunity.  If you didn't like this movie the first time around, give it another go with some patience.  Admittedly, the first time I watched it I wasn't 'in the mood for love' and had to set it aside.  Subsequent viewings have led to a deeper appreciation.  Make sure you are inclined to be receptive.    Good luck!
B00004ZB9D|1.0|MTV has been a two edged sword for the music industry.    On one hand, it has been a great way to break new music to the masses,on the other hand it has parlayed superficiality over substance to heights unimagined.    Lenny is the poster boy for what is wrong the music industry:  a soulless, contrived product,aimed at a demographic anxious to learn what is hip because MTV said so!    Well,there are two things Lenny ain't : hip and Hendrix.    He doesn't write much of his stuff, and tends to do cover tunes that are right up there with Pat Boone.    Listen to covers of Princes' Kiss by Tom Jones and LK.    It' amazing, that a 68 year old Welsh white man has so much more soul and feeling when doing that song.    It's surprising that Prince hasn't called up Lenny and asked him to pull that song from his repertoire.    But then again,royalties is royalties.    Lenny should stick to selling tight jeans and sunglasses,because making music ain't his strong point.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is real comic genius from the minds of Trey Parker & Matt Stone. Great Puppet work, great sets, great songs...awesome comedy!    This is satire at it's best!
0790732203|5.0|For those of us who grew up and were in high school in the 80's, especially the early 80's I think this is a great movie. Tom Cruise is great as Joel Goodsen, he projects the kind of innocence that I think a lot of us who grew up in the burbs in the 80's had. That time was kind of a throwback, although there was a little drug use such as the pot in the movie, I think the drug culture was not as big as in the mid 60's and 70's. AIDS had still not hit yet. Reagan was king and most kids were nice kids trying to do good in school, please their parents, and set themselves up for a productive future, as Joel in the movie. The story is good, although a little unbeleivable, as a small mistake Joel makes becomes a huge problem. Mainly it reminds me a lot of guys I went to high school with, the clothes we wore, having to ride a bike around instead of driving. All the stuff high school kids in the 80's did and had. It is a great movie and a classic from the era.
B000ZK4466|3.0|I would give this album THREE stars instead of four because I think it's a step backwards for these guys. Most fans seem to like the more concise and shorter songs (a la Deloused) but I prefer the work on Francis the Mute and Amputecture (hugely underrated) and thus the things that this album lacks (extended jams, slower moments, more expressive solos, etc) were what I considered the band's strong points. I also think that the Latin and fusion jazz influences on this album are spread far thinner than it has been on the previous two releases - this is also a downside for me. I enjoy the album, but it's probably one of my least favorite records of theirs. I would rank them: 1. FTM, 2. AMP, 3. Deloused, 4. Bedlam, 5. Tremulant.    Bedlam is exactly what the title suggests. It's a constant onslaught of fast and furious (and often atonal) music. I typically love this kind of stuff - it's all I listen to - but this album bores me. That's the honest truth. I also find the new drummer ruins the sound of the band. He's extremely talented of course, but his playing sounds like an inundation of speedy fill after speedy fill ad infinitum. There's nothing overly creative about his complexity. Also, what happened to the great bass playing that pervaded Amputecture?    I've listened to this record through six times now so I feel as if I have a fairly good grasp on my opinion of it. The Mars Volta are an incredible band - probably the best rock/prog band out there right now in my opinion - so it's with disappointment that I find this record sub-par for them.    Of course the argument against my claims is that 'the band is constantly evolving', well, in my opinion (as I stated at the beginning) this marks a devolution for The Mars Volta. They still rock, and this album is good, but it's certainly not great.    Look - if you're a Mars Volta fan you already own this album. But if this review accomplishes anything let it be this: If you are new to the band, don't start here; start withFrancis the Mute.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I didn't hear about this band until today. I saw the CD at Target and skipped over it because I had no idea who they were. Then as I was watching E! News, I heard a review of the album and how Chris Martin of Coldplay fame was a big fan. I thought, how could I go wrong? After listening to the samples of the songs on this site, I went back out to by it just before Target closed. After listening to the first few tracks, I feel this band could really go somewhere if they can get any airplay on the independent stations around the country. The CD seems to be fairly short though, so get it while it is still under $10. I can't wait to see where this band goes!!!!!!!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! It was much more entertaining than I expected. Great live concert footage of them in Pompeii, and amazing footage of them in Abbey Road studios working on Dark Side of the Moon. Lots of fun interviews too. If you like Pink Floyd, you will like this DVD.
B00005JL3A|5.0|\\"Resident Evil\\" is a great science fiction/horror hybrid.  The plot, a virus released from a laboratory, is frightening and plausible.  A beautiful cast, led by a multi-talented Milla Jovovich, comprises a group of paramilitary commandoes who find themselves trapped miles beneath the earth's surface in a secret laboratory where illegal genetic experiments are being conducted by the Umbrella Corporation.  It is a \\"who-will-live-who-will-die\\" action adventure.  Flesh-eating zombies are not usually my cup of tea but this movie makes them very plausible.  The Red Queen computer is chilling, especially when her voice and hologram are that of a child issuing threats such as \\"You're All Going to Die Down Here!\\"  With the advent of avian flu, the movie's T-virus has frightening possibilities.  Thus, the movie remains current and fresh.  It is reminiscent of \\"The Stand,\\" \\"Rabid,\\" \\"The Crazies,\\" and other out-of-control virus movies.  Favorite scene:  When the Red Queen traps four commandoes in a glass corridor and dispatches them with lasers that slice and dice.  A must have for all fans of science fiction/horror.  \\"Resident Evil\\" is followed by two strong sequels.
1594489505|5.0|The book is \\"Calm - A Proven Four Step Process Designed Specifically for Women Who Worry\\" by Denise Marek. Ok why would I read it with a title like that? I don't consider myself to be a worrier. Denise is my friend and she sent it to me.<br /><br />The book is well written, simple, fast to read and well organized. It would be a positive pick me up book but has enough depth to still add value.<br /><br />She uses the word CALM as an acronym for \\"Challenge your assumptions\\", \\"Act to control the controlable\\", \\"Let go of the uncontrolable\\", and \\"Master your mind\\".<br /><br />One of the great quotes in the book was \\"The times in your life you will regret are not the times when you looked foolish, they are the times when you took no action at all\\".<br /><br />Like me, she also uses the word yet. I do not yet speak Italian. I do not yet play polo etc. As opposed to I don's speak Italian.<br /><br />Denise used highly personal examples that personalized the book. (I find women often do that better than men).<br /><br />Awesome book. Highly recommended! Good work Denise
0767834739|5.0|In \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse,\\" Milla Jovovitch once again stars as the renegade security agent from the Umbrella Corporation.  This time around, we know her name - Alice.  In \\"Apocalypse,\\" the deadly T-virus has escaped from the underground laboratory known as the Hive and threatens to destroy an entire metropolis, Raccoon City.  Alice has been injected with the T-virus and has become a mutated super hero.  She leads a handful of survivors in search of a scientist's lost daughter.  The scientist has promised to airlift them to safety before a nuclear bomb destroys Raccoon City.  Like the original \\"Resident Evil,\\" this sequel is a science fiction/horror hybrid with non-stop action.  Instead of an underground lab, an entire city has been infected with the T-virus.  There are a thousand more zombies, killer dobermans, and hideoulsy mutated creatures that must be fought by a gorgeous cast of young actors/actresses.  A powerful rock-n-roll score accentuates the numerous action sequences.  While watching this movie, Euro horror fans will think of Lamberto Bava's \\"Demons\\" and \\"Demons 2\\" in which everyone is turning into hideous demons in lieu of zombies.  Favorite scene in \\"Apocalypse:\\"  When Alice crashes her motorcycle through a church's stained glass windown and battles the mutated creatures.  A very strong sequel that rivals the original, \\"Apocalypse\\" is an apocalyptic disaster movie.  If you own the original, you must own \\"Apocalypse.\\"
0439813786|5.0|read an awesome book on strategy by Seth Godin on the flight here called \\"Small is the New Big and 183 other riffs, rants and remarkable business ideas\\".<br /><br />I seem to be drawn to strategy books lately. Strategy is what I am thinking about. Being in a low margin business makes me think.<br /><br />Seth's challenge is to be truly unique, edgy, new, add value. He give many examples of companies who have done this. Part of what he pushed is the next big idea. I like that but also know ideas are cheap, excellent implementation is what is difficult. I am a big believer in acting small but being big. Take the best from both worlds.<br /><br />Seth's challenge on CEO blogs are they need to offer at least 4 of the following 6:<br /><br />Candor<br />Urgency<br />Timeliness<br />Pithiness<br />Controversy<br />Utility<br /><br />To that, I would consider adding humour. People never mind that.<br /><br />Thinking about how I stack up...<br /><br />I loved his comments on lawns. Why have a lawn? Just because everyone else does. Of course those who know me well know I have no lawn and grow strawberries, squash, potatoes etc on the \\"front lawn\\". Probably drives the chemlawn neighbours crazy. Just FYI, this is definitely not a time saver. It takes more work to care for a garden.<br /><br />Overall - an excellent highly recommended read.

B0011BGY66|5.0|Vampire Weekend (VW) offer a stunningly solid and modest debut album.  They spring some great melodies and harmonies on top of bouncing bass lines, grooving percussion, tastefully sparse guitar riffs, and impeccable keyboard work.  If any fault is to be pointed out, it would be that the drumming falls a bit short at times in its sloppiness, but this in no way detracts from the overall greatness of the album. VW is a fresh injection into the indie music scene and have just released what will easily stand to be one of 2008's best albums.  Stand out tracks include 1) Mansard Roof, 2) A-Punk, 4) Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa, 5) M79, and 9) I Stand Corrected.  Rating = 4.73 out of 5

B0010OMXKA|5.0|Even though this is a CD DVD set the real deal is the DVD, its a full length concert, Bocelli's record company releases these concerts as a DVD CD set and a CD DVD set, the only difference is size of packaging, This is the smaller CD size packaging.

1594481717|5.0|Play harder, appreciate, laugh louder, Love often, do more, think deeper, push your creativity to the limits and once you think you can do more... sit down and reflect about what you had just done. A book worth all the praise and adoration for aiding today's generation, \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers will Rule the Future\\" by Daniel Pink depicts the positive effects of honing a holistic mind in the 21st century.          As a Nursing/Pre-med major in Drexel University, having read this book has opened my eyes to the things that I need to fix in my life if I am to pursue a successful career in the health field. Pink's main focus in the book is to use your brain as a whole, in order to approach situations in a more well-informed manner. For me, that meant looking at patients as people, and not just another person with an illness. For example, one of Pink's main arguments was to infuse empathy, play and meaning more into one's life. Why empathy? Basically, we need to care more. Why play? America has grown so obsessed with winning and being the best, we need to relax and enjoy life more. Why meaning? We search and search to find someone or something to dedicate our lives too... yet why can't we seem to find it? In his book, Pink goes into much greater detail depicting the faults of the way we think and how we can improve it...         But that's just the beginning of the magic of Pink's book! While I only mentioned three of his six `high-sense, high-touch' abilities, at the end of each chapter, Pink provides various mechanisms in order for one to improve his way of thinking! Like I said, the enchantment of this book stems not from his writing, but from what one can learn and internalize in his or her life. I urge anyone interested in reinventing their mind to check out this book, and be prepared to be transformed into a Whole New Mind.
B000F4MLZ8|4.0|This CD would have earned five starts from me were it not for a single imperfection that is so glaring and disturbing to me that it merits a demotion in rank.  To some who read this review, it may be something trivial and won't affect your decision to purchase this disc in the least; but for me, I've got to say something about it.    First off, though, let me tell you that this CD is phenomenal.  The sound is unique, beautiful, crystal clear, just outstanding.  The songwriting, though a bit fragmented and sometimes confusing, is interesting enough that it evokes emotion lyrically.  Though he's no Paul Simon lyrically, his vocal style, or perhaps his execution, reminds me a bit of Simon in that he sings in such a soft, contemplative tone that Simon often employed in his more folky moments.    Nevertheless, I think that and the finger-pick guitar style is where the similarities end.  Mr. Radin has, in my opinion, created a very unique approach to this type of songwriting.  It's a sound, quite frankly, that you can get lost in, something to listen to in order to melt away the day.    Which brings me, I'm afraid, to this glaring complaint of mine.  The first time I listened to this disc I pop it in and the interesting Sundrenched World winds its way from my speakers to my ears.  I can't say this is my favorite song as I've heard a few Joshua Radin songs, or parts of them, before on soundtracks, etc.  Nevertheless I am enthralled and am enjoying the whole experience.  And, suddenly, as if arbitrarily, I am met with profanity in one of the latter verses.  This was very disappointing and disconcerting and completely ruined the experience of the first-time listen.  It's the sonic equivolent to leaning back in a comfy chair, taking that deep, cleansing breath of relaxation, and then suddenly getting punched in the face for no reason.  Would you lean back again in that comfy chair?  I think not!    And that is my biggest -- and only real complaint -- about this CD.  Now I know, some if not most of you are scoffing right now at the whole idea of it all, writing a review complaining about the use of the F-word in a song.  But the question to Mr. Radin is, why use it?  I wonder if he thinks this gives him some sort of street cred or edginess.  If that is the case, it's a poor exchange for good taste and good songwriting.  A man curses because he cannot find the words to say what is on his mind.  Do you see?  It's not just that it's immoral and irresponsible, and it is, but it's also stupid and shallow and easy.  It's a cop-out, and as a songwriter and lyricist myself I know the value of a well-spoken word.    The shame of it all is that Sundrenched World seemed to be a rather interesting song, but I will never listen to it again, so I'm robbed of a perfect disc and a perfect listening experience because everytime I listen to this disc now I have to fast-forward to track 2.  A minor inconvenience for a certainty, but a tragically unnecessary one, too.    As I've indicated, other than this complaint, We Were Here offers an extraordinarily good listen.  My favorites include Star Mile, Closer and Winter.  But all the songs are very good.  I think the electronic programming in Only You, the final track, is superfluous, but doesn't ruin the song.  Other than that, this CD is well worth the money.    Joshua Radin is at the beginning of his career.  There are several paths he can choose to follow.  I hope he chooses one that is uplifting and inspiring.  If he does, then I am most certainly waiting in anticipation to hear more from this exciting new artist.
B000ZK4466|5.0|only time will tell, but this might be the best mars volta album yet    01 Aberinkula 7/10: besides the high pitched chorus, this is a great opener that wastes no time, and is a good transition to metatron.  02 Metatron 8/10: has a great chorus and energy, the fan fave of the album it seems.  03 Ilyena 8/10: a very distinctive track with a little slower and more emotional tone.  04 Wax Simulacra 9/10: the two minute, drum pounding single that should get some radio airplay.  05 Goliath 8/10: a decent rework of another song, now including a jam session at the end that deserves a 10.  06 Tourniquet Man 6/10: kind of a filler track.  07 Cavalettas 9/10: prog kind of track with great transitions that definitely takes a few listens.  08 Agadez 10/10: the best track on the album...perfect bassline and amazing groove section in the middle.  09 Askepios 8/10: strange track which picks up at the end.  10 Ouroborous 10/10: the catchiest song, which blew me away from the start.  condense it and you have a great radio single.  11 Soothsayer 9/10: a very haunting track with great sound samples.  12 Conjugal Burns 9/10: a great closer for the album with probably the best vocals of any track.
1400063515|4.0|I have a lot of respect for Taleb having read his first book Fooled by Randomness (2001) to which I gave an enthusiastic, if critical, review.  But this book is so self-indulgent and so breezily written that I just want to throw up my hands and say, \\"Get an editor that has the ability to edit you!\\"<br /><br />What has happened--and this happens frequently--is that Professor Taleb, still basking in the success of Fooled by Randomness, has gotten so arrogant that he believes he can just write what comes into his head and presto! it's a work of art and erudition, and so obviously a fine guide to right thinking that we should all applaud.  Because of his prior success his editor spares the blue pencil even though Taleb is verbose, repetitive and digressive to the point of exasperation, and seemingly unaware that some of his pearls of wisdom are pinto beans.  The irony is that this book's sales will easily exceed those of Fooled by Randomness, and his editors and publishers will think this is a better book when it is not.<br /><br />I think what he was trying to achieve is a style that he credits to one of his heroes, Henri Poincare.  Taleb eulogizes, \\"The grand master wrote these wonders as serialized articles and composed them like extemporaneous speeches. As in every masterpiece, you see a mixture of repetitions, digressions, everything a 'me too' editor with a prepackaged mind would condemn--but these make his text even more readable owing to an iron consistency of thought.\\" (p. 174)<br /><br />I think in Taleb's case it is an iron redundancy.  But then on the other hand I found in his unorthodox expression ideas that wondrously tense the mind and make for an interesting read, so that on balance I have to say the book is definitely worth reading.<br /><br />In my review of Fooled by Randomness I wrote:<br /><br />\\"The central image of this interesting, erudite and somewhat self-indulgent book is the \\"black swan,\\" a metaphor for both the rare event that eventually will happen, and for the fact that you can't prove a negative (the problem of induction) because no matter how many white swans you count, you do not prove that the next one won't be black.\\"<br /><br />Well, I could write exactly the same thing in a review of this book.  The Black Swan is an elaboration on his previous book.  What is different about this book is the number of (fictional) stories he uses to make his points.  This is somewhat ironic since he dismisses what he calls the \\"narrative fallacy.\\"  (But I'm sure the nimble Dr. Taleb has an explanation.)  This book has more characters than some Russian novels including Fat Tony, Nero, the author himself (\\"NNT\\"), Casanova, \\"Yevgenia Krasnova\\" (who apparently exists but not by that name), the nerdish \\"Dr. John,\\" etc.<br /><br />A notable addition is his notion of \\"Mediocristan\\" and \\"Extremistan.\\"  The former is a fairly predictable place.  Two examples are casino games and human life expectancies. There is no possibility of black swans.  In Extremistan, however, where there exist stock markets, politics/war and other highly complex real world entities, black swans are always lurking, ready to fly into your face with complete capriciousness.<br /><br />Some high (or low) lights:<br /><br />On page 155 Taleb claims that the \\"practitioners of something called game theory...are no better at predicting than university students.\\"  No doubt he has some reference in mind, but I couldn't find it in the endnotes--which brings me to another problem, the endnotes themselves.  They are in a bizarre form without page or text reference.  They are arranged by chapters, but there is no way to tell which page the note refers to.  Taleb explains \\"I separate topics thematically; so general references will mostly be found in the chapter in which they first occur.  I prefer to use a logical sequence here rather than stick to chapter division.\\"  But what I think happened is that he just didn't bother to keep track of his references and when he was told by his publishers that he needed them, he came up with this dodge.  Annoying.<br /><br />A nice take on complexity is this billiard ball example from page 178: The first impact is fairly easy to access with enough information about the balls, the table, the force of the cue ball, etc.  The second is more difficult, but \\"to correctly compute the ninth impact, you need to take into account the gravitational pull of someone standing next to the table.\\" (!)<br /><br />Taleb sees \\"nerd knowledge\\" or the overestimation of our understanding as a disease \\"severely ingrained in our institutions.  It is why I fear governments and large corporations--it is hard to distinguish between them.\\" (p. 180)<br /><br />\\"...[L]anguages grow organically; grammar is something people without anything more exciting to do in their lives codify into a book.\\"  (p. 182)<br /><br />Perhaps part of the genius of Taleb's intent is to write wildly while insulting lots of people, especially anyone wearing a suit or having a corporate address, and especially anyone working on Wall Street.  This way you invite not just book chat comment but the slings and arrows of outrageous indignation and affrontiveness.  People write nasty reviews, people become incensed, Taleb replies in kind, etc., and the sales totals rise and book biz execs take notice.<br /><br />An addendum on induction: the reason we cannot put black swans neatly into the bell shape curve that Taleb so rails against or assign a probability to their occurrence is that we don't know the denominator.  We know for example that a certain event--say a 10k-wide or bigger meteor hitting the earth--is very rare, the last one perhaps hit the earth 65 million years ago.  So we know the numerator (a small number, maybe even only 1), but we have no idea what the universe of possibilities might be.  The denominator is obviously a large number, but HOW large?

0140120416|5.0|I have studied on my own at various levels of seriousness 6 languages in my life, (some to the extent of becoming fully fluent, some becoming basically conversational, and some starting and giving up out of disinterest or dislike for the language in general) and amid the many books I've used for all the languages, I found this book to be the best book for any independent foreign language learner (i.e. not in a university or other language class).  Not just for Russian - which this book happens to cover - but any book.  The reasons, below:    - reasonbly compact chapters with specific points to be learned in a logical order  - starts with basic grammar, and expands very methodically upon the fundamentals, gradually progressing to A-level Russian  - no \\"travel talk\\" - all texts and exercises are normal, everyday (and progressively harder and \\"bookish\\") rather than \\"hotel/airport/taxi\\" topics  - very clear explanations of all grammar, at basic as well as obscure levels (and the author tells which points are not so crucial and may be skipped if one wishes to do so - he even does this for an entire chapter on the vagaries of Russian numbers, counting and mathematics)  - compact in size - can be taken anywhere, and densely packed with vocabulary and grammar - this is no amateur book  - grammar terms are explained very well, and examples given very clearly  - good texture of pages and very readable print; no clutter; fonts used are very soft on the eyes and bold (mainly Russian words) are well-highlighted against the slightly tan-tinged, off-white pages - not overly-contrasty as with pure-white linen-colored pages  - texts vary from being short and to the point, to longer and more literary, providing variety and a chance to move at a good pace  - again, a very logical progression from basic nouns, verbs, then cases, endings, etc. through tenses, \\"bookish\\" style, etc. to cover nearly all the points one might encounter in Russian grammar  - an unbelievable price for all this- $20 retail, $12 or so on Amazon - worth many times that in terms of content    The downsides?    - no audio tapes - as others have noted, there is no way to know the correct pronunciation unless you supplement it with another series (Teach Yourself, Routledge, etc.) which have dialogues recorded and transcribed  - there are plenty of exercises for each grammar point but most are pretty brief; need to supplement with Teach Yourself's \\"Russian Grammar\\" or Terence Wade's grammar workbook  - later chapters have rather long vocabulary lists - probably difficult to master all of the vocabulary at once for one chapter, unless one works on a chapter a week or so; takes time to master this moreso than the grammar itself  - not much use of the often difficult-to-read italic Russian font (found in some other college-related texts) or handwriting (again, not much to say on this but one or two examples would be a nice addition, perhaps the text of a handwritten letter as one chapter addition)  - I always think the cover photo is so odd - hardly a good shot of St. Basil's on Red Square, taken wide-angle and appearing far off, with the inexplicable marching soldiers and an old Coke billboard (long gone now, I hear) in the forefront - the attempt to juxtapose the various elements of modern and old Russia are negated by the poor photo angle and distracting elements (lamppost, old-ish cars, large boring sidewalk dominating the foreground, etc.) - I know this is hardly a reason to complain about the book, but this mundane shot doesn't get one excited about a Russia visit each time one picks up the book to study; perhaps a snow-covered Orthodox church in the countryside or a nightscape of St. Petersburg, as cliched as those scenes are, would be more attractive and sell the book (also - can't translate what's on that billboard, even after studying the book!  Something about \\"Coca Cola - always better with... [something]...\\" - can anyone help??)    Otherwise, the best language textbook that I have ever used.  Highly recommended above all others.

The t-virus has spread all over the earth, infecting most of the world's population.<br /><br />The thing I liked most about this movie when comparing it to parts 1 and 2 is the apocalytic theme. In parts 1 and 2 the virus had not caused such a widespread pandemic yet. In Extinction, the whole planet is affected.<br /><br />I do feel that the story could have been a little better, but the visual effects and battle scenes were very good.
0345455681|4.0|If you happen to like hauling around 1000+ page books with you for weeks, you'll love this one! Although not in the same league as Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\", this is a nice book for Follett fans who are suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms after finishing those two great novels.<br /><br />I probably could have done without the first 200 pages, I really didn't need to know how the White Cliffs of Dover were formed to lead into the rest of the book, but once I got past the first several centuries, the book became much more interesting. It also took a while for me to feel connection with the characters.<br /><br />Rutherfurd covers far more actual history than Follett, I found myself spending a lot of time Googling specific historical events as I read along. This book is taking me a long time to read because I wanted to see what the Tower of London looked like, I wanted to read more about London Bridge, I even rented several DVDs that coincided with the time period in the book to get a feel of the culture, costumes and setting as I read. I don't believe any book has ever \\"engaged\\" me to this degree. I certainly wouldn't consider myself a history geek, so it is a pleasant surprise that I am truly enjoying learning so much about British history.<br /><br />I am looking forward to finally finishing \\"London\\" (about 100 pages to go) and reading some of the other epics by Rutherfurd. After all, I've built up such great arm muscles already!

0486424510|4.0|From the outset, Wilkie Collins's 1868 \\"sensation novel\\" keeps the reader entertained and engaged as a priceless yellow diamond, stolen from a Hindu religious statue of the Moon God in India in 1799, works its black magic and controls the action.  Rachel Verinder, heir of Colonel John Herncastle, who murdered to obtain the jewel during the battle of Seringapatam, inherits this possibly cursed treasure on her eighteenth birthday in 1848, only to have it vanish before she can put it into the bank.  Drawing on sensational details--three Indian \\"jugglers\\" who approach the house to perform a juggling act, the disappearance of the jewel from an Indian cabinet during the night, the certainty that the theft was an inside job, a housemaid with a criminal past, and a paint smudge on night clothing--Collins creates a haunting atmosphere and builds suspense.<br /><br />Telling the story is Gabriel Betteredge, the house steward, a man who has been asked to set down his recollections by Franklin Blake, who was present in the house at the time of the jewel's disappearance, and who is in love with Rachel Verinder.  Betteredge is a delightful story-teller, providing details, humor, and suggestions about what happened with a conscientiousness that makes him a reliable narrator.  As the story becomes more involved and the characters take on lives of their own, other narrators take up the story where Betteredge leaves off and provide new information.<br /><br />The second narrator, Miss Drusilla Clack, Rachel Verinder's cousin, is a \\"poor relation\\" who is also a religious fanatic, and her commentary and her behavior provide some of the funniest moments in Victorian literature.  Collins's use of humor, in fact, is one of the ways in which he surpasses his friend, Charles Dickens, in keeping an audience entertained.  Franklin Blake, rejected by Rachel, provides additional commentary about the events, as do a doctor and his assistant, a local police sergeant and his investigator, the family lawyer, and a traveler to India.  The use of multiple points of view is one of the great advances Collins makes in the history of the novel.  The fact that this is widely regarded as the first of the great mystery novels (though not dependent on a single detective) is another plus.<br /><br />Overall, the novel is surprisingly modern in its ability to appeal to a wide audience. Collins is adept at manipulating his readership and in keeping suspense high.  His characters are often engaging and frequently humorous, and in its ability to deal with social issues of the day, the novel provides pertinent commentary about colonialism, religious fanaticism, and class issues.  Collins never forgets, however, that he is writing to entertain, and in this he succeeds admirably.  n  Mary Whipple<br /><br />[[ASIN:0141020318 The Woman in White (musical tie-in) (Penguin Summer Classics)]]traveler to India.

B00005JPAO|4.0|It would be fair to say that I am not terribly interested in the English royal family and their follies in spite of living here. Having my own Queen and little time for gossip, it does not interest me sufficiently to pursue knowledge about them.<br />But I must admit that this was a super film. The insight that it affords into the workings of the royals, and people in general, the way they deal with things, their relationships with their own and others really fascinated me. It is such a different world, a different experience to anyone and anything else out there, yet in some ways I felt I could still connect with at least some of the characters on a human level. Additionally, it brought back some memories of that beautiful hot summer of '97.<br />A must see, but keep in mind, the English royal family is not England, and not representative of its people.
0679420266|5.0|Albert Camus superbly takes us through the thoughts of a Godless heathen; A Nihilist.  The author shows us the husk of a man.  A hollow being who cares for nothing except his selfish desires.  Our protagonist (and I use that label lightly) does not love his mother, whom he just days ago buried.  Does not care, and looks on as his acquaintance beats his ex-girlfriend.  He also does not care of the consequences or immorality of roaming the beach in search of someone to kill.  He is mildly interested in sex.  However, the woman whom he shares a bed with is viewed only as a means to the eventual end of satisfy his base needs.  The main character is naive, loathsome individual whom everyone who reads this book should take great strength and pains never to be.

From the first album, Talking Book, to this latest, Stay, I didn't think it could get any better.  I love watching this DVD.  It's one thing to listen to the CD but it's an unbelievable experience watching Mick sing.  It seems so effortless and he truly enjoys what he does, it's so obvious.  That voice, that sound that comes out of him is a Godsend.  I can't even imagine what it must feel like to be able to sing like that, to entertain like that.  He has to be the luckiest man alive.  If you like Simply Red you'll love this DVD.  Get it now while you still can before Simply Red are no more.  I'm actually looking forward to what he does on his own.  I'm sure he will continue to mesmerize us for years to come.  ALL HAIL MICK HUCKNALL AND SIMPLY RED!

B00117C2UM|5.0|Take my advice- if you are at all a fan of music, click \\"buy it now\\" and switch from reading reviews of this work of art to experiencing it. This album is in my opinion an extension of their previous full-length work, [[ASIN:B000IJ7MCC Gulag Orkestar]], in that it contains very little synthesized layers. Comparatively, the [[ASIN:B000KQF70M Lon Gisland]] EP goes more the electronica route with great effect.     My only complaint after several listens is that the violin parts at times clash with the mood & style of the music. Most noticeably this happens on the track \\"In the Mausoleum\\", where the violin part reeks of vintage Annie Lennox. Some of the violin fills in other songs smell of the same stylings as well. As you can probably tell, I'm not a fan of the choice of violinist. Other songs and on other albums, the violin fits into the overall theme well.    Differences from Gulag Orkestar seem to be mostly in mood-- this album is a slight bit more brooding and slow. It is a little more mature in the composition as well.    If you have not seen the video series (one video per song) on youtube yet, you must. It is another facet of the musical revolution that is Beirut, and is essential to the experience of The Flying Club Cup. Just search for \\"flyingclubcup\\" and enjoy.

B00130VASW|4.0|Like all the Mars Volta albums, this is a masterpiece of layers of chaotic guitar-heavy rock. I am awarding it 4 stars because while it's very good, I don't sense very much true progression from their previous albums-- they have found a formula and seem to be conservative with it. I tend to prefer similarly visionary bands but with a need to break the mold every album or 2, such as Faith No More or The Flaming Lips.    This is a must have for Mars Volta fans (of course), but an optional buy for those attracted to previous albums who may tend to get worn out or bored with this style- because ultimately it's more of the same.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I needed more light than it was available from the camera's built-in flash and I also wanted to be able to bounce the light.     Initially I considered buying a SB-600 flash for my Nikon DSLR, but after some research on internet SB-400 looked as a good alternative.  A few days ago I bought it and the results so far are amazing: it is small, powerful enough, it can be tilted horizontally, and has all the benefits offered by Nikon's excellent i-TTL.    This amazing flash has two shortcomings: it cannot be tilted laterally, and does not have wireless control. But they are more than balanced by the qualities listed above and by its price. And, not to be overlooked, because the flash it's so small you can take it with you everywhere.    Just a final note: while it's working with any camera with a flash connection, its best results (i-TTL) are possible only with a Nikon DSLR (and some Fujifilm cameras).

I'm slogging through the book which is very over written. I think I'm at pg. 47 and something is finally beginning to happen, but I find it very hard to pick up the book each time.    You just look at the state of the world today: Kenya hacking hundreds of people to death over a political result that may not end for decades,African genocides that have become national pastimes, terrorists,etc, ad nauseum!

In fact, it did represent a somewhat tighter story and the protagonist Elijah Baley acted a lot less stupidly than he had in the first novel, but all in all I found the book to be even less satisfactory than the first.<br /><br />The problems with this book are numerous.  One of the more serious difficulties is that Asimov took what was the most interesting part of the CAVES OF STEEL -- the cooperation between Baley and his robot partner Daneel Olivaw and largely ignored it.  Daneel plays a relatively minor role in the book, Baley, who is all in all a pretty dull bird, taking center stage.  As in the first novel, Baley isn't much of a detective.  His literary predecessors are not the Continental OP, Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, and Lew Archer, but Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.  For some bizarre reason Asimov made the decision to follow the example of detective writers whose sleuths operated more by instinct and love to employ the technique of assembling all the key suspects before making his climatic announcement as to whodunit.  As detective fiction, it is just horrible.  Worst of all, Asimov violates one of the canons of such fiction:  he withholds key facts, making it impossible for the reader to solve the crime ahead of time.<br /><br />In addition to failing in developing his characters and engaging in a literarily inferior form of detective fiction, Asimov's book is flawed by absolutely absurd assumptions about possible forms of human existence.  Now, in fairness to Asimov, he wrote at a time when the insane theories of B. F. Skinner (who attempted to raise his own daughter in a box) still held current.  So in fact Asimov might just be judged a victim of his time.  But even before the publication of THE NAKED SUN Harry Harlow (in a series of rather monstrous experiments involving rhesus monkeys and \\"monster mothers\\") proved how profoundly primates yearned for human contact.  Asimov imagines what is not merely a different form of human culture, but one that is impossible, since it cuts so deeply at what is most fundamental to human nature, namely that we are deeply social creatures for whom physical and social interaction is crucial.  Asimov tries his best to make conceivable a world on which people avoid being physically present to other people, but it simply is too silly.  Sure, we could suspend our disbelief, but only at the cost of suspending all critical interaction with the text.<br /><br />Added on top of all this is the fact that Asimov is simply not a very good writer.  His prose is drab at best and in writing about characters he tends to default to extremely trite expressions.  Someone says something to Baley and his reaction is to clinch his fists.  It not only isn't very gifted writing, it reinforces a sense of superficiality running through the book.<br /><br />I've now in the past month read the first three novels I've ever read by Isaac Asimov.  So far I'm baffled.  I know that he is extremely famous and that he was a pioneer in many ways, but while I've found enormous pleasure in many early SF writers like Henry Kuttner, C. L. Moore, Robert Heinlein, Hal Clement, Poul Anderson, Frederick Pohl, and a host of others, I honestly have found virtually nothing of value in Asimov's books.  I'm not giving up yet.  I'm currently trying to work through all the major books dealing with robots, cyborgs, and other forms of artificial people.  I will next finish THE ROBOTS OF DAWN and ROBOTS AND EMPIRE, in addition to finishing the last couple of stories in I, ROBOT.  Perhaps my opinion of Asimov will change.  But I can state with some confidence that CAVES OF STEEL and THE NAKED SUN are simply not very good books.primates yearned for human contact.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Although many people went into details how great this album was and how great it was not. The 4 long years waiting were more than worth it. I would give 10,000 dollars for this album. By far the best tool album and by far the best album made in the last 15 years. I dont understand how people say Tool has lost its flavour? wings part 2, well lets start with that.........the end of that song is a virtuoso masterpiece for danney...im a drummer and thats well, the drumming is some of the best ive heard. My second favorite song is rosetta stoned. moody, yet delacate, yet strong, and well, Jambi! powerful!!!! everything about this album is perfect. although u do have to be in the right mood to truly understand this album and you have to truly understand alot about music to fully apprieciate this album. I RECCOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND THIS ALBUM WILL GO DOWN  IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS EVER MADE, ATLEAST IN MY HEART IT WILL!!!!!!!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|One of the things that I have always liked about Radiohead is that their albums have enough depth and complexity to keep you listening for far longer than those of most other artists.  What makes this release different is that it is immediately accessible to a much wider audience than some of their other releases (Amnesiac and Kid A, for example).      This is an album that definitely appeals to many who never understood the Radiohead or even cared to understand them.  And don't let the review sway you with talk of it being subdued.  The album is very well balanced with more up-tempo tracks like \\"15-step\\", \\"Bodysnatchers\\", \\"Reckoner\\" and \\"Jigsaw...\\" mixed in with bits of high-quality, well-polished chill.    And for the real Radiohead, there are some definite elements of \\"OK Computer\\", although much less experimental overall.
B00005JPXY|5.0|First and foremost, enter this film knowing that you're not going to get any answers. No brilliant scientist or smart mouthed guy is going to explain what is happening halfway through.  The main characters know about as much as we would know if this was happening to us. That's one of the brilliant touches with Cloverfield, that nothing is spoon fed to us.  I'm a bit bored with movies that over explain everything so Cloverfield's ambiguity and less-is-more attitude is refreshing.    Outside of that, this is one of the most original (after giving props to Godzilla and Blair Witch Project) and exciting monster movies I have seen in a long time that exceeds the hype surrounding it. Yes, there's some shaky camera work, yes the character's actions are a bit far fetched and yes it raises more questions than answers (did the soldiers shoot the girl or did she explode?) but I didn't have a problem with that at all.  I was on the edge of my seat, my heart machine gun pounding against my chest, from the first explosion to the last. This is what a movie going experience is all about:  complete immersion in the story from first frame to last.    My only beef is Hud. He says Rob's name at least a half million times during the course of the movie which drove me slightly crazy. I was half expecting him to profess his undying love for Rob or something.    CHeck this one out if you love monster and sci-fi movies, especially ones that are done very well.  I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD.
B000W4HJ44|4.0|I avoided this movie like the plague; why was it necessary to remake John Waters' classic movie?!? And John Travolta as Edna Turnblad?!? Well, I was right on 1 out of 2 counts. This movie does a great job of creating its own niche; the songs are catchy and the performances are excellent...except for Travolta. Donning a fat-suit, although he looks grotesque, he doesn't capture the tired run-down housewife look made legendary by Divine. On top of that, Travolta chose to sound like Carol Channing and sounds totally out of place. I do have to give the guy snaps for his dancing though; even in a fat suit he tears up the dance floor. Still, his performance is the one part of the film that really detracts; you believe that Nikki Blonsky is Tracy Turnblad...she wants fame, fortune, and believes in herself; you don't believe Travolta as Tracy's mother Edna; nor do you believe that Travolta is doing anything other than a wink-wink-nudge-nudge to the audience. Michelle Pfeiffer is incredible...not only does she look amazing, she gives an ultra-sleek villianess quality to Velma Von Tussle, the former Baltimore Beauty Queen stuck in a time-warp of when she received her crown (by sleeping with the judges, so noted in one of my favorite musical numbers of the film). Pfeiffer needs to sing more often, as does James Marsden (playing Corky Collins), who seem like he just stepped out of a Rat Pack movie. The voice, the moves...this guy did his homework. The rest of the performances are letter-perfect as well; casting deserves a gold star for this one (other than the Travolta mishap; nice idea, poor execution on his part). For those that don't know the story, Tracy seeks fame, fortune, and a hot boyfriend (Linc, played well by teen idol Zac Effron) on the popular 1960s Baltimore dance TV series, The Corky Collins show. Along the way, she must battle Velma Von Tussle, who wants her daughter Amber to be the star and Linc's girlfriend. Although Tracy is plump, she wins everyone's heart with her singing, dancing, and positive personality. She also helps integrate the Collins show with a little assist from Queen Latifah, another singing/dancing powerhouse in this movie. The colors are very saturated in the movie...this thing looks like a candy-box; a true treat for the eyes, and the sound is excellent too. Turn up that surround sound and sub-woofer folks! You'll be dancing in your living room.<br /><br />I do highly recommend the Shake & Shimmy edition; loaded with extras, New Line doesn't pull a Paramount on you...they give indepth featurettes. One of my favorites are the set of featurettes documenting the history of Hairspray (\\"You Can't Stop the Beat: The Long Journey of Hairspray\\"); from the original movie starring Divine, to the Broadway Musical, and then the current version on the Big Screen. The producers, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, discuss how they were instrumental (pun intended) in bringing back the movie musical, which was considered box office poison not so long ago. It is sad to view Divine finally getting a chance to break into mainstream movies and then tragically passing away not long after the release of the original Hairspray movie. You also get featurettes on the choreography, hairstyles, set design, and costuming for the movie. Be sure to catch Penny's dress in the finale; it is made from her bedroom curtains, complete with valance and curtain rings at the hem. It is a little funny to see rehearsal footage of every major star in the movie except for Travlota. The extra \\"Hair Extensions\\" shows you the behind the scenes of the dance numbers; rehearsal footage is cut into the actual finished movie footage, providing an interesting glimpse of the work that goes into each number. \\"Step by Step: The Dances of Hairspray\\" teaches you how to do the Peyton Place dance, done expertly in the movie by Elijah Kelley. Although the pacing is a little quick for an actual dance number, you could really pick it up with this featurette if you watch closely and rewind it a few times. As always, it is interesting to watch the deleted scenes, but nothing shown  here is really missed from the film; the editors made the right decision. Karaoke fans can also sing along with the movie using the lyric track.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars for the extras, and 4 stars for the movie. Other than JT, the movie is flawless until the end, when it falls into a \\"let's wrap this up quickly\\" predictability and silliness that betrays the somewhat serious themes of the film (bigotry and self-image). However, it's hard to be cynical when watching the rowsing musical finale. Get this version today!nd rewind it a few times.

B000YDOOUK|5.0|Wow, what an album!  An instant hard rock classic (really, it's that good).  Every track is a winner.  They may have beaten AC/DC at their own game.  Turn it up and bang your head.  This album is worth growing your hair long again....
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|i don't think I've seen this movie since it was first released in 1970. It has the distinction of being the last animated movie put into production by Walt Disney himself, a few years before he passed away. There are no nail-biting sequences nor extraordinarily evil villains...this is a sweet sweet film with a somewhat predictable plot that is definitely endearing and full of memorable songs. Maurice Chevalier was coaxed out of retirement by the Sherman Brothers (they tell the details in one of the extra segments) to sing the title song and none other than Louis Armstrong sings the wonderful fast-paced song, \\"Everybody Wants to Be A Cat.\\" Phil Harris lends his voice to the lead male role of O'Malley the Alley cat (and duets with Louis on the previously mentioned song). Eva Gabor plays the female lead, Duchess, the mother of three kittens and apple of her wealthy mistress' eye, Adelaide (the voice of Hermoine Baddeley). I can't say enough about Gabor; she has a subtlety of emotion, charm, and humanity that shines through her wonderful accent. Briefly, the story is of Duchess and her three kittens who live in pampered Parisian luxury with Adelaide until the greedy butler, Edgar, decides to kidnap the cats so that he can inherit all of Adelaide's wealth instead of the cats. Dumped far away in the country, it takes O'Malley the Alley Cat to help get them back to Adelaide's, but not without a few fun journeys along the way. Sterling Holloway is wonderful as the cat's unlikely pal and hero, Roquefort. The animation has a similar rough-sketch look to it that Dalmations did. The picture quality is exceptional, as is the sound. As for the extras, they are a nice bunch considering this is only a one-disc set. The usual gallery of concept art, sketches, publicity materials, etc. The  Virtual Kitten game is somewhat amusing, but probably more so for a very young child (you have to click the correct button to choose or anticipate what your kitty will do next). \\"Fun with Language\\" teaches children how to identify musical instruments. \\"Bath Day\\" (6:38) is a cute Minnie Mouse cartoon with Figaro the cat. I really enjoyed the excerpt from a 1956 Wonderful World of Disney show (hosted by Walt himself) entitled \\"The Great Cat Family\\" (12:50) with a fun history of the cat, accompanied by some wonderful animation. Richard Sherman introduces a deleted song, accompanied by storyboard sketches and production drawings, using the original demo audio recordings. We learn here that Eva's singing voice was expertly dubbed by Robie Lester. \\"The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs\\" (4:33) has both of the Sherman brothers (but mainly Richard) talking about how they created the memorable musical numbers for this animated feature. What's missing? Sure would have been nice to have an overall \\"Making Of\\" featurette, but still this is a solid release and an enjoyable movie.\\" teaches children how to identify musical instruments. \\"Bath Day\\" (6:38) is a cute Minnie Mouse cartoon with Figaro the cat.

B0009QTS1M|5.0|If you saw this movie in the theater and were blown away like I was, you will want to get this particular DVD version. I bought this when it first was released in VHS. I was disappointed with it from the standpoint that it appeared to be missing bits and pieces of footage. I particularly remembered that the mock battle scene in the colliseum. He and his fellow gladiators were supposed to lose, and he turned it into a victory. I remember it being longer when I saw it in the theater. This DVD has a lot of great features including deleted footage and scenes etc.. You always want to get the Directors cut when you can. Worth the price, this is the movie that made Russell Crowe a super star, and made a fan out of me!

It worth any dollar !!!!!!!!!!
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet is a masterpiece of modern cinema and neo-noir.  It is veiled in mysteries that I still have not cracked after 8+ viewings.  It is simply one of my favorite films.       Blue Velvet is a particularly well acted film, especially for an early David Lynch film (no offence David).  Dennis Hopper is incredible.  His role as Frank Booth has been ranked as one of the best villains in cinema history.  Isabella Rossellini also did a miraculous job as Dorothy Vallens.  Her portrayal, which even Roger Ebert found impressive, is sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes heartwarming, which is quite an amazing thing to accomplish in her first film role ever.         While Blue Velvet is one of David Lynch's more \\"conventional\\" films, it still holds that mysterious aspect that David is so great at creating.  It contains little details that allow you to discover more with each viewing (SPOILERS*** such as: when Jeffery finds the ear in the beginning of the film, the camera zooms into the ear canal.  In the final scenes of the films, after Frank's dead and all is well, the camera zooms out of Jeffery's ear canal. Wow.)       Blue Velvet is also loaded with clever symbolism and imagery that keeps you astounded every time you see it.  The blue lighting, the picket fence and flowers, the well-dressed man disguise, the kink in the hoes during Jeffery's father's stroke are all examples of the amazing imagery found in Blue Velvet.       This DVD version of Blue Velvet does a fine job with the transfer, nothing that shouldn't be there.  The DVD itself is not loaded with features, but I particularly found the missing scene montage a great addition.  These scenes are still missing to this day and somehow they managed to find still frames from some of these scenes.  There is also an easter egg hidden in the DVD, but t is pretty pointless.       Overall, this is a great film and a good DVD.  If you are looking to replace a VHS copy, go for it because this is worth it.  If you have never seen it, do so as soon as possible.  You should not be disappointed.

1847242537|5.0|I got all three books in the trilogy as a present,<br />and read them all in less than a week (in Swedish), a personal<br />record.<br /><br />The first book is now available in English.<br />(The literal tranlation would have been \\"Men who Hate Women\\".)<br /><br />The books are complete page-turners, the suspense<br />keeps building. The author's death prior to publication<br />may have contributed to some minor errors of fact and<br />of internal consistency, but this does not detract from<br />the readability.<br /><br />The background portrayal of a school system<br />gone haywire and of a mental health system out of control,<br />both violationg people that don't quite fit in with the<br />Swedish way resounds with its plausibilty. I am left with<br />the impression that the author has first-hand experience<br />with the horrors of the former, if not necessarily the<br />latter.<br /><br />Curiously, the author fails to draw the conclusion that<br />it is the welfare state itself that is the cause, he clearly<br />embraces it  - but then, he is a dyed-in-the-wool Swede.<br /><br />A piece of advice to the reader: It is helpful to have a<br />physical map of Sweden handy; with the exception of one<br />of the main locations (Hedeby, which exists only unrelatedly<br />in Denmark) all the towns are real.<br /><br />The \\"Millenium\\" magazine featured in the books exists<br />in the real world as \\"EXPO\\", and Mikael Blomkvist is<br />clearly the author's alter ego.

0884271153|4.0|This book truly is a sequal to the goal. In the goal we were introduced the important topic of throughput, inventory and operational expenses. On throuput we learnt how \\"work\\" flows through a process, how to manage buffers and when to introduce work into the system. We see how inventory is just held-up cash and why we should try to minimize it within the limits of our constraints. Finally, on operational expenses, we see how cost accounting can really distort the reality and that having excess capacity can actually be a good thing.    In this book the author doesn't just repeat the process at a higher level. Instead we are introduced to new material: the Thinking Process. This is a toolkit for problem solving tools, which make us question our assumptions. These tools are named \\"Current & Future Reality Trees\\", \\"Pre-requisite Tree\\", \\"Transition-Tree\\" and \\"Negative Branch Reservations\\". As the story unfolds, our hero is busy applying the Thinking Process in sales in order to generate a leap in profits.    At times, I found the book to be a bit \\"verbose\\" in the sense that reading a series of almost repeating if-then statements can be somewhat tedious. But there are some small diagrams that help you follow. All in all, I liked the book but it's an introduction not a manual. Neither this book nor the previous is much more than an introduction to the topic.    For a more in-depth look at the Theory of Constraints and to gain sufficient knowledge to apply it to a business, you would definitely need another book.

B00097A5I6|5.0|Don't believe the truth represents Oasis' best album since the 1995 epic (What's the story?) Morning Glory. The single Lyla is easily one of the top Oasis tracks and marks a return of the band to more mainstream music and the end of the self-indulgent albums preceding this album. They use Zak Starkey on drums (yes, son of Ringo Star or Richard Starkey) and the tracks are co-written by many of the band members with 2 of the top tracks (Turn up the sun, Guess God thinks I'm Abel) written by the bass player and Liam Gallagher. I am optimistic the new band is now positioned to propel the group through their mature years and get down to writing more ripping, sing-along tracks that make the band the top act in the last 15 years, at least. This is a must buy even for a part-time fan.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|What's with the shaky camera ??  It's crazy..it takes away from the film,blurred,shaking.    Plus,do you think they could have done away with oh perhaps 20 less guys shooting at him at one time ??  Please !  That's what is so good about the Bond films,it pits much less activity at  one time and adds to the suspense.  I mean,this guy is good but to fist fight with 15 guys at one time gets  to be just ridiculous.    Disappointed with this film.    I would have forgiven the second gripe but the shaky camera was just  plain poor film making.  Plus to really show how bad it was..the second movie I watched was 3:10 To Yuma. That movie was stunning with the filming. It made the first one  really stand out against the blurred,shaking mess.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|What a fantastic slab of nerdy funkiness.  I'm a big fan of the Shins, but am tiring a little bit of so many bands doing that indie sound that's become a bit predictable.  Not so with Vampire Weekend.  They have the smarts of a band like Talking Heads.  Taking their indie rock and sprinkling it with the sounds of Soweto at times (hello Graceland) and chamber pop at others, this is a winner from start to finish.  Only negative is that I can't play track two in my car with our little daughter (clear F bombs).  But I doubt that's an issue with most people who buy this  :)    Definitely recommended if you like to be put in a good mood.

0790729601|4.0|The Eraser  DVD<br /><br />The Eraser starring Arnold The Eraser  DVD<br /><br />The Eraser starring Arnold Swarzzennegger and  James Caan is one of my favorite movies.  Arnold plays John  Kruger who is specializes in \\"erasing\\" people's identities, in this case Vanessa Williams plays  a FBI whistleblower that is going to testify against a very important person and Arnold must protect her from assassination.<br />The plot is relatively simple, in fact, you will be likely to pick up on the \\"secret\\" early on in the film. But the action is non-stop,).  There are a lot of explosions, especially of vehicles blowing sky-high but hey, we have to give the special effects guys something to do, and the secret weapon's effect is also pretty cool. Vanessa Williams underplays her role as FBI whistleblower, and James Caan is just superb as the heavy. The surprise fun came from the Wise Guys, who pay some debts in the plot. They were amusing and added a bit of fun to the action.<br />I found the suspense pleasantly gripping, and if it wasn't the smartest film on the block, it sure was plenty of entertainment.<br /><br />Recommended for Arnold fans and fans of action movies.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008
B000Y7U98W|5.0|One of the best movies of 2007. This movie is proof that a good writer, artistic director and an excellent cast can elevate a simple \\"disaster-movie premise\\" to another level.

B000RJO58M|5.0|This movie was a blast to watch, it's a little off the wall and all that but the lead characters pictured on the cover can be quite funneh. The movie is a little slow in parts but it's still a good one none the less.<br /><br />Video Quality: 5stars, never saw any bad video seens in HD and would gladly watch all over again, probably will over the weekend.<br /><br />Store line: I'd have to say 4.5 stars, just because it's a little corny but it's still a funny movie.
B000YA82F6|4.0|Probably a tad bit over-hyped and over-praised, Juno is a charming little tale about a girl who finds herself in a very womanly condition and is unprepared for life's new realities.    Ellen Page plays the title heroine with all the spunk and cynicism of an underage Janeane Garofalo in her nine month journey from copulation to parturition, as she struggles with her ever-expanding belly and the added pressure of turning her child over to an adoptive couple.      Sometimes vulgar and always sassy, Juno may stretch the limits of believability with her quick wit at times.  Like male characters from Kevin Smith films, she's just a tad bit too quick and too smart.   A lot of her snarky comments get delivered with such speed that she's already snapped another off before the first makes sense.      But as the film progresses, her \\"f-you\\" attitude to the world is revealed to be a façade hiding someone more tender and idealistic.  Roger Ebert says she's a character he wants to hug.  Although most audiences would agree, Juno herself would probably be quick to point out that Rog is a little old to be hugging underage girls.     Like the previously released \\"Knocked Up\\", a heart exists at the center of Juno that makes the tale irresistible.    Of course, the film has its share of \\"bad guys\\", but the bulk of the story is about people trying to do what's right and who want to make the best of their time on earth.  It's easy to care about the people in Juno, to feel happiness when they're happy, and to hurt when they hurt.    SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD: My biggest complaint with the film is it's reluctance to embrace what seemed like should have been the logical conclusion.  The film establishes a choice Juno must make: either to keep her child or turn it over to a wealthy, childless couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.  The couple live in the suburbs, own nice cars, wear sweaters and drink expensive wine.   But Hollywood is not ready to make a film that praises the virtues of a two-parent household over that of a single mother, so something must happen to prevent that ending.  The people behind this film couldn't have their audiences leaving the theater thinking the movie promoted traditional views of the ideal home from a child, so they throw together a very reaching and questionable ending where a single-mother household is shown to be the best solution to the problem of a child born to a single mother.   Huh?  Exactly.   Again, Hollywood shows its political leanings.    Unlike a much brave film (Gone Baby Gone), Juno lost an opportunity to deal with the realities of what is/isn't the best environment for a child, and instead opts for a save conclusion that won't offend any feminists groups.  Too bad.
B000056BOR|2.0|I love Doris Day and this movie is funny,entertaining and fun to watch. The only disappointment here is the dvd. The sound is mono and the quality is not the best, could have been better. That's why a give it a 2 for quality. I hope they give this movie a better treatment. I've seen older movies look and sound better than this. Great cover though. Now I wish they would give this movie that touch of mink.
B000URDEB0|4.0|It's the rare band who can replace their long time lead singer and still have success.  When the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish fired their singer Tarja Turunen back in 2005, their fans panicked.  After all, Nightwish's claim to fame was Tarja's delicate vocals over some pretty slamming metal.  With the addition of singer Anette Olzon, however, Nightwish seems to have regained its equilibrium, and \\"Dark Passion Play,\\" the first album with Anette singing, is at once the band at its most familiar and taking steps towards evolving.    Go on any message board with a Nightwish topic and the battle lines are fiercely drawn between those who believe that Nightwish is awful now without Tarja and those who think the band has improved with Anette.  Personally I was never fond of Tarja, whose voice is beautiful but looked like an overly painted marionette at live shows.  Anette, while perhaps not as technically perfect a singer as Tarja, is nonetheless an impressive vocalist who actually looks like she's having fun onstage.  That spirit shows in songs such as the downright bouncy \\"Amaranth\\" (I know, Nightwish and bouncy, odd combination).  She also acquits herself admirably on \\"Eva\\" and the lead-off opus \\"The Poet and the Pendulum.\\"  As these songs were originally written long before she joined the band, for the most part she does a great job.      The bad blood between Nightwish and Tarja comes to a boil in two songs, both mostly sung by bassist Marco Hietala.  \\"Master Passion Greed\\" is a snarled rebuke of Tarja's husband, who many believe started the friction between her and the band, while \\"Bye Bye Beautiful,\\" arguably the album's best song, is keyboardist/songwriter Tuomas Holopainen's scathing kiss-off to his one-time school friend (\\"Did we get this far just to feel your hate/Did we play to become only pawns in the game/How blind can you be, don't you see/You chose the long road but we'll be waiting\\").    Overall, \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is Nightwish's most accessiblealbum yet.  It's not perfect--Tuomas, PLEASE stop reading Tolkien and watching Disney movies before you write albums--but there is a warmth to the music now that was missing with Tarja at the mike.  Nightwish is a different band with Anette singing--and in this case, it's quite all right.
0440238609|1.0|This review is for Northern Lights/Golden Compass only -- I have enough to say on the first book before getting through the other two. I'm reading the 'adult edition' but have already read the standard 'non-adult' one. The only difference I can see so far is the adult one gives Pullman more room to throw around his explanations of Vatican/Magisterium (Vagisterium?) details and the science of the world. The former is boring and better said elsewhere, and the latter just forced me to look up 'anbaric' on Google.<br /><br />I'll get this out of the way: I'm neither atheist nor Christian by practice. I like Paradise Lost, Thus Spake Zarathustra, Narnia, The Bible itself (really, it is a work of literature) and Salman Rushdie (particularly Satanic Verses, which had nothing to do with 'Satan') equally. Not a big fantasy fan anymore but I figured I'd check these books out, given that I find the concepts intriguing. In short, I'm less a believer than a thinker and interpreter, which makes me a prime target for Pullman's agenda, right?<br /><br />A shame his writing just can't support the claims. Here's the long-and-short: his writing is at turns sluggish, self-involved and unhelpful; the characters are inconsistent; and the plot is just too convenient to get Lyra where Pullman wants her to be plausible.<br /><br />Firstly, the writing. Is this a children's book? Another reviewer has quoted Pullman saying 'I don't write children's books, I write books children read'. Personally I find this distinction redundant -- if he's aware that children read his books, then it follows that he's going to write them (or edit them) with children in mind (although not exclusively, of course). So if it is written with children in mind, then we can excuse some of the bad writing, the clich&eacute;s, etc. But if he's going for literature (and by the material, pardon the pun, he appears to be), Pullman's a far cry short of the likes of Ishiguro, Rushdie and Atwood -- who, for all their pretension, are 'modern' literary writers with more than a slight dipping towards Sci-Fi or Fantasy.<br /><br />A minor nitpick: Pullman's also erratic with the accents, particularly in regards to the 'gyptians'. Now and then they'll put 'a' before their words, but when they're doing lengthy explanations, somehow this miraculously disappears and the gyptian speaker is as fluent and coherent as any of Jordan's scholars.<br /><br />Let's look at Lyra for a sec. She's spoiled, arrogant and crass. These are, however, all pretty forgivable if you consider some of the great protagonists in literature. What is not forgivable is the inconsistency: one moment she's behaving like a 'savage' street urchin drinking (experimentally but 'liking it') and smoking, the next she's intrigued with the scholarly talk of 'Dust', then she's a young lady interested in perfume and Coulter's world, then she's starting to act like a 'gyptian' after living with them a few weeks, and THEN she's able to use some highly esoteric device that has baffled or eluded the scholars. Sure, you ride the story out assuming the author is going to explain these sooner or later, but I'd already lost faith in this author's ability to do so quite early. Only the idea that these books are an easy read kept me going (further proof that they're not literature -- literature that you don't like demands to be put down, because it's work that's not paying off).<br /><br />The manner in which the adults spoil and coddle Lyra, protect and groom her is less plausible than the notion that the girl is just a quirky Mary Sue for Pullman, who (true to his atheist proclamations) seems to reward Lyra's 'amoral' behaviour by giving her a slew of guardians and a wonderful quest to go on, etc. Another inconsistency? The book starts with her thwarting an attempt to murder her uncle by the Master of Jordan. Fair enough. But the next time she is summoned by that Master, she shows absolutely no hesitation when he offers to get her some softdrink. It's almost as if Pullman can't tell the difference between 'amoral' and 'amnesiac'. The result is less a prepubescent illustration of whim and willfulness and more an example of ad hoc character decisions to suit the story Pullman wants to tell.<br /><br />..Such a rant, and I haven't even mentioned any of the other characters yet. Don't worry, I won't. My lack of faith in Lyra as a believable protagonist reduces the peripheral characters to precisely that: flat cut-out figures with no agenda beyond the telling of Lyra's story. They are facilitators of her quest, either as benefactors or malefactors.<br /><br />Which leads me into the plot. It seems almost moot to examine the plot when I've already dismissed the validity of the main character, but I just have to say: 'Uncle' being her father (oh-gosh-what-a-surprise) and Coulter being her mother (ditto!) was just awful. It's not enough that this little obnoxious twerp had the staff of the University watching out for her, she simply had to be the direct kin of the two most powerful players in the book. It's a tired trope in most cases but tired tropes alone don't make a book bad. The combination of obvious authorial intention (I don't even have to go into that), inconsistent characters (particular the protagonist) and a lack of plausible plot (we shouldn't be seeing Deus Ex Machina as early as the first book!)...PLUS tired tropes...'bad' seems appropriate if you consider all those as factors of a book.<br /><br />I'd love to recommend Northern Lights/Golden Compass, but I'd have no idea who to recommend it to.<br /><br />--For kids there are simply better fantasies out there to be read (and if atheist parents want their kids questioning religion, there are better ways to initiate that too)<br /><br />--For teenagers, I think the same applies, but if His Dark Materials has a target, it'd be teenagers. They'd enjoy Lyra's rebelliousness and her apparent superiority to adults, not to mention the adults bowing to her desires. Still, whatever a teenager might seek in His Dark Materials, they're apt to find a better example of it elsewhere<br /><br />--For adults? The writing can be a bit infantile and the author's appeal to lenience in reader disbelief (Willing Suspension of Disbelief) is just too much<br /><br />--Parents, regardless of their religious inclinations, should be aware that the protagonist engages in behaviour that would be punished in our world by the morals that might have roots in Christianity but endure through common sense (willful damage of property being an obvious example). Lyra is not at all reprimanded for these (in fact, everyone has a good old laugh when she thinks she's getting in trouble for her assault on the gyptian boat). Keep in mind that 'protagonist' in this context means 'hero' -- is Lyra a heroic example for your kids?<br /><br />--For Christians? Heh, not even worth mentioning<br /><br />--For atheists? They should be bothered that such a clumsy, heavy-handed writer is championing their cause. Douglas Adams, just to name one author, did it far better.<br /><br />And for people like me, who are open-minded as long as the words are doing their thing and the story's believable as a story? I could recommend more books than you could read in a lifetime more worth your while than this, some of which I haven't even read yet but have enough weight behind them historically to sit higher on your reading list than Pullman's disappointing His Dark Materials.<br /><br />Milton went to great pains to illustrate both Hell and Heaven, but it's always the quotes about the great Romantic Satan that stick. Don't let your possible fascination with demons and pandemonium and the 'great war in Heaven' delude you into thinking this book has anything in common with Paradise Lost.<br /><br />Oh, and if you want an aesthetically beautiful book where 'God' is absolutely trashed, crapped upon (literally) and defaced, check out [[ASIN:187897212X Maldoror and the Complete Works of the Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont]].

B000VWYJ86|5.0|I thought I could not enjoy another Bourne movie.  Yet, my teenage sons and I completely enjoyed the action and intelligence in this movie - all because of Matt Damon.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|This album suffers heavily from dynamic compression. If you look at the waveforms they look like bricks. Good music, but horrible to listen to. Shame on Bob Ludwig who knows better.
0316067598|5.0|This is a great book about Operation Redwing by the only survivor of it. It is written in a no bull first hand view. Through the book you get a look into BUD/S and a first hand account of Navy SEALs operation in Afghanistan and the terrible ordeal and loss of so many of the authors friends and shipmates. You can also sense the therapy he gets from telling his story. His insight into the Afghan culture as experienced first hand, his hatred for the Taliban but respect and love for the Pushtu people who saved him. It might seem to a be a fairly straight forward book on the surface but you can appreciate the complex issues it presents as well. It is well worth a read.
B00007FOMP|5.0|From beginning to the end.  Truly, a masterpiece!  I can't get enough of this album.  Tracks seemlessly transition into each other.  We still go through the issues he adress on this album today.  A must have for all music connoisseurs!
1400049628|5.0|There are two types of people in this world, those who are prepared for the zombie outbreak and those who aren't. This book is full of excellent advice on this incredibly important subject. Some people fail to prepare because they are unaware of the threat zombies are. This book will help those who need it. It is written in the style of 1950's nuclear disaster handbooks. It clearly lays out all possible scenarios and how to prepare and then what to do when the inevitable happens. This is a great read and full of advice to take to heart.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I'm sure everyone will agree that this version has some definite problems, but come on! It deserves a LOT more credit than just one star. In some ways, this version is even BETTER than the 1995.    -------------------------    The High Points    - The scenery and costumes are amazing. Filming on location in Bath added so much to the film, and that counts for at least one star on its own.    - The score is beautiful. There is a subtle and pervasive yearning in the soundtrack that perfectly suits the story.    - While no actor will completely satisfy a true Austen fan, the two leads do an excellent job of showing us the tortured desire that their characters experience. Plus, they're both gorgeous.    -------------------------    The Low Points    - Many secondary characters and side plots of the novel are under-developed in this version. EVERYONE should anticipate this... they only had an hour and a half, folks.    - Yes, Anne has a headless turkey moment of panic and runs through Bath like a crazy woman. If you are expecting it, it won't be so bad. The director decided to go for emotion instead of accuracy, and, if you let yourself become emotionally involved with this version, it CAN be forgiven.    - What can't be forgiven, however, is that final fish kiss. Here is the moment we've all been waiting for, and it just turns out really awkward. I think the fault lies with the director on this one.    -------------------------    So the biggest problems happen in the last few minutes of the movie. As upsetting as they are, DON'T let them stop you from experiencing (and appreciating) all of the great things in this version. Although it's considerably different from the novel, the film DOES express the longing and romance that Austen described. Imperfect and beautiful, this version is very worth watching, and it certainly deserves more credit than it has been given here.
0765357151|5.0|Though I am not a real fan of post apocalyptic fiction, this is truly a great novel. I am Legend should be on everyone's must read list. It is truly a master peice of story telling. Set in the mid 1970's Los Angles it is a story about the lone surviver of a plague hit world. You see how he adapts and searches for the truth when most people would have given up. He is not a scientist, or any exotic profession but a humble factory worker. The story is fantastic and well written, which great pace. That being said it is surely not a feel good book, it is rather depressing at time. But the story is fantastic and the main character is very easy to relate to. It is sometimes scary how easy it is to relate to the main characters and most readers will see a bit of themselves in him. I can not recommend this book any higher.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I have been a devoted Linkin Park fan for the past 7 or so years (ever since Hybrid Theory came out).  Since then and for all my life I have not had such an emotional and spiritual connection to   any work of art (music)...I have pretty much bled Linkin Park and have not ever thought anybody could rock as hard as they could...until I started listening to Paramore.    I can't believe my ears or eyes watching some of their live performances - they are that good, and cannot help but have a strong emotional response to songs like \\"That's what you get\\" or \\"Born for this\\".    The music, the lyrics, the delivery (from Hayley especially) are superb and IMO produce the best music - so good that I cannot even believe that it exists (I feel like - seriously - I am going to wake up from a dream to realize that Paramore does not exist - but they do - and for that I AM THANKFUL, really).    I still love Linkin Park, but Paramore has taken my heart and is my new Favorite #1 band.  Paramore's lyrics (especially when delivered by the group live in their songs) remind me of who it is I am:  that I'm someone strong, that I should resist everyday temptations, that I should take the \\"road less traveled by\\", that I need my pain/my cross that I carry with me each day.    I have always felt that I had a fire that burned inside me, in my heart and deep within me that noone else could understand - including myself. But these emotional works (songs by Paramore) get me close in realizing who it is I am and why I am here (just like a lot of my favorite Linkin Park songs do). I think it is important to remember who it is you are and where you came from and always remember what it is you value and to NEVER sell out your soul for anything/anybody.    Thank you Paramore for reminding me who it is I am and for giving me strength in those times when I seem to have none - I get your music 100% and I'm sure so many other young people do!    I will buy whatever this band sells and follow them anywhere!and, oh yea, the \\"rock my face off\\" too!!!    I think if I actually saw them live in person I would die right then and there - and I would be at peace in that moment, happy and content with my life and my past.
B000077VR3|5.0|It is flawed and it is brilliant. It follows the classic boy meets girl - boy loses girl - boy gets girl back again formula, but it does so with a visual and musical imagination which few other directors can match.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Its very mellow and relaxed.  Thom's voice comes through after being buried in the mix the last couple of albums.  The Drumming of Phil Selway has never been better.  A couple of the songs sound like they could be R&B.  Highly reccomend
B000C3H4L8|5.0|All negative reviews are of the DualDisc format.  The product is amazing, but only get it if you have a 5.1 surround sound setup.  You won't be able to burn it and put it on your MP3 player, which sucks, but if you understand that and also understand that it is worth the price just to play it on your 5.1 surround sound system then buy it, I have it and a couple of others.  It's KILLER to listen too on 5.1.
B000WQW988|5.0|It's been fifteen years since this show aired on MTV. Since then, the accompanying CD has become a staple with most fans of the band, while the show itself became a distant memory. On one hand, it just doesn't feel like fifteen years have passed since then; the music still sounds fresh, vital and contemporary. On the other hand, my son barely knew how to walk when this was filmed, and now he's applying for a driver's license. I guess perspective is everything. In its time, the most jarring aspect of this performance rested in how well these songs worked in an acoustic environment. Here was this intense, electrified, post-punk indie band playing at James Taylor volumes. Kurt Cobain remains seated throughout, while Dave Grohl plays his drums with a deft touch, using brushes. Against all expectations, the show rocked in ways that nobody could have predicted, and finally, the evidence is available on DVD for all to see.<br /> So many of these songs are classics in their own right, but many have been surpassed by the specific versions featured in this program. \\"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam,\\" \\"The Man Who Sold the World,\\" \\"All Apologies\\" and \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\" represent some of the best music that our culture had to offer, and what held true in '93 still holds true today. This performance seemed simple and charming in its time, but has grown to represent so much more. Watching this, it is impossible to not mourn the loss of Kurt Cobain. What he could have achieved is incalculable, but there is so much evidence here pointing to the raw and crucial nature of his artistic creativity. We are so much worse off without him than we tend to acknowledge. Considering that he passed away within six months of this show, it now takes on the airs of a eulogy, an impression that is heightened by the candles and flowers that adorn the stage.<br /> On a technical note, this DVD contains the unedited performance, including songs that did not appear on the original MTV broadcast. For purists and impatient types, it also contains the edited version as aired by MTV. The extra tracks and between-song banter only add to the casual brilliance of this performance, and the recording is so crystal clear that you can hear the texture of Grohl's brushes on the cymbals. As rock and roll films go, this is classic, like footage from Woodstock, or Altamont. It seemed so simple at the time, but nothing like it has appeared since then. An entire generation has now come of age that never had the opportunity to see Nirvana, and specifically this show. Now that I've watched it a few times, I know what I must do. I need to give this to my son. before he leaves for college.<br />  A+  Tom Ryant. For purists and impatient types, it also contains the edited version as aired by MTV.

B00005JPTI|2.0|From the moment that the Fresh Prince of Bel Air bounds across your line of vision, complete with a sniper rifle and about four thousand CGI deer (oh! and also a pride of fake lions...), you'd be very forgiven for thinking that \\"I Am Legend\\" is going to be Just Another Action Movie. Indeed, the glaring awfulness of the computer-rendered deer is enough to make you forget all about the beautiful post-plague New York cityscapes (in themselves worthy of huge praise, they're chilling and very impressive), the thitherto-great performance by Smith as a man hounded by loneliness and personal demons, and the very cute Alsatian by his side.     But with further viewing, \\"I Am Legend\\" becomes much, much better - for the most part - and is, by the time the credits roll, not Just Another Action Movie, but something more enjoyable - if two-dimensional.    The Good: Smith gives a gorgeous, nuanced performance as plague survivor Robert Neville - when he's allowed to act, that is. When he's forced to shoot, run, chase, do action - he reverts to a horrible sort of MIB stereotype - but during Robert Neville's more emotionally complex scenes he's actually excellent. Director Francis Lawerence does great things with the aforementioned bare New York of the future, and we can really sense the isolation and loneliness of Neville's plight. And yes, there are several worthwhile \\"jump\\" moments, too, with which to keep the action moving along nicely. It's just a shame that most of the action is hackneyed - which leads me to    The Bad: Boring chase & evade sequences and frankly ridiculous computer animations (the animals are a minor offender: the crown of stupidity in this case belongs squarely planted on the heads of the totally unrealistic, poorly-animated Zombies) ruin the great work of Smith and his director in \\"I Am Legend\\". Also, the ending is very hackneyed - I'm not sure if it's reflective of the novel since I haven't read it - but as a movie, we've seen it all before.    Still, criticisms notwithstanding, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a worthwhile way to pass an evening's viewing: I wouldn't buy the DVD because no amount of extras could make up for the fact that, while enjoyable enough with all-too-brief moments of excellence, \\"I Am Legend\\" is just not engaging enough to watch twice.
B0000046X0|5.0|It's almost impossible to believe that the Return To Forever presented here is the same band that recorded [[ASIN:B0000262QW Return to Forever]] and [[ASIN:B0000046YK Light as a Feather]] a year or so earlier! That seemed like a totally different band and with the exception of Stanley Clarke and Chick Corea it is.On this recording Bill Connors and Lenny White have joined the crew and have changed the bands general direction. The emphasis on the first two RTF albums was on sudtlty and Brazillian rhythms,as well as the vocals of Flora Purim and sometimes Andy Bey. THIS Return To Forever lineup puts a strong focus on instrumentation-in fact this is all instrumental. As with almost all jazz-fusion from this era the tempo is often very fast paced and sometimes overdone. But that doesn't mean that the title song,\\"After The Cosmic Rain\\",\\"Captain Senor Mouse\\" and \\"Theme To The Mothership\\" don't all have a lot of focus-that is probably why this album rates so highly among RTF fans. These songs are rather long and feature periods of extended jamming-this album is more or less split between Corea's lightening speed Fender Rhodes solos and Lenny White's very likeminded drumming. Bill Connors tries hard to keep up and usually does but usually the drums and the organ bury him in the mix,which is exactly what happens to Stanley Clarke. But Stanley gets his chance to shine on \\"Space Circus\\",the only funk song on the album and it benifits from his sense of the groove and the other guys in the group follow his lead and give up the funk in great style. \\"The Game Maker\\" is back to Corea himself but the arrangement is just a little more subdued. The one thing that is a bit troubling about this album are that the songwriting skills of each of these musicians are virtually non existant here,as they opt to excersise their musical skills as opposed to the song.So there is a lot of collective and solo improvisation here ammidst the jazz-rock arrangments. If your not a musician,fusion or prog rock fan or are looking more for accessible songs this album might lose you midway through but after a few listens you'll find out what an exciting experience this music can be.n or prog rock fan or are looking more for accessible songs this album might lose you midway through but after a few listens you'll find out what an exciting experience this music can be.
0375424474|5.0|This is an absolutely fascinating, mind-blowing, thought-provoking story of science that will leave many hard beliefs in total shatters!     It reads like a detective story that pieces together the evolution of the human body. You will learn what sharks have to do with human hernias, and you will learn what the jaw of ancient reptiles have to do with two bones in your middle ear: the malleus and the incus.  Walking away from this book, I will never look at any living organism in the same light ever again. I now totally believe that all living organisms are our brothers and sisters: they have many insights to tell us about ourselves.     Your Inner Fish swims through the fossil record, the lives of single-cell organisms, the lives of multi-cell organsims, the depths of the human body, and ties it all together to show how many of the problems we have with our bodies can be directly explained by our 3.5 billion year evolutionary history.     You will learn \\"... that we were not designed rationally, but are products of a convoluted history.\\" An underlining current throughout this story of Your Inner Fish: our bodies evolved from and have been made for action. To deny this in our modern world though effortless sitting and lack of movement, is to condemn a body to an early death.    This is one of the best books that I have ever read; it will stay with me for the rest of my life. In each bacteria, in each insect, in each polar bear, I see a part of me. In destroying them, I destroy myself.
B000ZK4466|5.0|With \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\", Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & co. have come full circle and embraced their hardcore roots, nearly abandoning their familiar trappings in favor of a harder-edged approach.  While all the elements that have come to define them are still very much present, we are treated to the sounds of a group of musicians exploring the heavier possibilities of their individual talents.    Diehard fans will no doubt be scrutinizing new drummer Thomas Pridjen more than anyone else, and I don't think many of them will be disappointed.  While lacking the type of subtle dynamics and jazzy inflections Jon Theodore brought to the fold, Pridjen more than makes up for this with a fireworks display of rhythmic inventiveness and sheer bombast.  In fact, one might draw the conclusion that his unique style may have been a large factor in the changing of course the band seems to be undergoing, as many of Omar's compositions seem almost tailored around the onslaught of Pridjen's percussive puzzles.    Omar, for his part, does the album a huge service by decreasing the frequency (not to mention the volume) of his atonal and often arrhythmic improvisational frenzies, allowing the listener to focus on the interaction of the full band.  His fingers also find their way to the bottom end of his neck much more often than in the past, pulling the spotlight from the kind of beautiful treble arpeggios that graced such older material as \\"Eriatarka\\", \\"Cassandra Gemini\\" & \\"Roulette Dares\\" and throwing it onto meaty riffs and chord progressions (ala \\"Aberinkula\\",  \\"Ouroborous\\" and \\"Wax Simulacra\\").    In keeping with the deepened nature of this new material, singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala also keeps largely in the lower register of his vocal range and reduces the syllable-stretching melismatics of his yesteryear.  This makes for a spine-chilling experience when he does employ his note-bending soprano, as in \\"Wax Simulacra\\" (\\"..to shake by the rooooots..\\"), \\"Conjugal Burns\\" (\\"..Maybe tonight..\\"), or \\"Goliath\\" (\\"Does it make you feel alright?\\" and \\"Give it a name**\\") [** - This line is not printed in the lyrics, but is the closest interpretation I can come up with].  Rounding out the sound of the band are returning members bassist Juan Alderete de la Pena, keyboardist Ikey Owens, percussionist Marcel Rodriguez-Lopez, saxophonist/flautist Adrian Terrazas-Gonzales, former ATDI alumni and sound manipulator Paul Hinojos (now known as Pablo Hinojos-Gonzalez), and guitarist John Frusciante (also of the Red Hot Chili Peppers).  All of the above are to be lauded for executing this labyrinth of sound with such precision and feeling, though one does wish Omar would allow Juan or Ikey to take a solo in his place once in a while.  My only true complaint about this album is that though he is a full-fledged member of the group, Adrian's beautifully expressive playing (reminiscent at times of John Zorn or Ornette Coleman) is largely absent, though intoxicating when present.  But this injustice is, for me, compensated by Omar's decision to replace the band with a string ensemble to perform the music for \\"Soothsayer\\", accompanied only by Mr. Pridjen and his own occasional amelodic phrasings.    Long story short, this is Mars Volta at its heaviest and tightest.  While unlike anything they've done before (with the exception of a few parts of Amputechture which seem to be embryonic forms of this particular outing), this is one no fan should miss.  5 stars and then some!

B0001ARCFA|5.0|Edit: 12/2012<br /><br />I no longer recommend these headphones, I feel the sound and build quality have suffered since the move to building them in China. They are still a decent buy, and I can't recommend another semi-open in this price range, but the closed offerings in the bracket are MUCH better options in my opinion. I'm talking about the usual suspects the MDR-7506 and ATH-M50 are my two favorites.<br /><br />----- Back to 2008 -----<br /><br />These are considered the studio standard in circumaural open back headphones for good reason. The sound reproduction is excellent, with clear bass and midrange and a very balanced profile through the entire frequency spectrum. It makes me angry at how much I've spent on speakers and studio monitors, these do a better job at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />They are circumaural they fit OVER your ears. I guess some people don't like that. I think they might change their mind if they tried these. If you're looking for a SUPRA-aural design look at the AKG K141<br /><br />I find them extremely comfortable. I have literally forgotten I was wearing them more than once. The suspension system adjusts automagically and is excellent. At first I felt a little unsure about the security of the hold, I've been using these mostly as monitors while recording guitar and bass parts, but they've made it through some pretty enthusiastic headbanging without getting dislodged. It also prevents almost all the banging and noise you normally hear when handling your headphones.<br /><br />The ear pads are soft and comfortable and have a nice synthetic cover which feels like glove leather and has just the right combination of grip and smoothness.<br /><br />They are semi-open. In this case it means that with no sound coming out of them they are basically aurally transparent but when they are on it takes a pretty loud sound outside to be noticeable. They are excellent at the job I use them for, monitoring a master track while laying down new parts, because you can hear yourself and the room sound pretty naturally and still have a high quality monitor with no bleed through to the mic'ed amps. If you are intending to use these for monitoring during vocal track recording you might want to consider a closed back design, these can be a little loud close up, The K271 is an excellent option with an ingenious auto-mute feature that work off the same magical suspension system.<br /><br />Other Cool Features:<br /><br />mini-xlr connector on cord - replace your mangled cord or make your own!<br />fully rebuildable and modular - any component can be replaced if neccesary<br /><br />Gripes:<br /><br />It ships with a 3m mini-xlr to 1/8 cord w/ 1/4 adapter, I think most people would prefer the coiled cord which they sell as an option.<br /><br />The suspension may 'feel' a bit insecure at first, and the pads may wiggle a bit if you shake your head really hard. a manual tension adjustment on the suspension might be a nice addition.<br /><br />You really need a case for your studio headphones.

B000VI70WM|5.0|As what a previous review mentioned, this album is a continuation from Big Thing.  DD was lost and have been producing terrible albums in between until Red Carpet Massacre.  Even if you are not a DD fan from the 80's this album is great introduction for you.  Nite-runner and Tempted are my favorite tracks on the album.  Those songs will definitely make you dance, feel upbeat and positive.  This album is as strong as Justin's Sexyback album.  Timbaland is magic!
B000YIGNKE|4.0|While I enjoyed this adaptation of Persuassion, epsecially the performances of the 2 lead characters (Anne Elliot & Captain Wentworth), it still lacked in comparison to the 1995 version starring Amanda Root & Cieran Hinds.  That version is well rounded with fabulous performances by the main characters as well as the supporting cast and is delightful from start to finish. This version left a little to be desired. I have broken down my issues with this version to 3 key points.    1. While I felt the performances of Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones were excellent and carried the movie, I was extermely dissapointed in the supporting cast, in particular Sir Walter Elliot and Elizabeth Elliot.  I also felt that Mary Musgrove was completely unlikable where as in the book she has a few tolerable moments that soften her a little bit.  Also, I recall Mrs. Clay being mentioned multiple times in the book as not being \\"handsome.\\"  If my memory is correct, I would say the person they cast as Mrs. Clay was entirely too beautiful for the role.  I think one of the enjoyable things about Mrs. Clay in the book is that you can't figure out what would attract Mr. Elliot to her other than just trying to keep her away from Sir Walter.    2. The last 10 mintues - from reading other reviews people either loved or hated this part.  I for one hated it.  The way it was filmed just made me dizzy and it felt like a big departure from the book (even though the basis of the story was there).  I also missed the idea of seeing the reaction of Anne's family when they announce their engagement which always brings a smile to my face.    3. The use of Mrs. Smith in the last 10 mintues - While I think it was admirable for the movie makers to try to include her character in with the uncovering of Mr. Elliot's true character, it didn't fit when they had cut out all the back story of the past involving Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Smith's husband.  How did she come across this information?  Also, if she is a poor, sickly widow why is she out in the streets of Bath looking for Anne?  It just didn't add up in my mind.    Overall, this version was well made and the performances of the 2 lead charcters make it worth watching, it just didn't have that special spark to make me like it better than the 1995 version.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Bought the set for Christmas and ended up as the best gift that I had received.  Great setting along with wonderful performances from all who had contributed.  Loreena McKennitt truly gives the best performance that I've seen in 20 years.  Along with the excellent produced dvd,  one receives an added bonus of two cds.  All in all I would have paid twice the price for the set and would have still be 100% satisfied. Buy this set.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Out of all the new adaptations being done, I was most looking forward to Northanger Abbey (mostly because it is my favorite Jane Austen book and no decent movie of it exists).  I am very happy to say that I was not dissapointed.  The casting of this movie was spot on.  The movie had a great flow to it and was never dull.  Catherine's dream sequences were just as I imagine them from the book.  I think my favorite performances (outside of Catherine & Henry who were both perfectly cast) were those of General Tillney and Isabella Thorpe who were exactly how I pictured them when reading the book.  This is one Jane Austen adaption that I am eager to purchase and watch again.  I think true fans of the book Northanger Abbey will not be dissapointed in.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|This is by far Marillion's best effort. Every song stands out as an essential piece of Marillion history. As a die hard Hogarth-era fan it is hard for me to say that any album could surpass the immortal and highly celebrated Brave album but the two-disc version of Marbles has surpassed it by miles. Why do I say the two-disc version? Two words - Ocean Cloud.
0307388840|5.0|Upon reading `Atonement' one is completely removed from their lives, their places of dwelling and time of departure and transplanted to a place where nothing is familiar yet everything is impressionable.  Being the first novel I've read by the acclaimed novelist Ian McEwan I was immediately made aware of his immense talent.  The tale presented to the reader is one of remarkable effectiveness, one that is truly relatable and believable and in the end of dire importance for its overall moral is one that transcends the boundaries of this prose and cements itself in our very being, in our every interaction and in our constant memory.  Separated into four sections `Atonement' is broken down in such a way as to make the true conclusion all the more shocking and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Part one retells the events on one especially harsh summer day in 1935.  I say `especially harsh' mainly because by the days end events take place that harshly affect the lives of everyone involved.  13-yearold Briony Tallis is a smart and imaginative young girl and she becomes the main focus of our attention as we hear of the day's events.  As she attempts to orchestrate a theatrical production in honor of her brother Leon's arrival home she is met with a few snags and some ominous distractions that put her initial plans on hold and send her into a newfound direction.  As the relationship between her older sister Cecilia and their housekeepers son Robbie begins to take a turn Briony finds herself in the know of a serious misunderstanding that changes the course of everyone's lives.  With their three cousins Lola, Jackson and Pierrot visiting as well as Leon's friend Paul Marshall the house is quite full on the evening in question, so when events take a turn for the worse there are so many more eyes to cast their judgment.<br /><br />Briony is a very interesting character.  I found it truly fascinating as her character unveiled itself with each turning page.  Her immaturity is emphasized by her incessant need to be the mature one despite her inability to do so.  She's lost in her writing, an obsession that causes her to read deeply into matters that aren't her concern and imagine the possibilities no matter how devastating they may become.  She also allows the actions of others to affect her too deeply, finding herself reacting irrationally and this leaves her in a position to do much harm.  It's hard for the reader not to find themselves calling Briony out as the villain here, for it's her needless actions that cause so much pain, but in reality she's nothing more than a young child who was invested in a poor decision.<br /><br />So, with an accusation made and a terrible crime committed we brace ourselves for the second and third parts of the novel where we follow Robbie and Briony respectably as they strive to patch up their lives.  Robbie has been through hell, literally, and in the second part of the novel we follow his journey as he strives to get home from the war.  The horrors he is witness to, the atrocities he is privy to are all sprawled out for us is detail, as is his dire need to be reunited with his lost love Cecilia.  The third part covers Briony's struggles as a nurse during the war, but more importantly her struggles within herself for some ounce of atonement for her sins.  She has grown up since that summer day, not only in age but in understanding, and she is finally able to grasp the seriousness of her lies.  The pain she has caused will never fully be undone, but she desires to do all she can to write them.<br /><br />The novel opens with such a brilliantly conceived idea, and is so effortlessly and elegantly penned that one is immediately engulfed in its design.  I for one could not put it down and read the entire first section in one sitting.  Sadly the second a third sections do not read as briskly, but their importance is all the more secured by the closing section as elderly Briony recounts her actions and the ultimate consequences of them all.  The final pages are chilling to say the least, and are completely unexpected, so much so that the tears running down my face had all but dried before I realized I was crying.<br /><br />`Atonement' is a brilliantly orchestrated tale of pain, despair, loyalty, betrayal and the ultimate yearning to make amends, to find atonement for our sins and attain forgiveness for our souls.  Truly one of the most inspiring and ultimately absorbing novels I've read to date.al pages are chilling to say the least, and are completely unexpected, so much so that the tears running down my face had all but dried before I realized I was crying.      `Atonement' is a brilliantly orchestrated tale of pain, despair, loyalty, betrayal and the ultimate yearning to make amends, to find atonement for our sins and attain forgiveness for our souls.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|If ever there was an album, a soundtrack that truly captured the vibe of the film in which it cataloged, `Into the Wild' is that soundtrack.  Each and every track here is designed to bring you on Chris McCandless' journey.  With stripped down acoustic background and Eddie Vedder's signature growl these songs are a perfect compliment to Sean Penn's wilderness adventure.  I truly believe that Vedder was the perfect choice for this endeavor and it gave him a chance to spread his wings and sour outside of the confines of Pearl Jam and deliver to us his debut solo project.<br /><br />Any fan of the cult grunge act Pearl Jam will immediately be drawn to this album for it gives them a chance to get a taste of Vedder unplugged.  But even those who are not typically drawn to Pearl Jam can enjoy this album because it's more of a mood piece, a venture from Vedder's roots and plays beautifully along with the images from the film.  The majority of the tracks are short and simple, the guitar work doing most of the talking and this adds to the attraction for there is no feeling of being bogged down by each passing track.  It's a brisk musical adventure that flows wonderfully from one track to the next and before you know it the album is over and you're tempted to hit replay.<br /><br />The guitar work is a beautiful thing to listen to and must be singled out.  Aside from Vedder the guitar is really the only other star here and it shines as brightly if not brighter than Vedder himself.  Tracks like `End of the Road' and `Tuolumne' strip away Vedder's vocals and allow us to embrace the power of the music.  The finger plucking structure adds to the feeling of being alone in the wilderness and actually reminds me of all those chilly nights I spent hunting with my friends, huddled around a camp fire playing the acoustic guitar and relaxing.  It's a very serene feeling, one that is cultivated so well within these eleven tracks.<br /><br />From the opening `Setting Forth' to the closing track `Guaranteed' `Into the Wild' delivers a magical and moving journey.  While tracks like `Far Behind' and `No Ceiling' have a very upbeat feel to them and remind the viewer what it was that made Vedder famous in the first place it's tracks like the haunting `The Wolf' that prove this is as much an experiment for Vedder as it is for us.  `Rise' and of course `Guaranteed' have garnered much critical praise and rightfully so.  `Guaranteed' is provided to us twice on the album, in vocal form and in a hidden hummed version, both impressive and emotionally moving.  My personal favorite track here is `Society', a track a feel captures the grace and tranquility the entire album was aspiring to attain; truly a beautiful and moving piece.  `Long Nights' comes close to this feeling.  `Hard Sun' is another track that stands out for its sheer difference from the balance of the album.  It's more along the lines of Pearl Jam than any other track here and breaks the acoustic formula.<br /><br />As a whole `Into the Wild' is a beautiful collection of songs that only further my determination to soak up McCandless' tale.to the Wild' delivers a magical and moving journey.

B0000062FJ|5.0|With this album, Santana ignited the stages materializing a dreamy project that previously had nestled in the minds of Tito Puente and Carl Tjader, which was to blend with supreme perfection an old desire, the best of the Latin music, the seductive African rhythm and enrooting with basic principles of the jazz; the result was an album whose resonance has widely overcome the test of time to become since the days of its immediate classic. Since the first time I listened it, I perceived it by intuition, so after thirty seven years elapsed, this recording has wrought its own landmark and enviable place among the famous status of cult recordings.

B000005JA8|1.0|Captain Beefheart's \\"Safe As Milk\\" is one of my all-time favorite albums. I listened to \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" all the way through, once. I'm glad I did but I can't imagine I'll ever do it again. It is avant garde and experimental, and there are bits that are listenable but on the entire of album of 28 pieces there is not a single one that is listenable all the way through, not one that I would put on my iPod so that it might come up in random play. It is a huge disappointment.

B000U1ZV8K|5.0|The Lethal Weapon movies are some of the best buddy/action/comedy movies ever.  This two disc set includes all four movies in the Lethal Weapon series for the price of one movie.  Each of the movies is shown in the Director's Cut edition.  There are trailers for the first three movies, but not for LETHAL WEAPON 4.  However, LETHAL WEAPON 4 does include a commentary with director Richard Donner.  If you're unfamiliar with the Lethal Weapon franchise, a brief synopsis of the films follows.<br /><br />LETHAL WEAPON is the first movie in the series and introduces the unlikely cop team of Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson).  Murtaugh is fifty-years old and a veteran officer.  Riggs is an up-and-coming star of the police force, known for his atypical style.  They are partnered together and become close friends while working to bring down a major drug cartel.  Besides being just a good movie, LETHAL WEAPON is also notable for being the movie that made Mel Gibson a box officer superstar in the United States.  Mel became famous because of Mad Max, but it was LETHAL WEAPON that made him a household name in the U.S.<br /><br />LETHAL WEAPON 2 continues a few years after LETHAL WEAPON.  Murtaugh and Riggs are still partners.  Once again they are on a drug case, but this time it's an international drug ring of diplomats from South Africa with diplomatic immunity.  They are also put in charge of protecting a key witness and informant, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who becomes a great secondary character in the series.  Also, Riggs falls in love and pulls a house off a cliff.  As a bit of trivia, Riggs was supposed to die in this one, but the studio called for a rewrite knowing how successful the franchise would be.<br /><br />The Lethal Weapon series was going to be a trilogy wrapped up with the retirement of Murtaugh at the end of LETHAL WEAPON 3.  After thirty-years on the force, Murtaugh is finally going to retire.  However, eight days before the big event he and Riggs become involved in a case of gun running and cops gone bad.  Riggs finds lasting love with an internal affairs officer, Lorna Cole (Rene Russo).  Leo Getz also returns.  This film is the weakest of the Lethal Weapon movies and the studio wisely decided to bring everyone back for one last film.<br /><br />LETHAL WEAPON 4 brings back the entire cast of the Lethal Weapon films for one last go-around.  Lorna Cole is pregnant with Riggs' child.  Murtaugh's eldest daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe) is secretly engaged to Detective Lee Butters Chris Rock) and has a baby on the way, too.  Meanwhile, Murtaugh and Riggs get entangled in bringing down a Chinese king pin, Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li) determined to move his operations from the Orient to Southern California.<br /><br />If you don't already own the Lethal Weapon movies, this is THE DVD you want to own.in a case of gun running and cops gone bad.

1580493939|5.0|Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book.  Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over.  I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read.  To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.<br /><br />I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever.  Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings.  Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.<br /><br />Summary without giving too much away:  Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story.  His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him.  Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life.  Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran.  Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit.  His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life.  Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road.  Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.<br /><br />Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth.  In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth.  And what if someone believed in these lies?  What if they lived their life according to what they had been told?  Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him.  This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning.  There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them.dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth.  And what if someone believed in these lies?

B000WMFZMY|5.0|Producer Samuel Bronston's masterpiece, the 1961 epic, \\"El Cid\\", is at last on digitally-remastered DVD, in a two-disc edition that positively glows! The finest (and most expensive) 'Chivalry' film ever made, the film combines intimacy and monumental battle scenes (without CGI!), drenched in an opulence that will never be equaled.<br /><br />One of the great pleasures of this long-awaited release is the second disc's Special Features, which provides the astonishing back story of the film, as well as features on Bronston, director Anthony Mann, film composer Miklos Rozsa, and \\"El Cid's\\" incredible restoration process. This was a film that defied the 'Hollywood system' in every way; Bronston, a freewheeling, frequently in-debt entrepreneur, stonewalled in Hollywood, literally turned Madrid into a film capital, spending every penny he could raise, every favor he could ask, in producing the film with all the richness it deserved. With a 'terrible' screenplay (by Philip Yordan), that an uncredited Ben Barzman would have to rewrite from scratch, as filming began, a respected director (Mann), who had just been publicly humiliated by being fired as director of \\"Spartacus\\" (replaced by Stanley Kubrick), and two of the hottest actors in the world (Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren), who despised each other (Heston, with a history of on-set temperament, particularly toward female co-stars, discovered Loren was being paid more than he was!), this production seemed doomed from the outset.<br /><br />But Bronston was a man of limitless vision and energy, and could accomplish miracles! He got the DuPont family to financially back the production, convinced Spanish dictator General Franco to loan him nearly the entire Spanish army for battle scenes (second directed by the legendary Yakima Canutt), recruited entire villages to serve as extras, and backed Mann's vision, creating one of the most beautifully composed films in the history of the cinema.<br /><br />Much to everyone's (except Bronston and Mann's) surprise, \\"El Cid\\" was a worldwide critical and commercial hit, and one of 1961's biggest blockbuster successes, influencing a generation of young filmmakers, and becoming a capstone to the careers of many of the participants.<br /><br />While it is a crime that the film has been largely unseen for over forty years, this 2-Disc Deluxe Edition should again bring \\"El Cid\\" the respect it richly deserves.<br /><br />It is absolutely ESSENTIAL for any film lover's collection!pt Bronston and Mann's) surprise, \\"El Cid\\" was a worldwide critical and commercial hit, and one of 1961's biggest blockbuster successes, influencing a generation of young filmmakers, and becoming a capstone to the careers of many of the participants.<br /><br />While it is a crime that the film has been largely unseen for over forty years, this 2-Disc Deluxe Edition should again bring \\"El Cid\\" the respect it richly deserves.<br /><br />It is absolutely ESSENTIAL for any film lover's collection!
B0001VV1GK|3.0|I really wanted to like the Parking Garage and PlanToys as a company.  The company is eco friendly, has good looking toys and uses real wood.  The concept is excellent -- a moving elevator, ramps for parking on multiple levels, well marked parking spots, a parking attendant that sits and stands, gas pumps, a car wash and a heli-pad.  What's not obvious is that only a single car is included.  This should be clearly marked.  There is no helicopter either.  Ever see a single car in a parking garage.  It's lonely.  Despite this, my son has been playing with the garage on and off and seems to enjoy it.  One design issue is that the gas pumps are very difficult to reach.  They are exciting but impossible to play with.  My big issue with the toy however is that the red wood has come apart from the second floor after about a weeks worth of occasional play.  In contrast we have many Haba toys that are true quality wood and last forever.  I was expecting significantly more given the price of this toy.  I will contact the manufacturer for some sort of resolution.  Will post follow-up.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|The movie is great, but dont buy it in Blu-ray. It has the worst quality i've seen in a movie in a loooong time. Alot of the movie is fuzzy and semi-distorted. They didnt take enough time to remaster it digitally. DONT BUY IT. get it in regular form it is a great movie.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell is a beautiful singer, and contains a beautiful voice.  Furthermore, she has a beautiful variety and distinct sound to her music.  Are you getting tired of hearing me say the word \\"beautiful\\"?  No other word will work, sorry.    Why radio stations completely ignore this masterpiece I'll never understand.  A quality album that triggers some of the strongest emotions a human being can possibly have.      There's a reason everyone likes Joni Mitchell.  When you combine a perfect voice with perfect range to a distinct style of songwriting, you can't lose.  Justin Hayward from the Moody Blues said he loves Joni's music, and that's another reason to check out this album.  I can see why.  Both singers have an amazing range and melodic style that pleases me on a personal level.    Now you know what you have to do.  You have to pick up the Blue album and enjoy one of the greatest musical achievements of the 70's.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Let me start of by saying that I'm not normally a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan.  Aside from What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Gangs of New York, nothing he's done has really impressed me much.  However, in The Aviator, he may have just given his career performance.  He truly owned the role of Howard Hughes in this picture.  DiCaprio perfectly captures Hughes' no nonsense approach to business and life.  As the film progresses, and Hughes' mental condition slowly deteriorates, DiCaprio depicts eloquently the turmoil Hughes must have felt.  To see such a brilliant, driven man gradually lose control of his life and mind is heart wrenching to say the least.  The casting for this movie was perfection.  Gwen Stefani sporting the platinum locks of Jean Harlow, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, and a brilliant turn by Cate Blanchette as Katherine Hepburn.  It's my feeling that it's more difficult to portray a real person as opposed to a completely fictitious one and everyone in this film excels in this capacity.  Alec Baldwin is especially seedy as Juan Trippe, the head of rival Pan Am.  I love John C. Reilly as Noah Dietrich.  I think he's a very underappreciated actor and he's excellent here as always.  Of all the performances though, I was especially impressed by Alan Alda's portrayal of Senator Brewster, who makes quite a bit of trouble for Hughes.  It was a different kind of role than what I'm accustomed to from Alda and he really makes the most of it.  His back and forth with DiCaprio at a senate hearing was the high point of the movie for me.<br /><br />Howard Hughes was a larger than life figure in his time and this movie was an excellent representation of his ambitions, romances, and accomplishments, as well as his setbacks and implied eventual disintegration.  I like the fact that Scorsese chooses to end the picture where he does, just after the successful flight of the Hercules.  During the celebratory party, Hughes ends up in a bathroom, compelled to repeat the same phrase over and over again.  The film leaves us with the legacy of Hughes as The Aviator, a man who contributed a great deal to the industry of avionics in this country and foreshadows his fall into seclusion and madness without forcing us to watch the tragic end of this great man's life.ver and over again.

B000002I2G|5.0|The Doors \\"Soft Parade\\" doesn't deserve the criticism it has received for being a jazzy album with brass sounds.  The main focus is of course on the songwriting, which is really JUST as good as it has always been (since the debut).    Every song entertains me and I'm really glad I can listen to this album over and over and continue to get a huge amount of enjoyment out of it every time.  That's the truth too.  I love the jam on the title song, and \\"Tell all the People\\" has a brilliant vocal melody.  It doesn't lose its momentum either, for the entire run, baby.      I can't believe people are still criticizing it.  For what?  It was a slight change in style, I admit.  I mean, it doesn't have that mysterious spooky edge that made the first three albums so brilliant.  But remember, songwriting is something NOT to be underrated.  That's something you can never ignore.  Quality is quality, and the Doors deserve to be remembered for having a very successful career with consistently enjoyable songwriting-dominated tracks.  Great album.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I must say, we have many Nerf guns.  And while they are all played with, this one is the most desired.  It always receives \\"ooohs\\" and \\"ahhhs\\" and of course, \\"that's so cool!\\".  It is very durable, and my son likes to show his friends all the things it does.  While I don't think it is very educational at all, we have seen more than our money's worth out of use.
0312995423|3.0|First, the good news. Writing a \\"commercial\\" thriller is harder than it looks (otherwise we'd all be millionaires), and it's clear that Dan Brown worked hard from the beginning to master all the tricks. Even in this, his debut novel, he shows many of the novelistic skills that would later contribute to the success of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"... specifically, he keeps throwing twists at you and seems to have mastered the \\"cliff hanger\\" style of writing.    It's odd, then, that Digital Fortress sold only a few thousand copies initially, while Da Vinci Code is up to 70 million in sales. What gives?    Well, look at the bad news. There are many small errors that people quibble with in Digital Fortress, but there is one logic error in particular that is huge. The Digital Fortress of the title is a supposedly unbreakable code, the algorithm for which is posted on the Net. However, the code itself is used to encrypt it. The code is allegedly unbreakable because the public key is insufficient to break it; you also need the algorithm itself. So various characters spend the entire novel chasing down the key. However, by Dan Brown's own logic, that means that the premise doesn't make any sense... because he already told you that the key itself is not enough!    This may seem complex, but trust me, if you read the novel and think about it, you'll see that the premise of the story is illogical.    Beyond that, the style is flat and the characters are little more than archetypes, just as they are in Brown's other thrillers. In this case they are a beautiful woman who works for the NSA and her Georgetown prof husband. Odd, then, that Da Vinci Code should be so much more successful. Put it down to Dan Brown's talent for throwing you lots of plot twists and puzzles to solve. In Digital Fortress, these puzzles are not nearly as intriguing as in Da Vinci Code. In particular, he milks the ending of Digital Fortress for far too long. Good idea, but by that time we've had enough twists to satisfy us... and let's face it, the bad guys are already dead. He shoulda found a way to end more crisply, not overstaying his welcome.    That being said, you have to give him some credit even in this debut novel for proving that he could keep the twists coming.
B000059HCN|3.0|This movie is very odd - too many different stories going on at one time.  It does show the harness of using drugs though.
0553805460|5.0|I was at the airport in Chicago when I saw the book on the shelves. I was looking around for something to read the next few days because I was going to be on planes for 3 days. I saw that book, and the title just seemed perfect. And with on cover page saying, lived like a king partied like a rockstart, my rise and fall. Thats some good marketing right there. So I decided to buy it.      I simply couldn't believe this story. Incredibly wild. I couldn't put the book down. I read it on all my flights in those 3 days. I enjoyed the way he wrote this story. But mostly, I felt, in a way, everyone wants to be that guy he writes in the story. Most people want that crazy adrenaline life, to be the outlaw and never get caught. But thats not reality. So in my opinion it must be in the top 5 books i've read in my life.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I was very disapointed in this version of Persuasion. The interesting characters were not developed.  Nothing that made the book so delightful came through in this version of the movie.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|This album has always been one of my all-time favorites, but the sound on this latest remastered edition knocked my socks off.  The DVD of a long ago concert is fun--better-than-expected video of the oh-so-young boys running through the numbers; reminded me of why they got my attention from their earliest songs!
1577314808|1.0|No Other Gospel (Galatians 1:6-10)    6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- 7 not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.    10 For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant [2] of Christ.      This is a different gospel... it sounds good because it appeals to a human's way of thinking..but do not be mistaken, this is not from God. Also please realize, that anything that is not from God is from the Deceiver.  Pray that God would reveal the truth to you.      Romans 3:21-24  21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it-- 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus    God bless and God lead.
0979660742|5.0|The original Elements of Style is a must have for any creative writer or student.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|In the 1980s, the pop music landscape got littered with synth-pop - synthesizer and keyboard-laden sounds. The 1990s music landscape saw Alternative Rock begin to basically become part of the mainstream music fold. Alternative Rock began to incorporate a more natural guitar-laden sound emphasizing both electric and acoustic guitars.   To some extent the dominance of the guitar-laden sound has put keyboards and synthesizers in the background.   Many have made the argument that the music of the 2000s has a \\"cookie cutter\\" sound.   This has alienated some hard-core music fans and is definitely a contributing factor to the music tailspin that has taken place in the 2000s.   As a result, the music industry has become ripe for a new sound.     In 2007, a Canadian band from Montreal emerged seeming ready to take the mantle.   Arcade Fire's sophomore full-length album, \\"Neon Bible\\" might be a \\"dark\\" sounding album, but the incorporation of an orchestral sound brings a much needed change of pace to the \\"cookie cutter\\" sound of the 2000s.   In fact, I'll feel this might be the best thing to happen to the music industry in 25 years - and easily helps \\"Neon Bible\\" claim the title as \\"Best Album of 2007\\"    In the early 1980s, I remember telling people that U2 was going to become the next big sensation in music.   I wasn't alone in those thoughts as I had heard many people echo those thoughts.  When \\"Neon Bible\\" made the airwaves in 2007, I remember hearing a lot of positive things about the band.   Once I heard \\"Neon Bible\\", I was convinced that I had now heard the next great sensation in music.   Arcade Fire didn't come from left field as their debut album \\"Funeral\\" had garnered some significant attention in the music industry.   \\"Funeral\\" had a very dark tone to it.  The sound of \\"Funeral\\" has an orchestral feel - with a big emphasis on the strings.   In a lot of respects \\"Neon Bible\\" expands on this sound by incorporating the use of a pipe organ and gospel choir type sounds.It are these instruments incorporated into some terrific arrangements that help this album stand above many others.    As for the vocals, these are primarily handled by the husband/wife duo that forms the nucleus for Arcade Fire - Wim Butler and Regine Chassagne.  It is Butler who primarily handles the vocals and Chassagne takes more of a secondary role.  Still having two vocalists makes the sound twice as good.   It adds to the appeal of this band and helps this album emerge as the best of 2007.    \\"Neon Bible\\" is going to be one of those albums requires several listens.  Each time you listen, it will grow on you and you will learn something new.   Here is a track by track synopsis.    \\"Black Mirror\\":  The title of this song sets the \\"dark\\" tone for this album and once you listen to the instrumentation, this backs it up.  The orchestral sound is alive and well, but it gets a great lead-in from some Timpani drums.   Listen to how Chassagne's vocals supplement Butler perfectly as this is a pattern throughout the whole album.    \\"Keep the Car Running\\": This has a bit of a mainstream and Rock feel. This explains why Bruce Springsteen covered this song in concert.  Great track.    \\"Neon Bible\\":  This is a slow and haunting track.  The chorus has a mantra-like feel to it.   Of all of the tracks on the album, it relies the least on instrumentation.    \\"Intervention\\": Home-run track.  The song opens with a pipe organ that continues throughout the song.   Here Butler's vocals really shine.   This song has a terrific \\"build up\\" to a crescendo that layers a Rock sound on top of it.  The choir adds a great effect.    \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\": This is a tale of two tracks.   Chassagne handles vocals in the first part (\\"Black Wave\\" - featuring some great French vocals) and Butler handles it on the second part (\\"Bad Vibrations\\").  Entire part has a dark feel, but it gets darker during Butler's part of the song.  The choir kicks in in the second half as well.    \\"Ocean of Noise\\":  This track opens with the sounds of the ocean followed by instrumentation that reflects the sound of the ocean.  The instrumentation almost has a Dire Straits feel to it.  The timpani drums really play a pivotal role toward the end of the track.    \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\":  This song has a true alternative rock feel to it as it opens, but listen to the outstanding instrumentation.   Chassagne's background vocals are spot on.    \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\":  This track has a guitar sound to it, yet it sounds nothing like the cookie cutter music of the 2000s.   The choir does a great job at supplementing the sound.  The sudden ending to the song fits perfectly.    \\"Windowstill\\": This might be the most underrated track of the album.  The orchestral-like sounds don't come in until midway through the track, but when they do - they add a perfect touch to this track.  Butler does a great job using his vocals to control the tempo of the song.    \\"No Cars Go\\": A terrific duet by Butler and Chassagne.   This song appeared on a prior EP (not counting that as a full album), but now has a deeper orchestral arrangement.  Another Home-run.    \\"My Body is a Cage\\":  This song has a feel a lot like the title track.  While the beginning doesn't rely on instrumentation, the ending does- using all of the power of the orchestra and pipe organ.   This is the perfect wrap-up song.    The liner notes include the lyrics, but I wish it would have done a better job at crediting the musicians that make up Arcade Fire.  The only question about Arcade Fire is can they keep this up in the future and truly take the title of the next great band?  Time will tell.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|I quite enjoyed this movie.  I didn't really know what to expect at first, as all I knew about it was that it is about a group of astronauts who are on a mission to put a nuclear bomb into the sun to keep it from burning out.  (By the way, how far in the future must it be if the sun has gotten so cold that there are six-foot snow drifts in Sydney, Australia?  At least we're not worried about Global Warming anymore.) Sounds a little far-fetched, but that's what makes it sci-fi, right?  Well, that's not the only thing that makes it sci-fi.  Without revealing too much, let me just say that there was a period of about five minutes when I feared that it had turned into a slasher film and I was going to be very angry, but it turned out okay.  This movie gets four stars from me because it made me jump a couple times and it even made me think a little, which not all sci-fi does.
B00000099Y|3.0|Back in 96' when I first heard this album, and being sixteen, I thought that this album was the be-all and end-all of rock/metal. I had never heard a band quite like this. And now I realize why. I didn't know much music back then.    Almost twelve years later, being much older now, I realize that this album has not retained that same impact for me.     I think the first thing that struck me after all these years is how disorganized of an album it is. There are a few tracks that seem to be thrown in for a joke (intermission, Die Eier Von Satan) , which leads me to not take them seriously. I say this because many reviews that I read regarding this album explain how deep and complex of an album it is. For me, it's really not. I think they had a lot of ideas to express, and instead of focusing on one central theme, they decided to throw many things at you, which ultimately leads to something that not only doesn't flow, but doesn't make sense.     Another thing that struck me was the overall musicianship. While these guys clearly play well, they don't play anything that is, at least musically, amazing. They are more rock than metal, and less progressive than many claim them to be. They don't have to play anything super complex to impress, but then they don't really deserve the, \\"progressive\\" label that they are normally given.     In the songwriting department, their structuring is heavily rock-based, and there isn't anything innovative going on here. The one place where I still find enjoyment though is in the minor harmonics that Adam Jones adds in the background to compliment the central themed-riff for a particular song.     Also, the vocals of Keenan are not as great as I remembered. I am still a fan of his lower vocals, but I am now completely turned off by his higher, \\"emo\\" (for lack of a better word) type vocals. I know that many are not going to agree with me here, but I find them unbearable now.     Yet having said all that, this album will always have a certainmeaning for me, as it was something I basically grew up with, from my teens into early adulthood. But like my Nirvana albums, it's more nostalgia than an appreciation for the art itself that will bring me back for further listenings.     I give this album a three out of five stars because it's more good than bad, but it's far from great.
0060512806|5.0|So what if it is almost 1000 pages long ?   This should not discourage you, au contraire: covering the last 50 years - from WWII to the Internet, from the Nazi Enigma machine to the modern code breaking techniques, from USA to Europe to Asia, using a language that is so Stehephenson-ique - funny, but still educating, entertaining while teaching us so much.  One of the best Neal has ever produced. I wish his other books would have the same quality, but unfortunately they do not.
0761129235|5.0|I finished this book yeaterday and immediately started implementing it in my own life which I am sure I will do for the rest of my life. What really has my mind working overtime on though, is the thought of using these techniques in education. I always have tried to take small steps, starting at the beginning with my students and have small rewards, and those are the things that worked. I hope to figure out how to package this for teachers, schools and for use in the classroom.<br />Send me an e-mail if you have any thoughts on the matter.
0784011923|4.0|Seriously, the movie is fine, but there is nothing special about this copy. It has some advertisements that differ from the original release, and the box art is obviously different, but that's it. Go buy the DVD; it probably has a lot more to offer.
B000I2JKFQ|2.0|Well, the release date has been played around with a few times, not that that hurts it. Todays the 29th and its out. The 3 prior body snatcher movies were excellent and really did somehow intertwine the social feelings of each era in which they were released. They were all very impactive in that sense. This current film which uses all the body snatcher cliches to the hilt, misses the excellent chance of fully capitalizing on a post 9/11 worldview. A few backround tv scenes covering world events was an overly overt attempt at putting a sociological stamp on this version. It mostly failed.                                  I dont feel its important for me to rehash the storyline because everyone(except for one reviewer living under a rock)knows the premise of a 'body snatcher' film. I bought the film in HD expecting to see at minimal some thought provoking ideas. So much was left out that could have been interjected in a concrete way. What I'm trying to point out is the missed opportunity of capturing our CURRENT era, and all that comes with it. I have to admit though, when this film is looked back on several years from now it might show some distinctions. Can we get away from the immune child notion? Its a sort of forced storyline to invoke heartfelt compassion. In turn, those scenes looked just short of a big tv movie. Important fact; body snatcher movies NEED PODS. Very cool techniques could have been employed with pods these days. Vomiting on individuals was disease oriented but came off a little silly. Their was some jumping around in the film that did't quite fit. Trying to show you one scene ahead with the action while they were in another totally messed up as far as editing.                                    I wanted to like it, and their were some good parts. The changing bodies were realistic, but I was surprised their weren't more scenes that could have been creatively played with in regards to them. Nichole Kidman was decent and she had the proper look ofconfusion in the beginning. Her subway chase was alright. Daniel Craig was completely miscast and seemed to be walking through it. As a trivia point, Kidmans first patient is the actress Veronica Cartwright who was in the 1978 remake version. Unfortunately her speaking role was almost a duplicate of that version.                       The sci-fi idea of aliens attacking us and removing our true core is great stuff. Its such good stuff that I really expected more in this age of film making. It does go to show you that even this brand of sci-fi has a stopping point, and this is it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|These videos are amazing and a must own for HD/orBlueray owners to show off to your friends, because the visuals will blow you/them away!  I loved it and the guy narrating it is way better than Sigorney was, in my opinion anyway.  I am still stunned about how clear it is and detailed almost every scene is.  This is a must own for any HDTV owner.      Now yes, I would have liked some extra bonus footage, but do you really want to take back the BlueRay HD for the regular DVD for that reason only? If you do you're crazy because the pictures in HD are 100 times better than you will see on standard DVD.  This series needs to be owned by every HD owner, and nature lover for that matter (though Im no tree hugger I do appreciate this glorious work of art we call earth).  Purchase this with no hesitation.
0307346617|5.0|I took a chance and read this book because of the rave reviews and also i love end of the world type stories. This book had it all, my only regret it was only 300 some odd pages long..man a thousand would have been great. It was so hard to put this book down.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Great package, 2 CD's and 1 DVD of the greatest band of the century...Led Zeppelin. This package sounds even better and punchier than the original remasters, and comes with great a booklet and cool pictures. The DVD is great and will blow you away all on it's own. Throw these 2 CD's in your car cd player and I guarantee it will stay in your player indefinitely, you won't want to take it out. So many styles with so much dynamics and power, it's intelligent and muscular at the same time. Every song is fantastic. The musicianship and range is downright scary, and the sound production and arrangements will knock you out. It's all the more impressive when you realize that guitarist Jimmy Page produced all the albums himself, as well as wrote the bulk of the music. This man has ALOT of talent. The best rhythm section of all time, drummer John Bonham and bassist John Paul Jones, will pummel your senses with power, dexterity, and musicality. Tons of hooks and atmosphere. This is one band in which you need ALL of their albums without exception, this set alone merely scratches the surface of this great band, but it is a great teaser for the entire catalog. Buy it.
0307387178|5.0|This is a great book.  It was very difficult for me to put it down once I started reading it.  In fact, I finished it in one sitting.  I've never done that before.    I could have done without the side stories involving the other Alaskan adventurers and the author's own experiences.  I bought the book mainly to read about McCandless.  Thankfully these parts don't drag on and they only take up a small percentage of the book.    I think what I liked the most about the book were the witness accounts given by the people Chris encountered and Chris' writings (what few of them there were).  There is a letter from Chris to a widower named Ron Franz (not his real name) that is especially touching.  Even more touching was the fact that the old man took McCandless' advice.  That told me a lot about the kind of man McCandless was.    I don't understand a lot of the criticism aimed at McCandless with respect to going out into the bush ill-prepared.  Could he have used more supplies?  Yes, of course.  But the entire point was to do it with as little as possible.  Also, even though he could have used more supplies he still managed to survive for 112 days.  To me that says he was well prepared enough.  He would have made it out alive if he hadn't ate those moldy seeds.    Bottom line for this book:  If you like nature, true stories, mysteries, adventure, etc...this is a must read.
0679745653|5.0|Well written and cathartic. Be warned, don't go in expecting the movie; the characters are there, as is a simlar story, but the ending is different, and what was skeletal in the film is fleshed out into greater depth here. If you want an equivalent experience in film (though without one of the most strikingly romantic paragraph-long passages you'll find written in this language), try \\"Almost Famous,\\" which essentially has the same characters and plot points as this book.<br /><br />A touching rumination on wanting something that you know you can't have and shouldn't want, almost but not quite getting it, and come to terms with everything that means.
B000K15VSA|5.0|If you like Blade Runner a whole lot then buy this. If you're a casual fan or have never seen it don't. The toys inside are kind of neat and the case is great for storing your Dungeons and Dragons figures in. I've seen nearly every TBS broadcast of Blade Runner and finally having a copy without commercial interruptions is awesome.

B000RL4GS4|5.0|First heard these guys on 98 Rock back in the Summer and couldn't believe my ears.  They are awesome!  My hubby managed to get me the import and I've played the heck out of it.  I too, went to the show in Baltimore and they rocked the house.  And they were nice guys too, to boot!  They came out afterwards and talked to everyone and signed until the bouncers threw everyone out of the club.     The album is great, there are no dogs on it in my opinion.  It's a must for anyone who likes old school metal.
B000002LND|5.0|'The Immaculate Collection'confirms once and for all Madonna's mastery of the pop single. This set contains about 80% of Madonna's singles of the<br />period 1984-1990 plus two new songs 'Justify my love'and 'Rescue me'(both turned out to be top ten singles).  There are some important items missing like 'Who's that girl', 'Dress you up', and 'Causing a commotion'but they were replaced by not-so obvious choices like 'Into the groove, and it really works.  This is an important album, even if you don't care about Madonna. It summarizes a small but extremely signficant part of the music of the 1980's.

If you are expecting any light, fluffy songs...this is NOT you cd. It have more of an edge to it. It pushes more towards rock than the previous. The only song that I thought was ok but could've been better was Yeah...I felt that any 1st grader could have wrote it lyric wise. My favorites are..Chivas, Irvine, Be Still, Haunted, and Sober. Sober is a breath of fresh air. Her voice hits it perfectly. Sad that it haven't been a radio fixture.
0446577391|5.0|The third of the Camel Club books is the best. You must read the Camel Club, and The Collectors before reading Stone Cold to get the full effect of the trilogy. Great action and intrigue. Don't want to tell you about the plot, but it keeps you on edge right up till the end. This review is based on audio unabridged cd. A winner from David Balducci
B000NY12CI|5.0|Never underestimate the power of Nancy Drew. Ayaan Hirsi Ali read not only Nancy Drew mysteries as a child, but also English classics from the 19th century. They planted a seed of freedom that later gave her the inner strength to break away from an Islamic upbringing. This book is the story of that journey to inner freedom, which resulted in her fleeing to Europe and settling in Holland.  I posted this same review on my blog at hungerisgood.blogspot.com.    This book is captivating, because it is a window into the Islamic pattern of thinking. It causes me to ask questions. How would I as a man react if I were raised in that environment? Would I view women as second class citizens? In the Islamic culture men have all the power. Being part of the power base, would I be content in my power, or would I have compassion for the weak?    Are there any parallel situations in my culture? Are there any citizens that have no power? Women seem to be making progress in the work force today, although we read about the \\"glass ceiling\\" that they bump against in the business world. Racism seems to be on the wane, although there is still plenty of it around. Abortion is probably the most obvious example, since there is nothing more helpless than an unborn child.    Are there any patterns of thinking in Western culture that prevent me from clearly discerning the truth? Islamic culture certainly has preconceived ideas about life that causes them to make what we consider erroneous decisions. They are apparent throughout this book. What are my preconceived ideas, and what actions do they lead to?    Have you ever had your eyes suddenly opened to an error in your priorities or lifestyle? Did you change, or would the cost have been too great? For Ayaan Hirsi Ali, it was worth leaving her family and her culture. Would you do the same?
0143038419|5.0|I LOVED this book!  It is now one of my favorite books of all time.  Elizabeth Gilbert is funny and down-to-earth. She's someone I would want to be friends with.  The book ended and I wanted more.  Maybe I'll just have to take my own year-long journey now!
1401300529|5.0|For a relative history neophyte, but with a keen interest in the Korean War, this book provides a great historical setting as well as many personal stories of the Korean War. The title mentions it, but to be clear, this book focuses on the first year of the war, with a small portion devoted to the aftermath of the first winter. Halberstam is able to weave in stories from platoon and company soldiers to the larger picture between major world powers, which to me is the greatest strength of this book.    The research into the book must have been enormous but it shows with interesting details each solider remembered from particular battles, especially the major ones that Halberstam focused on (Naktong, Inchon, etc). A highly enjoyable read for me.

1594481717|5.0|Overall I really enjoyed reading this book. It was entertaining and informative at the same time. Pink organized the book in such a way that it keeps you engaged the whole way through.  Daniel Pink's book \\"A Whole New Mind\\", offers insight into methods of developing one's brain for a new era filled with creativity. This short, easy read details why we are entering this new era and skills that will be essential for success.   Pink starts off by informing his readers about the two very different sides of the brain. The left side controls logical thinking, while the right side controls more creative ideas. While it was once thought that logical thinkers controlled the workplace, Pink explains that a new era is arising in which creative thinkers will rule.      There are three main reasons for this power shift; abundance, Asia, and automation. Pink explains these reasons in more depth and provides suggestions of how to overcome these obstacles.    Pink introduces six skills that are key for individuals to develop in this new creative era. These senses, as Pink refers to them, include design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning. Pink then details what each sense entails and exercises you can do to develop these skills.    While explaining the skills, Pink weaves in stories about his own experiences. The stories help make the book more enjoyable.   I feel that Pink presented his arguments in a thought-provoking manner. As a college student I felt this really opened my mind and helped me realize I can have some fun with my work.  Although I don't think everyone needs to read this book to be successful, I feel that it will greatly open people's minds to help them become whole-minded thinkers.
1594481717|3.0|Daniel Pink's book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, takes the reader on a journey of brain discovery. Pink differentiates between the left and right side of the brain saying that the left is the analytical and sequential side while the right brain is creative and sees the whole picture. Pink says that through his six techniques of Design, Story, Empathy, Symphony, Play, and Meaning people can become better equipped for the future workplace.    It is easy to see that in this era design is incorporated into every part of our lives. America likes pretty things; from furniture to shoes someone, at one point, designed it.    Pink mentions that people are all about story telling in the 21st century. Stories appeal to our emotions and help us remember otherwise meaningless things. Instead of instructions, people remember facts more when used in context, through narratives.    Empathy is another concept that is needed in many jobs. Nurses, for example, will never have to worry about their jobs due to the personal contact they make with their patients. This kind of care cannot be outsourced to other countries.    Pink says that Symphony is being able to see the big picture and how things relate to one another. A concept that is very much right brained.  Play, Pink discusses, used to be such a taboo topic in the workplace, but now laughter has been shown to bring people closer together in the workplace.    Lastly, Pink talks about Meaning as the last of his six \\"senses.\\" People are now trying to find the meaning in things and in life rather than doing things just because.    Throughout the book, Pink incorporates quotes from research, people, and other books, making his facts come alive. His use of easy to understand language and integration of pictures makes this book a trouble-free read. Pink's well-researched ideas enhance his concepts such as the fact that L-Directed jobs are being outsourced to low wage countries. I don't agree with all of thethings Pink wrote about. I think left brained jobs are not being outsourced as quickly as Pink believes, and people should not worry. It is definitely important to pick up some right brained techniques and build up creativity, but people will still have their jobs in ten years, even if they are software engineers.
0765318741|2.0|I admit that I picked this book up after seeing the Will Smith movie of the same name. I thought the movie was fairly good and so, I thought, the book must be great. But this book is by far the exception to the `book is always better than the movie' rule.<br /><br />The main character, the last man on earth, is incredibly flat. He's your stereotypical, aging white man that turns to alcohol to ease his troubles. He mourns his wife but spends most of his time brooding and drinking. A daughter/child is mentioned early in the novella but then never again.<br /><br />The thing that endeared me most to the movie was the dog, Sam. It gave Will Smith's character depth and an excuse for dialogue. There is no dog in this book. There is no dialogue.<br /><br />The ending is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny. I would love to enlighten you all and save you the pain but I don't want to be a `spoiler'.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst part of this `book' is that it's actually only about 150 pages. The rest of the book is filler of other short stories. Fine. Except nowhere on the book (cover or back) does it say this. It felt extremely deceitful to not disclose that half the book was short stories. Also, there is no division between I Am Legend and the rest of the stories. After what was the last page of Legend, I turned it and kept reading because there had to be more. But that was it. No transition.<br /><br />This was one of the few times where I enjoyed the movie much more than the book.
1582701709|4.0|Yes, the movie does overhype old teachings, it does empathize on materialistic living, it looks glamourish but what do you care? You don't have to marry Rhonda Byrne to accept it.      The only downside I noticed is that it (purposely??) leaves out the importance of intention, which is the corner stone of similair (less spectaculair) teachings (Wayne Dyer/Silva Method/David Hawkins/etc). The intention is the key to make it work, it must be genuine. So here is the secret to \\"The Secret\\" for the critics: it will *only* work with humility.     By the way, this kind of stuff is perfectly backed up in the major religions.     Christianity: \\"The kingdom of God is within you\\" (God is not poor)      Hinduism: in the Gita Purana, Krishna explains to Arjuna that the individual Jivaman (the soul) is omniscient and omnipresent, it is perfectly free and has infinite potential.    I'd like to add that the concept 'existence' is not something without value, although *most* people do nothing more with it then going to work and watching television (and this movie is just what they need on their screen). Existence comes with inherited divinity, because existence is a gift from God.    My conclusion: Everybody has to see for themselves!    Have a nice day!
0679882820|5.0|I love this book.  My 12 month old daughter loves all the sounds that we make when you read this book.  It's so cute.
0273659030|2.0|The concepts the book presents are very powerful and clearly very useful for readers who want to learn about how to structure their thinking and communications.     However, the book itself is quite poorly written, which is surprising for an author who is considered to be a communication expert. Examples are quite antiquated and dry, and not all concepts are explained sufficiently enough. At a $70+ price, I cannot recommend this book and would suggest you consider alternatives.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|WOW, what a great album! The first CD album I've purchased in years. If you've had enough of the next American Idol, self-pitying & self-absorbed artists, pre-packaged girl & boy bands etc. and just want to hear some hard charging Rock 'n Roll then buy this album. These Aussie Pub Rockers pick up where AC/DC left off in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Great riffs and memorable choruses rival some of AC/DC's best work. Best of all despite the obvious comparisons to AC/DC these guys have managed to infuse their own energy and flavor to make this sound new and fresh. If you're a fan of good Rock 'n Roll this CD is guaranteed to get heavy play while you workout, jog, drive etc. This album is the soundtrack to your next fun weekend. Bravo!

B000002P2V|4.0|The Who seemes to take some flack with \\"Who are You\\" Some fans to this day still claim that they hate it, but I can't understand why. \\"Who are You\\" is a good album. Sure, it has a few bad songs, but I just dont see how any fan could label this horrid. We get a bit of a different sound with \\"Who are You\\", as alot of rock bands during this time peroid starting messing with synth sounds. Led Zepplin did it a year later with \\"In through the out door\\", Rush did it two years later with \\"Moving Pictures\\", and Yes had already been doing it for some time. Does that make it a bad thing. Not really, in fact I happen to like \\"The Who's\\" sound that they get on \\"Who are You\\" Lets face it, if you just getting into the band, and you are expecting a return of the Quadra album or Tommy, you arent going to get it with this album. YOu will get some great rock, as The Who always gave us, and even the two post moon albums are decent (I have not heard the newest release, so I cannot comment) Please add this to your collection if you are a new Who fan, and if you are an old fan that didnt like this years ago, try it again. Its still better then half the junk rock out there today. ENJOY
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie has a plethora of characteristics that make it remarkable, an ultra-funny script, endearing characters, superior graphics and animation, and the fact that it can be shared and loved by the whole family. However, being someone that works closely with the restaurant industry and that is en route to becoming a foodie, I was surprised by this film in terms of how well it presents the stereotypes that you are likely to find in this world. The use of satire based on these characters left me satiated and happy to have sat through a wonderful meal...err movie :)<br /><br />Every possible stereotype in the food world makes an appearance, from the bitter and lonely critic, to the egotistical chef that is not as good as others think, and he knows it. In the middle of this, we find an aloof young man starting out from the lower echelons in the kitchen of a famous restaurant, who could only succeed with the help of a real gourmet. The fact that this food connoisseur is a rodent is just a minor kink.<br /><br />I believe that most people will agree that watching this movie is a great experience, but if you are a foodie, you cannot afford to miss it. Enjoy!
0439813786|4.0|We started this book as our night time story.  It quickly turned into a family event.  Our daughter is 8 and loves to read but we didn't want her to be overwhelmed with the thickness of the book.  Once we started, we realized that it wouldn't have been overwhelming and she wanted to read it on her own.  However, no one wanted to miss the story (pictures or words) so we couldn't read it unless everyone was available.    A truly enjoyable book!  We loved exploring the artwork and spent as much time doing that as taking in the written words.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Daredevil The Director's Cut is kind of a redemption film for me.  I know Mark Steven Johnson wishes he released this film into theatres instead of the \\"cut & stitched\\" abridged version that didn't impress most.  After seing this film, I treat it as the original faithful artwork, while the theatrical release is just an imposter.<br />So many great elements were lost from this film.  All the extra material definately raises the movies credibility and worth.  And all for what? We cut it out to save bathroom breaks?  And we added a sex scene to appeal to lovers and perverts?  In my opinion, some of the artistic bits were cut from the film, in attempt to \\"Hollywoodize\\" the flick.<br />The Director's cut is the fan's movie.  I may be biased being a fan of comic book movies, but I think anyone could agree that the pieces taken out were not only to satisfy fanatics, but they were important building blocks to these characters and stories.<br />Every character has more meaning: Dardevil has a stronger relationship with her father, Elektra shows more of her Greek culture, Kingpin displays more cruelty, Bullseye becomes a better villain.  And did anyone say \\"Hey I saw Coolio in the trailer! Where the heck did he go?\\"  Well he's in this film and he's actually not a bad actor at all.  And finally, for those that wished there was more humourous dialogue between Foggy and Matt, your dinner is served.  I think the old/new jokes are funnier than the originals.<br /><br />Bottom Line: See Daredevil in an entirely new movie.  If you were dissapointed by the '03 film, then pick this up and I guarantee it will show itself as the \\"better\\" film.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I have watched all of the film adaptations of Persuasion, and this one does lack in certain areas, but is magnificent in others; mainly the set colors, costumes, locations, music score and casting.  I would agree with an earlier reviewer that Elizabeth was miscast (old looking), and Mary Musgrove makes me want to vomit, although she is meant to be shallow and irritating, so she probably is cast well upon further consideration. Other reviewers compare the 1995 Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version which was I think better than this version, but it also had many annoying cast members; Hinds is too old to play Wentworth, Root looks a bit too old, but her acting makes up for it, Clay and most of the Musgrove daughters are irritating and ugly. Elizabeth is not very pretty either, but her acting was great!)  For this version I was put off by Anne Elliot running through the street at first as well,.... although after watching it twice more I appreciated the director/etc.. attempting to capture Anne's feelings that she cannot get to Capt Wentworth fast enough to accept him since she thought that NEVER would she get another chance in life at happiness with him.  (I would run for my life to him as well!)  For those who are comparing the 95 Root version, I do recall Root running out of the concert in hot pursuit of Wentworth, which did not happen in the book and would not have happened, but it seems to be forgiven here by other reviewers.  Either way, Rupert Penry-Jones is a bit reserved, but dashing and gorgeous,(Move over Colin Firth, I have a new favorite!) and Sally Hawkins is perfect as well as Anne, she has a beautiful voice.  She really does capture Anne's internal turmoil and sadness well in her tone and expressions.  I would highly recommend this as well as the new Mansfield Park in spite of the deficiencies, other aspects of the films more than make up for what they lack, and I am always grateful for a fresh new adaptation of any of Austen's novels.
B00005MAM2|2.0|Ah yes, Akira.  After many years of anime fandom and having watched great movies like Perfect Blue and Vampire Hunter D, I expected this acclaimed anime to be best I had ever seen.  I read tons of reviews and decided it was time I watched it as well.  I sat in anticipation in front of my computer as the opening credits ran. But when the ended, I wasn't surprised by the 80s animation (I experienced plenty of that with Vampire Hunter D).  As the story progressed, I got attached to the characters and thought damn...WHEN DOES THIS END?!?!  The movie drug on and on and was FAR too long.  In the end, I felt like the writers just dragged out the plot for the animation (that isn't even really that great).  In the end, I was left thinking, \\"What the hell just happened?\\"  Oh well, I wasted 2 and a half or so of my life.  At least now I know what everyone is talking about...I just don't idolize Akira like everyone else.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|This was a great movie.  Ever since I read \\"The Beach\\" I have been following Alex Garland's writing career (novels have dropped off but his screenplays are stellar).  I should start this by saying that I am not a scientist and cannot support or deny the theory or technology used for the film.  What I can tell you is that they tell you what you need to know and don't get too hung up on the details.  You can read the plot synopsis to get the gist of this little thriller so I won't bore you with those details.  What I will tell you is that this is a science fiction film, but also a study of human behavior.  These people are on a mission to the sun and it haunts thier dreams.  Imagine spending two years behind a solar shield where the only thing in your line of sight is the sun.  It affects these people and that is the true purpose of the film.  The film also carries until about 2/3 of the way through without an antagonist.  Once this person makes thier presence known, it truly paints a picture of what obsession means and how people handle it.  The acting is average (Cliff Curtis and Cillian Murphy are awesome) and Danny Boyle as usual uses clever camera angles, a haunting score, and proves he can work well with special effects.  I give this movie 4 1/2 stars.  If you have a blue ray player, it is truly the only way to view this film.  Enjoy.
0380715430|4.0|This book manages to make the history of the English Language amusing and interesting. It is a thorough examination of words, how we use them and how they evolved - including swear words, cuss words, slang and everyday things like... why DID the yanks take the second 'i' out of aluminium?
B000022TSY|1.0|Jack Nicholson and the great soundtrack are really the only interesting or entertaining aspects of this film. I found myself fighting the urge to sleep, which was especially annoying after reading over and over again for years about what a classic, epochal movie ER was. If you want excitement, great story and script, great acting danger and an even better soundtrack from the same era, go for Performance or Get Carter. Avoid this snore.
B000001FSP|4.0|Love it! Sometimes you just need more than chocolate to make you feel better...  Marriane Faithful is more than Mick Jagger's Ex.. she is a talented and articulate song writer too. This album showcases her deep, smokey voice, but its not for the faint hearted. This is a great album to play after the big fight.. or break-up. Wallow in you misery withMarrianne.  Not recommended for those on anti-depressants.
B000000OA6|5.0|Much like Warren Zevon's \\"The Wind\\" album, \\"Innuendo\\" is the final portrait of a dying man.  At the time of it's recording, Freddie Mercury was in the last months of dying from AIDs.  Incredibly he threw himself into the recording process on days when he was physically able, and he and the band came up with what in my opinion is one of their best albums.  One would really have to go all the way back to \\"A Day At The Races\\" in 1976 to find an album that is even close to this one.  The majority of this disc deals with death, but incredibly it is not really a downbeat album and in fact finds Freddie and the boys in a reflective yet hopeful mood.  The album did not make too much of a splash in the U.S. although the single \\"Headlong\\" did get some AOR airplay.  It is a great rocker and one of the best singles the band ever release in my opinion.  Just about every song on this disc is great.  The one exception being \\"Delilah\\", a song about Freddie's cat.  Yea, it is pretty horrible, but I am guessing that the band let Fred indulge a bit on this one due to his condition.  Other than that the tracks are all strong.  The title track \\"Innuendo\\" is as loud and bombastic Queen at it's best with a nice Spanish guitar interlude provided by special guest Steve Howe (Yes, Asia).  Other highlights include \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"I Can't Live With You\\", \\"Don't Try So Hard\\", \\"Ride The Wild Wind\\", \\"The Hitman\\" and \\"Bijou\\".  Probably two of the most effective songs on the album are \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" which finds Freddie looking back on his life and forward to his demise.  The final track, \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is the high point of the album and really sums up Freddie and his love of the stage.  Even to this day when I listen to him belting out this tour de force it brings a bit of a lump to my throat.  When the Beatles ended their career the final statement on \\"Abby Road\\" of \\"and in the end, the love you make, is equal to the love you make\\", was the perfect coda for the end of the band.  To me \\"The Show Must Go On\\" has the same impact in its message.  With Freddie's final words \\"on with the show\\" he summed up the entire career of one of the most innovative bands in the history of rock n roll.  If you are a Queen fan and don't own this one you need to pick it up.end of the band.  To me \\"The Show Must Go On\\" has the same impact in its message.

B00076NYFU|4.0|I bought this Album when it was released, I couldn't believe the music being played by this group. I continued to buy their albums & just recently bought the new CD-In Search of The Fourth Chord, & the new concert DVD. The DVD is not available for the USA region. It's two bad this group never made it real big in the states they could easily have been the greatest Rock group in the whole world. They are the greatest Rock group in the world but most of the USA still doesn't know it. Buy this cd, turn it up and Rock & Roll.
B000000OE7|3.0|Although \\"Innuendo\\" was the last official Queen album, Freddie Mercury continued to record with the band right up until days before his death.  In 1995 surviving band members Brian May, John Deacon, and Roger Taylor decided to finish up some these tracks and the release them as the album \\"Made In Heaven\\".  A lot of the material here can be found on either Brian May, Freddie Mercury, or Roger Taylor solo albums, so much of this is not new.  I think that nostalgia may paint this album as a bit better than it actually is.  There are some good songs here and the music is good for the most part, but it does not flow together nearly as good as the best Queen albums, and had a definite pieced together feel to it.  This is a decent enough album for the Queen fan, but like Led Zeppelin's  \\"Coda\\" this was put together after the fact and to some extent it sounds like it.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|It really is hard to find a good science fiction film isn't it?  Most entries are actually fantasies.  This film purports to be a bit more technically believable than most; a mission is sent from Earth to reignite our dying sun.  People old enough to remember the Skylab missions from the early '70's might find something rather familiar about the interiors of the \\"Icarus 2.\\"  Speaking of historical notes, it's symptomatic of the declining importance of Hollywood to the film industry that all American allusions are missing from this film; fifteen years ago, that obviously wouldn't have been the case.  Half of the crew seem to have been recruited from Asia, the other half from feuding twenty-year-olds on a reality TV show. Though the film has many gloriously golden views of the sun, it ultimately degrades into another gory kill-fest.  Too bad; it had potential.
0439813786|5.0|As a future teacher, I love what this book is doing with the concept of text and literacy.  If you've read the other fantastic reviews here, you know that this text combines various genres of \\"text\\"--written words, illustrations, and pictures--weaving them seamlessly into a spellbinding tale that you won't be able to put down.  I came across it while I was searching for a book in the library; I ripped through it in 2-3 hours.    This book is on the cusp of all things modern. Because kids today have grown up in a world in which they use a variety of technology and multi-media, this book provides an opportunity for today's kids to use their technological literacy skills for intentional reading.  That is pretty cool.  This book represents what I think is the future of text--think about it: manga and graphic novels are wildly popular, and so are blogs.  This book incorporates many of those concepts into one.  For these reasons, it's going on my \\"recommended reading\\" list.  Check it out!  You'll be blown away.  Happy reading!
B0010HOZS0|1.0|Not knowing what to expect, I basically bought this movie based on the actors playing in it. (Nicole Kidman and Daniele Craig). I can't believe these outstanding actors lend themselves to a movie of such a low caliber. It reminded me of one of those low-budget sci-fi movies. After about 45 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and turned the movie off. Something I rarely do! Terrible \\"low-budget\\" movie!

B000ZK4466|3.0|I honestly didn't find anything truely memorable about this album. It is good in the sense that it is a huge progression from Amputechture... but in a sense even further away from the amazing sound they began on. doesn't really work for me.    the drums are a major weak spot for me... as a drummer myself, i realize that there is a difference in talent and technique. throughout the Bedlam I felt like there was a fairly constant barrage of loud flamboyant improvisation done by pridgen that really didn't help to compliment the songs. What i loved about theodore's style was how he acted as a backbone for the band. don't get me wrong, Pridgen is an AMAZING drummer... but i don't think he is ideal for the mars volta.     this album just doesn't feel memorable to me. deloused, frances, and amputechture made an immediate connection with me while this did not.    unless you are a diehard \\"mars volta can do no wrong fan\\" dive in, you will love it. it is a huge step for the band. but otherwise, give some songs a listen... it's not for everybody.

B000059T1E|4.0|This is a truly a masterpiece, and the re-mastered tracks sound great.  But one star off for the bonus tracks, especially for the one stuck in the middle.  I'm not a big fan of bonus tracks in general; they rarely add to the experience, but at least stick em at the end where they can be properly ignored.  The liner notes for the re-issue give a clue to their cluelessness: \\"Along with Fairport Conventions Liege and Leif, John Barleycorn Must Die stands as a pivotal statement in late 60's/early 70's British folk rock music\\".  Huh?  Did the person who wrote that even listen to anything besides the title track???
1594489505|3.0|It was hard for me to read this book without comparing it to the kite runner.  The story was pretty good but the author should have developed the characters a little more.  I learned so much about their background in the beginning but after each of them marries Rasheed the storyline becomes rushed.  If I had read this before kite runner I would have enjoyed it more but my expections were too high.
B000ZK4466|4.0|I'll give the Mars Volta this -- they can spin a concept album out of just about anything. In this case, a cursed/haunted ouija board from Jerusalem.<br /><br />And their fourth full-length album \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\"  is a suitably haunted, demented affair with some vibrant moments buried in the crazy lyrics and tsunamis of distorted, chaotic hard-rock. It just grabs you and pushes you to the edge, with the force of its dense music -- and if you like it weird, it's a blast.<br /><br />It starts off loud -- a blazing twisting bassline, hammering drums and Cedric Bixler-Zavala's howling vocals buried somewhere in the twisting melody. And it's folllowed the equally eruptive \\"Metatron,\\" a swirling storm of clashing riffs and sharp drums... really, it's like an extension of the first song,<br /><br />With the distorted buildup and electric riffs of \\"Ilyena,\\" the Mars Volta try out some different sounds -- blazing droning tsunamis of twirling bass'n'guitars, epic rockers with the power of a sandstorm, landslides of sputtering hoarse riffs, howling psychedelica, wailing laments, and the tight, serpentine power of \\"Ouroborous.\\"<br /><br />Admittedly, the Mars Volta can't keep up this energy continually -- \\"Tourniquet Man\\" is a messy tangle of distortion, horns, halfhearted drums and a continuous drone of synth in the background. \\"Askepios\\" flirts with this sound, but is saved from total boredom by its louder moments.<br /><br />The Mars Volta has been dabbling in this stuff for years now, though they stumbled with an album that was more about the weirdness than the music. Fortunately, while it has some limp moments, \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\" is more about the eruptions of vaguely psychedelic, extremely uncatchy hard rock -- in other words,  what they do best.<br /><br />They've also gained some polish to their stormy, tangled instrumentation -- lots of blazing riffs, machine-gun drums, and powerful basslines that sputter and twist together. These are tangled with some blaring horns and a mess of schizophrenic synth that can sound like anything from crickets to a landing UFO. At times it sounds like the instruments are being strangled, especially the guitar -- it's hard to imagine how those sounds are being produced by ordinary instruments.<br /><br />The disappointment? I don't know where \\"Tourniquet Man\\" came from, except perhaps the need for a single -- it's just a meandering electric guitar, loosely strung with some synth effects and a moment of sax. They don't even bother with drums -- it sounds like they didn't have their coffee that morning, and were performing in a daze.<br /><br />Good luck figuring out what Bixler-Zavala is singing, though. As always, his cryptically weird lyrics -- wormholes, sulfur, \\"an avalanche of Toltec bones,\\" Ouroborous and corpse-swapping -- are sung in his sharp, high-pitched voice, and then buried inside the music like another guitar. I'll tell you this -- it sounds like a musical apocalypse, filled with lust, dread and pain.<br /><br />\\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\" is exactly what it sounds like -- bizarre and crazy.

0061015725|4.0|Prey is an entertaining book by Michael Crichton that continues his genre of science fiction, made popular earlier with his wildly successful book \\"Jurassic Park\\".  He specializes in taking complex scientific theories and discussing the concepts to make them understandable to the layman.  Mr. Crichton melds this simplistic explanation of the science with a plausible scenario of science gone wild to write engaging science terror novels.<br /><br />In this book, Mr. Crichton tackles the concepts of nanotechnology, bioengineering, and distributed computer processing.  This page turner keeps you enthralled with what happens next in this story of a few days in Jack Forman's life.  Jack, the main character, is recently unemployed and he suspects his wife of having an affair at her high-tech company.  The combination of the science and the emotional attachment to Jack, will keep you reading this book until the very last page.<br /><br />This is a perfect book for people looking for a light read of some very heavy scientific concepts.  However, die-hard Crichton fans will be left wanting for more.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|The original cast and crew is back for round 2 of High School Musical.  This one features the kids from East High taking a break from school, getting summer jobs, and preparing for their future.  The music is original and inspired just like last time, and Kenny Ortega never fails to impress the audience with his 1st class dance choreography.  We see new sides of the characters in the story as well as a lot of the old sides that we learned from the original.  Zac Effron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and Lucas Grabeel never cease to amaze with their singing and dancing.  The movie is filled with great musical numbers, romance, comedy and much much more!  At the risk of going too far, I would dare to say that this is one of the rare sequels that outshine the predecessor.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I was really looking forward to watching this season.   Beause I loved all the previous ones, but i didnt really like how Lorelai married Chris. I guess it was good how it finally 'ENDED' their on and off relationship thats being going on since the start of the series, but it was just so sudden! Also how Lorelai only ended up with Luke right at the end of the season. I would of liked to see more romance between them (:  Rory and Logan ended badly. Quite a long relationship and it ends with Rory saying no to his marrige proposal and Logan walking off. I guess she did have a good point, and maybe if there was an eighth season, they would have ended back together some how.  I still enjoyed many parts of this season,   - How Sookie got pregnant again that was really funny!  And at lest they tied up most of the loose ends!    All up, I'm glad I bought this season (:
B000YDOOU0|3.0|Although this trio is out touring now, these are older recordings from the fall of 2005 (before the Mehldau project).  Not that that's bad, but calling this a \\"new\\" album is somewhat misleading.<br /><br />This is typical of Pat's more recent work - Absolutely great playing all around, but the tunes themselves are not particularly memorable.  If you've kept up with Pat's music over the years, you'll recognise some of these tunes from earlier albums.  It's nice to hear a different take on this material.<br /><br />If you want another jazz guitar trio album, you won't go wrong here - Pat does this stuff better than just about anyone and this album holds up well along with his earlier trio work.  Stronger tunes would've be nice, though...
B000MR9D5E|2.0|I ordered, sent back and reordered this DVD. None of them would play on my new DVD player. No problems with anything else that I currently have or have rented. Waste of my time.
0345409671|5.0|This was so different from her other books, but in a delighfully dark and good way. You really get sucked into the storytelling and you envision Lestat and his journey. It is full of religious passages and undertones, yet, it doesn't derail you from the fact that you are reading a wonderful vampire novel. Its all quite interesting, even for someone who is not religious. It is most definetely a controversial book, no doubt, but I found it stunning and amazing. It gripped me from beginning to end. Every character is filled with flaw and its heartbreaking at times and always mesmerizing. I have read it 3 times already and I could read it another 3 without ever getting tired from it, there is always new secrets to discover. A must read.
B000S56R1I|5.0|I've never heard of this guy until I happened to hear \\"Chicago\\" on my local radio station, WXRT. It is rare that I hear a song this perfect. A perfect mix of strings, woodwinds and brass. I immediately wrote down the artist's name, incorrectly.. After a few hours of searching I found \\"Illinoise\\" and downloaded \\"Chicago\\" and a few other tracks. This stuff is simply amazing. Such rich, melodious, thoughtful music. Hmm, soo good!    Do yourself a favor, buy this CD. It is a great cure for that toxic, top 40 goop.
0385504209|5.0|I finally decided to pick this up after everyone told me I simply must read this. This was a few years back when it dominated the number 1 best seller spot. So I finally did and literally could not put it down. It sucks you in and stays with you til long after you're done reading it. It is suspenseful and enjoyable with wonderful surprises and twists that I didn't see coming at all. And when you think its all said and done, well, you havent gotten to the ending yet...The writing is simple, but top-notch and informative when it needs to be. I wasn't really confused and the subject matter was utterly new and foreign to me. So I was glad I got a great history lesson, whether fact or fiction. I actually don't know anyone personally who has not read this and loved it. It deserves more than one read.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Well I saw this movie before I read the book so maybe I was not as biased as other may have been.  But I have to say thought that I thought it was incredible, I thought everyone was incredible in their roll really capturing the spirit of their character.  Sure some things were changed and re-arranged, but that generally happens with every adaptation of any book.  Plus the most important things were left in.
0671027387|4.0|I read this after DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, so I thought I would give this a go since I loved those 2. But the subject matter didnt really interest me. I normally wouldn't find a political/sci-fi mystery/thriller interesting, in fact, I would usually roll my eyes at somthing like this. But I was genuinely surprised and delighted. It is fast-paced and interesting without being bogged down by boring political mumbo jumbo. I don't know where this man get his ideas from. They are very original and this is no exception. It is a fun read and should not easilly be dismissed.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|Northanger Abbey is not, as noted by others, the easiest story to adapt to film and here I think they've only done a so-so job.  The casting is all right, the heroine is appealing if pretty sappy and the story hasn't been mutilated too badly.  However, like all the other new \\"Masterpiece\\" productions, Northanger rips along leaving out a lot and creating gaps that make the plot seem murky and/or really silly.  Overall, not that good and definitely not up to previous versions.  And, please, who decided that Gillian Anderson would make a good introducer for the new Masterpiece?  She's terrible and the new format, if that is what it is, is not an improvement.
