B0037SQ3C6|5.0|This is absolutely a must-have. Yundi's style is so graceful, clean, and poetic. It's just phenomenal!!<br />I confess I accidentally hit the \\"1star\\" button when I really meant to press the 5-star. There seemed no way to reverse it. I slapped myself for the mistake and assume the other 1-star giver must have done the same way :).
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Sequels have been a constant disappointment for me, with a scant few exceptions. However,  this book is quite a bit better than its predecessor, mostly in content. This begins the adventure you were waiting for all through the first and it doesn't disappoint.
B000HF2NTE|4.0|Go ahead and shoot dirt bag! good B movie, needs some work but lots of bullets and bad one liners
0756404738|4.0|This is book two in the Kingkiller Chronicles, subtitled Day Two. What a pleasure that this second book was at least as intriguing as the first! Mr. Rothfuss returns to his engaging characters and interesting world and expands both. At almost 1000 pages in hardcover, I was very sorry to come to  the end. There is still so much story to come. Once again, Mr. Rothfuss is so extraordinarily patient in unfolding his story. There is so much that the reader wants to know and he does not tell us. I suspect hat there is much that he will never tell us. Amazingly, we are not frustrated, because we also so interested in what he does tell us. This is very real storytelling talent on the part of Mr. Rothfuss. He introduces totally new peoples and cultures in several places in this book and I was immediately engrossed in them. Our hero and narrator is Kvothe. He tells his story in rich detail beginning in this book as a young man and a student. He uses his determination and wit to study at a magician's university. His talents as a musician and as a magician allow him to survive under adverse circumstances. While some of the themes and adversaries may sound predictable, Mr. Rothfuss renders them with such skill that nothing reads as hackneyed or derivative. He is so patient with unfolding his story that at the end of this second book of the series we still know nothing of a king killing. The premise continues that an older Kvothe is telling his story to a scribe (the Chronicler) who has special status. Kvothe has a companion who also has powers but we have no idea where he came from (beyond hints that he is a fairy), no ideas about his real powers. While we see something of the fairy world in this book we do not see anything about Bast. It is clear that Kvothe and Bast have a shared history and probable future, but it is interesting to see Bast surprised by some of the tale that Kvothe is telling. We want to know more about much, but neither our author nor Kvothe are there yet. We know that the current times for Kvothe are troubled and we suspect that a crisis is approaching, but we know nothing about it even at the end of this volume. This book was recommended to me by my young adult son and since then my adult sons have also read it. They are great fans of Brandon Sanderson. As you consider this book for your  young readers you may want to know that there is real jeopardy, violent death (not graphically on the page), intoxication, sex as irresistible lust, sex as natural attraction separate from love or commitment, and bullying. Although I could agree with some of the reviewers that the Felurian subplot seems disconnected, I prefer to suspend judgment because I believe that Mr. Rothfuss has plans to tie it together. After all, the presence of Bast seems to tell us that Kvothe does go back and manage once again to leave. While it shows some of the worst of human nature it also shows some of the best with value given to friendships, loyalty, kindness, resilience, integrity, music and hard work. Magic is present, but it is not used as a crutch to advance the narrative. When I finished this book I was wishing that I could start immediately on Day Three.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Broadchurch has a mysterious and dark tone.  The acting is realistic.  The characters are multidimensional.  It is similar to The Killing and Prime Suspect.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This story has approached life hardships in avery simple and humorous way..<br />Being different can make life very hard,but Simsion takes life as it rolls. I found myself laughing,but not is a viscous manner.<br />A good book to read ,to lighten your day.Having said this I appreciate the bullying and hardship in friendships,and I think this is shown well.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|If you enjoy the Buck Owens, Merle Haggard \\"Bakersfield\\" style of music, this is a terrific CD. It has lots of steel guitar and guitar picking, as opposed to strumming. Vince Gill & Paul Franklin were able to recreate some of the well known Owens & Haggard songs, without the feeling that they're \\"covers\\".
075640407X|4.0|This is the first book in the Kingkiller Chronicles. The actual subtitle is Day One. Mr. Rothfuss creates engaging characters and an interesting world. He writes with great talent. I was sorry to finish this book because I was enjoying it so much. That statement becomes a more powerful endorsement when you realize that the book is more than 600 pages. Our hero and narrator is Kvothe. He tells his story in rich detail beginning as a teenager and in this volume leaving off as a young man. He uses his determination and wit to gain admission to a magician's university. His talents as a musician and as a magician allow him to survive under adverse circumstances. While some of the themes and adversaries may sound predictable, Mr. Rothfuss renders them with such skill that nothing reads as hackneyed or derivative. He is so patient with unfolding his story that at the end of the book we know nothing of a king much less a king killing. The premise is that an older Kvothe is telling his story to a scribe (the Chronicler) who has special status. Kvothe has a companion who also has powers but we have no idea where he came from (beyond hints that he is a fairy), no ideas about his real powers and we see nothing of the fairy world in this book at all. We want to know, but he is not there yet. This book was recommended to me by my young adult son and since then my adult sons have also read it. They are great fans of Brandon Sanderson. This book is suitable for young readers although there is real jeopardy, violent death (not graphically on the page), intoxication and bullying. While it shows some of the worst of human nature it also shows some of the best with value given to friendships, loyalty, kindness, resilience, integrity, music and hard work. Magic is present, but it is not used as a crutch to advance the narrative. When I finished this book I was fortunate enough to be able to dive into the second book in the series. You will want to do the same.
B00CTT9646|4.0|I thought the movie was fabulous. Well-written, acted, and directed. I've already watched it 3 times in the week that I've had it.<br /><br />That being said, the only reason it's not getting 5 stars from me is the lack of special features.  There's no deleted scenes, no bloopers even, and as many other people have stated the &#34;Behind the Scenes&#34; stuff is split up across 3-4 different vendors.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|The game is addictive and habit forming.Love it.good for coordinating speed and skills.can be a little frustrating at times though
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works great for streaming Netflix, Google Play and even web sites via Google Chrome but it does not support Amazon Instant Video via an app or through web site casting.  The site itself can be &#34;cast&#34; but the video content can not.  This is very disappointing as it was the main reason I wanted this device.  I'd rather not have both Netflix and Instant Video and this could be the reason I switch when my free trial ends.
B001TCNSOI|4.0|Apart from the amazing (but true) story and the impeccable directing etc. that others have commented on, I found this film stylistically very satisfying. The production design should get a round of applause for creating not just the look but the mood of the 20s - specifically, not Gatsby-land but Prohibition-era crime-ridden LA, with the Great Depression just around the corner. I love the fact that everyone in the film was pitch-perfect - the distraught mother with steel in her character, the police chiefs in their suit / uniform who really make your skin crawl, and the serial killer who is both revolting and strangely affecting (I couldn't help thinking what could have turned him into a vile monster at such a young age).<br /><br />This does have the look and feel of a minor classic and should be recognised as such.
B002NWXRYY|3.0|My wife wanted to watch this so I reluctanly joined her. It turned out to be a decent comedy. Both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn played their roles well. The way they could spin tales on the fly to any and everyone was just fun to watch. Had me laughing pretty regularly. Also, since we live in MA, we kept trying to guess what city/cities they used for Dobbs Mills town. The architecture firm owner, don't know his name, was also very good. Dana Delancy plays this spiffy preppy woman, and I really didn't like her that much, which I think means she did an ok job. It was hard to figure out if the Director was trying to get you to root for her or for Goldie Hawn.<br /><br />Anyhow, it comes in at 90 minutes and I would recommend it to catch Martin and Hawn when they were still young enough to pull this off.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!  It makes me cry to watch the love of this dog for the person he loved unconditionally!
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Nice build quality and easy to snap the phone in and out of the case.  Makes one-handed use a little trickier but that is OK.
B008133DO8|5.0|Season 2 of \\"Sherlock\\" continues the adapted tales of Sherlock Holmes, culminating in \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\", an homage to the short story where Arthur Conan Doyle tries to kill off his too-popular fictional hero. Where Season 1 dealt with the demons behind the duo (Holmes and Watson), Season 2 has a handful of totally weird and wonderful criminals and Holmes dealing with his new-found fame. Where his website and \\"243 kinds of tobacco ash\\" failed to grab public attention, John Watson's blog gets thousands of hits a day and has turned Holmes into a tabloid darling, much to his dismay. The unfortunate photo where he's disguised in a theatre prop hat (the Deerstalker, of course) comes back to vex him as well.<br /><br />The end episode is very Batman-like, but that is ok. Moriarty and Holmes are larger-than-life figures so a bit of cartoonish writing is all right--though I think the silliness in Season 2 sometimes gets out of hand (going trouser-less in Buckingham Palace?) I found the cartoonish quality detracted a bit from the sympathy and attraction we feel for Holmes and Watson, but only a little. If you're like me and like the public who clamored for more Sherlock Holmes, after Conan Doyle dispatched him down a waterfall in the original stories, you're waiting anxiously for Season 3.<br /><br />This is television writing and acting at its best. And yes, we're all crazy for Benedict Cumberbatch's cheekbones.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|bizzare for a classic. It was more like watching a play then a movie. I would not waste my time.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Superb character and relationship development. I am blown away at the maturity of the story at this stage. While this book could not stand on its own, when combined  d with the first it is a tour de force.
B00CRCRNEA|5.0|When I was a young teenager during the early 1970's ; when I was into heavy metel stuff like Deep Purple ,Black Sabbath ,Led Zepplen ,Mahageny Rush and Ronnie Montrose , it does not compare to what one hears nowadays...it is so nice hearing this...hearing two great icons jamming and still kicking a** at their age...just listen to \\"Slip Away \\"...and  they are doing this to help build a music school in Armenia ,a  former nation of the Soviet Union that got nailed by an earthquike some time ago...that alone makes this a worthy purchase !
B005544TRQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Very entertaining and intriguing, kept me coming back for more. I can't wait to watch the next season.
0316227706|5.0|My girlfriend gave this to me as a birthday gift. It was so awesome especially since we are both dog lovers. I have a border collie and a german shepherd and it was nice to see both breeds in it. It is a shame though that there is only one photo for the GSD. Aside from that small personal rant due to breed preference, this book is great.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love it!!!! Im watching the seasons episodes all over again cause I cant get enough of SOA! I would recommened it to all my friends! Best show ever!
B0016OMFNY|4.0|I have always liked the music, some really good songs and the performers appear to be enjoying themselves. Good country music for an outdoor get together.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Not her best but a well written, interesting story. Drags a bit, but that is the actual history, not the writing.
B006T9Y278|5.0|This movie is one of the best I've seen of the Civil War era.  The plot is excellent.  I love the relationship which develops between Ada and Ruby as they work together to keep Ada's farm going during the end of the war.  Dealing with the home guard in their county is very realistic.  The way Ada and Inman make it through their own trying times, both heavily relying on the memories of their short courtship right before Inman left with the forces.  Rene Zellweger is outstanding in her role as Ruby Thewes.  I highly recommend this movie for the acting as well as the musical score.
B008ER9QKG|4.0|The set, which I suspect is annoying if one is in the Met audience, works perfectly on the screen. We are spared the distraction of the Met's old-fashioned attempts at realistic sets, in it's clunky prior production.  Most of the performances are superb. Was especially delighted to be treated to the discovery of Jay Hunter Morris as a truly believable naive Siegfried!
B0035JNTA6|5.0|What is this a centrer for ants? You need to make this at least two times bigger.  Best Movie Ever!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the game...but hate the bugs in the software.  You guys have got to get it fixed. The game continuously skips in the middle of running or jumping. It causes my runner to hit a wall or miss a turn and ends my run prematurely. Updates???

0345803485|2.0|The only reason why I jumped on this bandwagon was because of the power of persuasion of the lovely Charlie Hunnam (Beautiful Man)on why he decided to take this role (Huh?, Why?, Didn't you say you where picky when choosing roles?), I decided to have an open mind, and read it for myself to see what the hell people complaining about. I also read the other comments, and thank God I am not the only one who felt this book was repetitive. After chapter eight, I was like, \\"WTF is this\\". Why oh, why, Charlie H. did you take this role?!Come to your senses brother! I am about to send your agent a hate email, telling him, \\"Are you serious\\". I hold out hope that the \\"Screenwriter\\" will do a better job than the E.L. at \\"Re- Writing\\" this now soon to be movie.. Oh well, one down, two to go.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|it was a great movie to watch on 3d. I enjoyed the 3d graphics on the TV. a good choice

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|This is definitely a great story and a whole literary classic. However, I must note that this film adaptation is not the best. There are two very good cinematographic adaptations, one from 1996 and one from 1997.<br />Although this version has very good actors and photography, I think it manages to convey all the emotions of the book. Not achieved a strong connection and I think it falls short in the deepest scenes, as it extends into other little importance.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I wanted to upgrade from the USB WIFI setup that came with my TV. It was useless to me, couldn't go 10 minutes without a interruption. Chomecast was easy to setup, and works great with my Nexus 7 tablet. The picture quality is real nice, Leave it to Beaver never looked so good!!!! For $35.00 you cannot beat it. I got mine at @#@& Buy for that price. Some stores have it in stock.
B007V9YF5E|5.0|This is a really a horrible movie.  The only one in the movie who I think had talent was Gina..  this is her first movie and you put it all on her shoulders.  All these actors (male)  they all sucked.. performances at a 3rd grade play would be better..<br />Gina I would say this know your lines and when crap actors show up late bitch them out..
1416972242|5.0|All of the books in this series are amazing. Love Cassandra Clare's writing. Can't wait til next spring for the next installment!

B001F12J0C|5.0|These three movies are excellent!  They are very exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat.  They also explain who Jason Bourne is to make sense of the newest Bourne movie.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I wanted the orarks or whatever they are to kill are the actors in the first scene and show reruns of giliigans island  what a horrible movie  maybe the director should eat something  and then he can come up with a movie idea..  vomit
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A marvelous book - should be on the best seller list.  I was young in that era but have always love stories of WW2 and this one especially because of Franz Stigler, the valiant German Ace  and how he and Charlie Brown found each other after some 40 years.  Amazing story!!!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|After the box-office bomb that was Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin&#34;, back in Fall 1997. DC Comics and Warner Brothers decided that with the next &#34;Live-Action&#34; adaptation of the caped crusader to take a different route. From a live-action adaptation of the then current Batman cartoon, Batman Beyond with the creators Allan Burnett, Paul Dini and Bruce Timm involved to a live action adaptation of Frank Miller's iconic &#34;canonical&#34; origin to the Dark Knight, 1987's &#34;Batman: Year One&#34;  and was to be helmed by Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain).<br /><br />Around Fall of 2003, it was announced that writer, David S. Goyer (Blade 1-3, The Crow: City of Angles, Nick Fury 1998 TV movie) and at the time up-and-coming, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) reshape the Dark Knight and would retell his universe with 2005's Batman Begins.<br /><br />Batman Begins (2005):<br /><br />This was the movie that not only reintroduced Batman/Bruce Wayne and the character's universe to the going public, but also introduced and popularized the idea of making Comic-based films &#34;Realistic&#34;.<br /><br />The tone of Batman and of Gotham rang true to what comic creator, Bob Kane originally thought of back in 1939. This was a Gotham that we've never seen before in live-action; a city was corrupt to the bone, gritty and a shell of it's former self. Same thing goes with Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />Unlike the previous interpretation of the duality of both, this take shows the true trauma that Bruce not only suffered as a child when originally seeing his parents gunned down, but also showing that traumatic experience still haunted him as an adult. An adult that was fueled with hatred and going a far to use the same weapon that struck his parents down, on the culprit.<br /><br />With this reintroduction to the material, Christian Bale was casted as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A lot of bat-fans were going &#34;Wha?&#34;, when it was originally announced before production even started, but like Keaton as the tittual role in the 1989 Tim Burton film, &#34;You can't judge a book by it's cover&#34;. While I think he's a good Batman, his Bruce Wayne was phenomenal. Compared to the others that took the character as they're own, Bale actually acted like a playboy would in the real world.<br /><br />Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, Yes. He and Nolan overdid the realism when it came to Batman's voice. When Bale opened his mouth as Batman. I wasn't trembling in fear, I was laughing. Granted, I get why they went with this decision and yes, they did improve it by toning it down with the last film, but still it was an annoyance to an already amazing performance.<br /><br />Michael Cain as Alfred has got to be the perfect personification of the character to date. The way he interact with Bruce and the other characters in this trilogy felt he was really give it his all.<br /><br />The same could be said with Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. It felt like the look and characterization of Gordon was ripped right out of the Frank Miller classic origin, Batman: Year One.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. He gets the job done, but feels like deja vu. Basically, it feels like Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman or in Batman's case, Morgan Freeman as Deus Ex Machnia.<br /><br />Katie Holmes as the love interest Rachel Dawes was basically good in general. In some parts, it felt weak but as a whole, she does the job done with the role she was assigned.<br /><br />Liam Neeson as Henry Ducard/Ra's al Guel was another stellar performance in this film. His interpretation was not only his own, but also felt like he did his homework on the character and was influenced by different interpretations of Ra's from the now iconic Batman: Animated Series from the 90's to the character's influence during the Danny O'Neil run of the Batman comic series.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow was also damn impressive. His take on the character was anotherwell-done interoperation of the character from the original source. When he's &#34;The Good Doctor&#34;, he does come of that one thinks is sane but in reality is down right nuts.<br /><br />The Director of the trilogy Christopher Nolan was a perfect choice to reintroduce the character and the universe. Not only does he pull it off with the material at hand but throughout the Whole trilogy, he make you feel for the characters and what has transpired with the story. The only complaint I've had with Nolan is that he doesn't know how to direct a fight sequence. While he improved with both The Dark Knight and the recently released Dark Knight Rises, that was the only catalyst with Begins.<br /><br />Main composer of the trilogy Hans Zimmer, did a phenomenal job with the soundtrack. With the character's themes and the overall &#34;themes&#34; of the movies separate plots, he really mixes it well.<br /><br />Batman Begins - 5/5<br /><br />The Dark Knight (2008):<br /><br />With the start of The Dark Knight we get to see Gotham in a better state, one that has never been seen before. That is until we're introduced to the Joker (Heath Ledger) and his plan for the &#34;fair&#34; city of Gotham? He doesn't have one. He wants to see it return to it's original state &#34;a cesspool for criminals and killers&#34;. Like  what Alfred said with the Joker's psyche &#34;Some people just want to see the world burn&#34;…<br /><br />While I still say my two favorites Joker's are both Mark Hamill ( Batman: The Animated Series, Batman: Arkham Asylem/Arkham City) and Cesar Romero (60's Batman TV Series), the way Heath Ledger portrayed this iconic villain from Batman's Rouge gallery was down right amazing. He made it his own character but took some cues from the comics, animated series and other media that the character has appeared in. In other words, He was the breakout performance and it was a damn shame that he passed away so young.<br /><br />The character of Rachel Dawes was re-cast in the sequel from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhaal. Honestly, I preferred Ms. Holmes as the character than how Maggie portrayed her. When some critics said back in 2005 with Begins that Holmes felt out of place in the movie, I felt that with Maggie. That she was both out of place but her acting was Highly wooden. When her character was killed off, I was shocked but shrugged it off a little later. This is when re-casting an already established character will hurt the film in the long haul.<br /><br />Another stellar performance was by Aaron Eckhart as Harvey &#34;Two-Face&#34; Dent. His portrayal was not only refreshing to what the common conscience remembers the character of from 1995's Batman Forever (ironically, a Batman movie I like) but one that is true to the character in general.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises (2012):<br /><br />It's been 8 years after the events of the previous film and we see Bruce as we saw Howard Hughes later in his life, a recluse a shell of his former self. Jim Gordon, the commissioner of Gotham Police has resigned during this time-skip due to his guilt of knowing the truth about Two-Face and falsely painting Batman as a killer. After Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) broke in the Wayne estate to copy Bruce's fingerprints, they fall into the hands of Bane! (Tom Hardy)<br /><br />Like the Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight, my favorites interpretations of Selina/Catwoman have been both Adrienne Barbeau (Batman: The Animated Series) and Grey DeLisle (Batman: Arkham City). And then Anne Hathaway happened. Ms. Hathaway's take of Selina is the breakthrough performance of this film. She's sarcastic, charming, beautiful, smart, I can go on and on but the bottom line is this, We finally have a Catwoman that is true to her comic counterpart!<br /><br />Another stellar performance was done by Tom Hardy as Bane. Unlike 1997's Batman and Robin, which was the character's big-screen debut. This interpretation of Bane is one that is right down to it's core, true to the comic original. unlike both Joker and Scarecrow, Bane was in the same plane on villainy as Begins' Ra's. He both has the Brass and Brawn to kill Batman if he wanted to. What I'm getting at is this, Bane is the first villain in this trilogy that shows Batman what he truly is, a vulnerable human being.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levit as Det. John Blake is, in some ways, how we were introduced to Bruce back in 2005. He's a calm, collective cop in the force that holds to the same ideals that both Bruce and Jim once believed in. And in some ways like both Bruce and Jim, he to is a hot-head. I won't spoil it but when it's revealed who he really is, it's cool but like his character deducing that Bruce is Batman, it was one that was seen a mile away.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises - 5/5<br /><br />With the Dark knight Trilogy, I'll say this. While the Dark Knight Rises was the more comic book focused one, it's predecessor was more realistic/bank heist/drama focused. Batman Begins was the one that had the perfect mixture of the comic book mythos and the stylistic reality that this trilogy created and popularized in the comic/superhero adaptation genre<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: The Dark Knight Trilogy - 5/5in the sequel from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhaal.

1118488768|4.0|David Meerman Scott's The New Rules of Marketing and PR: How to use Social Media, Online Video, Mobile Applications, Blogs, News Releases and Viral Marketing to Reach Buyers Directly attempts to help PR and marketing professionals learn to take advantage of the web to reach buyers, drive buzz, receive new product feedback and boost sales. That is, to help professionals \\"[use] the web to drive people to an offline initiative,\\" (Meerman Scott). To do so, Meerman Scott must first prove that traditional advertising and marketing isn't always the most effective or efficient - and in doing so, he proves that the web is more effective in reaching consumers due to the emergence of digital and social media. He demonstrates the success of his theory directly, through the marketing efforts of this book via the web. Many were able to follow the construction of the book by section, as he published them online. Through online connections, Meerman Scott was able to reach his intended audience of marketing and public relations professionals in an online world they connect with on a daily basis.<br />Meerman Scott argues the benefits of using the web as a resource to reach buyers. He writes, \\"The web has opened a tremendous opportunity to reach niche uyers directly with targeted information that costs a fraction of what big-budget advertising costs...If you aren't present and engaged in the places and at the times that your buyers are, then you're losing out on potential business\\" (Meerman Scott). He argues that the web is a good resource for reaching buyers because it is the primary source of information consumers consult before making a purchase, it allows you to provide direct, targeted and interactive marketing - giving consumers what they want and need from your company.  His argument centers around the claim that we need to change the way we market and advertise for a new, more receptive audience. Because the web is the new best way to reach potential buyers, Meerman Scott argues that the web can take the place of, or transform traditional marketing and PR strategies. He writes, \\"these [traditional marketing] efforts made us feel good...but the programs were not producing significant, measurable results because we were working based on the rules of the past...online content in all of its forms is causing a convergence of marketing and PR that does not really exist off-line\\" (Meerman Scott).<br />David Meerman Scott effectively supports each argument with critical analysis as well as real-life examples of the success of connecting with consumers via the web. The web allows any company to reach buyers directly, which is the basis for Meerman Scott's claim that the web is the best new resource available for reaching buyers. He supports this claim first with a discussion of consumers' use of the web as an informational resource when considering a purchase. He writes, \\"consumers search the internet for answers to their problems...they are searching for what organizations like yours have to offer\\" (Meerman Scott). Research, Scott Claims, suggests that advertising is most effective when it reaches the buyer during the correct stage of the decision making process - the research stage - and that before making a purchase, buyers search for information online. Scott uses the example of the bicycle company Cervélo, who uses the web to reach buyers researching bikes to buy. \\"'Because of the keyword-rich cycling content available on the site,' Vroomen says,  `Cervélo gets the same amount of search engine traffic as many sites for bike companies that are ten times larger\\" (Meerman Scott). The creator of Cervélo says, \\"The content is valuable and authentic compared to the marketing messages that appear on so many other sites.\\" Similarly, another small company, the Lodge at Chaa Creek, uses similar strategies to reach consumers looking for places to visit and stay. This flows into his analysis of the capabilities of web content allowing companies to give consumers what they want and need - targeted and interactive marketing. Content \\"is your tool to show off your expertise\\" Meerman Scott says. Successful personal trainer, golf coach and businessman Mike Pederson says, \\"I like to call it targeted content. When I write an article, I'm targeting a very specific element of golf for my readers.\\" The web, Meerman Scott explains, allows businesses to create content that consumers seek. All of these arguments and examples support Meerman Scott's claim that companies need to change the way that they market and advertise for a changed, web-saavy marketplace. He writes, \\"Instead of causing one-way interruption, marketing is about delivering content at just the precise moment your audience needs it. Marketers must shift their thinking from mainstream marketing to the masses to a strategy of reaching vast numbers of underserved audiences via the web\\" (Meerman Scott).  Proof of this, Scott says, lies in examples such as Century 21. Bev Thorne, chief marketing officer at Century 21, says \\"We found that our online investments provided a return that was substantively higher than our more traditional TV media investments.\\"<br />David Meerman Scott's explanations and analysis of the validity of his key arguments, and the real-world examples he provides readers are persuasive and logically unbiased. One can argue that his investigation of and explanation for his arguments fully support his arguments and convince the reader that perhaps we really do need to look at the web as an effective tool for reaching consumers. Scott successfully achieves his objectives in writing the book, his thorough analysis and explanation engages the reader and gives the professional the tools and background necessary to begin to utilize the web to achieve marketing initiatives - which was his goal in reaching professionals through this book.<br />Scott's book verified the importance of digital and web-based marketing for myself as a reader, and persuaded me that perhaps more companies need to look to the web when considering marketing objectives and goals. I found his analysis and discussion intriguing and enjoyable. Though a long read, I would recommend this as a fun read for anyone interested in digital marketing, or anyone looking to incorporate web-based communications into their marketing strategy.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|nick cage is a horrible as an actor when he won the Oscar I knew then that title of Oscar winner means nothing.. did you see the movie precious with that big fat black women how much of a stretch was it to her to play a nasty bitch.  The little girl in this movie is going to be a big star someday..  The movie is very depressing  at least nicks character dies in the movie.. sorry Jim Carey  is Canadian and has No talent Celine pisses more talent then this crap actor does  who bitches ever about the movie they are in.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|By far their best album in my opinion. I can listen to each song many times without over playing it. I also have found for the first time  a song I can call my favorite song ever and will likely be until the day I die.<br /><br />&#34;Lost in Paradise&#34;.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Batman has developed a lengthy lineage in the cinematic world. From the grotesqueries of Tim Burton's mind to the performance-geated Schumacher productions, they're a diverse class of entities as unique as the times that they take place in. Now, in the reign of Christopher Nolan's masterful Batman pictures, do they hold up? Two do, two don't.<br /><br /> It all boils down to this: Batman and Batman Returns are two very artful, thematically rich and gripping renditions of the Dark Knight, while Batman Forever only satisfies on a surface-level, make-your-eyes-bleed kind of way -- and Batman and Robin to an even lesser degree. They're all entertaining on some very mild level, though Burton's pictures are the only two that'll provide enough thought to match up with the modern-minded Batman aficionados. Schumacher's riffs on the series claim to hark back to the '50s and '60s comics while paying homage to the Adam West television show, which you can take as a reasonable explanation or not for their boisterous, obnoxious kid-geared demeanor. Overall, I'd still recommend the whole-shebang as a slate of interesting achievements in production design, action choreography, and cinematography across the board, giving Burton's pictures exceedingly high marks while relegating Schumacher's pictures to rent-worthy diversions, the latter being one perfect for rifftracking with friends.<br /><br />Speaking on quality alone without price necessarily in mind, The Batman Blu-ray Anthology comes with a firm Recommendation based on the strong visual and aural qualities matching the complete carry-over of the standard-definition box's slate of supplements. As a Batman lover it's certainly a blast to see all of these pictures presented in beautifully-rendered visual transfers and sounding nearly as good as they did in the theaters -- even if they now play second banana (or third, or fourth) to the new breed of Batman movies.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is absolutely awesome. I played asphalt 7 to death, and this blows it out of the water!! Amazing improvement on graphics, cars are just great. They took out the decal and window tint option, meh. One thing I would change however, is more dynamic crashes. Right now, it looms like a hot wheels car is tumbling down the track. Where's the tires bounding down the road without the car attached?!?! Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun racing game. It's awesome. Great job on this one Gameloft!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Steve Carell is not my type of actor (he cant act)  but in this movie he shows warmth and it shows through this movie..  Good for you Steve  you finally made a movie I liked
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I gave this four stars, not because I didn't enjoy the music or something like that, It is PINK FLOYD, I gave it four just simply due to the quality of the video, it looked like a VHS tape, and it does say in the description it says &#34;sometimes hazy image quality&#34; but this was more than sometimes.  But it is still an awesome concert and am glad to add the DVD to my collection.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Quell memento is a great sequel to the original and quell reflect!  Challenging new puzzles with hidden goodies and a beautiful music combine for a great user experience!

B009SQOGZ2|5.0|I like this movie because it would help parents teach kids about bullying..  I loved the parts with his grandmother and the kids mother telling him the father loves him and is afraid for him.. Great movie but explain it to your kids.  for Gods sake don't let them watch this alone  you should have a slap upside the head.. explain about death and it is a part of life and not to be afraid..

B004LWZVZC|4.0|A pretty well acted and directed movie.<br />If for no other reason than to shed a bit of truth on what usually gets REALLY glossed over.<br />Lincolns Northern War of Aggression was my countries darkest hour.<br />If you think people...especially Politicians and Generals...cared anymore more about slaves than did their opposite Southern numbers did...you need to get a grip.<br />States rights and paving the way for Northern Capital and a Northern Industrial Revolution is what happened.<br />Factory owners do not want to own slaves...they want wage slaves. Once the Southern Governments were swepped aside...the carpet baggers moved in...and Northern capital theories were imposed.<br />It was not until a man named Martin King Jr...100 years later....,came along did The North take a look at the misery they helped to create in The South.<br />Mary Surratt is a hero.<br />26+6=1<br />God Bless
0525953728|5.0|Great first hand account of what went down. Period. I like that the author is donating the majority of proceeds to charities for our troops. I also thought his criticism of the current administration was spot on.<br />I recommend this book highly.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Great movie! It's my all time favorite it's not your typical romance movie and the chemistry Joseph and Zooey haveis amazing!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing cant wait for the movie :) now its difficult to not want a Christian grey for myself. The trilogy was in fact to my delight
B0058VW36U|4.0|Still one of the most adorable puzzle apps out there, Cut the Rope taxes your brain's comprehension, your finger's dexterity, all while looking gosh darn cute.<br /><br />I did knock down a star because all that glitz and glamor does tax my machine (to the point where it crashes during later stages), but for the price it's a great time killer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thought this would be another temple run because it has those aspects, however, the run changes constantly. New challenges appear without having to get meters into a run. Can't wait to share this with my 8 yr old who loves these games and the minions.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I find myself singing this song all the time even when it's not playing. And it makes me dance! My grandkids and I really enjoy it. Requested it while roller skating, but they didn't have it yet. Soon I hope. Love the line, \\"...some of us just like to read\\". Go Lady Gaga!
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|Cate Blanchett delivers a memorable performance as a dry brittle woman who appears to be held together by her clothing and hairspray. The entire plot seems to be animated by the nuances of Blanchett's expressive, wan beauty as it shatters into madness. Blanche DuBois, and The Madoffs are touchstones, but also Mia Farrow, her adopted children, and Allen's own peccadilloes. The blue collar men that Blanchett's character abhors, and her ditzy sister are the only three dimensional characters, and set the moral tone.
B00BFV1JZI|5.0|It's an amazing book despite the violent theme it blossoms on. It brings to life what life as a girl in Katniss' position would feel.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Studio album number six for John Mayer, and genre number 6, too, I reckon... His latest offering is a terrific follow on from &#34;Born & Raised&#34; and it makes beautiful sense as a sequel. Don Was is back for their second collaboration, and as a Steve Jordan (Continuum's producer) fan, I still wish some woman would break Mayer's heart good-and-proper, so he is forced to re-unite with Jordan and go back to the blues... But, as long as he is crafting music like this - and believe me this is well-crafted - I'll survive. &#34;Paradise Valley&#34; is a short album at 40 minutes, and that is my only gripe with the project. Don't fret though: you'll enjoy it so much, you'll find yourself just hitting play again from the top! It has a few stand out tracks: the duet &#34;Who You Love&#34; with Katie Perry is excellent, and &#34;Paperdoll&#34; will have you trying to wear out the disc. It would also be remiss of me not to mention the opening track &#34;Wildfire&#34; - this track DRIPS with Summer sun, and even concrete boots will be a shufflin' - your kitchen floor won't know what's hit it! There's several flavours here: decades of Americana, bits of Country, and some long-held 'pop' influences Mayer has depended on well, since album #1. It isn't so much a jambalaya of genres, more like fine cocktail with just the right splashes of this, and dashes of that. It stands as a brilliant follow up, and a worthy addition to his discography. A part of me may still be longing for Jordan's grooves which I thought brought out Mayer's best licks, but he is two albums into this feel now, and each new project seems more confidant, but - importantly -  with a bit less show-off as the previous album. This is not a reduction in quality, don't mis-understand me: it is a fantastic progression and refinement of his art and craft.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Just a fun, fun move to watch.<br />Ever in need of a pick me up or party mood this is the movie to put a smile on your face.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Loved it, can't wait to get the rest of the season and have a marathon watching party to get caught up.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|The movie was action packed and the special effects were good but the movie was missing a huge part and that was (Stallone). The first Jude Dredd was a classic and the person that played Dredd just didn't do it for me.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Nice bag.. Good price...Holds my Apple Ipad2, Nikon D5200 camera, Nikon speed flash light, charger, plugs, lens hood, 55-300 Nikkor lens and my18-55 Nikon lens...
0307950689|1.0|I'm not the biggest fan of Dan Brown, but generally I could at least find some entertainment value in his Robert Langdon books.  The Lost Symbol, is a complete and utter disaster in just about every facet of it.  For one thing, the writing is subpar at best.  The plot is so utterly preposterous with holes the size of the craters on Mars.  There was nothing remotely believable about it, both in the overall macro sense, but even in smaller micro details.  The villain in this story doesn't in any way resemble a real human being.  The writing was also repetitive.  If I heard the phrase \\"As above, so below\\", or \\"the secret is in the order\\" again, I think I'm going to shoot somebody.<br /><br /> In this dreadful novel, Robert Langdon is drawn to Washington DC at the supposed request of his mentor Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Masons.  He is actually being drawn out by the story's antagonist, who is trying to learn the Ancient Mysteries of the Masons that will unleash secret powers that will change humanity.  He has Peter hostage, making Robert Langdon cooperate with him.  Meanwhile, the CIA is also involved usually working against Langdon to stop this from happening, despite the fact that there was no mention of how the CIA could possibly have known about what was going on since the only people who knew were the villain, Langdon, and Peter Solomon.  The CIA had to stop them as a matter of grave national security, but this grave national security turned out to be silly.  Another thing that ate at my craw is that is utterly absurd that Peter Solomon could not have recognized who Molloch, the villain in the story.  It's hard to describe how ridiculous the scenario was.  Also, it's not believable that Molloch could have gone from a Turkish prison where he was drugged out, to not only becoming a Mason, but achieving their highest level in a period of about three years.  I have never thought that a book could jump the shark, but this one did.  It is disgraceful.  Dan Brown must think his readers are a bunch of idiots to put out such garbage.  Avoid this one.<br />Carl Alves - author of Blood Streetown must think his readers are a bunch of idiots to put out such garbage.  Avoid this one.<br />Carl Alves - author of Blood Street
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a very long time.If you like historical novels, you will love this book. I could not put it down.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good update on an old classic! Lots of time wasting fun that will keep you entertained during boring car trips or insomnia.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The show is great. The stream is great. Thank you Amazon for having this show available. I can't wait for the next season!

B00BIVN82M|5.0|I know I moved into old lady status when I'm rockin' out to this driving around with the top down on a summer day.
B00CDXOXB4|2.0|I am in the minority when I say that I didn't like this movie.  I'm a big fan of Josh Duhamel, and he did a fine acting job.  But the dancing with the stars turned actress didn't act well.  I thought it was a train wreck.  And the 'twist' wasn't much of a twist and couldn't overcome her poor acting.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes &#34;What great acting&#34;. Jennifer Lawrence what an amazing job, John Hawkes I remember him from Deadwood great actor.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Take a look into the making of some really great Rock albums and meet some of the people involved behind the scenes that help get it done. Watching musicians of different generations describe their experience at the studio, then a bunch of them collaborating on new songs made me appreciate the continuing evolution of music in a genre that at times seems to be losing the attention of younger audiences. Given the title it is essential that the SOUND of it be incredible, and it is.
1423113454|5.0|The Red Pyramid is a great book because it is full of adventure drama and action. I really recommend this book to people that like the author Rick Riordan, he is a great writer with great ideas. This book is about these two kids called Carter and Sadie. They don't know that there family is a magical. They are magicians and they have a lot of power that they don't know that they have. In a visit to the British Museum the Rosetta stone explodes and gods come out. Isis and Horus become Carter and Sadie. But the evil god Set has gone out. He has performed an evil plan to destroy the whole world and it is up to Carter and Sadie to stop Set and his evil plan. That where the action begins and everything starts to make sense. This book I really liked it because of all the things it had it had a lot of action and fighting which I love and the book is well made. Everything makes sense when you read this book and you learn a lot about ancient Egypt.
B00332CWLW|5.0|This book is so intense that I read it holding my breath. It's beautiful and tragic. It's poetic and heart-wrenching. At the very beginning the walker on the tightrope seems to be the one making the wonder, the miracle. He's the one walking on a thin line over the world, making acrobatics. But very soon, after few pages, we discover that the real acrobat is not him, but the \\"normal\\" people walking on the streets. Down there there are many individual stories, involuntarily and secretly tangled. As the read proceeds, we got caught in the intricate existences of some of the Acrobat's viewers. In their stories we found the real struggle, the real miracle. As I was nearing the end of the book I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted to read it fast to know what was next or I wanted to prolong the reading to savour it more. In conclusion, this book offers an unique experience. It's unforgettable and surely, as soon as I closed it, I felt I wanted to read it again, because there are still so many layers, so many details, so many shades to discover.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great app! Especially for the Kindle HD the voice activation is perfect for someone that's always on the go
0345525558|5.0|This book was written in such a way that the reader actually experiences the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the main character.  That is no easy task!  I was riveted.  I thought it would be about flowers and it was in a very small but important sense.  The main story hidden in this garden of flowers is compelling.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This app is so fun.  It gets more and more difficult as you move along.  Makes you stop and evaluate how to get the job done.
B000MKIR80|4.0|i can only recommend this for hardcore fans of miss johansson. the movie itself was a feeble endeavor, even for woody allen. yet, it was refreshing to see how scarlett, with her usual steadfast excellence, interpreted allen's direction and gave the only extra layer to what would have been a completely two dimensional experience without her.<br /><br />the movie is light and without the need of much mental engagement, which can be perfect depending on your mood. my recommendation is to only expect to get a kick out of scarlett's role and performance - which is about as unique as she makes most all her roles.
B00AOCLWF6|2.0|Typical man against extraterrestrial science fiction.  I did only watch the first episode, so it could admittedly get better.  However, I didn't want to risk wasting time on a show which had a seemingly vapid plot.

B0084AXZK0|5.0|I've been meaning to read this story for a long time, and finally found the motivation in the form of a friend with whom I could discuss the story afterward. Definitely glad I read this on a Kindle, the dictionary came in very handy. Interestingly, most of the words I didn't know were the names of plants.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|This game is almost impossible to control at least on my kindle fire.  It is hard to find the place to fly the helicopter.  Perhaps some instructions would help.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Great box-set. The packaging is excellent, it comes in a metal can :)<br />The only problem is that the first disk, the one with the Mad Max movie is region A coded.

B0078XFYDA|5.0|This book will be easier for people who are Dawkins fans. It took me a short 1-2 hours to finish. But I was satisfied with the myth inspection way of solving many cool but important questions.<br />Can recommend this for kids and also adults.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|Nice app.. works good. Like the features especially the weather addition. Wish it were free, but price is acceptable for its use
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Graphics are great and a fun laid back game.  HOWEVER, this is a for-profit game (i get it) as you level up it costs more pearls to open chests, as fish come many cost as much as 9000 algae to feed every 72 hrs and you ONLY get One Pearl per fish. There is not a fair balance you pretty much have to buy pearls (which i have) to keep the reef going and to get rare fish and in addition to having to grow &quot;rare plants&quot; it becomes more of a cost than fun. Sorry but once my pearls run out i will not buy anymore.  Would really like more pearls given, etc to make it less of a huge FOR-PROFIT GAME.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|All the hype related to Downton Abbey was right. I am rivoted to the drama of the great old house, both upstairs and down.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Good movie that you don't have to think much about.  It's enjoyable if you like justice dilemmas, futuristic societies, and action.
B002R5HR70|5.0|There are many fascinating and highly entertaining things about this film, but the one that burned itself indelibly into my mind was the incredible difference between the song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" as sung by Tex Ritter or someone like him on the jukebox in some dive where Costner and Houston are having a drink and the absolutely mind-blowing, electrifying explosion of Houston's version of it at the end. I couldn't believe it was the same song. Her tragic death was an incalculable loss to the music world, so we are very fortunate to have this film to remember her by. She and Costner (whose acting I don't usually appreciate that much) were magic together and transformed what might otherwise have been a rather mediocre film into a classic mystery/romance with a deeply bitter-sweet ending. Male, female, black, white, gay, straight -- if you're not in love with Houston by the time this film ends, your heart is made of stone.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I have had the game for a few months now and have always had problems with it crashing. At first it was not so bad but it has only gotten worse. I am really thinking about uninstalling it. Has anyone else had this problem I am using an HTC EVO 4G. I would have giving this game 5 stars if not for it always crashing.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Obviously not for me. Couldn't get it to work right so I deleted after a couple of tries. More words to fill out the review.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|From great martial arts, and a great story line to workouts by the star, the Green Arrow never looked so good!
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Not a very interesting story line. McConaughey was gross looking the entire time. I usually love his movies, but this was a disappointment.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Great show that has nothing to do about motorcycles. Not for the faint of heart or children but a great scripted drama series.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|But some of the physics are really hard to figure out. Most annoying and frustrating of all the angry birds games.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't stop reading the trilogy, I want more of Christian's thoughts. I recommend this book to everyone, with the exception, of children, of course.<br /><br />I loved this read.
B006K1IIHA|5.0|My son had these on blu-ray, and I watched them so much I decided I needed my own set; these were reasonably priced and arrived quickly.  Honestly one of the best TV shows I've ever seen, and definitely beats anything on currently.  The acting, writing, creativity and cinematography are absolutely top-notch, and the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are now very sought-after actors is no accident.  HIGHLY recommend!!  (And ANXIOUSLY awaiting Season 3...!!!!)
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I'm sorry I shouldn't be rating this book.  I've not found time to read it yet, and will rate it after I do.
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|but had not super engaging for me. Had to delete it to since I ran out of space on the device.
B00008OWZC|3.0|I received my product.  when i tried to download it to my computer to put on my Ipod, the song &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; was so scratched up I had to go back to amazon and buy the single and added that to the CD I already had.  it would be nice if the disc were checke out before purchasing.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|When i first got this app i went to go watch a video and it said not available i would recommend not getting this app because you cant even watch any videos.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a beautiful story that deserves to be read by everyone. Its a heart breaking and breath taking book.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Clever, funny,smart, intriguing.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Another Steven Moffat brilliant piece of work (Coupling, Dr Who...).
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Touches on key aspects of life.  The concepts can be related to multiple everyday situations.  Read the first paragraph or two and you will be intrigued.  &#34;Life is difficult.&#34;
0756655307|5.0|I ordered this for a buddy who loves the Marvel side of comics. As soon as I got it, I knew it was worth every penny. Beautiful book and the artwork is spot on. Great buy.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I have never read F. Scott Fitzgerald's book and had not see this in film but after considering the new release of it I decided I should see what may be the best version.  It didn't disappoint.  It was entertaining.
0307592731|2.0|I did not expect a book about a woman's journey on the PCT to be so full of crudity.  Unfortunately, Strayed's use of crude profanity is pervasive in this book.  The following, for example, are a few quotes from the book:<br /><br />\\"When Paul accepted a job offer in Minneapolis that required him to return to Minnesota midway through our exotic hen-sitting gig, I stayed behind in Oregon and f****d the ex-boyfriend of the woman who owned the exotic hens. I f****d a cook at the restaurant where I'd picked up a job waiting tables. I f****d a massage therapist who gave me a piece of banana cream pie and a free massage. All three of them over the span of five days.\\"<br /><br />\\"'That dog's got some motherf***ing good taste in women,' said the man.\\"<br /><br />\\"'Oh my f***ing GOD!' moaned a pale waif of a woman with a bare, skeletal midriff and a collage of Celtic tattoos. 'We drove all the way from f***ing Ashland for nothing?'\\"<br /><br />The book contains over 40 F-bombs used in all possible ways.  Strayed also speaks in crude terms about her multiple sexual escapades throughout the hike.<br /><br />Perhaps Strayed tried to be honest and raw, but it's crude...almost gratuitously so.  I had hoped to give this book to my wife as a gift and as encouragement for our future hike on the PCT or the Appalachian Trail, but I have no desire to expose her to this level of foulness.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We loved the Despicable Me movies, and based on all the reviews, we decided to download Minion Rush. This is a fun running game. My children love to play and so do their friends. Even I enjoy playing it. I could only play this game on my smartphone though. I had trouble opening it on my tablet.
1556438850|5.0|I've been teaching for a long time but every once in a while you have to take yourself back to &#34;start&#34; just to check in with yourself, this book was an easy read, full of great info, very straight forward. It was good to see the asanas consistently referred to in Sanskrit and illustrated and explained with great (while pretty universal) cues. I would encourage any new teacher to read this!
B001O1O71C|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie and found there are some interesting parts that the movie left out. It is worth reading and contemplating life from a child's perspective.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Great movie.  This is a great movie. Brings to light some characters from past movies.  Love it. Will watch it over and over
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Spoiler:  This isn't the kind of movie that ends up on a happy uplift, it is full of the love of friends and of being loved, but it is also about letting go and not being afraid to let go, even if it means assisting the loved one terminally suffering.  This is the kind of movie that really moves you, but I doubt it is one you watch over and over again.<br /><br />I had no idea before watching this movie, other than Benedict Cumberland was in it, whom I have seen in many other British films and he is excellent, whether using humor, or in this case suffering.<br /><br />Moves you to tears, quite literally.
B00D8HNR2K|1.0|If you are looking for the usual NIN dark guitar riffs - you will not find any on this album......if you are looking for the usual great Bass Guitar sounds - you will not find any.  If you want to hear any actual instruments being played - you will be sadly disappointed on this album. Even the electronic sounds that Trent Reznor usually is great at are terrible on this album.  It just seems that no effort was put into this album......maybe with the exception of I Would For You.  Other than that song, I am greatly disappointed in this album as a die hard Nine Inch Nails fan
B00112ASYO|5.0|Got this to prank a coworker. It was exactly what I expected. Would probably be a great toy for a kid too!
B007SGM084|5.0|W as led to believe by all the hype it was a sex story. Yes there was plenty of that, but mostly it was a genuine and sacrificial story of love.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like Indiana Jones. Montana Smith kinda looks like Indiana Jones &amp; the big monkey thing is like the GIANT boulder in the  first Indiana Jones movie.  Awesome game!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam is straight forward, funny and the energy experiments are excellent!! I would recommend this book to everyone! Teen age kids really need to do these experiments too! We are energy beings and we forget that, because society does not promote 'that way' of thinking. Get out of your rut, and move forward into your highest potential. Read this book!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The minions are cute and funny to listen to. For free it is an interesting way to pass a few moments when you need something to do.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it, it was really amazing and entertaining!  EXCELLENT IMAGINATION!!!  It was funny to see the minions jump and me to participate in the minion of the year!!!!
B005OOSPZO|5.0|still the best movie about the pearl harbor attack, as is usual there are some antiquated facts depicted. overall, however no other film has captured the reality of that day as tora tora tora has. the video clarity in blue ray is phenomenal.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|If you like Stevie Ray Vaughn you will worship Joe Bonamassa and add Beth Hart, you have the best there is right now and I hope for years to come. I would recommend this to any and everyone regardless of your taste in music.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I was raised on Shatner; my daughter is a dedicated Picard/Stewart fan. This version might just bring us together! I am so grateful to Roddenberry and Majel for establishing the dynamic boundaries for these epic works. Staying true to a concept has resulted in some of the most enjoyable viewing (and reading) for me and those I encourage to participate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The characters are real people who choose to step up and be heroes.  I loved that Cinna made a mocking jay outfit for Katniss.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book. There were times when I forgot it was a fictional account of a war against zombies.  There were even more times when I forgot it was a fictional war.  And even more to Max Brook's credit, there were times when I even forgot it was fictional.  It was that engrossing.  Fully engaging.  A shockingly realistic analysis of mankind's response to a global crisis.  A masterpiece!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am having such great fun with the beautiful puzzles. It is very relaxing and I make it as simple or as challenging as I want.
B001LM1456|4.0|I really enjoyed this version of the Hulk and actually viewed it twice, so I could really pick up the nuances.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great read. I hope he keeps this character going. The action is nonstop with great supporting characters. Cannot say enough.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's So easy! Just a press away to a version of the Bibles you choose then chapter and verse! Also when you are on a verse and change to a different bible version you do not lose the verse that was selected! Just Great and its free ...
0790729628|5.0|My only issue with this movie is that the fleebs don't match up with the florbes.  I mean, the gahoozefests are in order, but the fleebs are all willy nilly.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Man, I hate to give Downey credit! But I absolutely must! He is so appropriate for this role and does it so well.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|what I like best about this all-in-one Mahjong game is that there are lots of puzzle choices.  You can choose different tiles and keep track of your score so which allows for challengeing yourself to complete it faster.  Enjoy
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It was a good time. It wasn't always clear, and the magician characters were always more of a caricature than anything. Still, for a though-free, chase-em movie with one excellent fight scene (apartment with one magician two cops), it hit the spot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|On this game, your fingers better be in shape. The minion speeds up the farther you run. And the other thing I like about it is the different backgrounds or places. This is a game everyone will enjoy. Have fun playing!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|big walking dead junky love it and been watching it over and over till the next season starts ya ya
B005COO1X6|5.0|This story was a great read, but entirely too short.  Can't wait to get started on the next great one.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It did its job. It entertained me. It had a good plot and good acting. I would watch it again.
B008EKMB82|3.0|This could have been a 5 star book for me, however it transgressed on one of my big dislikes. The voice is that of the author in the first person writing a book, i.e. this one. OK, the writer is the writer. This has happened in a number of novels and it just sets my teeth on edge.<br />Having said that, this is a pretty gripping story line. It moves along. I am a buddhist, but not of the Zen tradition. Quantum physics is a model which plays well within buddhism, especially as the present is past is future and everything is part of everything else all the time. The plasticity seen in the story line appeals to me. I rather liked it except for the cheap trick of the writer being the writer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Has lots of options. I play this all the time, my favorite is to play &amp; relax while in bed before I go to sleep.
B003G4W49C|5.0|So, I thought I would not like anything that smacked of science fiction and mentioned enemies like the buggies. But I have t say I really liked this story
1781162646|4.0|This was a good book , not too scary.  It is not a favorite that I would read again, which I will do with books I really like.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this app I have always loved yahoo so it was a must for me and it works great
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I've never had any inclination to start this show but after realizing several friends like it and swear by its entertainment value I decided to dive in. I watched the first two episodes one weekend and liked, for the most part, what I saw, but it took me a little while to jump into the third episode. When I did I began to see more clearly the ways in which Doctor Who is brilliant. I get easily tired of shows, especially ones where mysteries are solved, that do the same thing each and every week. With Doctor Who we get the new locations, new enemies, new stories. I burned through season one in a few days and I'm looking forward to beginning season two.
B0073COMKW|5.0|These 60 watt equivalents produce great lighting and use very little electricity. They produce plenty of light for the room and the lighting is very natural and warm. They hardly use any electricity and don't produce heat like conventional bulbs.  I will never buy any other type of bulb.  From now on it's all LED bulbs.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It took about a month or 45 days to receive due to the popularity, but this was worth the wait.<br />The unit is small, well built and has a USB cable and plug in charger. This requires a powered USB port on a TV.<br />The unit required to be reset in order for me to set it up initially.<br />The chromecast works well with my android and iOS phone. I am able to also broadcast my Chrome browser onto the TV. This mimics the Airplay functionality built into MAC OS X. The fluidity is a little rough and I'm not gonna say it's bad...but it's not as good as my Apple TV.<br />Overall, for $35 this is an amazing value for a decent product. Google is at the front, pushing to expand it's product line and value for their services. I will keep this Chromecast in my suitcase for travel, enabling me to turn any hotel TV into a SMART TV with Netflix and (eventually) Hulu.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like this app it great for it's something the adults and kids can play and for some of us who grew up playing uno cards it great to be able to play online
0767810856|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that reminds us that honesty still exists. Good acting and believable characters contribute to the movie's excellence.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Jack London is a great author and his capture of the Spirit of the Great North has me coming back to reading this Novel again and again. The Way his portraiture of Buck the Dog one would think Jack could read the dogs mind. Actually I think as he developed Buck and the relations with the men of the north, Jack showed a great understanding of that Great Dog, in size, cunning, and loyalty. Join me by the fireplace and we will share the adventure of Buck and the North Country.
B005CRQ3H0|2.0|I'm having a lot of difficulty staying interested in this storyline. I only decided to read it because I know that it's being made into a movie and should be out next year. So far I haven't finished the book ... I probably won't finish it either.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Update...here is my review...The MAIN reason it stinks is that I had to get up a few times because a YouTube video hung up for several mintues and the only way to continue was to unplug and re-plug the unit at which time it would play fine until it stalled again for as much as 15 minutes without self-starting.<br /><br />It also sort of stinks because the only free video is on YouTube.  You cannot watch any personal videos that are on on your tablet; it does not show the internet on the TV; You cannot search the Internet; You cannot play your own music. Google play has no free videos...zero.  You cannot connect a desktop pc; only certain phones and tablets and laptops.<br /><br />Suggestion: Get a Blu-Ray or other player that lets you do much more.<br /><br />Original:<br />I now often DELETE many products that I order from Amazon because of the Georgia TAX.  Liberals don't realize that we pay shipping costs or pay for Prime at $79 a year.  And, used books and DVDs cost 3.99 shipping, so why are we punished by paying additional taxes?  Yeah, I know some are going to say 'tuff luck!'.  Go ahead, it is 'free speech' [unless you are a liberal; then only YOUR speech is free; not mine].  Anyway, it is my way of saying NO to taxing the internet [PS, we already pay huge taxes for internet and phone services].
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good book, but it's kind of predictable. It did make me cry though! Lol
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Cool,  Broadcast your internet to your tv.  Set it up on my laptop. Really like broadcasting youtube. Cons:  doesn't work perfect all the time. Have to mess with it to get it to work sometimes. Interferes with my TV reception. I use an outside antenna . I just unplug Chrome cast when I am not using. All in All really cool.  Worth the Money!!! Google still classifies as Beta. I am sure they will get the bugs out. It is the future!!!  Enjoy!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Interesting  read about all the different ways your life could go if you made different choices. It kept me guessing an  curious. The characters are well developed as well as their relationships.
0316056898|5.0|I've read hundreds of books in the last few years. This is hands down one of the funniest things I've ever read. I'm sure the people at my local coffeeshop thought I was nuts because I kept laughing out loud. It's pretty clear why Tina is the success that she is.  Brilliantly written and laugh out loud funny.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Did exactly what it said it would. Easy to use. I would recommend<br /> This app to clean up any unwanted / unneeded items in you tablet.
8866131105|5.0|Love the product, and its become my journal of choice since 2009....stacks neatly in a box when the year is done!
B002ZBPZNY|5.0|A must have CD. Lost my original and have been wanting to pick this CD up. You wont be disappointed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game. I wish there were my Facebook games that you could play. I like the short scenes because then you've not looking all day. Maybe change some of the things you look for so you've not looking for the same thing always.
1442337966|5.0|Going through some tough times at the moment and this has really helped me get myself back on track.<br />Listen to parts of it each night and it really gets my mind back on track.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Contrary to other reviews, my version only had 9 levels. Like some others mentioned, sometimes the clicks did not register so I found myself clicking the same spots multiple times. Another gripe keeping this game from the elusive 5 stars is the seemingly randomly placed items completely irrelevant to the puzzle. Other than that, a fun and challenging game.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|I dont like this game at all.  It is pointless and Jewel Quest is much better.  I would say go with that instead.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|This devide is easy to configure and works great.  It is also pretty accurate as compared to other devices.  I highly recommend it.
1582701709|5.0|A friend loaned me her book and after reading a few pages I could not put it down - had to get the CD's to listen too.<br />Has certainly put me in a more positive mind and helped me to get back on track.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these types of games. Slightly challenging and definitely fun. Wish there were more levels though. Had I known there were only 10 levels, I would have taken my time solving them. :(
B005HSL626|3.0|It's ok, but not a fan.  My 9yr old loves it though.  all you do is slice fruit all over the screen.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was one I couldn't put down. Great writing, amazing subject, real food for thought.  Highly recommended.<br />I need three more words, so here they are,
0345803493|5.0|can't wait to finish part one to start book two......i love it. this book is so addictive i can't stop
B000LXQVA4|4.0|We bought this jumperoo for our 3 month old son...he is a very curious/active little one & doesn't like playing on his back or tummy for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.....he seems to get bored quick....however; he is always happy when I was carrying him around...but that gets old real quick! I needed something else to entertain him for a few minutes a day so I could get a few things done around the house!<br /><br />At first he only liked being in the jumperoo for 5-10minutes....but after a few weeks he can now handle about 20 minutes in the jumperoo before he gets bored.<br /><br />CON - my son is of average height according to Dr BUT his legs are still not long enough/his feet do not touch the ground (he is now almost 5months old...my husband places a thick book underneath his legs for his feet to touch)...We do have it on the lowest height setting....I am hoping he will grow into the jumperoo soon...like I said he is not on the short side.  My husband says the toys are a little cheap for the price but our son seems to like them just fine.  I do wish there were a few other things to entertain him....the push button that pops up the tiger could have been something else more entertaining. The tiger barely pops up.<br />Overall, I am happy with this jumperoo.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is crazy addictive, want advice GET THIS GAME NOW DO IT it it's the best of all time it has updating game so it's never gets boring
B0025KVLRO|4.0|Despite it's not one of my favourite early age beatles' record, this 2009 remastered sounds great. You can hear so clearly the voices, the instruments. And the pictures book it's fantastic. It makes me want to get other records that already I have and aren't the remastered version.
0345803485|5.0|It is in very good condition and i'm very happy to finish reading it. i already got more then half done.
B005ERX1Z0|4.0|Ok it's not a great movie.  But if you like cars, if you like goofiness, if you like one gag after another, if you need a good laugh, if you want to see a lot of well known actors having a good time and generally spoofing their most famous roles, if you want a great popcorn movie, it you like to giggle, and if every once-in-a-while you just want to be silly for a little bit, this is your movie.  From the opening credits to the closing credits you cannot help but laugh.  The video is very good, the audio is just fine; the Blu-Ray version is the best you can get at this time.  The price is reasonable.  I've been laughing with this movie for over 30 years.  Biggest risk: the opening scene makes you think seriously about buying a Lamborghini.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really awesome . It's cute and its funny and just fun .so I really love this game oh yeah and I love despicable me so it's perfect .So please try this game
B005PK56TA|5.0|i have watched the first 2 seasons and enjoy every episode.. i cant wait for season 3 to start in fall
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|This is a silly little idea spun into 2 hours of kinetic nausea inducing camera angles and motion. It presumes that the lack of plot and total cinematic  predictably cam be disguised with kool moving cameras and smart ass dialog. Kind of a waste of talent and time.
B00BFTV09K|4.0|It's amazing the lengths the food industry giants go to to get you to buy their products. Nobody says it but addiction to salt,fat and sugar seems real enough !
0855329483|5.0|this book is creative but since i bought the book i found i had already got it so i gave to my sister.thank you.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I really loved this movie. All the graphics, characters and storyline came together beautifully. Some of the magical beings that we believed in when we were kids take on the Boogie Man when he tries to crush childrens hopes and dreams. Great cast for this movie. Might be a little scary for some younger kids but still an awesome movie for the whole family or a kid at heart. A great message for kids too. I do recommend the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the way the author tells the story from multiple points of view. Had a hard time putting it down!
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|This was a great book. I love it! This book tells about a boy that got lost from his family and lived with the tigers. He learns how to live a life in the jungle and has so many adventures in his life. Read this book to discover all the great places this boy goes to.
075669812X|5.0|We were going to buy it from scholastic at school but I decided to check at amazon and it was $8 less! I got it for him and he love it. He carries it everywhere we go.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|What a wonderful book. Humorous, inspirational, excellent! I read into the wee hours of the morning, I didn't want to stop!
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie was absolutely awesome from beginning to end! It is one of the best I've seen in a long time and my whole family enjoyed it. The end left our mouths hanging open in shock which was a nice change since I can usually always predict how a movie will go. It's a must see!
B009H7SCMA|5.0|This story is lovable and humorous.It didn't take me long to read at all. The author delivered with greatness and did a excellent job with the plot and the character development as well. For some reason the scenes played out like a movie in my mind as I read. Great job! I definitely recommend this story especially if you like comical and witty love stories.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Love this movie.  When we lost our original in the tornado, this was one of the first ones we replaced.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game for all aged! My 5 &amp; 7 year old love it as much as I do. Little minions are funny.
B002HK9I04|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever. South Park at their best. If you like South Park, you'll obviously love this. If you don't like South Park, get a life.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love this movie.  When we lost our original in the tornado, this was one of the first ones we replaced.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love ww2 stuff and this is worth the dollar anyone who loves world war 2 or just love guns in general you will love this then
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book delivers humour, real life examples, easy to follow experiments which deliver quick, proven results, just loved this book and have used the experiments with a personal development group.  I LOVE THIS BOOK!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Love this movie.  When we lost our original in the tornado, this was one of the first ones we replaced.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|My boyfriend watched this movie when it was in theaters and I was FURIOUS that he didn't take me.  When we talked about Dredd he told me it was \\"just okay\\" and that it was \\"really violent\\".<br /><br />I like violent movies BUT he and I generally like the same types of movies so I decided missing it was not a big deal.<br /><br />Now I am FURIOUS again that I did not get to see this movie in theaters.<br /><br />Yes, this movie was EXTREMELY violent but it is Dredd.  When was Judge Dredd ever supposed to be a pacifist?<br /><br />I enjoyed the over all storyline and the inclusion of a psychic and corrupt judges.  I hope there is a sequel and am actually thinking about watching this movie again tonight.
0385349947|4.0|I heard a lot of buzz about this book before I read it. As a young woman, working at a financial firm that can be an &#34;old boys club&#34; I looked forward to reading Sheryl Sandberg's book. Any advice, information, knowledge I can get about women and business is good for me. I know there were some negative reviews concerning this book, as Sheryl Sandberg comes from a privileged background, and how could she offer advice to women and anyone really, unless they’ve had the same opportunities. I disagree, I think this book is good for anyone, whether or not you were able to go to an Ivy League school or not. The main thing I got from this book was, we have to be the change we want to see happen. If women want things to change, we need to get ourselves in the positions to make those changes happen. Interestingly enough, in my Political Science class, two classmates said, and I quote “ Women are too emotional, I wouldn’t want a woman as President”. As a feminist and woman, you can imagine that made me very upset. But it also made me think of Sheryl Sandberg, if women want change, we need to be that change. We need to encourage and uplift. Overall, I liked this book and thought it was informative. I definitely learned some useful tips I will apply in the future.

B00030DEQE|1.0|This card proved to be incompatible with my computers that uses Windows XP and have Biostar Motherboards.  It caused my computers to constantly reboot during the installation process.  I never was able to successfully  install these cards on my computers.  I bought these cards, because of the good reviews.  In my case these cards never did work for my application.  When I tried the TRENDnet Gigabit PCI Adapter, the results were completely different.  I was able to successfully instal the TRENDnet Cards on my computers.  I am happy with TRENDnet TEG-PCITXR network cards.

B0083GQKQG|3.0|This movie is a real-life horror that most people can relate to in some way. This movie is not as thought compelling as the book since it attempts to answer question about characters quickly and imprecisely. If you end up watching this movie and end up thinking it never really got anywhere, read the book  because it's much more eloquent and delves deeper into the characters minds.

B000N2HCM4|5.0|In my opinion, this has been one of best life narration I have<br /> read so far! The humility in which this story is written, I could not help, but transport my mind and compare to my own roots and ancestors ways. The details made me feel as if I was sitting right there next to him listening to the the stories by Granny or Auma, so real, so full of life!<br />Of course I would recommend this book to anyone of my friends and family and coworkers.

1623650003|4.0|Phew! One thing is sure , this book leaves no one indifferent !<br /><br />Talking characters. Here we have Alex, victim or executioner? We do not know much about her until the end, and yet we feel for her a range of emotions! Her character is excellently written. She remains a mystery, but she seems fragile, very sure of herself, cold, she seems to suffer. You won't know if you like her or hate her or if you're concerned for her or if you think that she has it coming. I started to love her, then I did not know what to think of her. I wanted to blame Alex, but it was at odds with what I had felt for her before! And at the end! the end is incredible, again a change of context, another way of seeing things, it is even more confusing than it was. Pierre Lemaitre is really good in mixing your feelings! Facing Alex, we have cops: Camille, a (very) small in size, but (very) tough in determination Police commandant, Louis, the distinguished cop and Armand the generous stripper cop (you must read the book to know how that can be!) A trio not trivial, with a strong bond. This book bring some very engaging and realistic characters.<br /><br />The plot changes along the course of the story, we're looking for a victim, then for a hangman, we're looking for the reason behind all that's happening, we're seeking justice. The characters remain the same but the roles change. The context plays a growing role in the explanation. Everything must be understood and will be... at the end !<br /><br />Another important point in this book, which deserves to be mentioned because it is quite rare in thrillers. Reading the back cover, I saw the Figaro and Le Monde reviews - two French newspapers - the journalists spoke of a literary novel ... OK. So I started this book with a slight fear: will the bombastic style upstage the plot? Well not at all, on the contrary. The writing is fluid, often funny, tragic, cold and never boring. Indeed the quality of the writing is closer to literary style than thriller style. But you'll find literary flights, as well as slang dialogues, short shock sentences and very long sentences, sometimes only impactful words. It seems that Lemaitre is as strong to play with our feelings as he is to play with words .<br /><br />I give it a 4.5/5 !<br />(Originally posted at vanessa-s-bookshelves.blogspot.ca)

B009EEFTMC|4.0|Simple concept, easy to learn, yet challenging to master.  Two game modes and random puzzle generation make this game constantly renew itself so you never play the same puzzle twice.  The sound effects are a perfect match.  My only real complaint is that some of the cube designs can be tough to discern when at the far side of the cube (appears to be MIP mapping that causes the texture to be lower-resolution than the blocks on the near side of the cube).  The Kindle version doesn't seem to have this problem on its high-resolution screen.

B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I started watching this film, and going into it wanted to personally loathe it. But this remake is one of the better remakes that I have viewed in a while. The storyline is a little different than the original but it still piles on the gore. All fans of horror film and The Evil Dead should definitely view this one. It is still a lot of fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Just started playing it, but enjoying it so far. Doesn't seem as grindy and punishing as other similar app games.

B0007KS7D0|4.0|I recently purchased a Raynox M-150 'add-on' diopter lens to use with my Nikkor 105G macro lens.<br />The combination gives me a magnification range of 0.45:1 (0.45x life-size) at 'infinity', to 1.9:1 (1.9x life-size) at MFD.<br />This makes my true macro-photography much easier, as my lens no longer wastes time 'searching' for focus.

B00CHNKJFO|4.0|By far the most addictive app I have ever played!<br />Its pinball, but centered around Star Wars and its entirely free, ad-free, for one Table (pinball machine) that comes with scenes from the original episodes (ep.IV-VI)! The developers are making other tables that do cost money, but I feel like they are one of the few that aren't fooling you by making you pay for more time or extra things. In fact, the actual extras are entirely optional so a casual player can just enjoy the free table. For a hardcore Star Wars fan this is a most have! As each table has unique features and extra lore from the Star Wars universe inside. What's great is that you are also fighting for leaderboards, trying to contribute to the faction you choose as soon as you load up the game. Its light-side vs dark-side in pinball formula! And like Anakin you can switch whenever and cost free at any time!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The first three seasons live up to all the hype and then some. I'm not particularly a fan of period pieces, but this one has been great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game,  some levels are hard but still a good game. Need more levels though that last longer.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game has put a new spin on the racing games on the Amazon Appstore!!! This game (although not great in physics or engine behaviours) has a great way of incorporating battle, speed and strategy. Great app.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Just a bit over the top. I particularly disliked the CGI. Acting was pretty good however, and I really thought it had potential. I'm on the fence recommending it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app will not let me delete cities that I no longer need (due to moving from that area).  Even though I changed my home location, when I open the app it goes to the former city where I lived.  The iPhone version of this app is MUCH better. There are many more user friendly options!  Format the Android/kindle version after the iPhone version!

B00555X8OA|5.0|THis is a must read for anyone involved in group decision making, or anyone curious to truly understand what motivates us, and what really drives our decisions. It provides powerful insights into how we function, and it will change the way that you understand people's motivations and reactions.
B00CVPAJ94|5.0|I've watched already seen this movie at least 5 times and still haven't tired of it.  It's one of those perfect movies--both funny and touching.  I'm glad I've added this to my collection so I can watch it again and again.

B009RH9J7W|4.0|I originally bought this to have my Kindle Fire HD at the office but the way the power cord would sit under the whole thing, I just did not like. Now, I usually take this to travel with my Kindle Fire HD so it is nice, just not what I wanted to use at the office.

B000PC6A3E|4.0|This Batman is amazing. I love the Dark Knight. The voice thing that he does as Batman it alittle odd but all in all I find it to be a very good job. This movie is not as corny or flashy as earlyier Batman movies.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This DVD was everything I thought it would be. I ordered the first 2 seasons from another supplier and there is a DVD that skips but there are no skippings with this DVD. It was fast getting here as well.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|My wife loves Katy Perry and I must say this CD was not ad at all. It arived on time and in good condition. THe songs were up beat and fun to lesson to.
B002VCR03A|1.0|I haven't bought this book purely on principal.<br />I don't mind paying for an authors work, but when the price of the kindle is much more expensive than the paper back it makes you wonder why?<br />Surely the paper back is more expensive to produce with printing costs etc than just uploading it onto kindle and paying a small commission fee to amazon.<br />Even if the paper back book started out more expensive and it has now dropped, if you can afford to drop the price of a book then why not the kindle price.<br />This is very concerning for me and I must admit I was not impressed at all to see this.<br />I am one customer who will not be buying either the kindle or book!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The work that they put in ot this movie was outstanding. There can never be another Joker that lives up to what Heath did in this.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Love this show!  Broadchurch is a must see in our house -- for everyone in the house!  DirectTV messed up their episode numbers for episode 6, so our DVR didn't record it. Thank goodness for Amazon downloads. We were able to watch the episode before the next episode aired on BBCA.
B0025VLELQ|3.0|this was an ok Blue Ray but they could of done so much more for it. This move was one of a kind and paved the road in more ways then one for the future of space movies.
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|One great graphic novel. Way better on paper (or kindle for instance) than on movie. A must for every graphic novel fan.
0756407125|5.0|It's actually quite difficult to describe either of the two books in this series, as it's been incredibly well written and the story being told is far from simple.  Suffice to say, it's an amazing read for lovers of fantasy.  However, it reads like fiction in that the characters are real enough that you can imagine meeting them around the corner at a coffee shop (or the nearest inn.
B001EA4M7M|1.0|I am a HUGE Jane Austin fan.  Pride & Prejudice is my favorite of all her books.  I have seen most of the movie versions of this novel.  The worst, by far, is the Greer Garson version from 1946, in which the ladies dress like refugees from Tara (Gone With the Wind).  Either the film makers didn't know how people dressed in the early 1800's or they got a discount on left-overs from GWTW.  This version was almost as bad.  I could not tell which sister was which!  The four sisters couldn't be more different, yet in this version, they all acted alike.  Elizabeth didn't appear smarter or livelier than the others, and the little tart Lidia was indistinguishable from the others, not a saucy little flirt.  And Mr. Darcy, UGH!!  WHERE ARE YOU COLIN FIRTH?????
B007P3TMW2|3.0|I am told the protagonist is more sympathetic in print. I'd suggest reading the novel rather than watching the film.
B004EF65QA|5.0|This story was a total surprise.  I had never read the book, so I had no expectations, but it couldn't have been better.  I read the book immediately after seeing the series, and I think the TV version was actually better!!  The changes/improvements made by the screen writer were perfect and made me like many of the characters better than I would have just reading the  book.  Even if you are a big fan of the book, you should love this version.  This is almost a Pride & Prejudice in reverse.  Margaret is poor, but her father is a clergyman and considered upper class.  She is somewhat &#34;prejudiced&#34; against Mr. Thornton, who is a manufacturer, lower class.  (Oh No!  He as actually works for a living!)  In all fairness to her, he does act somewhat bad at the beginning,  but hang in there, he gets better.<br /><br />He falls for her immediately, but unlike Darcy (P&P) who feels he is too good for Elizabeth, Thornton believes that Margaret is too good for him.  The love story is set in the manufacturing town of Milton, a rather dreary place in the &#34;north&#34; compared to London and her home in the &#34;south&#34; of England.  Manufacturing, mills, workers vs. masters, and strikes all interact to make Margaret's and Thornton's love-life complicated and challenging, and to make each of them grow in understanding and character.<br /><br />Some American reviewers complained about the DVD being the English version which didn't play in their DVD players.  I am a USA viewer (California) and did not have any trouble with my DVD.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I am really enjoying this book. It is interesting, and the way it is divided into relatively short 1st person accounts keeps it from being an intimidating read. I am a fan of the show, but found a few of the story lines to be a tad boring - particularly those including Jon. I suspected that I would actually care about the character in the book, and that was definitely the case.<br /><br />If you go to read the book and find yourself confused by all of the lingo or have trouble grasping the situation, my recommendation would be to watch a little bit of the show. After doing so, the confusing parts made much more since.<br /><br />This book was pretty cheap for a Kindle Book, and I would definitely buy it again.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|David Mitchell's book and the movie based on it are entertaining, stimulating and emotionally engaging. Looking at the 'big picture' of humanity through multiple lives across hundreds of years challenges the reader into interacting both emotionally and intellectually with the story and its characters. The themes and ideas were at times jarring and at other times reassuring. I highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy a complex plot and a strong and stirring message. Along with everything else, the book is simply entertaining.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Mr Locke's book helped me get the right perspective on publishing an Ebook with Amazon. I'm in the process of doing that right  now!
B004SIP6A4|5.0|We LOVE everything about this movie--the story, the characters, the music!<br />At least once a year we enjoy playing it.  It's a visual and auditory treat!
030758836X|3.0|Predictable start, surprising twist, tepid ending.<br />I love a thriller - and Lee Child, Ruth Rendell, etc. have provided me many a blissful reading moment.  In \\"Gone Girl\\", the author gives us a stock-standard start as happens in many a breaking-news item: wife disappears (Amy), finger points to the sneaky-looking husband (Nick), the police/ media/ reality-show-loving public have a field day joining the dots to the arrest of the husband.  It is True Crime masquerading as a Reality Show.<br /><br />Therefore, I admit to having waded through the story where the husband is trying to claim his innocence, all the while showing little-to-no interest in his missing wife. He throws in a few bombshells e.g. about his activities and interests, including lack of a reliable alibi.  During this part of the book, I put the book down many times, hoping not only that there would be a twist, but that it would be worthwhile.<br /><br />Then came the twist - thank goodness, or I may not have finished the book.  And it led to an ending that I thought was too clever for me.  So when I read with interest a number of readers' comments on this page, I found that many of them were similarly disappointed by the ending.<br />Gillian Flynn has been quoted in EW online saying that she didn't write it as an open ending to set up a sequel.  But the ending \\"... was the only thing that made sense to me, that made sense to what was true to the book and true to the characters. ... (Some content removed to avoid spoiler). She's Amazing Amy!\\"<br />And, \\"I sought different ways to end it, and that one was the one I kept coming back to that felt the way those two would quote work out their issues.\\"  Hmmm. Still did not satisfy me.  After investing in reading 430+ pages, I wish the author had a definite conclusion in mind and execution.

The stories are joined by a very thin thread. Almost 8 degrees of separation. I didn't care much about the characters and the ending was flat. Disappointing to say the least.
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|Very good disc. I'm not a huge fan of Whitney Houston per say, but this particular collection I do enjoy.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this sonic screwdriver and when I opened the package I was impressed. It's good quality and really makes you feel like 9/10. My co-workers are whovians too and they loved it and bought their own.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Sorry, I love most Stephen King books, but this one.....NO Way!!  It was just stupid!!  I couldn't see the dialoge coming out of the mouths of the children.  Completely STUPID!!!
B000002U6E|5.0|Excellent. Exactly what I wanted to listen to on those quiet evenings. I also  listen to the CD in my car on the way home in order to relax.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just finished my 26th time reading this.  It was as good as the first time and I'll read it again I'm sure.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|LIKE IF COOL MATH BROUGHT YOU TO THIS AMAZING GAME &quot;Sugar, sugar&quot; I recommend it if you love strategy and prefer Awesomeness
B00DP3IESY|5.0|While I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, I think this will be one of my favorite movies the year. I though cinematography was excellent and the story was intriguing.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Game simply isn't playable on a Toshiba Thrive running Android 4.0.4. It starts up correctly, but crashes at some point within the first duel, making it impossible to proceed in the game.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Don't know why I waited so long to start this series. Great story, interesting characters. Slow beginning but quickly becomes a real page turner.<br /><br />As for kindle format, its great. Bookmark the map - you'll want to reference it often.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The actors and the story are really good. Definitely worth watching. But be careful: it is very, very addictive!! :)
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Awesome well worth it. A must have for all &#34;Clone clubbers&#34;  Tatiana Maslany is amazing.  Can't wait for season 2.
B00CLD671A|5.0|Whether you're a history buff, a student of human social behavior, or an incurable romantic, this series will push all of your buttons.  The acting is fabulous, the accuracy to historical fact is meticulous, and the story line is both believable and unpredictable.  Can't wait for Season 4!!!!
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|I opted for the reg version not the HD but still, this shouldn't happen...The film was very pixilated in scenes where there were lots of small detail, such as the opening scene where they are running from the indigenous tribal folk. While running through the woods, loads of pixilation. I may ask for a refund.
B009Q6ADG0|2.0|I was under the impression that this CD by Adelle would include the entire soundtrack from Skyfall not just her song. Her song is is great but for the money I spent for this CD it was not worth just this one song. Would have done better downloading the song only if I knew that it wasn't the entire soundtrak. I won't do that again!.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It's a good read; unexpected twists, well written characters, romantic.  The supernatural is believable in that &#34;It's easy to suspend your beliefs&#34; kind of way.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It wasn't until Halloween season of last year (2012) that I first found out about \\"Firefly\\" (and Serenity). While working at Universal Studios, at their annual Halloween event, most of us spent our break times discussing our favorite 'scary' movies and other movies / t.v. shows. Now, I know that 'scary' is not really applicable to \\"Firefly\\", let alone \\"Serenity\\", but both the series and movie came up in conversation on more than just a couple of occasions. I had never heard of either one, let alone knew what either the series or movie were about (?). I must have kept those conversations in the back of my mind though ........<br /><br />Several months later the \\"Firefly\\" series aired on one of our cable stations, and remembering how many times this series came up during those Halloween night conversations, I decided to tape the series and check it out when I had the time. Well, that said, I was hooked right from the very first episode. This is unusual, considering that I'm not exactly what you would call an avid sci-fi fan. While I can't pinpoint the precise reason or reasons why I was hooked so quickly I can recall recognizing only one of the actors ~~ Nathan Fillion (whom I had seen in White Noise 2). While I had never heard of any of the other actors, I thought that the overall casting was a great effort. Some casts just \\"gel\\" while others don't; this one definitely did !!!! There's a bit of something for everyone - i.e. action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy. As for the basic plot of the series, it's certainly been rehashed in so many already posted reviews. So rather than rehash it again, I'm posting this as a newcomer to the \\"Firefly\\" series, as well as someone who hopes to convert more newcomers. Better late than never, I suppose ......<br /><br />If you like a good story, in the form of a mini-series, with the sci-fi aspect reminiscent of Star Wars ... in that it's not the type of sci-fi that is especially for the die hard sci-fi crowd, then you might want to give this series a chance. It seems the network / studio that aired the series back in 2002 didn't agree with my last statement, as the series was cancelled after only a few brief months. That said, the fans ~ known as \\"Browncoats\\" ~ refused to let the series just die and fade away .... much to the surprise and approval of the cast and creators, whom also thought the series had not been given a proper chance. IF I had known about \\"Firefly\\" back in the day I would certainly have been hooked when it originally aired. I have a feeling that a lack of knowing about this wonderful series (or perhaps a lack of publicity?) is why others probably also didn't know about it until recently. I am now a proud member of the \\"Browncoat\\" family and, thanks to syndication and DVDs, a happy owner of both the series and the follow-up feature film. It's a shame that so many GOOD shows die an early death due to premature cancellation, only to be upstaged by more and more idiotic reality shows. I want to thank all the \\"Firefly\\" fans for not letting this one get away ....
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|It started out a little slow to me, but I knew that I couldn't just put it down. Nicholas Sparks always has a way of sucking you into the story. What a wonderful ending.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I  absolutely loved this book.  Jamie  McGuire is  an  author that is able to evoke  pure  emotion through her story telling. I  laughed. I  cried. I  was  scared. I  smiled  until  my  face  hurt....I  will  continue to read everything she writes. :)
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Calling this show my second favorite is actually a pretty big compliment! My #1 favorite is Parks & Recreation - I absolutely love the entire cast and the writing. I can identify with the characters of this show (Kat's much more so than Beth's), and the humor is less satirical, more sarcastic and in your face. I'm basically a comedy junkie, and this show makes me laugh as much as I was hoping to! Looking forward to more seasons!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The unit I received didn't work for me. The connection to this device from my iPad and HTC One kept on dropping.<br /><br />This product does not support Wireless-N 5GHz band and all my devices at home (my iPad, MacBook Pro, HTC One, Samsung Smart TV, Synology NAS, Samsung Bluray player) are connected either via LAN or via 5GHz band. I suspect this could be the reason why this didn't work properly.<br /><br />As a product, my feelings are explained below.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Price is great; it costs only $35 compared to most set-top boxes which cost around $100<br />- Form factor is very small; it is a HDMI dongle and you can put it in your HDTV's HDMI port although you need to power it from a USB source.<br />- It can cast contents from Chrome web browser (laptop or desktop) but mobile chrome is not supported. You can cast YouTube, Netflix and Google Play contents from mobile devices.<br />- It is not a screen mirroring device (like AirPlay of AppleTV); it uses cloud. i.e. you can stream a YouTube video from your mobile device and can switch off the device, the play on your TV won't stop. And, you can manage that video from your chrome browser.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Works only in USA at the moment and Google has a bad habit of keeping things in &#34;beta&#34; mode for very long time (e.g. Gmail).<br />- Supports only 2GHz band of your WiFi. This is one of the significant limitations. A device made in the year 2013 has no support for 5GHz; are you kidding? We are talking about WiFi AC standard and this crap doesn't support part of Wireless-N (5GHz)!! This will have impact on 1080p video (sampled at 20+ mbps while shooting) streaming for sure.<br />- Very limited app support at the moment; it only supports YouTube, Netflix and Google Play (music and video). heck! my TV has both YouTube and Netflix app built-in and my android phone has YouTube Remote App; another $35 on such a device is not worth (at least at this moment).<br />- HD video streaming is not as smooth as expected. It has lags and I could see framing issue in the videos (looks like some of the frames reach with some delay) while casting a 1080p YouTube video from my HTC One to TV.<br />- Heavy dependency on High speed internet (and yet it does not support 5GHz band!!)<br />- You cannot play your local files (audio/video); heck! my android device can play those using a DLNA-UPnP app. And, most HDTVs come with DLNA feature, so this is not a compelling need from this device, but it would definitely a nice-to-have. Plus, many people tried playing local content by opening those in Chrome browser and then casting it, but result is not good. The contents are too slow.oth as expected.

B00D5LC4GY|2.0|I downladed it as the freebie today.  I'm glad I did not pay for it. It's a well made/constructed game but I got 4 levels in before I got bored. It may interest other people more, but that wasn't the case for me.
B001TAJGO6|4.0|love the questions this movie asks, and love jim carrey and kate winslet in it! a romantic, funny, philosophical movie

B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I began reading The Giver thinking I would read a simple tale written for my grandkids but realized quickly that it was an epic philosophical study and warning about what we stand to lose as we strive for more more convenient and organized lives. Hooray for nonconformity.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 3 is  a great show, with darker topics compared to Season 1 & 2. You can tell that the characters are more weary from the run, with each dressing becoming more ragged. Putting the show aside, I was very glad with the swift response Amazon delivered to me from the date of release, sending it to me thousands of miles away so quickly!

B00DGN51O8|5.0|Jack and the Beanstalk story is pretty simple.  This movie took that simple story and made reasonable conclusions come to life.  Though they added a few things, all the additions were in keeping with the original story as most people would remember it. The additions made sense.  The Giants were pretty bad villains but not overly and unnecessarily gory in their actions.

B004H4XDBI|3.0|I read if I stay in 4 hours, so I was really wanting this book to be just as good but it wasn't. You see things from Adams point of view but the story is just a little flat and not as touching, emotional, or heartwarming as If I stay.

B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Many levels to choose from as nd hours if great fun! You can play teams or against the computer, either/any way will give you hours of fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pocket edition is a lot more limited than the full version, but that doesn't stop me from giving it five stars! Besides, if there's something you don't like about it, it updates to fix bugs, improve things or add cool new stuff. Minecraft is a very creative sandbox game that is probably one of the more popular games. For those of you who play the other two versions, they are going to be introducing redstone in I think November. Some time In the future for sure.

The stories are just so captivating and I can't wait for the next one to come out!!!

If you truly would like to ad advance and discover all the wonderful tthings this game has to offer, one must be willing to learn how to & exactly when to, use items or, exactly when to conserve them! Although this is critical for any further advancement, it is not at all difficult to do.

B007THA4FI|1.0|My kids grew up reading Harry Potter, and I enjoyed the books, too. Ms. Rowling created many wonderful,engaging characters along with the necessary awful ones.<br /><br />Now, in her first adult book, the characters are an assortment of awful people that I could'nt relate to in a dreary story about small-minded, small town politics. The only bright spots were two teen-aged girls who were dealing with serious issues.ppm
B00F35BV64|1.0|There was a problem with the streaming, so I didn't get to watch it, looks like I will have to rent it elsewhere.<br />The 1 star a gave it does not mean I hate it it means I didn't get to see it yet.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Not as funny as i expected. More of a drama. Good heartfelt movie. It was my wife's pick so what's a man to do.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|Although I loved the actors and how they where so much like the original cast, except Chekov.<br />The time travel destroyed the original story line, and it should have ended with Cpt Kirk and crew correcting the time line.
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|Shortly after Josh Homme's first band Kyuss called it quits, he formed a new band called Queens Of The Stone Age. Ironically, the new band contained a couple of members from his former group- notably Nick Oliveri. They went on to release their self-titled debut \\"Queens Of The Stone Age\\" on an independent label. They would move to Interscope Records for the release of their sophomore effort \\"Rated R\\"- however, their biggest success would be right around the corner. 2002 saw the arrival of their most commercially successful outing yet- \\"Songs For The Deaf\\", which featured contributions from Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and Screaming Trees founder Mark Lanegan. At the height of their success however, Nick Oliveri was fired from the band. The remaining members continued on as trio for the dark album \\"Lullabies To Paralyze\\" and their final album for Interscope, 2007's \\"Era Vulgaris\\". In between time, the members devoted time to various side projects. By the time the regrouped to record a new album, they were back to their roots as independent artists- signing with the legendary alt-rock label Matador Records.<br /><br />In 2013, they released their newest album \\"...Like Clockwork\\". Unlike previous albums- minus \\"Era Vulgaris\\"- this new album is short and straight to the point. They self-produced the entire album with the exception of the title track, which was produced by Homme and UNKLE founder James Lavelle. They start the album off with the opening track \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\", which features additional vocals from Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears. \\"I Sat By The Ocean\\" has the trademartk QOTSA sound, while they create a piano driven ballad \\"The Vampyre Of Time And Memory\\". The song \\"If I Had A Tail\\" creates an unholy alliance between disco and stoner rock, but surprisingly works. Dave Grohl makes his second appearance on a Queens Of The Stone Age album, playing on roughly half the songs- including the first single \\"My God Is The Sun\\". The album takes a turn with the turn with the moody ballad \\"Kalopsia\\", while Elton John appears on the song about cutting loose fake people \\"Fairweather Friends\\". On \\"Smooth Sailing\\", Josh sings about being over the troubled times in his life, while stretching out on the six minute ballad \\"I Appear Missing\\". Overall, \\"...Like Clockwork\\" is an amazing return from Queens Of The Stone Age. Despite a label switch and extensive personnel changes, the band still knows how to make a great album.ith the turn with the moody ballad \\"Kalopsia\\", while Elton John appears on the song about cutting loose fake people \\"Fairweather Friends\\".

B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I recently purchased the MDNA World Tour Blu Ray and believe the disc to be defective. The 5.1 audio track seems to be mixed incorrectly; there is no sound from the front-right and rear-right channels, and very little sound from the subwoofer channel. I know of many people within the United States that have purchased this Blu Ray and have been posting on forums about this issue. I wanted to help bring this defective Blu Ray to the attention of whoever is able to offer a corrected replacement. It seems that not every stock of every country it was released has been affected but most of the people who have purchased this Blu Ray within the U.S. have had problems. Please help to get this issue to the attention of the right people.

B00124PXW8|5.0|This is the original version of the film that appeared in theaters, and in my opinion the best, as the &#34;directors cut&#34; has all the things in it that the director originally felt....and rightly...was too over the top.<br /><br />It's a classic film, not just for it's horrific scenes, but because it's a perfect storm of a movie....great script, superior casting, ace cinematography and editing, and amazing sound.<br /><br />Jason Miller, in his first movie role, is particularly engrossing as a troubled priest, and Ellen Burstyn is believable and effective as the tortured mother of Regan. It truly is a classic.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|As with Kite Runner, Khaled Hosseini takes you to this beautiful and yet horrifying look at life in Afghanistan.  It will haunt you as did Kite Runner and the writer always brings redemption to  his characters.  I can understand why many of our soldiers come back with PSTS after witnessing some of the cultural and sad things this country and its people struggle with daily.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|For the simple concept alone used in this game deserves 5 stars. The puzzles that gets presented in each level are interesting and gets solved by your own crafty drawing & that makes the game super sweet. This is one interesting puzzle game.

I enjoyed the story, the characters, and to a layman like me it seemed viable.  I don't read books or watch movies to stay into reality.  I want to believe in the stories I read, but that is why I enjoy reading.  To me it was a fast read.  Thanks Dan Brown for a technological thiller that kept me on my toes!!!

1401324029|5.0|Was an excellent read, much like all the RC books! Def try to get it in hard back as it just looks better. Every Castle super fan should own a copy!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Everyone has a crazy side and although I am not the greatest ben stiller fan this is still my favorite.
B0063M22QO|4.0|ITs ok but if you don't figure it out it lets you reshuffle the tiles and you always win.  Not cool
B00000K3D4|5.0|I know this is old school and I am aging myself for everyone but this is hands down the best movie of our ( the new elderly) time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The convenience is wonderful.  Can always have the Word with me when I want to read something. Easy to use..... like the bookmark feature.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the BEST GAME IN THE WORLD. You so need to buy this game because it's the best game in the world.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Was very excited to rewatch season 10 before the new season starts....  Ive watched since the intro episode from JAG!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio continues the Angry Birds story where the birds have to rescue their friends and set them free.  It is a great game and no ads make the game even more enjoyable.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|What a bad product! It is defective! In Germany, UK and France this item is under examination.<br />Amazon USA please Stop selling defective copies! It's a shame!!!!!<br /><br />UNIVERSAL, please produce new copies who are not defective!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds classic is an awesome game to play and keeps you entertained for hours at a time.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great game.  The ad free version makes the game even more enjoyable.
B001NTZE9O|5.0|With elements of  Rock Gino Vannelli's Brother to Brother album is soulful theater for the ears,as always Gino's vocals and lyrics demands attention. The \\"hit single\\" was \\"I Just Wanna Stop\\", but it is by no means the only gem on this record, \\"The River Must Flow\\" \\"Feel Like Flying\\" \\"Evil Eye\\" and the title track \\"Brother to Brother\\" deserves a listen. The'70s was the years of the singer/songwriter,we all know Stevie Wonder,James Taylor,Carly Simon and a host of others for their songwriting abilities but Gino Vannelli was there too doing his thing ! If you have never heard of him before,might i suggest his album \\"A Pauper In Paradise\\" to start you off or if not that Brother to Brother will do.
B004LROMQG|5.0|I've seen all 4 seasons - This one was the best.  Aggravaine is the best and so is the whole Gwen and Prince Arthur's relationship is the best.  Highly recommended.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|So far I haven't had any problems. I like the level of customization and the ability to dim with a swipe of my finger.
1781162646|1.0|I read a little bit and tossed it.  All the characters at the amusement park were just too \\"clever\\" and \\"cool\\".  Didn't interest me.
B00CIS1OKW|5.0|Great movie!!!! Great graphics!!!! a little difrent then the childhood story we all know as kids, its not just a story of jack and a giant. It a new age love story with action packed war story combined. highly recommend to someone who thinks its just a kids story.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Boooooo. This product is not as good as I would like it to be. It does etch a line across the bottle, but not deep enough to do much good.
1423136802|5.0|The boys loved this set.  One of my Grandson have read other books by the same author.  They split the set between them
B0091REZMW|5.0|Sweet hidden object game with a quirky sense of humorous and tasks and variuos characters. Love that you can interact with other players as helpers and give and receive gifts without facebook
1451638450|5.0|This is a Vorkosigan Saga book that is lighter than most.  It is funny and refreshing, a nice break from mundane life.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Great movie with amazing scenes. I do not regret having this film in my collection. This movie was above my expectations.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|In shiny blu-ray quality, shipped with alternate formats I prefer. The packaging wasn't perfect and wrinkled the corners of the media box. The movie itself would be better described by more artistic reviewers than me.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This was like a combination of Wall-E, 2001, and Planet of the Apes.  I wish there were more Morgan Freeman, but it kept me guessing and had a good ending.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|One round will only take a few minutes but you will want to play over and over. The goal is to knock your opponets out of the round while not getting eliminated yourself and if you make it to the end of the round you need to have the card with the highest value to win. There are so few cards that everyone can easily learn the unique powers (and rules) that each card has in no time and those powers are so well designed and simple that it makes for a very fun and different experince everytime you play. Here is an example:<br /><br />My daughter draws a Baron card which allows you to compare the other card you are holding to any other players card. The player with the lowest card value is eliminated. She chooses me and I have the King card (value 6) which only two other cards (out of 16) can beat. I think my chances are good then discover she is holding the Countess (value 7), I'm eliminated, bummer.<br /><br />The next round, I'm dealt the Countess and draw the Baron. Ah Ha! payback time. I choose my daughter and expect to elminate her only to discover she was dealt the Princess (value 8) and I elminate myself. The game is awesome and it's affordable. I would highly recommend buying it before they stop making it one day.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Decided to watch this movie using our ROKU streaming projector and it was really great! At first both myself and my husband were hesitant because well, quite honestly we expected it to suck. But I heard good things about it and it was free so what the heck. Partway through the movie I started thinking that Dredd was Karl Urban and to my surprise, it was!! Even though all you could see was his mouth he was really great as Dredd. His posture, tone, there was a scene where he knew he was screwed and even though you can't see his face, it really says it all. Great movie. What a surprise. I wasn't really a fan of the slow-motion scenes, I think they were a little too long, but the whole movie was pretty great. And as I mentioned earlier, having Karl Urban in it was a real bonus.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was a great game .I had fun grooming,feeding,and playing with it. This is not one of those free games that afterwards to continue you have to pay. It is a fun interactive,safe game that teaches you the responsibility of taking care of a pet.I recommend that you get it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|but in a good way - enjoyed it - just a very strange plot - good book - can understand why people have raved about it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but I wish there were more levels. Challenging but not too difficult that I felt I wanted to give up.
1476719071|5.0|Not very often do I read a book that pulls me in the way this one did.  I found myself so captivated by the characters and their story that I couldn't put it down until I read the entire book in 1 sitting.
B000VZGK3K|5.0|The Aviator, an epic biopic of Howard Hughes' career, won 5 of 11 Oscar nominations, 4 of 14 BAFTA, 3 of 6 Golden Globe, and 1 of 11 Satellite. It was well deserving of all these industry accolades, and more not listed here. His second film with Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role has a lengthy all-star list of supporting actors and actresses that include Cate Blanchett, John C. Reilly, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe. It's little wonder The Aviator collected dozens of major industry award nominations: (1) Stellar performances from a large all-star cast, (2) great attention to detail for accurate period costumes, props and sets spanning several decades, (3) numerous special effects created with large scale models (instead of using CGI), (4) special methods used on the film during processing to recreate the look of Hughes 2-strip \\"Multicolor\\" process used in the 1930's for color movies in the first 1/3rd of the film, then a shift in the processing to recreate the appearance of 3-strip Technicolor for the remainder of the film, and (5) a long 2:49 running length with a pace and sufficient action that makes it seem shorter than it really is. The Aviator is an epic in more than length and subject scope, it's epic in a half-dozen different aspects that were superbly executed. Even if the subject matter, Hughes' life, were not of interest, seeing the film just to observe the technical work that went into making it is worth while.<br /><br />Blu-ray transfer is excellent with great color and much detail which would be expected with a 2004 film. The multi-channel audio is impressive, particularly the directional aspect of ambient environmental sounds from ongoing background activities (e.g. aircraft engine sounds) to include tracking of moving sound sources.
B000IXUOP0|5.0|very well done. I go back and re-watch episodes from this season every once in awhile. would recomend this series.
0783208227|5.0|Robert Downey sings in this movie.  A great movie for a family<br />with older children. Jr. High on.  It made a great Christmas Gift.
0345457684|5.0|Awesome character in an awesome \\"'verse\\".  Very original and well fleshed out.  Holds no punches,  has it's own society from the demographics to the slang.  Tolkien may have been envious.
B00004CYS9|5.0|This is a great family movie that makes a good gift for a Christmas gift.<br />Recomended for older children age ten and up. A great family adventure.<br />A remake of the halley Mills movie about twins.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Do i really even have to say anything? If you saw this as a kid it was down right amazing!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie has many great British movie stairs<br />and one great American president played by<br />Angelena Jolies former husband.  Adult content.
B004GWW5HE|4.0|Unlike the 2nd Hot Shots, this one is funny in all avenues. My wife never saw it till now and she really enjoyed it.
B0094MFITS|5.0|I'm the chief I know everything.  Jessie Stone is The second best character Robert B Parker wrote.  Tom Selleck brings this character to life.  You end up liking him even though he has a drinking problem...an obsession with his ex wife and an inability to explain why he does things the way he does.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have tested this product now on several networks with several TVs, streaming from several services from my Galaxy S3, Galaxy Tab, and Windows 8 desktop over Chrome. With the latter I easily casted Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu free, and MLB.tv in fullscreen HD. For $35, there is nothing better out there. It won't replace my full on HTPC, but it wasn't designed to. It was invaluable when I took it to a cabin in the mountains last weekend. Great little gadget.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I loved this book and will definitely read it many more times. The advice is priceless and makes you take a look at yourself and how you relate to others. I am now reading the Fifth Agreement.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD along with Ripped in 30. Goodness Jillian really knows how to get you in shape and QUICKLY! As I said in my previous post about ripped in 30,if you concentrate on technique and doing the exercises correctly as opposed to repetitions, the you will most certainly see results. You can also make your own weights at home if you don't already have them. Just fill 2 700ml water bottles up and bam! Instant 1lb weights. If you want heavier ones, you can buy purified water jugs at cvs or target and use those for your rows and presses. Modify your diet, by cutting the extras, (Starbucks, Jamba juice, soda, salt, fast food, snacks) and eat fruits and veggies. Also, SUPER IMPORTAANT to make your workout the first thing that you do so that you're burning fat stores and not food that you consume for breakfast!!! Best of luck to you, be safe and be sure to talk to your doctor before beginning any exercise program! in 30 days Ive met my weight goal, lost 4 inches from hips an bust, 3 inches from waist. That's worth $8!
B003UYV08E|5.0|As good if not better than the first Iron Man movie. Great special effects, lots of action with the right amount of humor. Looking forward to the next one.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Book dragged on a bit (and seemed repetative) in the middle.  Picked up, but ended abruptly towards the end.  Short chapters kept me enaged.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I liked all of the characters in this book. I would recommend this book to all of my friends. It's a great adventure.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is amazing. Now Teresa can't be trusted! This book has things that you don't find everyday. Go Thomas!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works really well but occasionally my devices have trouble discovering the chromecast over my network. Not really sure why this is happening.
B00C0233A0|5.0|This is a great and exciting movie... and even better in 3D!  Definitely worth the money! You won't be disappointed!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My daughter's favorite movie. LOVE the music. Steve Carrell is a genius and is fabulous. What a great movie. Excellent.
0812982622|5.0|Fascinating story.  Results in making the real time newspaper articles about N. Korea come to life and  much more relatable.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What a great value. Streaming Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies, Music, etc. Even Chromecasting tabs within Chrome browser on a Mac/PC. I LOVE THIS THING.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy being able to see different writings, some will read to you and you can download to your device when no wifi available
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Enjoyed all of the episodes.  The whole series is simply fun!  It's something both my husband and I watch together.
1596177373|5.0|I've wanted to own a deck since I attended the Tim Burton Exhibit in Toronto.  These cards arrived in perfect condition- on time and as described. And at the price I paid they proved to be a great buy.<br /><br />I love them!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Good story line, however there were few times i skipped some paragraphs... All & all I was happy with it - now I can see the movie :)
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Love the recorded songs just as much as I love hearing them live. Can't wait 'till I see them live again. This will definitely<br />&#34;do&#34; until!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I was pleasantly surprise I enjoyed the movie so much.  Good cast of actors to carry on the Star Trek story.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|definitely dancing!  I am soooo into this band it's not even funny!  Going to be a lifelong fan! I know it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game its so fun to playyy play it irdetggry hope was here she is not a powerful hagsgfy I anm exam ghost
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|Heard this band play with the Black Crowes this summer and fell in LOVE. Ordered everything they've done and I am a happy happy camper. I have made up my mind...love them!
B005LAIGZU|4.0|For a military movie, I love this film.  Some say the acting isn't all that great but I appreciate the fact that it revolves around the more technical true to life aspect of the special forces world instead of the hyped up made for movie experience that modern war flicks are.
B002ECN4P0|4.0|good sound quality. great songs. Happiness! Just like I remember them. Never get tired of my stones! Takes me back!
B000F1IQNC|1.0|It was never received and it was for a birthday gift.  My granddaughter was without her requested video.  I am so disappointed.
B002R88G5E|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Read 'The Kite Runner',  Khaled Hosseini is an excellent story teller and this book didn't disappoint. An insight into another world. Would recommend this book, very good read.
B00CM1S1QK|5.0|If you are a fan of Nina, get the set! It has a lot of her earlier recordings with different renditions of her popular songs. Absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of Nina, get the set and you will become a fan.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Great way to watch again my favorite episodes and review the previous season in a &#34;Once Upon a Time swoop is great!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Great book- good story line which kept me interested. Funny wit throughout the book and learning more about quadriplegic living was intriguing. Will definitely look for more of her books.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am going to keep this short. I really like this album, the first one of Taylor's albums I have listened to start to finish. I can not figure out why the first song \\"State of Grace\\" is not a single? It is one of the best songs I have heard in years and is quite different from her normal singles that I think it would be a huge hit and bring in new fans like myself. Anyone else agree State of Grace should be a single?
140006922X|5.0|A very interesting book, dispels a lot of myths and lies and tells a lot of truths that many need to hear. Well done.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Awesome bingo game.Great features and credits good. Charms earned are fun to try and get and you can trade with others if needed. TRY IT........
B00DP8XSQ2|1.0|Not what it said it was. Don't click on it! Read the reviews. I didn't read them until afterword. oops!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie is very well done. Entertaining!  Very good for a date night as it appeals to men and women
0761172726|5.0|LOVE this calendar! I especially love how there are spaces that you can write in for other Family members to keep track of everyone. Besides the &#34;Mom&#34;section, I wrote in &#34;Dad&#34; and our kids in the remaining tabs. Love the stickers for things like birthdays, no school, Doctor, etc. this is very helpful for a busy Mom and Family!
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|From beginning to end each song has it's own uniqueness to it. It really combines a lot of different instruments from pianos to violins. The rythms will change at anytime and each rhythm fits perfectly in each song. I believe it combines previous albums works from fast paced brutal songs to very smooth melodic sounds. The message they send is very positive and truthful, definitely one of my favorite albums and that's saying something from someone who has hundreds of albums from many different bands in the same musical genre.
B008XTVWHK|5.0|good movie for the Ray Harryhausen fans!  Love all of his movies even if they are a little old fashion for today's computer age.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Best author ever! This book does not disappoint. I can't wait fir him to write another book. Just as incredible as always.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This was a good, quick read.  The story line is not the most ingenious but still somewhat enthralling.  Her writing is good and I found the style quick and easy.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|This is definitely one of my favorites from QOTSA.<br />It is slower paced and more brooding than previous releases, but it is clear that for Homme, this was a very personal album and the lyrics reflect that. As usual, the riffs in some of these songs hit really hard and the groove will be in your head for the rest of the day. The whole album is cohesive but some songs (I Appear Missing, The Vampyre of Time and Memory) really stick out.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is pretty cool reminds me of call of duty and battle field I hope they make more games like this
0553801473|5.0|Much better than the fourth book.  I was very pleased with the progression and I am anxious to find out what happens in this epic series.  Very fast delivery.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Very nice. This product is very beautiful and helpfull. It is the best stylus pen. It is my personnal choice.
B0001I561E|2.0|I ordered Aladdin, but received The Little Mermaid. I don't care for that movie, but my husband didn't know we received the wrong DVD and had opened and viewed it before I knew it was the wrong movie.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|this game is pretty good for free. not a big fan of the pay-if-you-want-to-uprade. but its a really good way to kill time.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Lacking only a hands on throttle and stick  this game provides all the kick of a console game on a mobile  device. With many fighter choices relive the cold war era and beyond.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|You should be able to search by word not by page. :'-(  it's harder to look for definitions<br />Also it takes for ever to find the word
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems refreshes my respect for the imagination and creativity of  O'Brien.  It's been a few weeks and several books since I read the fairytale, then I picked up this collection of poetry that delivered me right back to the colorful and highly visual world of Peter.  None of the poems has a rushed or out-of-place feel... just a great touch of emotion and fantasy that makes you want to discover the next one.  My personal favorite is The Vaandorg Dragon, because it captures the magic of Peter's land and O'Brien's talent.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Its very addictive to play. Once you start playinh you will be hooked. If you like bingo games you will love this one.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Buy this book it is worth it.It talks about the gods and monsters if u don't buy this book u r missing out- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great displays, easy on the eyes at night. Very easy to use and setup. Really like the selection of alarm sounds to choose from.
0765325950|5.0|I loved the series and the final battle. I feel like I just said goodbye to my friends however. Great kob Brandon
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It's a great game to play with plenty of challenges to keep you entertained for a good period of time.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Sometimes it works, sometimes it won't get my new mail and/or just keeps trying to get my new mail and so won't let me check the email I can see that I already have.  I often have to use my brower on my phone and just check mail using the intranet on my phone rather than through this ap.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Very good guide for beginners looking to start calesthetic training. I personally do it after my weight lifting session and have seen great results in strength thus far.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I devoured all 5 books in 5 days. Deep characters, awesome action, what more could you ask for in a book? Can't wait until the next book. Loved these so much I might just read them again now!
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|This is a great game for people who like playing strategy game lots of thinking and the best part about it is there is tons of action and fun there are war planes tanks marines great game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I Loved this book!  Better than the first. Can't wait for next book. Lots of things happen in this book you don't expect.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have read a lot of reviews at other sites by users complaining about various things. I have only found a few video sources I cannot stream from my Mac laptop. Amazon Instant Video and PBS SO CAL are the only sources I could not get to work using the Chrome browser from my Mac. The image quality is not as good as a Roku but having the ability to throw almost any free or paid video source on my TV makes it well worth the $35. I can't play HBOGO on my Roku because Directv does not allow it.  But I can do it via the Chromecast. There is an amazing amount of free content you can stream to this thing. I also can stream local movie, music and photo files from my Mac using a 3rd party media server app via the Chrome bowser. I keep wondering if Google is going to cripple it sometime in the future. For now it works great.
B00D5LC4GY|1.0|This game is beyond frustrating. .uninstalling.. its too complicated. Pretty happy that I didn't waste any money on this game.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a fun, low key game. It is simple and very pretty. When my cat decided she wanted to play I was able to turn off the buying option, and let her have at it! Only issue is when I tried to move my game over to my new device, the port never occurred. I'm just glad I wasn't too far and started over.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect but this movie exceeded any expectations I might have had.  They did a good job with the Blues Legend of the Crossroads
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Jared Harris plays the antagonist wonderfully. Downey is a fine Holmes.<br /><br />The story line keeps one interested and moves along nicely.<br /><br />A bit over the top at times even for a fantasy.<br /><br />My biggest pet peave with this film is Col. Moran, a highly rated marksman, was able to make a highly difficult shot early in the movie, yet misses Watson several times at fairly close range. This is not staying true to the character being portrayed.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was extremely surprised at this backpack I have purchased a couple of others for my video cameras in my camera equipment but this one which is the same size as my sling backpack fits all my camera equipment that I use often nicely with room to spare and easy access and in addition because of the flat bottom it sets nicely when you set it down doesn't tend to fall over so I give this one 5 out of 5 because of the price and the quality of the unit I recommend it to any amateur or professional photographer
B004NELBPC|5.0|I get all the news I can use and more. Love the ease of finding particular news events. 5 stars for sure
B005IFWXWU|4.0|Never imagined how talented and diverse Hugh Laurie.this CD really makes the New Orleans sounds come alive.<br />Caught the program on our local PBS station
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|The first thing tangrams fans should know is that there's no rotation of pieces in this game's puzzles. They all fit in at the angle you first find them at. This drops the difficulty level considerably, though larger puzzles will still offer plenty of complexity. The levels are randomly generated, but you can alter the parameters-- grid height (between five and ten), grid width (also between five and ten), number of pieces (between five and fourteen), and normal or challenge mode. In normal mode the grid is completely empty when the game begins; in challenge mode there are fixed pieces already in place that you have to work around. If you like a particular level, you can share it using e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media. The design is basic but it all looks sharp, even on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9. You can choose among twelve different background designs, from soothing blue to wood-grain to metallic black.<br /><br />So far so good. What are the downsides? Well, the app crashed on me once in a very short play span; I'll update the review if it happens again. And there are lots of little design flaws that downgrade the experience. The options don't always interact right: if you choose a smaller grid and a higher number of pieces, the game will simply give you as many pieces as it can, even if it's below what you chose. There's a list of achievements, but they're pretty dull. There are star ratings for performance, but they're a little too generous. There are typos in a couple places (\\"challange\\" mode). The placement detection is vexing-- you have to watch the shadows of the blocks and make sure none are outside the grid or over already placed blocks. If they are, the piece will snap back, even if it looks like it's lined up right. And worst of all, the internal navigation is poor. From the main menu you can select play, resume (to return to your last puzzle), options, and themes (backgrounds). Within a puzzle you can mute the game, or select \\"continue\\" or \\"share\\" after you finish. And that's it. You can't pause a puzzle, you can't reset it to take the tangrams out again, you can't play it again to improve your time, you can't go back to the menu without using your device's back button.<br /><br />Put together, those are some pretty big issues, and leave me wavering on a three or four star rating. But the gameplay is intact enough that I'll be generous. If you like tangrams, customization, and a high level count, you should give this one a shot. Otherwise, it's probably not worth even 99 cents.share\\" after you finish. And that's it.

B0090P98Z4|4.0|Still fun, great graphics, smooth game play, over all I have no complaints.  It free and fun.  Not to much else to say.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|great sound great songs and a wonderful stage show. This is one of the greatest live shows ever recorded. It is a shame it was filmed on video tape instead of celluloid.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This second offering into a reboot of the Star Trek adventures with new actors playing the original cast of Jim Kirk, Spock, et al is a thrilling adventure.  I especially love how they use Leonard Nemoy as a time warp Spock to come back and guide new actor, Zachery Quinto, in the same role of Spock.  I won't mention how that came about because it would be a spoiler for those not having seen the first installment, Star Trek Take Command.  These two movies with fresh young actors open up a whole new universe to explore because the time line differential.  Quinto is so believeable as Spock that when you see him on the same screen with Nemoy, you BELIEVE!  And I was around when the original series aired for the first time on TV in the 60's!

B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to finish it.<br />It ended rather abruptly though, and I was wishing for the<br />story to go on.  Both of the main characters are very well portrayed.

B00AYB0TOW|3.0|In the future white supercops will kill people of color and poor people by burning them alive.  And these are the good guys in Judge Dredd.  Insofar as the film itself is concerned, too much Batman (another Right fantasy) for this to be original.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|After watching the movie I got excited to read the book, while the movie is considerable different I was very pleased with City of Bones. The book is definitely written for its intended audience (YA) but I am still in love with the characters and excited about the plot.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This could get to be addictive! It is good that it gives hints if you get stuck in the &#34;web&#34; and can't get anywhere!!
B009LDXQGW|1.0|yo i'm a huge fan of the weeknd and i really like, or LOVE house of balloons and thursday. wasn't feeling his third one too much.  with that said, this triolgy cd is WHACK due to all of the unnecessary remixing.  whoever produced this thing should be ashamed.  most of my favorite songs are re-leveled, re edited and mixed and it's not just to make the sounds crisper or clearer, but most of the time they've removed key elements, and instruments, sometimes the vocal effects are missing or there are new ones where there weren't on the mixtapes.  i'm a big fan of remixing and i love the mixtapes that spawned the first two parts of this trilogy. i am ALL FOR producers adding their individual touches on something just for the sake of remixing. but in this case i think it shouldn't have been done, as this is technically the weeknd's first retail cd so in my opinion it should haven't been touched.  or if he wanted to release this as a remix cd, that's cool.  a classic is a classic and it shouldn't have been messed with.  the remixing on this effort hurts it so much that i just can't listen to it.<br /><br />i'm all for supporting the weeknd in going to see his shows and promoting him to my friends, but i can't honestly tell anyone to go out and spend their money on this when the mixtape versions are free and way better.<br /><br />i'm totally not doing this for attention being the lone one star review here, but i have given this trilogy MANY chances in my ride and in my ipod, but it hurts too much and i have gone back to the mixtapes for good now.<br /><br />with all of that said, it's nice to see that a lot of his fans on here like (love) both the mixtapes and cd.  i hope this dude really breaks out into something huge cause he puts a lot of work and love into his craft and i want to hear more.<br /><br />peace
B009POHHR6|3.0|Ultimately I liked this, but it has the feel of much alternate-history fiction, and even much in common with an airport working in someone else's universe. Specifically, the writers seem to have felt compelled to include to many \\"touchstones\\" to the world or the universe that we're familiar with.  Do Batman, Wonder Woman, and the Green Lantern belong in this story?<br /><br />Ultimately this is a fun read, and of course it's a really intriguing idea. But I can't shake the feeling that the writing should have gone in a different direction.
0684857219|5.0|My cousin introduced this book as the bible to bodybuilding. This is the bible. Great book, lot of information. It's actually 5 books rolled into one.
B00CKH9WOQ|4.0|Over all Catty Noir is a beautiful doll, I love how her face looks and she is now one of my daughters favorite dolls. However I do have a few complaints, firstly her stand is designed to go under her dress rather than around her waist like the classic stand and while the idea is fine the execution sucks, the stand is cheap and she doesn't easily remain standing upright when placed in it. Also she costs more and only comes with a microphone for an accessory, and while they look nice for a while the boots and microphone are made of cheaper plastic with a metallic finish that has already started to dull.
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|This movie is a great standalone zombie apocalypse movie, carrying over a few themes from the book.  I would say this movie is \\"inspired\\" by the book rather than \\"based\\" on it.<br /><br />Still, this movie has its merits.  Decent acting, amazing visuals, fairly coherent story.  There are a few 'why would he/she/they do that?' moments, but they don't detract from the fun.<br /><br />Though this unrated version has more blood and guts than the theatrical release, it still doesn't come close to other movies or zombie fare (I think it has less gore than a movie like 'Dredd' or the series \\"The Walking Dead\\").<br /><br />Notable differences: more graphic zombie headshots, a more intense (i.e. bloody) version of the hand removal scene in Israel, and a few more zombie body obliteration sequences.<br /><br />This version did not contain the original ending everybody is hoping to eventually see.
B00DSTBMMU|1.0|Sheryl seems to not just taken another step towards contemporary Country, she seems firmly cemented in it.  I wouldn't have minded if she'd turned closer to Americana but contemporary Country to me has always been a bit of a sham.  It's not rock, and it's certainly not real country but more like bad pop with a few steel guitars and a fiddle once in a blue moon to make you think you're listening to country.  In any case, Sheryl still has a nice voice but the clever lyrics that were there in the past are gone.  If you like 'new' country, you'll probably like this.  If you don't, then avoid.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|This is a good mindless game to pass the time. The only grips I have, are that the sliding of the pieces can be a little finicky and the level number is absolutely useless for knowing what level your at.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This keyboard is fast and great to use once the learning has had enough to learn the words you would normally use.  The predictability for most words is correct.  Slang and shorthand are still problematic but are getting better with use.  The symbols take some getting used to where things are placed in relation to the stock Samsung keyboard.<br />The only thing I would like is the purchase to be cross platform,  so I can use it also for my tablet without having to buy it again.
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda is one of the most beloved video game franchises of all time. But for a series that is so treasured, Nintendo has been coy about giving fans an insider scoop regarding detailed plotlines, development commentary, and the behind the scenes creative process. In fact, the overarching storyline has been a topic of heated debate among gamers for years. Finally, after 25 years, Nintendo in partnership of Dark Horse Comics has peeled back the veil of this legendary video game series.<br /><br />Hyrule Historia is a hardcover documentary detailing everything Zelda.  Originally, this book was released only in Japan as a tie-in with the release of Skyward Sword.  But thanks to Dark Horse, everything has been translated to English – even handwritten captions by Japanese developers have been reworked for Western audiences.<br /><br />This book is basically divided into four sections.<br /><br />The first section is solely dedicated to Skyward Sword, the most current Zelda game but the first in the Zelda timeline.  Tons of artwork is nicely displayed along with developer commentary and notes. It might seem kind of strange that such a large section of the book is dedicated to this one game but it was originally designed as a side-by-side release with the Skyward Sword game.  Also, since this is the most recent game, all the game’s assets should have been the most easily accessible.<br /><br />The second section is going to be the most coveted as it finally explains the chronology of the entire Zelda series.  All the games are canonically linked together on the opening page but then followed by brief summaries of each title on the subsequent pages.  As a Zelda fan that has played and completed every Zelda title (except for the highly difficult Adventure of Link – someday I will conquer it!) this section was an eye-opener.  Details explained in this section are not something that players can obtain simply by playing the games or reading the instruction manual.  Even if you played every Zelda game one hundred times, there are still factoids listed here that you never knew about.  Just browsing through these pages will create several “ah-ha” moments especially for hardcore fans.  While the rest of the book is definitely welcomed, this section undoubtedly makes the most impact.  However, although the book explains the Zelda series in more detail, it still leaves enough open-endedness to allow for readers to make their own assumptions. But at the same time, it leaves things vague enough so future Zelda games can find their place in the series history.<br /><br />Creative Footprints: Documenting 25 Years of Artwork is the third section.  Here, viewers are treated to a highly visual representation of the entire Zelda series by game.  From early rough sketches, to creature design or declined ideas, this section focuses on the craftsmanship of Zelda.  Unfortunately, the earlier released games, say before Ocarina of Time, received the least amount of attention although these games are often the most interesting.  Nonetheless, it is pretty to look at and well respected.<br /><br />Finally, artist Akria Himekawa drew an exclusive Zelda anime that basically sets up the events of Skyward Sword.  This is an interesting way to experience Zelda especially since this story is basically the origins of Link and Hyrule.  Unfortunately, much of this comic is in simple black and white.  For a book that is so detailed, the black and white is a jarring difference and doesn’t hold up in comparison to the rest of the publication.<br /><br />The book itself is also well put together.  The heavy green cover makes the reader feel like they are holding history in their hands while the pages are printed on high quality paper to make colors pop without unsightly finger printing.  This book, in a way, almost makes me feel like I am holding the book of Mudora from A Link To the Past.  Luckily, I didn’t need the Pegasus boots to knock it down from the top shelf.  Instead, this piece of video game history retails for $35 but outlets like Amazon are charging under $20 it. This is a great way to absorb the most amount of Zelda with the smallest price.<br /><br />My complaints revolve around omitted material.  Outside a brief sidebar, BS Zelda was not talked about.  Also, the CD-I titles were completely absent which only ensures that Nintendo chooses to ignore this unsightly blemish.  The cartoon and even the Zelda cereal were also not shown any love.  For a book that is basically the encyclopedia of Zelda, omitting these pieces of Zelda history seems like a wasted opportunity.  And for a book based on a game franchise that is filled with some of the most creative character and level designs in history, many of this book’s screenshots and other art assets are small.  It would have been nice to see a blown up map or landscape art spread over two pages on occasion.  And the Dark Horse logo on the binding of the book also looks out of place; it detracts from the aura of the publication when it sits vertically on a shelf.<br /><br />Hyrule Historia was created for the fans and the artistry shows.  Sure there are some flaws with the final execution but the excellent quality of the cover and paper along with the intriguing content make this a book gamers will actually want to read.rom the top shelf.

B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I have had this app for a while... but it kept freezing up my Kindle Fire and I would have to let my battery die on my Kindle because it would not move off that page...., and every time it updated I would loose access to it for days!  Today even though I had 45 pearls. (those of you who play know that is a sweet deal) the app was updated and I could not get in it all day. Tried everything ....decided it is not worth the frustration and deleted the app.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Shipped nice - the kids and us really enjoyed it - very funny, lots of adult quirks about it - so parents can enjoy as well - way to go Adam!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV version of the Bible is easy to read and is packed full of information for your study pleasure. There are maps, charts and diagrams that make learning easier and fun.<br /><br />The price you pay for this Bible is well worth the cost.
0061743526|5.0|I never read this classic, so had it on my bucket list.  The movie was great and it will be a good beach read
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story  is beautiful and captivating. It's a must read for all. You will enjoy it from the beginning to the end, and will want to re-read it over and over.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|Wanted to like this, but the fact that you can't rotate the pieces is just too annoying. With any given set of pieces, there may be several solutions, and I find it a big drawback to the game that the challenge is to find the specific one the developers had in mind. Since you can &quot;test drive&quot; this game on Amazon, you should do so and see what you think.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|I always liked the &#34;Road Warrior&#34; and &#34;Beyond Thunderdome.&#34;  The first lower budget movie &#34;Mad Max&#34; was never up to the sequels but you have to have it as a collector.  Not a bad movie just not as good as what was to follow.<br /><br />I am happy with the purchase.
B008602KQI|5.0|I very much enjoyed the movie &#34;Hunter Games&#34;. Thank you for allowing the 30 day free trial for Prime. Loved it.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|\\"Grainy\\", \\"poor quality\\", \\"VHS quality\\" \\"bad sound\\", etc: These are just some of the descriptions of the MDNA Tour concert Blu-Ray from Madonna. My copy arrived today. My reaction: First, there are three audio tracks; the first is an HD-Audio that is supposed to be 5.1 surround sound. It is NOT. In fact it sounds like both the front and real channels are missing on one side. Again, the front left and the rear left are completely SILENT. However, select AUDIO TRACK 2, and you get a GREAT sounding 2-channel stereo, that will break up into a surround environment. It sounds wonderful; as good as any concert that I've heard in 2.0 and the surround information is vibrant and exciting. As for the VIDEO, honestly I don't know what some of these comments are all about! The concert is VERY colorful and appears to be utilizing various filters for a more FILMIC effect. In fact this entire concert looks like a FILM, and that is a very good thing. I didn't find any of this to look \\"grainy\\" and the very notion that it looks \\"washed out\\" or like \\"VHS\\" is just ludicrous. Although I wish there was a proper HD 5.1 audio option, I am very happy with the audio and video on this Blu-Ray. Perhaps my copy is corrected from what others have seen, but since my sound is defective as well, I dare-say that I have received and now seen, exactly what veryone else has seen. As for the concert itself, here are some one-word adjectives: \\"UNBELIEVABLE!\\" \\"STUNNING\\" \\"INTENSE\\" \\"BEAUTIFUL\\" and finally, a more 'complete' reaction: The MDNA tour is ferocious, fearless and mind-blowing throughout! The visuals are absolutely wild. MDNA is like a blend of \\"Cirque Du Soleil\\" and Dante's Inferno. Madonna continues to amaze, giving new meaning behind the statement that some people don't get older - they get BETTER! Prepare to be knocked off your feet by MDNA!
B004GXZ69W|3.0|I purchased 2 of these mice in July 2011. The small and the regular sized wired mouse. It was a great mouse. The hand position does take a little bit to get used to. The buttons are programmable so you can have Copy and Paste literally at your thumbtip with one click.<br />Now, for the bad part......<br />about 3 months ago the small mouse started to act up - It has taken to scrolling the screen or zooming in on its own often when no hand is anywhere near the mouse. It is a HORRID quirk.<br /><br />For $85 this mouse should last longer than 2 years. I've emailed the techsupport email address at the company but have not yet heard a response.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have two small kids and was constantly worrying about my phone. Not with lifeproof I don't panic and run across the room is one of them gets my phone. It has been dropped and is perfectly fine. The only downside to the is case if if you use headphones as the headphone screw isn't attached so when you take it out you have to keep track of it. Minor detail and all in all it's a great case.
0823016714|4.0|I found this book to be helpful even though I was more interested in head positions and angle shots than facial expressions.  I did notice that all the models are not regimented to the same sequence of expressions.  This is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.  I liked the book.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|We really enjoyed this game until they recently added ads. Disappointed I won't be able to let my kids play any longer.
0375869026|5.0|Whatever your age, you must read this book. You won't regret it. I have recommended this book to several people, and everyone has loved it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Easy to download; good story.  Would recommend using this method when buying books;  love my Kindle and titles available for it.
0307948110|4.0|I don't think the book is so much about bilionaires and AI as it is about fear as the title sugest. All layers of the story(near autist bilionaire, genial computar scientists, honest policeman, revenue disparities and the astounding money markets) are well plotted and written, but the major thing is fear, how misguided we can by that vital self-preserving emotion, how close fear and greed are and how fear makes us vulnerable, specially when facing AI, that as far as I know, is not afraid at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Downloaded to complete set.  Do not like having minimum number of words to comment as there is only so much you can say about books.
B00422LESO|4.0|This book, brought to my attention by the recent film, was fun, intelligent and very entertaining. A fun weekend read. I recommend it to all Austen and oth Regency era fans, and although it's not big literature, I may read it again!

0142421715|5.0|Couldn't put Crossed down. It was an easy read and a great story. I can't wait for the last book to come out in paperback. This product shipped quickly.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro are two very powerful actors who I have never seen give a bad performance. The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because I found the plot depressing. It was wonderfully and meticulously done, but it is not a picture I would like to watch often; the story is heartbreaking, but the realism and attention to detail together with the cinematography are truly beautiful.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read the book after watching the movie, and it's definitely better (pretty typical that the book is better).  It was a very quick, easy, and enjoyable read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was just so well written, amazing, and overall just a great story. You will this book,  MUST Read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I find this one better than the 1st and the 3rd.  It was a quick and easy read, and found it thoroughly entertaining.
0765325950|5.0|I loved the series really surprise ending in this book . Was really sorry for it to come to and end.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This one starts out pretty slow, and I found the ending pretty unsatisfying.  There are several unsatisfying parts for me at the end, the biggest being her choice between Gale and Peeta.  They put so much emphasis in all the books on her torment of her feelings for the 2 of them, and I felt like they didn't give her final choice the gravitas it deserved.  Overall, still OK, and you still have to read it if you read the 1st 2, but definitely my least favorite of the 3.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised. Go Ana! She really came into herself as a woman. The writing is phenomenal and the plot is not all sex and kinky f*ckery. ;) It actually has a point. A good one, at that. Their banter is my favorite, very well done.
B005LAII44|3.0|Nothing to get excited about. The usual comic book story and while it is mildly entertaining it is what it is. Comic book story telling. Some of Ninja fighting on the mountain is probably the highlight of the movie and is very good. Worth watching if you are a Joe Fan
B008XG1X18|4.0|Im in love with pinterest in genera but this app is constantly crashing when I try to use it on my kindle
B008JFUO36|3.0|Overall this is an okay movie and both Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman make it worth watching. There are things happening in the early story and for a while you can't put your finger on just what it is and for that reason it also make's it worth while view. The ending does come together quickly and the effects are good.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Wasn't sure I was gonna like it but I watch because my daughter wanted me to watch it her. I'm so glad she did cause I loved it!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a bunch of older actors having fun and making the statement to not count them out!  The comedy was good, and the interplay between them all was enjoyable.  This movie probably won't charm the critics - I really don't care because it provided me with a couple of hours of entertainment and inspiration to not let others define what I'm capable of.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The first season was great! I loved every part and I couldn't wait to see the next seasons as well as seeing Castle and Beckett's relationship continue.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|netflix, no developer support (google released an update to not let you root / unlock the device), not much yet in terms of third party support.<br /><br />most of the people who bought it ended up taking the netflix and selling it for a profit.<br /><br />i'll stick to my roku... sold my chromecast.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is great and does not freeze or shut down like most kindle fire apps and  it is free useful for anyone. Don't worry and get kik it is awesome.
B005JABU82|5.0|For those Gundam Seed Saga Lovers, this is the perfect &#34;toy&#34; for you. The detail level is incredible, every tiny piece does not make any sense until you assemble it with other parts of the gundam. I took 2 days to finish assembling the skeleton and exterior details (the armor and wings), you have to be extra careful when extracting the pieces from the box, while some of then are easy, other are simple impossible with bare hands, so a tweezers is highly recommended.<br /><br />PROs<br />- It's a GUNDAM<br />- It's fun to assemble<br />- Detail Level is almost perfect<br />- The material is good, it looks like a hardened plastic<br /><br />CONs<br />- It does not provide the base stand, so you need to find it elsewhere<br />- The decals are so hard to place, you need to use extra glue and have a really high precision with your hands in order to place them &#34;correctly&#34;<br />- The weight of the weapons may affect the pose, you need to distribute the weight correctly if you want to use the gundam in a &#34;stand up position&#34; (I don't have the stand base).<br />- Wings Assembly is far from good. Even if you can assemble the wings and keep them in a cool position, even a soft hit or just by simple folding the wing it may break and you have to reassemble the wing pack again. So be careful.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The movie was a great depiction of the book. I actually really liked the modern music throughout. There were a couple parts that I found a little bit cheesy but the actors all did well

I honestly have never read any folktale from Africa and, so far, this has proved to be the best children stories I've read. This is the first book I'm reading by this author. I'm definitely going to be catching up on the first collection of these folktales. Tales by Twilight, is it?

B00CWY76CC|4.0|My son and I are enjoying this game immensely. The puzzles dare hard enough to keep us interested but so much so, that we get  frustrated!
B0055D3EFU|1.0|Ok ..... Not great acting, story line or special effects. Some scary moments. Plus - Amazon charges too much for a movie. Prefer Vudu or Netflix.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This movie was really good, but without John Goodman there is no movie, in my opinion. Sure, Bridges was funny, the story was good and entertaining, but Goodman made this movie, much like Val Kilmer made Tombstone.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book, the ending was quite abrupt but it makes you want to move right on to the next book.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I enjoyed most of the characters and the plot and the acting... ok, i enjoyed the acting less by most of the characters.  It wasn't a total waste-of-time romance but I've seen better.
081299471X|5.0|This book was the most unique reading experience I've ever had.  The author must be an incredible person, to be able to write in so many styles about such diverse characters.  My only complaint is that the print is a bit small - I should've gotten it on my Kindle.  Before reading the book, I watched the film, and that did help me with the section about Zachry, because I could hear Tom Hanks and Halle Berry when I was reading the dialog.  I would highly recommend Cloud Atlas to anyone who wants to become totally immersed in a wonderful book.
B005I3PAUO|5.0|I love David Baldacci, and this book is no exception.  He writes so well, and brings the story together in such wonderful style, definitely one of the best thriller writers that I have come across.  This is the second John Puller book that he has written, and both are superb!  I cannot wait for the next one...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Incredible app.  Evernote is one of the greatest things I have ever discovered.  I couldn't manage my life without evernote.  The ability to be reminded of everything, the ability to search everything, and the ability to save everything and have access to it everywhere is just incredible.  I would highly recommend evernote to anyone I know.  Also, the premium features are by far worth the $5.00 a month.  You get much more storage, the ability to search inside office and pdf documents, and the ability to mark up documents just to name a few.<br /><br />Give evernote a try...you won't be disappointed.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is a really nice app that looks beautiful on HD. Shouldn't be free though? Any device for a long time has had a built-in calculator.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It doesn't take up much memory very light. Very simple and accurate. I would recommend it to anyone wanting up-to-date weather where they live or work.
0345525558|4.0|I like the book - no time for a critique . . . I won't be reviewing anything in the future as you require too much information
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|While friends who read the book say its not a direct adaptation of the book, that was fine with me. Although there are some logic gaps in the plot ... like what Brad Pitt's job was exactly or how Jerusalem fell (all the people w microphones? Really?) ... the acting and production were fantastic. I especially liked Segan. Hope they make a part 2!
B00A2H9L2E|1.0|Let me start off in saying I love a good scary movie. I just finished watching Silent Hill Revelation.I have but one question, Huh? The story made no sense, the gore seemed to have no impact or relevance to what was going on with the plot if you want to call it that, and the scares were practically non existentent. I do know they give you a heads up to the next installment, well good luck with that. I like to preview a movie in 2-D to see if I like it and then if all is well ,I will purchase it in 3-D . Well in this case I saved some money because this one is not a keeper.
B00DU73T08|2.0|I haven't read the book and can't comment on that but this movie is so cardboard flimsy in its plot and its acting that I though I had rented the wrong movie.<br /><br />From a very linear and predictable story to most of the movie seemingly taking place in dark places or night time, it really left non-readers of the book bored and wanting to just walk out / turn it off.<br /><br />I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the quality of some of the actors (like Hurt) who must be really doing it for a paycheck / some of the very scenic outdoor shots (wish there were more).<br /><br />If you are a fan of the book, then check this movie out. Otherwise save your time & money.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|A not very original story. Everything is too pat. I did not like the story. Felt it was a Harry Potter wannabe.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun and great graphics.  I think I laugh at the minions more than I can actually play. Got to try it.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|This movie has to go down as one of my all-time favourites, as Ricky Gervais is rendered first speechless, and secondly, dead.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Another good read from Sanderson.  A fun afternoon and some interesting tidbits for the larger cosmere.  I would definitely recommend it.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|I did already read the book in paper form, but reading again on Kindle is even more powerful and inspiring.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I never imagined this was going on in this country. Very eye-opening.. A bit of history probably no-one knows about!
B008JEJNDE|5.0|I ordered these for my husband and he loves them. They are comfortable and perfect when you're on the go. Like the other reviews said, they run a little big, so definitely go for the smaller size if you are in between sizes.
B00ADR2DTG|4.0|I saw this little amp and having always been intrigued by tube sonic characteristics, but hesitant to buy due to unreasonable costs, had no problem shelling out for this one. Unlike the instrument side of amplification where guitar tube amps are more appropriately priced, the home/ personal audio side of tube amplification is horrendously overpriced to the point of being criminal. I suspect there are many reasons for this and snake oil snobbery from pseudo \\"audiophiles\\" is probably very much to blame for this. It is a shame and it shouldnt have to be that way and thats where this little amp comes in to play.<br />Is this amp a high end piece of equipment? NO. Will it power your earbuds or headphones better than the output stage of your phone or mp3 player ? Yes. Does it have a warmer sound that I have always heard is synonymous with tube amps? To a small degree yes this amp will be slightly warmer. I dont think you will be disappointed with this little guy's pergormance.
B00006I53S|3.0|One thing that I learned over the last 30 years of photography, lenses(and cameras) can differ from sample to sample and<br />long range zooms (especially Sigmas) are the worst offenders. I first bought this EF28-135mm for use on my original 5D<br />last summer-It turned out to be the 3rd most optically defective lens that ever owned (next to my old sigma 18-200 and 18-125mm)<br />the right side of the lens never got sharp yet the center and left were fine. I sold it. Last week I saw a 28-135mm for sale at Hunts photo so I tried it out- it was better. I brought my 5D down today to try it out and I noticed the edges were very low resolution-this one was made in Taiwan. I explained to the salesperson my story with this lens and she took one off of a used 7D kit to try out. This one was<br />SHARP to the edges even wide open and made in Japan. It was spot clean and had a red mark on the mount so I think it was serviced and adjusted by Canon, it was even cheaper than the original one I looked at. Now I am happy, this is the sharpest wide zoom that I own, but unless yours was adjusted by Canon-Who knows..
140006922X|4.0|A little disappointed.  Though he sets forth a great deal of info that is new to me, every so often he will just glide over a point, asking the reader to assume he knows what he is talking about.  Almost as though he is displaying a bit of bragadacio.  But perhaps I should not be so harsh, as he is an academic not a writer.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It is amazing to me that Preston and Child can write such complex subplots that successfully intertwine over the span of about a dozen novels...and finally, with thisalmost all of the loose ends have been tied.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I completely enjoyed this series, I could not put the 3 books down. This was the third book and it was as good or better than the first.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't think I would enjoy these books but my daughter and son talked me into it.  I loved it!  I was sorry that this was the last book..
B003O86FMW|5.0|I completely enjoyed this series, I could not put the 3 books down. This was the second book and it was as good or better than the first.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I didn't think I would enjoy these books but my daughter and son talked me into it.  I loved it!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter loved this movie!  We enjoyed it as a family. Can't wait for the sequel to come.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is an awesome tool.<br />It makes so easy to transfer videos from youtube or netflix to bigger screen/TV.<br />Amazing.<br /><br />Bad part: can no longer transfer own videos or pictures from laptop/smartphone to TV via ChromeCast.
B005M5PER2|5.0|After catching an episode of Five-0 on a Friday nite about three weeks ago, I was HOOKED.  It's hip, it's beautifully shot, it's high-speed, and I LOVE IT ... Steve McGarrett is the closest we have to a true American Hero, since the days of Harmon Rabb on JAG ... !  Steve & Danno are a modern day &#34;Butch & Sundance&#34;, and are fun to follow.  I've been catching up with the back episodes on TNT, but truly needed a source to see the first month of shows from back in 2010.  And I found 'em HERE...  With the new season starting in 10 days on CBS, I'll be using Amazon / TNT to bring me up to speed for years 1-3 !  Yes, I am DOWN with HAWAII FIVE-0 !!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Loved all of these books. The trilogy is really well written I'm sad it's over. Time for a new book
B004KPX4W2|5.0|A great movie to watch, comedy, action, excellent cast, it's very dynamic and story is good too:-) and hoping to see red 2 on demand soon :-)
B00AEFXXZU|4.0|If you are a fight film fan and you haven't seen this one, do yourself a favor and check it out.<br /><br />It has humor and heart, and some solid performances by Christian Bale, Amy Adams and the folks portrayed from the town of Lowell, Mass. My only gripe is I wish the film included the legendary Ward vs. Gatti fights.<br /><br />Also, like I did after watching this film, do yourself a favor and watch the Ward vs. Gatti fights.<br /><br />Unbelievable, truly.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005DZMODI|4.0|A wonderful collection of blues like you've never heard before.  Layla in a Dixieland sound: outrageous.  The trombone solo on Forty Four is terrific - makes me wish I hadn't given it up in high school.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|The special features are worth it even if you already own the movie but that's just like my opinion, man.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|The nemesis Kahn is back, as is Kirk (or rather his son - and just as reckless as his dad), Ohura, Scotty, Bones, and Sulu although all different actors. Same familiar story format: Starship Enterprise on a dangerous mission, Enterprise all but destoyed, pull the &#34;rabbit out of the hat&#34; and save the ship, crew, and beat up the bad guy we all love to hate. Apparently the producer has climbed on the &#34;nostalgia&#34; bandwagon - or call it &#34;retro&#34; if you prefer. Bottom line: campy, predictable, but fun. Lots of good special effects with gobs of blowin' stuff up, which us guy-types enjoy. I watched it twice, but mostly because I had a 48-hour rental.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game...need to be quick to make the turns but the graphics are great and easy to use.  Highly recommend!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|love that this was a life led. Love how well it was written. Easy to follow though the vocabulary and sentence structure was very well assembled. Love the resources that were put in the back that hopefully have helped women now and in the future. Thanks!!
B00APKIN1I|4.0|Great songs on this CD! A great collection of artists on one Disc! I love Dave Grohl, Pat Smear, & Stevie Nicks!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great to pass the time with while waiting for your husband in the hardware store or auto department. Great fun.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you love history and how the Aristocrats live at the turn of the century you will enjoy Downton Abbey.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love that the change in the timeline has opened up so many more stories.<br />Going to watch it again.  :-)
B0063GORYU|2.0|I did not like the game as it brought along a lot of pop ups.  I uninstalled from my phone.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was beautiful. I really like Gaiman`s simple, blunt and somehow artful writing style. The story is nice enough, maybe a bit less intricate than I am use to, but is well written. The characters are well made, kept nice and even through the book.It's a good, light read for the casual reader, and kept me up at night, but not too late.
B00000DOXS|4.0|I rate this recording at 3 and 1/2 stars rounded up to 4. This is definitely not the best album by this phenomenally talented group. Each of the four suites comprising Tales contains some of the best material and musicianship Yes has ever displayed but it is interspersed with and surrounded by other material which although skillfully done detracts from the cohesiveness of the whole and demands possibly too much of the listener, some of it being more unpleasant than necessary. Yes is at their absolute best on extended tracks from 6 to 11 minutes although they have had much success on occasion with multi-part suites not so much here. But the good parts are superb and make this CD much worth having. This idea may offend some readers but if a person has a music editing program on their computer they might create some shorter tracks, by extracting some of the better material from the suites, which hold together much better and could be listened to without having to wade through the less desirable stuff as I have done.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I bought this seat because of the headrest.  Our baby refused to sleep on it the first day of biking (he was still getting used to the helmet), but on our second long bike trip, he was out like a light and slept the whole way home.  I love it that you can bike with your arms around your baby...he felt safe and comforted on his first ride, and we can talk and laugh as we go.  He' s ten months old.  I agree with other reviews that the foot rests all the way down is about as short as you need them, but I think as he grows he will just bend his knees.  No problems biking, you don't hit it with your knees or anything.  Just have to sit up a little straighter!
0307749347|5.0|CD on positive psychology that isn't filled with lots of fluff- most of author's claims are based on psychological research.  Worthwhile listen and/or read.  Lots of interesting anecdotes, especially from the corporate world.
0230768695|5.0|I was sorry when I read the last page of this book...  I would have gladly read another 1000 pages!
B00C8RGEBM|5.0|I can't believe how this season ends !! One of the best shows I have ever seen, Breaking Bad is just amazing.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I really liked watching this movie.  There were a lot of correlations from the Original Series and even a few of the original movies.  I liked the tribble being injected with Khan's blood, Kirk being the one who sacrificed himself instead of Spock, Spock going after Khan instead of Kirk, Chekov being in command in engineering instead of Scotty, A Starfleet officer attacking the Enterprise in a Federation ship instead of Khan, Khan's people being frozen in torpedoes, Pike being killed in an attack by Khan and taking command from Kirk.  Also I liked the scene were the original Spock talked to the alternate Spock about Khan and how costly capturing Khan is.  I cannot wait to see if another movie will be made with this crew.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Loved it. Brilliantly written, takes you to another world. My type of book. Enjoying the next one just as much.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|The reason I recommend getting this book is because you get to learn some facts about the boys that you already did not know and it is an amazing book so I'd get this book if i were you
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I've used and depended on this App for years as my daily alarm. It worked fine on my previous 2 Kindle Fires, and I installed it on my current Kindle as well, but since the last upgrade, it has failed to wake me several times by either deleting the alam that I set the night before, or turning itself off before it's loud enough to hear. I've overslept and been late for work so many times because of this thing, that I just got rid of it and found another alarm.<br /><br />Another thing since the last upgrade: it only has maybe 6 or so irritating ringtones now, even though there's quite a few (but not as many as before)  listed. Many of them are duplicate ringtones with different names. Also, whatever one I set doesn't matter, it randomly changes to something else by itself anyway.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed they screwed with this once-great App and ruined it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The most exciting and best game I have ever got for my kindle!! The graphics are awesome and it never gets boring.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I really like this game--there's something about smashing hipsters in the face with a tennis ball that just makes you feel good. GREAT stress reliever! I would have given it 5 stars but there's not enough levels. I was surprised (and a little sad) when the game ended so quickly. I guess I'll put it aside for awhile and play it again in a few months.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|well I know little about reviews. what I know is that I loved  this. I truly did.<br />I am so glad that I could read this.<br />now onto book 2<br />wa ar
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|this is a great device. it is about the size of my galaxy nexus and is very portable. it works as advertised and charges my devices very fast! i use this on my galaxy nexus, my nexus 7 (2013), my bluetooth headphones, etc. this is a good looking, slick and small (thin) device. i looked at many other portable battery packs and they looked cheap, too big, etc. this comes as close to something as a mophie or anything else at an apple store (in terms of design). plus, the BUILT-IN mini USB is an amazing feature! no external cords needed!!!! this is what sold me on this product - super convenient! you will not regret this purchase.
030789701X|5.0|Awesome it just what I needed to get through parts of the game. I couldn't ask for anything more. Thank you!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|good book. waiting on the next one now. already on my wish list. can not waiy till it comes out.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|If you are annoyed by Zombie movies as often as I am you would probably not select this one. You would be making a big mistake because this is an excellent movie and it is not about Zombies and their interactions with high school kids. The World War Z zombie is a symptom of a highly contagious pandemic caused by a deadly virus or bacteria that is spreading worldwide at an alarming pace. The film concerns itself with finding the cause of the lethal contagion and developing a treatment. The writers do not bore the viewers with the paranormal or curses by ancient shaman as possible origins for the disease. Instead, they have created a more mature film filled with all the fun and shortcoming we have grown accustomed to in our better action thrillers rather than the no sense histrionics offered up by many recent zombie movies. Give this one a try even if avoid most zombie movies.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I loved this app although it some times wouldn't come on its a great app for kindle fire and any other device
1476733953|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Wool; it held my interest from beginning to end.  I've been reading various forms of science fiction and fantasy for nearly 60 years now, and it one of the best I have ever encountered.  I would give it more stars if I could.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|The grand kids love it,but l have to share with them bcause l like the game also just not as much
B003JH8LPW|5.0|So close to the Eric Snowden affair it is scary.  I would highly recommend this book for an exciting read.
B00C2C637I|5.0|Ray Bradbury at his best! This Bradbury &#34;adventure&#34; took me back to the carnivals of my youth. Even then there was a sense of dark magic in the side shows. While reading this book there are times when one feels the need to hold one's breath, to stop the inevitable from happening. Or maybe, to close your eyes and not watch. I found it very hard to put down. Ray Bradbury has a way of transporting readers to whatever time, place or planet he has chosen to show us. Something Wicked This Way Comes is no exception to that rule.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|I loved this series, especially season 4. I was hoping that the final season would be its best. Sadly, that's not true. The writing has gotten stale. The plots are either outrageous or repetitive. The knights are men, but Arthur and Merlin still aren't. Arthur keeps talking about how he's such a great king, but he still seems like a man/boy grasping for maturity. Morgana is a joke. She does the same thing over and over and looks horrible. She's completely lacking in motivation and is nonsensical. The love story between Arthur and Guinevere is pretty much dead. There are some interesting pivot points surrounding magic, Mordred, and the story winding it's way around the legend. The look is even sleeker and more movie-like than before (slow-motion fight scenes and the like), but it doesn't hold my interest like it did before. It's still an entertaining show. Just not as much as before.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Modernized and updated, but with nods to the original stories for those &#34;in the know.&#34;  I like how Watson isn't an idiot; I like how they show you what Sherlock sees; and I love the humor.  It's fun to see what references they make back to the original stories, and how the titles are all plays on Conan Doyle's titles.  Respecting the past while moving into the future.  Very well done.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Too much time spent on stuff not having to do woth the plot and the mystery. I don't recommend it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Nice choices. Easy to operate. No unnecessary frills. Time gets away from me when I play this game. Good fun.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Good movie, with classic J.J. Abrams written all over it.  I am an old school trekkie, looking for something original, like in the first Abrams star trek. So with out spoiling it. Old school trekkies beware; however I rated 4 stars because J.J. is still the man and sci fi king.
B009LDCXNY|2.0|I have watched the show from the beginning and have always loved it.  However, this season was, for me, the worst and I have to admit that although I bought the DVD (to round out my collection), up until watching it, I hadn't even watched the last two episodes that were saved in my TV recordings.  The Men of Letters angle was a good one, but the whole Naomi angel manipulation stuff was nonsensical and added nothing to the show. The bunker is great but anyone with any imagination would have explored the entire thing right after first finding it - it wouldn't have taken months before they found room 7B and the hidden dungeon so for Sam and Dean to explore those areas toward the end of the season was so out of character for them.<br /><br />While I admit I haven't been a huge fan of the Castiel character (after his initial couple of seasons), this year the character arc seemed to serve no purpose and made no sense.  If feels like the writers are just trying to find something to do with the character, since a lot of fans like him, rather than figuring out a way to make him an integral part of the show - from trailing bees/making honey/general insanity last year to sitting in Biggersons all over the country this year to \\"protect\\" the tablet which was easily taken from him was just plain ridiculous. I watched the special feature about Cas but wasn't that impressed with their explanations - basically it boiled down to Cas has always been a flawed angel.  Well if that is the case why in world would he have been sent to get Dean out of hell in the first place - seems like a job for an unflawed angel if Dean was so important to heaven.<br /><br />And why change the mythology - for example, you can't hear a hellhound unless you are close to the end of your deal, but in the episode where the hellhound was killed it seemed that almost everyone could hear it (and clearly not everyone sold their soul).  The ranchhand, who did sell her soul, claimed she knew nothing about the 10 yrend of the deal, but she somehow just knew the beast was coming for her - HOW?  Also why would Sam and Dean re-animate Abidon and then just walk away leaving her to her own devices.  With all their knowledge and experience, they would know to never leave one of the most powerful demons alone even if she were in a devils trap. How stupid was it of them to bring her back at all.  Even if Crowley was making it hard to find a demon, most likely they could have found a better way to get one rather than bringing her back.  The writers took a big short cut there since they wanted her back to fight Crowley and presumably take over hell for part of Season 9.<br /><br />I will continue watching the show, because I am invested in the characters and there are a few good shows along the way, until it is cancelled but I hope Season 9 and any other seasons will be better than this one.
B00DQAM5LI|2.0|What Avenged Sevenfold music I'd heard prior to \\"Hail to the King\\" was from satellite radio, and while I wasn't quite interested enough at that time to buy their music, rave reviews including one from Metal Hammer magazine, whose reviews are usually pretty dependable, coaxed me into buying \\"Hail to the King\\".  This is a difficult review because I'm not sure it will grow on me, but after a few listens I'm in a no man's land between appreciating the influence of bands that came before A7X and being out and out alarmed by how shamelessly those bands are being copied.<br />  Machine Head's Robb Flynn has made some viral comments about this issue, but I'll try not to be as mean spirited because I don't like writing negative reviews as a rule, and you as the reader are certainly entitled to your opinion.  Whether you agree or disagree, neither your view or mine is superior, just different.  I wish some of these reviewers would act that way.<br />  \\"Hail to the King\\" opens up promisingly enough with \\"Shepherd of Fire\\", and it's refreshing to hear M. Shadows sing and carry a tune, hence one star awarded.  Despite their metalcore appearance, the playing is much better in terms of musicianship and there is no denying Synyster Gates and Co. are adept at their instruments.  Gates in particular has a more emotional range to his solos, and can rip with the best of them.  Comparisons to Buck Dharma are not out of line here, as the great Blue Oyster Cult axeman also brands a very melodic and furious style at the same time.<br />  The trouble really starts with \\"Doing Time\\".  Suddenly the ghost of Guns n' Roses appears, Shadows' vocals trying to emulate W. Axl Rose, and the guitars mimicking Stradlin/Slash for all it's worth.  Then it's Metallica's Black Album time, and we get a song called \\"This Means War\\" that is so close to \\"Sad But True\\" that it's ridiculous.  While not close enough for copyright infringement, it's still a carbon copy as far as I'm concerned.  Influence is one thing, but this is crazy.<br />  They get a bit of their own sound back with later cuts but by that time you feel like you've listened to a Rhino Records compilation of late '80's -early '90's metal from all the big bands all crammed onto one CD.  Even their symbol, the Death Bat is a ripoff of Chalie, the mascot of Overkill.<br />  So my advice is simple:  if you like A7X' attempt to produce a mass selling CD and dig the sound they re-create, go for it.  If you want something though that shows a band with individual personality, check their earlier stuff out or some other band.  This album is dishwasher safe, suitable for blips of riffs at football games and fun for the entire family.  I.E., it has no edge and is ideal mall metal.  Not my cup of tea, although I may change my mind later.

B006C45MRE|5.0|This review is from: Cowboys & Aliens (Extended Version) (Amazon Instant Video)<br />movie did its job, good rockem sockem action and all characters believable and acted well. a little like independence day. Harrison Ford at his finest, and our new james bond was great. highly recommend.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|My dad recommended this app and I am really enjoying it.  I have already downloaded about 20 book off of it.  I plan to continue to take advantage of the free ebooks it offers.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Another great album from Janelle Monae! I've been following her music since this beginning and, in my opinion, this is the most developed and complex album to date. A definite must-buy!
B005LJITS0|4.0|This was a terrific and very entertaining movie. I was not familiar w/the subject growing up or since, and really enjoyed it. Ryan was a stellar choice for Hal. I loved it. I guess I'm glad I came with no particular expectations or preconceived notions about it. given some of the other reviews, sounds like that spoiled a great movie for them. I'll buy it to have on hand, for sure.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|If you don't pay too close attention to the details and are just looking for a visually thrilling with action and jump type scares, this movie is acceptable.<br /><br />However, the geography is wrong; there are numerous plot holes; and there are inconsistencies with ghost & possession lore.<br /><br />The actors do a decent job with the material provided.<br /><br />As stated previously, the special effects are well done.<br /><br />Overall, an adequate film.
B00B1D7ANK|4.0|I appreciate the work and details Schleich puts into creating their gorgeous plastic model toys. It adds so much to the imagination for all ages.<br /><br />The Dragon Rider is stunning in its display and detail. It's larger in size to most of their other models and this one contains a lot of built in energy in its curves and design rather than a static pose. The moveable wing design makes it fun to play and to create your own menacing pose.<br /><br />The dragon is solid and hefty. He wears armor plates down neck, back, hips, and tail. The tail armor has a twin-head battle axe built in for devastating sweeps of his tail. His menacing maw gapes open baring his teeth and tongue. His moveable wings are ball socket joints that move nicely. If you move it to an extreme, it will pop out of the joint, but it's easy to pop it back in again - no damage done.<br /><br />The fearless rider, also solid plastic, bears a dragon-crested shield while preparing to impale a polearm into the imaginary enemy. He also wears plate armor in red, gold and black. Within his helm, you can see his parts of his face and eyes. The rider's hiney is magnetized, so he stays fastened to his dragon's saddle while riding. However, his pose also allows him to stand on his own for battling enemies on the ground.<br /><br />As an avid World of Warcraft player, this set just fires off my imagination. The dragon reminds me of the protodrake mounts in the game. However the rider is just too big for my taste. A minifig of King Varian Wrynn now mounts this mighty dragon (but without a butt magnet, he keeps falling off when I bump my computer table. Doh!)<br /><br />The Schleich Dragon Rider toy is remarkable in its quality and detail. It's pricey, nonetheless. Best for the more serious imaginative players out there. I'd love to get my hands on more of the medieval set for posing on my shelves. Stuff like this fires up my imagination and gets my creative juices flowing.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Matthew McConaghey did an excellent job of playing this poor ol' white-trash of a guy with a good heart. The kids also did a great job acting. I really liked this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If I could give 0 stars I would. It wasn't compatible with my tv and couldn't  play Netflix. I returned it but lost a shipping and restocking fee. Also it was almost $  90.00 not $35.00
067101756X|5.0|Very well written and, if not for the credentials of the writer, hard to believe. If the contents of this book are true, our governments are doing a big disservice to us. Incredible details. We have to start accepting, not denying.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I have a new 3D TV & have only been buying the 3D movies.  Being a Trekkie I had high expectations for this film.  The 3D visuals were few & far between.  I little let-down for me, but the movie itself was awesome!
B007B8EX9I|4.0|I just watched the first two seasons and the episodes were engaging. but, let's not get carried away. consider, in no particular order: 1. Churchill, Gallipoli in 1914 or the war's outset? 2. Robert's aborted liason with a housemaid? No chemistry, completely out of character. No contribution to the development of character or to the plot. 3. No religion to speak of; in only a few of the episodes was there any invocation of religion and almost none of God. That's a reflection of modern sensibilities not those of period. 4. The cook's miraculous recovery from cataracts? not even corrective lenses. 5. Matthew's miraculous recovery...dancing without effort after he has just regained the use of his legs.  and, no scars. Wow.  6. Thomas' miraculous recovery; no impairment of the use of his left hand and, in a year or two, no scar.  and, no one questions his status as a wounded soldier discharged from active service at the front. 7. the frequent use of the contemporary locutions that were very improbable...one expects some character to say \\"it is what it is\\"...or, \\"comfortable in his own skin\\" or some other modern idiocy. 8. and, poor John Bates. death sentence just commuted. but, if a viewer does not now suspect some catastrophe to slam Bates, he has not been following the rhythm of the character's life, easily borrowed from or inspired by Dickens. 9. Carson's willingness to leave Downton? Not possible...incredible. 10. the references to turkey are, perhaps, understandable as informal...but no educated person of noble birth would address a formal message to the Turkish ambassador at the \\"Embassy of Turkey\\" or \\"Turkish Embassy\\": there was no \\"Turkey\\" at that time. 11. Mary was, perhaps, raped by Kemal...and, then, she refers to him as her \\"lover\\"? she had just met him...he forced himself upon her (though she seemed to have warmed to the project) and, it seems, he was stricken in flagrante delicto. one could hardly say that he was her \\"lover.\\" btw: the evidence of the circumstances of Kemal's demise would been obvious to a physician or anyone else who examined the body.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is the best 3D film I have seen to date.  Sweet story & great visuals.  A must have for your library.
B008J05EL8|1.0|it is on my kindle and I have no idea what it is for.  just one more thing that is useless.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|First - This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have viewed it over & over several times & consider it #1.  But, the 3D version was a little light in the 3D effects.  It seems as though adding 3D was an after-thought, but maybe it was meant to not distract from the film itself.  At any rate - I LOVE the movie & it is firmly in place in my 3D library!
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|The quality of the DVD 's is not good, but I loved the story. I wish the quality had been better, I am glad I got to finish the season. Can not wait until the January season!
B0000CFW87|3.0|Gorban is a wonderful singer with a tremendous voice but I do not care for the song choices in this album.
B008AYA7WE|4.0|it was easier on a game system as its bigger and you have more time to get it where you want it but its fun...but like the other games I got better....
B0015XASFS|4.0|these are great songs.  It is worth the money. I enjoy the album a lot.  He is a wonderful singer.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game and it is getting better with each vertion . Just one thing. It is getting hard to collect coins after you build a lot of properties.  Very good game overal!!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|I would rate this as a classic, must see!<br />Very compelling story and even though it's in french and is subtitled, after a few minutes you don't even notice that you're reading subtitles.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I have been playing for hrs great puzzles. It is very replayable. My family is loving the game too. Get if you care for gameplay and not 3d graphics.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Finally I am able to see this great series without having to subscribe to Showtime.  Compeling drama.  Great acting.  Good story.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was a great read, hard to put down. Carries on the stories of all the characters developed in the first book of the trilogy told against the backdrop of the nightmare of the WWII. Although we all know what a tragedy that period was, Follett brings it all alive and personalizes it for us in new ways. I can't wait for the third book now!
B00542USJW|5.0|I bought it drunk and I do not regret it. And now we play a drinking game while watching it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Really nice show about a young woman growing up. Set in the beautiful countryside. Good, clean family show. Try watching it.
B00A285OOW|4.0|This author writes very well. The words call up pictures, lovely or loathsome. The story flows like a river. I read this book in two parts because I feared what would happen. It was grim.
034580404X|5.0|It was all that every one said and more. A real page turner. The trilogy came faster thatn expected and was as described. Very happy with my purchase.
B006WXHJOO|5.0|Cute movie great 3d effects.. Minions are BOSS!!!!! Love those little things. Cant wait to get despicable me 2 3d to add to my collection
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The second book was ok but I did not find it as good as the first. In fact, I found myself having trouble staying interested for much of the book. It got REALLY good the last several chapters but I almost didnt make it to the good part. Looking forward to the next one and hoping it keeps my interests better
B001QFZADA|5.0|Love is definitely the language of all human being no matter our emotional condition, I was able to understand how to find out and speak this language so as to improve my relationships.  Thanks a million.
1594481717|5.0|it's a good, fast read! A lot of good points and not boring at all, at least in my opinion!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is about the love and also sadness of family relationships. The sadness contains a real beauty that can only come from loving your family member truly. I liked all the characters. They had flaws as well as goodness. They were to be admired.
B009FZFONO|5.0|All seasons are outstanding ,  It's one of the must see shows on TV , i hope there is season 4 and also 5 ,<br />this show must continue .
B0044C3RB4|4.0|I got lost for awhile between the two universes in keeping all the characters straight, as I got busy and couldn't keep at it as often as I like.  Over all, it's a fairly well done series, especially when you get a good laugh once in awhile when some pseudo-science is thrown in!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best way to play a challenging game. It's a family-friendly game.<br /><br />I love this game a whole lot.<br /><br />This is the best way to play a
B00B0IHEWS|5.0|What's not to like about Legos!  Keeps children occupied for hours and encourages their imagination.  Although he prefers the Stars Wars items he has so many already he is branching out into the Lego Chima series and often combines the two in creations of his own!
0756405890|5.0|This review was previously published on my blog here: [...]<br /><br />Review:<br />How do I start this review? There is no way to really bring across the epicness of this story. None. The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece of storytelling and a unique world filled with fantastic magical concepts and memorable characters that will stick with me for the rest of my life. I don't even want to tell you too much about it because it would just keep you from experiencing it for yourselves.<br /><br />The story starts out in a wayside inn, but it's soon obvious that its owner is no ordinary innkeeper. Kvothe is a multilayered, complex character, and there is a big difference between the older Kvothe of the frame narrative and the younger, more idealistic and passionate Kvothe of the unfolding story - his biography of sorts, if you will. I loved reading about how he grew up with a troupe of travelling folk and how his acting and music remained such a big part of him even after tragedy struck early in his life. His growth and his struggle made me immerse himself completely in the story and after a somewhat slower start, I just couldn't stop reading anymore.<br /><br />When I said that this novel is a masterpiece of storytelling, I meant that a large part of this story is made up of other stories. It's not just one story, it's a whole web of stories that I think will eventually have a connection to one another. And it's not just the content of the stories, it's the way they're told. The setting, the voice, the feeling that you are given a glimpse of something ancient and amazing. The tension between `before' and `after'.<br /><br />I enjoyed the concept and rules of the magic in this series immensely. The world building was revealed gradually and I loved learning about it alongside Kvothe. There is no info-dumping and you have to piece quite a lot of things together on your own. The depth of it, the languages, the places, the sense of a past, elevated it to the likes of The Lord of the Rings for me. That is not a comparison I make lightly.<br /><br />The University, where Kvothe eventually goes to study, was an amazing setting of old buildings, quirky characters, friends, enemies, and adventures. And, of course, eventually also some romance. I'm going to let you explore that place when you get there but let's just say that it was my favorite part of the story. Kvothe has an remarkable mind and while he's older than his years in some ways, he was very inexperienced in other areas and that made for an interesting balance.<br /><br />The greatest strength of the novel by far is the writing. It felt very fresh and somehow familiar in at the same time. It reminded me of the stories I used to read in my early teens. Rothfuss really is a gifted wordsmith and that's what really brought the world and characters to life for me and made me care about what happened to them. He can write beauty and he can write despair in a way that is honest and heartfelt and brought tears to my eyes more than once. When he describes the sound of music, you hear it and it touches your heart. When he weaves a visual description, you see the world with new eyes. When someone hurts, you ache for them.<br /><br />So, in case you still haven't realized: if you don't own this book, run the next book store and buy it immediately. Read it. Let it whisk you away to a different world, go breathe in the magic. The size of The Name of the Wind may seem intimidating, but believe me - you won't want it to end!<br />I have the sequel,The Wise Man's Fear, in my room but I'll have to wait a while before I start it or I will never get anything done for my university classes. Also, it will make the wait for book 3 shorter.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome!!!!!! I love how it is the perfect mix of fantasy, reality, cruelty, craziness, hate, lies and love
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Fast and convenient! Faster than my desk top computer! Use it all the time! Very happy with this app. Great!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Fall Out Boy is a fantastic mix of lyrics and stomp. I love how thoughtful and playful the songs are while just being fun to listen to as well. Young Volcanoes is an obvious standout, as is My Songs Know What You Did Last Summer. But the whole album is great tracks. Ironically the only one I don't like is the title track. It doesn't save it at all.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter loves to play this game in the car.  She plays over and over and never seems to get bored.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love Minion? Love Temple Run? You'll love this game!<br />Keeps the kids busy for hours!<br />Wish you could buy more with banana's - not a fan of spending real money on fake products. :) LOL
B007SY3CEW|4.0|This is an easy to use fun way to play the piano.  The kids enjoy the music on the app.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Easy to read with much info.  I really didn't get the results I was looking for yet I feel it is due to the interference of some outer circumstances which keep my attention else where.<br /><br />Will re-attempt when the waters are cooled.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a great book and movie.  A new unquie way to view the times then, I would reccommend to anyone.
B000MGATTE|5.0|Not your typical Stephen King horror book - yes, there were monsters but they are more of the human variety which is even scarier.  What this story really is is a love story.  It was at times funny, at times suspenseful and at times heartbreaking and beautiful.
B00B3HJMLM|4.0|I like the CD and would buy more Luke Bryan albums.  We listen to it in the car all of the time.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|For a film with it budget restraints, and age, it looks and sounds (PCM 5.1) awesome. For aussie buyers this is the one to get, as its 1080p...our release was 1080i. Chow Chow for Now Now.
B00AALHW6Y|3.0|This is a good CD with a couple of really good songs I think the next one will be even better,
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very touching story.  The title of the book is a little misleading.  I couldn't put it down.  Great ending!  Enjoy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lots of time playing this game fun and relaxing for all of the family we all play it to relax.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very good, the acting is great, the writing is very good and the right amount of humor is interjected. Perfect
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Living less than a mile from the federal correctional facility in Danbury, I was initially drawn in to find out what life was like for those women living down the road from me. I immediately felt the connection with this white, ordinary American girl and was fascinated by the peek she allows us into daily prison life as well as her emotional journey of courage and lessons learned there.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|I thought I'd have to make my video game loving child play this since it's educational, but it's actually fun and effective. I wasn't expecting so much from this app, but now I'm playing too. I wish this was around when I was learning algebra.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you're working in IT and wonder how things can be less dysfunctional, then this is the book for you.
B00F35BV64|1.0|I sat down with my husband and 18 year old son to what seemed to be a pretty  good movie until the embarrassing scene of Kirk getting out of bed with 2 females with tales.  Ruined it for me.  I have cautioned my daughter-in-law &#34;not&#34; to let my grandchildren see it and will tell everyone I know to do the same.  It a shame that Holywood thinks that profanity, beastology, homosexuality and sex scenes etc sell a movie.  Morals, please come back to mankind.....
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follet never fails to satisfy.  His characters are always developed, even those that you hate you hate them because you can see shreds of humanity every so often.
0345529057|5.0|Bought it for my sister and she said every book was amazing. She's now in wait of more future volumes.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars, I would! I consider it to be a masterpiece. Excellent character development, fast-paced, intriguing plot, and a twist in the end that will leave you speechless!<br /><br />Highly recommend it and will definitely read more from this author!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Excellent music! High quality of  the music sound which is better than the audio in their Youtube channel. I enjoy to listen to it when I'm driving.
B00B52F278|5.0|Liam McIntye is still woofy smoking hot as his predecessor.  The action still great and so is story line.  That he was at DragonCon this year in Atlanta was awesome.
B0055S348W|5.0|What a brilliant concept: printing from any computer, without huge, blocky, cumbersome, bloated software to install! I used the app on my older Asus Transformer TF101 tablet and expected to get error messages, printer not found or to download a 500GB program, as what happened when I tried to print from my older TC1100 tablet.<br /><br />I wanted to print from my old PC, the TC1100 and went to the printer manufacturer's website, found the driver and proceeded to download.  I stopped after noticing it was a HUGE file and was only downloading at 2kb per minute.  You know what that means?  That's like draining a 64 ounce drink with one of those narrow, tiny, mini straws you stir coffee with.  Ridiculous. So I was looking for a free printing app on the old android tablet and found this one.  I didn't have much hope but downloaded anyway.<br /><br />The app worked with my TF101 flawlessly, found the printer effortlessly and voila!  The paper was printing!  I was astounded.<br /><br />I would give 5 stars!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Don't even start to watch this unless you have a good block of time available. You will be hooked and won't want to stop watching. It could put your job in jeopardy.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Fantasy meets SF. I fun ride that you dont always see what is around the corner. A fun read for people looking outside the mainstream of Marvel and DC.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed this story. I loved the connection of lives, as you learn each character's faith. The book is an unfinished spider web, with only a few key strands connected. It's a wishful ending that comes with new beginnings.
B005OI1T8A|5.0|Even more detail and explanation than I could have hoped for, all without getting too wordy or complex.  The graphics are beautiful and mind-blowing and easy to understand.  A beautiful book and accomplishment for the author.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|A WONDERFUL, HEARTWARMING STORY. WISH ALL COACHES WERE LIKE THIS CHARACTER. IT IS A MOVIE YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. SHOWS  STRONG CHARACTERS.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Nice to finally be able to ditch the old alarm clock. This app does all that I need and is so easy to use.
B00BMUL2WW|5.0|Luke is the geatest composer of our time. Hands down. This album is beautiful and the vinyl gatefold looks great. Definitely in competition for album of the year.
160941280X|1.0|I ordered a book and recieved a cd, i went back and checked at the site and it was not clear enough that this is a cd and not the book
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I think this book should be required reading for all school children. You learn so many things that you were never taught in school.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Decent story line and leaves room for a sequel. Acting was not as bad as I thought it would be.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is one my all time favorite books.  I would, and have, recommend it to everyone.  Excellent. I just finished reading it for the 2nd time.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|The book was charming, impractical (in a world with no visible magic), and the characters made me smile. A good book for like minded adult fans of fantasy and an excellent read for young people.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|recommended, great, the material, the movie, the actors, the soundtrack, one of the best movies of dracula, totally recommended for a movie collector
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love it so much that they go from the Kindle to my phone to play all day long
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you liked the first book, this is a must-read! Your mind will hurt trying to figure out what may happen next!
B004I744AS|5.0|The app is very good and has a lot of other things going on in it than just being a dictionary. The offline mode is pretty handy too. There are text based ads and to get rid of them needs an in-app purchase though.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I couldn't ask for a better novel. This is my 4th time reading it, and still love it like it's my first. For any fan of the video game, I suggest you read this novel, and then the rest of them. This is easily in my top 5 books of all time.
B003DS3GC0|5.0|great acting, grew up in the city and took me back to fond memories growing up in hells kitchen. highly recommended
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really liked this book.  What appears to be a simple plot is anything but that.  I had a difficult time putting it down all the way to the stunning conclusion.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I'm sure Gregory thanked his editor, for it seems all writers do but I'm not certain the editor of this novel deserves it. Normally I enjoy descriptive details but there were many times with this novel where I felt the energy and excitement of the story was diluted by excessive detail. I finished the novel but there were times I was in no hurry to pick it up again and continue reading and I blame that on the editing. I think Mr. Roberts is a very talented writer but he has some repetitive bad habits which in a book of this length become annoying. Every character in this book is described by his impressions of their eyes to begin with and it becomes far too predictable. The story was amazing and I learned more about India with this read than I expected and that was a bonus.<br />Would I buy another 1000 page novel by Mr. Roberts ?  Not likely .
B008QTVNUI|5.0|What a well written and well acted show.  The storyline is superb.  My wife and I are completely hooked.  We ordered Showtime just to watch this show.  It is that good.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I love this movie, I got it the day before the movie came out so I was soo happy about that. A must buy.
B0086221SS|4.0|This is a romantic-comedy movie and has great actors in it. The movie is very well intrigued for rocky relationships.
B009RX85N0|4.0|Dear creators of the show \\"Once Upon A Time\\"<br /><br />I really like your show. Honestly, I do. You've breathed new life into the old fairy tales we all grew up with while also weaving in a decent modern tale that not only ties together our world with the fairytale world, but also both types of characters - their fairy tale version and modern counterpart.<br /><br />Sure, you have more than your fair share of baffling plot twists, gaping plot holes you could sail the Jolly Roger through and countless moments where you openly contradict the rules you've created in the story; sometimes in the same episode that the rule was stated. I had to wonder as I watched on Netflix whether there was a conversation that went:<br /><br />Writer 1: Hey I think we wrote ourselves into a corner on this one, because the protagonists have what they need to go back home; now the villians can't chase them and keep the drama going.<br /><br />Writer 2: Oh don't worry about it - I've got another McGruffin up my sleeve! Call it a \\"backup McGruffin!\\"<br /><br />1: But didn't we just establish that the villains can't go to Storybrooke without the McGruffin? You know, the one Emma and crew spent the last few episodes tracking down and just barely STOLE BACK from the villains in the nick of time?<br /><br />2: Yeah; but they're the villains, so they can do that.<br /><br />1: Ooooohhh, I get it. They're VILLAINS, right!<br /><br />And there are really only so many times you can reuse \\"The character who was the hero in the original's really the villain here. Surprise!\\" trope so many times before it starts to wear a little thin. Case in point:  I'm not sure how you thought we wouldn't see who the next Big Bad for season 3 was a freaking mile away. I mean, seriously guys; waiting to mention his name until the last few minutes of the show really wasn't necessary at that point. Not to mention that you already used the \\"This character died! Nope, not really; here they are - bwahahahaha! Fooled you!\\"trope in season 1; don't you think reusing it in season 2's a tad premature?<br /><br />Then of course there's the whole \\"We're all family\\" trope that you mashed in there with as many characters as you could possibly get away with. I get that you want to amp up the stakes, but there are really only so many connections you can make before the whole thing starts to buckle under its own weight.<br /><br />And maybe I'm nitpicking a little here, but when a certain character shot another certain character to make her lose her memories to hurt the shooter's most hated enemy, I found myself taken aback by this after the initial shock wore off. I mean, we're talking about someone who just barely got to the modern world, and he's somehow a good enough shot to hit someone in the dark while wielding a gun one-handed, standing far enough away to not be seen until it's too late. Bullets aren't exactly known for flying perfectly straight, and the human body's got this annoying tendency to have blood vessels all about it, so there aren't really too many places you can shoot someone and it truly be a nonlethal shot.<br /><br />I suppose this sounds like a negative review of the show, but I would like to reiterate that I do in fact like it. Despite the show's flaws, I've enjoyed seeing the cast all get their own stories alongside the modern plot. Regina and Gold/Rumpelstiltskin are both complex and intriguing characters who show a lot of depth, especially in season 2. The conflict was appropriately escalated in the finale and now with the way things turned out in the end we have something to look forward to with season 3. And it looks as though Storybrooke'll be put on the back burner for at least the first part, so we'll probably see a lot more of the fantasy side of the show, and that's hardly a bad thing. So while I would recommend the show to those who loved those old fairy tale stories and fantasy in general, I would temper my expectations if you go in expecting this to be thenext grand accomplishment in television.
B002QQ8HAG|4.0|Anna Wintpurs  story is remarkable as is her role in Vogue<br /><br />I also enjoyed going on the fashion shoots especially with Grace Coddington at Versailles<br /><br />A fabulous documentar<br /><br />FABULOUS STORY
1611762359|4.0|A great story.  Love the choices the author made regarding the end of the book.  I started this as a audio book on a trip but the reader's voice didn't match my vision so I ditched the cd and bought the book because the story was that good.
B008U3NU38|4.0|This ridiculously lavish box will make committed Clash fans and collectors swoon. You get every Mick Jones-era album remastered brilliantly for modern listeners (among other things, the low end has been juiced up for playback on mobile devices and computers) and sounding great, especially on a proper stereo.  You get a big helping of unreleased tracks that have all been given good sound. You get a DVD packed with videos and live performances. You get liner notes written by both the band and just about every key person from the band's personal entourage and studio crews. You get stickers and badges to replace the ones you regret using or losing back in the day. You get random objects that have no discernable purpose. All in high quality, historically faithful, and sturdy packaging throughout.<br /><br />Other bands and record labels issuing deluxe sets would do well to study Sound System closely. Sound System easily matches the cool boxes put out by Rhino during its heyday and even comes close to the opulent limited editions put out by Revenant Records. Too many jumbo sets these days skimp on one or more things, such as sound quality, booklets, replica album sleeves, or tchotchkes. Not Sound System.<br /><br />There are a couple of small things that keep Sound System from being perfect though. First, just like in the Singles box set, the \\"Cost of Living EP advert\\" coda to Capital Radio II is missing. I also think both versions of \\"Inoculated City\\" should have been included since so many vinyl albums were sold without the 2000 Flushes sample. These are quibbles, especially since it isn't that difficult to dig up online posts of either track, but these omissions stick out in such a high quality set.<br /><br />Bottom line: an essential acquisition for big time fans and completists, despite the two minor faults.  Newcomers to the Clash who want the essentials all in one go--plus saving some $$$ as well--might be better off picking up [[ASIN:B00CUKTGW6 5 Album Studio Set]] and [[ASIN:B000HCPU0Q The Singles]] instead. Four stars.The Singles]] instead. Four stars.

B00DOQK2OG|5.0|I saw this tour in Las Vegas at the Huntridge Theater, its an old plush Movie Theater they turned into a concert hall, its small, interment, comfortable and great venue for concerts; Blackmore and company just tour it up. Blackmore was on fire, maybe knowing he was going in another musical direction soon thereafter.  This concert from Germany catches the essence of this tour and how on fire Blackmore was.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like this item; it dose everything it is supped to. Easy to set up and use.<br /><br />It is, however, limited to only sites that are compatible to Chrome cast. I only hope that more will be in the future.
B00001W9G0|5.0|This film still moves after forty years. The immortal love story of free-spirited, liberal, middle-class Katie and rich, privileged, jet-setting writer Hubbell continues to charm.  It's a brilliant story of a woman who always sees the best in her man, however far he falls from the pedestal on which she has placed him.<br /><br />Redford and Streisand were at the peak of the careers, and at the most beautiful of their lifetimes when this movie was made.  The viewer sees the best of their careers and the depth of their talent in watching them together; one can believe they're in love.  If the movie has a flaw, it's in the way the man she loves disappoints a woman - but this is also its key point.  People can love each other but be unable to live together, and men and women can be drawn together through the bleakest of circumstances and despite a deep canyon of differences.  A woman can bring out the very best in a man.....and never be as good again as he was with her.  Likewise, if she moves on, there will still be a place in her heart that can't quite belong to anyone else.<br /><br />Always makes me cry.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a fun game that takes several different games and makes it into one. I wish that you didn't have to grind so long to get another game
B0087X728K|5.0|I'm sure glad you don't need to use much of this stuff! I've purchased several of these and nothing has overheated yet(except for one old Dell Inspiron, but it had a dead fan, oops.

Vote? Ruth from OHIO
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|I loved Born and Raised and found it to be a great middle ground between the pop/blues and the bluegrass/folk sound he's been moving toward since Battle Studies.  Paradise Valley has the needle buried in the latter sound with mixed results.  Personally it's my least favorite JM album and one that I don't think will gather greater favor with continued replays.<br /><br />There are a few chestnuts on here: Badge and Gun captures the sounds of lament that permeated the B&R album, but does so without the effective autobiographical tones that listeners of Mayer have come to appreciate. Wildfire has some neat guitar and rhythm work, but lyrically it's attempt to be catchy falls short. Dear Marie is an attempt at the nostalgia of first love, but doesn't quite get the listener there emotionally. I Will Be Found is a fine song, but fails lyrically 'I'm a little birdie in a big ole tree'?<br /><br />Overall, I like that Mayer keeps reinventing himself and I think Born and Raised was a near perfect melding of his various musical interests and writing songs in different styles. Paradise Valley just goes too far in one direction.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|An over all addictive game decent combat and fun upgrading<br />A little time consuming in some aspects but for a free mobile game of this genre it's good to go
B009P5S11G|5.0|Sex Love and Addiction. I love Rihanna and her voice so beautiful and she is way gorgeous. I think she is an amazing artist this album is great.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Wish it was still on, the cast was great and story lines are current with today's topics which shows the quality of the show. This review is for all seven seasons
B004H1V5RU|5.0|bought these as a wedding present for my sister's husband because it drives her nuts.  my gift got a big eye roll from her and a grin from him.  mission accomplished.
159463176X|4.0|Unlike his first two books, Hosseini tones down his flare for drama in this one. A lot, quite a lot, happens in course of half a century in this book but his endings are humbling, less dreamy, more real. The complexity is impressive and yet simple keeping the book interesting. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the verbosity of it. Two characters and their stories are quite unnecessary and take away from the heart of the story. The others are real winners. A fabulous read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I just started playing and I am already addicted!! This app is alot of fun and filled with lots of cute dragons. I highly recommend Dragonvale to everybody!
B0089XH38M|5.0|I love AVG. Have it on my tablet and home computer. The best free virus out there. Cant go wrong
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this game for my six year old and he loves it, I've even played it myself.  It truly awakens the brain cells
B003U4UNPK|5.0|On to season 4. Can't miss this one! Best series I ever watched in a long time. Just can't stop watching, episode after episode.<br />A must see.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|Purchased for our grand kiddies, at their request for a Christmas gift.  We have had this movie for years and we never tire of watching it with the kiddies. Viewing much more enjoyable than the old VHS.<br />CJF-Houston
B00006LFGD|5.0|We couldn't have been more happy about this album.  It is the best DUETS ever! some were the famous ones, some we never knew she had recorded.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|We live in the south.  There is much of this movie that is heart-breaking, on many levels.  Much that we are not proud of.<br />The acting is amazing, you just know these characters are true and real.  Good movie around which to have a disscussion with children, of all ages.  Our teens were unaware of the level of segregation. Many fun and funny moments that keep the movie light enough to be entertaining.  The women are brave beyond belief.<br />CJF-Houston
B000I3SYEI|5.0|The Best ST movie of all time. Though dated, still holds its own. Love the linkage to the original series!
1579128955|5.0|My kids love this book and spend much of their free time reading through it just for their interest. Then they discuss what they have learned with each other and with us (their parents). It is just as I had hoped.  I purchased this that my children might enjoy learning this information on their own, better preparing them for future science classes.  Yes, I love this book too!  It is filled with lovely, bright pictures and well worded facts and information on the elements.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Only reason this book isn't a 5 star is because I read Promise of Blood right before and I think that might be my favorite book of all time at this point.
1250007208|5.0|Good reading.
B00DPY95D6|1.0|The writing was awful and the story too wierd. The ending stupid. Would not ever read another book by this author
B0093X80VQ|3.0|I read this follow up to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a kid, and I remember liking it.  I bought this to read to my kids some 30 years later after we read the first book together...not as good as I remembered.  Kind of a strange story and definitely not as good as Charlie and the Chocolate factory.<br /><br />The kindle version was fine, but I think it might be best for most readers to stop at the first book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Read all of Grisham and enjoy his style and plots. This one was very different and I liked the twist of events.
B007LYB4BC|5.0|Purchased this record after reading postitive review about it. Great vintage blues sound. And great to see a modern artist recording on vinyl too!
B0026IQYEU|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but watching it online was a little frustrating at first:  the movie would proceed past the first couple minutes.  I came back after a little while and it worked just fine.  My internet connectivity was maximized at all times so I thought there might be something wrong on Amazon's end.<br /><br />The movie itself details the struggles of a famous Varsovian Jew, Wladyslaw Szpilman, through Nazi-occupied Poland.  The movie does feel a little slow at times, but overall the story is engaging and you keep wondering what will happen next.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|As a long-time Bible reader who is not a historian, the author's fact-based perspective was very enlightening.  Learning how Roman authorities reacted to and ultimate dispatched the many messiah's before and after Jesus has given me a better understanding of everyday life and some of what early believers faced in those times.
6305212112|5.0|Every female should own this movie and watch it often.  Full of love and charm.  If only we could stop by the 'Whistle Stop Cafe' and have some of those Fried Green Tomatoes...  I'll pass on the barbecue. The cook book that goes along side the movie is great, too!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning. Started on a Sunday morning and read straight through to the end.  Going back to Amazon to find other books written by Moyes!
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Great little game to play in small doses. The rendering jump when new ads appear keeps it from 5 stars as it is distracting. Excellent concept and fun to play.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is such an easy approach to harnessing the power of the universe.<br />The exercises and labs are easy to follow and the results aremsurento surprise and amaze.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was happy with customer service for their prompt attention to my dilemma and their recommendation to purchase this item.  I was happily surprised that I can use it not only at home but on the go.  Thanks again the kindle customer service.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Not yet done with book, but love it...author uses simple terms to explain how to use conscious versus unconscious thinking to manifest positive thoughts/energy.
1451695195|5.0|Truth is hard to find when it comes to Heaven, but here it is. The source, Eben Alexander, is Totally Credible with as a Doctor.
B00CNEVII4|5.0|This is a classic album musically speaking, most rock music fans will already own a copy. The 1994 Atlantic label remaster was excellent for it's day, however the 2013 Audio Fidelity gold CD betters the Atlantic sonically in every way and is well worth the outlay for those with better sounding systems, or anyone who still has the original (mediocre) 1980s CD release.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|This movie, in HD and 3D HD is breathtaking.  The 3D effects are absolutely the best I have seen.  Highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game.  intuition needed.  easy to play and User friendly.  would play all levels.  highly recommended for all that love hide and seek games.
0811877485|3.0|I have to add to the other reviews that express disappointment about the adhesion of these decals.  The ones that stick best are the color circles & fruit.  The caterpillar & butterfly are packed into the folder in such a way that they are creased, which makes their adhesion more difficult without some modifications.  Also, design-wise be aware that many of the images have a white border which you may not like in your design.<br /><br />However, there are work-arounds to encourage the decal to stick to the wall.  Give the wall where you plan to put the decal a quick swipe with rubbing alcohol and use a credit card to smooth the decal onto the wall (I also had a friend have success rolling a tennis ball over decals to smooth them).  I didn't have any problems with the alcohol permanently discoloring the paint, but you might want to test somewhere inconspicuous on your wall first.  I've found that the alcohol gives the paint a slight tackiness that helped the decal cling.  The crease of the butterfly & caterpillar were still bubbling up a bit, so I cut a very small piece of [[ASIN:B00004Z47L 3M  Double-Sided Tape with Dispenser, Permanent, 1/2 X 250 Inches, Clear (MMM136)]] and slid that onto the crease of the decal.  So far, so good.  This obviously works best once you have decided on position for the decal -- don't put the tape behind it until you're done re-positioning!  I didn't use a ton of tape - just one or two small pieces per stubborn decal, so I don't expect it to be a huge pain to remove once the little one has outgrown the Hungry Caterpillar theme.<br /><br />So, for the price, I'm willing to put up with a little extra work to make these stick.  They're a bit frustrating at first, but the other Hungry Caterpillar decals are far out of my price range.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is somewhat fun, but it is not everything that I expected or hoped for.  I play the game some.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Awesome movie!! But what Brad Pitt movie isn't, action, suspence and a great story. Totally worth buying and watching again.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I just finished watching the first season of the Following.<br />What a great show.<br />Didnt watch it until it came to reruns.<br />Wont make that choice again.<br />A thrill ride. Loved it.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|one of the most boringest games i've ever played.  totally deleted it from my kindle. uugghhh not very pleased with the game
B00E97AZZK|5.0|Good surprise ending, loved it.  Definitely reccomment it.  I also purchased this.  I think its a good one to watch again.
B004W1GCVE|5.0|The setting is very similar to Downton Abby (if you haven't seen it, you are missing some good stuff) and the plot somewhat as well. There is good dialogue, drama, and a couple of unexpected twists. It takes place around the 1940's pre-World War II.  I agree with others who said the scenery is so well done, colorful and just plain beautiful. If you like BBC, then you won't be disappointed. This is superior historical drama. Enjoy it every night like we have the last few nights. Season 2 is available too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun and challenging game. it is fun to try and figure out what you have to do to get the doors to open. needs more levels. hopefully they are in the works.
B00CX7TOOG|5.0|My husband and I both really liked this movie. It kept you on the edge of your seats throughout most of the movie.
0525478817|5.0|This book is by far, one of the best books I have read this year.  I wasn't sure if it was just me, as Cancer is a part of my life (not me personally, but family members), but this book really touched me.  I found the characters endearing, believable, and heartwarming.  The story line made me think about how I might react if (When?) I get Cancer, and how we treat those who are touched by Cancer.  I laughed, I cried and all in all I did not want this book to end.  I read book after book after book, and upon finishing this book, I didn't even want to start another book, I just wanted to treasure the memories of this well written book.  Brilliant.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Sometimes challenging. Enjoy the hunt for clues to get out but then am right back in another situation. Bring on more.
1451627297|4.0|Let me just say first this is a really long book! 842 pages in hard cover. And while part of me is slightly disappointed in this book, part of me loved it. I used to read a lot of Stephen King, and haven't read one of his books in years. I picked this one up because of the topic. I have wanted to read more about Kennedy and the assassination. While I know this is a Novel, and I didn't expect to learn any new facts about the assasination, when I think about the book from the Kennedy assassination stand point I kind of want to give this book 3 stars. I wanted a more indepth look at what the world would be like if Kennedy had lived.  The book did cover that, don't get me wrong.  I just wanted more of this.  So I found the book a bit disappointing from that stand point. But if I look at the book from a love story stand point, then I liked the book tremendously. I just didn't expect this book to be so much of a love story. From a love story stand point, this book was beautifully written, that's just not what I expected.  Overall, I liked the book quite a bit,this is one that will stay with me for some time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The best for sleeping and wakeing up.<br />The perfect mix of both worlds. Now you can fall asleep with white noise then wake up all rrefreshed.
0307341577|2.0|I had read Gone Girl and had a hard time putting the book down.  So I ordered two more of Gillian Flynn's books.  I haven't read the third book yet, but did read Dark Places.  My first thought is 'appropriate title'.  It is a dark book.  I find that I like books better when I can connect to and/or relate to at least one character in the book.  I didn't feel like I could relate or even like any characters in this book.  So that might be a fault against me, not necessarily the book.  I feel like the book got too detailed on some items and areas and not detailed enough for my liking in other areas.  I do recommend reading until the end of the book, as there are some surprises, and that was a saving grace for this book.  Not a bad book overall (any book I finish can't be all bad), but not my favorite by Gillian Flynn.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|I enjoyed this from the start.  It did get a little slow toward the middle, but, of course, picked up later on.  Baldacci kept me thinking the entire time and had surprises at most turns.
0307744434|2.0|The idea behind this book in very intriguing. I wish I could say the book was as well. What this book did do very well was to give great insight into what it was like to be at the Night Circus. The atmosphere, the excitement, the feeling that you were really there and walking through the circus, gets an A+. But that's where the A's for this book end. The story line between Celia and Marco left me flat. The two do not become romantically linked until late in the book (which is fine really but the book description leads the reader to believe they are lovers for longer than just the end of the book). The \\"competition\\" they are said to be in, nobody seems to understand the rules to. I don't think Celia, Marco or the reader understood the rules of the \\"competition\\". I found this part of the story line pretty flat, uninteresting and difficult to understand.  I feel like this could have been an incredible story, but I found it more confusing than anything.  I give it a 2 1/2 stars.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|This app wouldn't play on my machine.  I am not sure what prevented it from playing. My OS is Android 2.8 or the like.
B00F35BV64|4.0|You will either love it or hate it.  The new stars, particularly Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (Kirk and Spock) have done an amazing job with the mannerisms and interactions that Bill Shatner and Leonard Nimoy created with the characters.  The doctor was acceptable...the rest of the characters were just...characters. If you aren't looking at the screen, you'll swear that Scotty is Craig Ferguson talking. Maybe it's more realistic to have an actual Scotsman playing the part...but he doesn't sound or even remotely resemble James Doohan.  I wish they had allowed Doohan's son to play the part...it would have been much better.<br /><br />According to the hard core fans on Shatner's Facebook, some comic books in between the two new movies indicated the story in these to be an \\"alternate timeline\\".  I don't care for this concept, and the fact that they blew up Vulcan in the first movie.  I think it has screwed up the continuity that was always so carefully preserved with all the shows and movies, and it's a shame.<br /><br />That being said, it was still a fun movie...half of it taken from Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.  They used a lot of those scenes, although some reversed. You can't imagine Spock screaming KHANNNNNNNN! yet he does.  Both actors cry too easily, which is somewhat irksome.  They have taken the two most macho characters in our folklore and turned them into metro-sexuals. :-)<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good little video, especially if you aren't a hard core fan and won't be insulted with the changes.  I'm glad to hear JJ. Abrams is moving to Star Wars, though.  I think his tendency for fluff will be more appreciated in that movie line.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Angry Birds Seasons would not play on my android tablet. I think it was the tablet, but I am not sure.
B001NLJ33K|1.0|Could have been a good movie. Gritty, dramatic, intense. However, it was muddled from the beginning with poor acting, bad dialogue and flat characterizations. Jamie Foxx was the only actor in the cast who was remotely believable. The rest were wooden, which made it difficult to invest in the movie and therefore follow the convoluted plot line. Unfortunately, what should have been the main draw of the film- the relationship between Crockett and Tubbs- was ruined by the poor chemistry between Farrell and Foxx and diminished by their trite love interests. I think I could've enjoyed this movie if the acting had been better though. But right from the start it failed to engage me because the characters seemed like cardboard cutouts reading off a teleprompter.
B006S009IY|5.0|Love this movie. It is a great story of imagination at work. Johnny depp does a great job in this movie
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good book would recommend anyone to read it very romantic. Would definitely read this book again. Very good book.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A cute little story woven around a big problem.  Our kids will be entertained by the robots that seem very human and the parents of the children watching this movie can contemplate the problem of a rampant consumer society.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Recommended for children and families! One or two small cuss words but other than that perfect. The book is also very good.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|Great dvd watch the first episode<br />and it was good<br />Great Picture and Sound<br />Would watch it again<br />Thanks for the complete series on Stargate SG- !
B00004XMTH|5.0|Cats is full of great songs and impressive dances. It is entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Now, it is all singing so if you do not like musicals like that then this is not for you.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Fun game for everyone.  In the genre of Cut the Rope.  Simple premise to save the bugs.... challenging to accomplish.  This one is worth it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Despicable Me is a well written cartoon comedy made for both adults and children. This cartoon will make anyone laugh.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|This case is nice. I would have given it 5 stars if it had been just a little bit bigger,  as I find I have to shove it in with some force. It doesn't just slip in easily.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Pro:<br />The g930s sound quality and 7.1 is absolutely amazing, it blows me away to hear the difference from stereo to 7.1 when i swap from one to the other while listening to music or playing games.<br /><br />Con:<br />I've already RMA'd it for dead battery, and I get the feeling I will have to RMA it again.<br /><br />It's plagued by interference and driver issues.<br /><br />Sound crackles in 7.1 now in majority of games off and on cause is unknown.<br /><br />Forget about using it at Large LAN parties way to much interference will skip and cut out like no ones business<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If it worked as intended it would be my favorite headphones to date, the sound quality (when working) is truly something to enjoy. The freedom offered by a wireless headset is great, and there are no worries about breaking it via the cord, but the sound issues and cutting on and off ruin the benefits of wirelessness and I find the battery quickly stops charging correctly, sometimes it will die even when plugged in as if it had decided not to charge, It spends more time plugged in then wireless nowaday.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if this is Logitech's number one  RMA'd item since its come out.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother investing in this headset unless you get it really cheap or have no issues with potentially sending it back after 6 months and waiting 2 weeks for a new one to come back
B002ZG98J6|4.0|I absolutely love the books in this series and wish the movie would have stuck a little closer to the book. It was still really good though!
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Great father and son story about second chances in one of life's most important roles. The under dog rises and the little guy wins. Good family movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I absolutely love all of Rick Riordan's series. He is a fantastic writer and this book certainly has left nothing to be desired. I can't wait for the rest of the series!!
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Another great action movie in this series.  If you are a GI Joe fan you have to see it. Great action and special effects.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I absolutely love all of Rick Riordan's series. He is a fantastic writer and this book certainly has left nothing to be desired. I can't wait for the rest of the series!!

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious! I love musicals and this one keeps it light and fun! Very well done! I hope there's a sequel on the way!

B000JCSPG0|5.0|I love this movie! Don't ask me why, I just do. The whole plot/story resonates with me. James Spader & Kurt Russell are fantastic in their performance. Don't believe it's a classic? Look how many movie sequels and televison series resulted from it.
B00A8P45FI|5.0|This is an EPIC film it has been my favorite movie since childhood... I am 51 and it remains untouched.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I have purchased the whole set, I think anyone who likes cop shows will like this set of DVD's. Great!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I have to wake up at 5:00 am. Not 5:01 am, not 5:02 am. But 5:00 am. Insted of going BEEP BEEP BEEP and playing that really scary loud annoying alarm type soundy  thing. It does nothing. My pet fuzzy teradctile makes more sound than this. But that's off the subject. It does notify me that it went off.. which is wierd becuase I dont typically sleeepturnoffmyalarm. Anyone will tell you that that's not a normal thing for me, so it leaves me just like whaaaaaaa. Someone. Help. I. Have. School. To. Get. To. DX

B009AMAGQM|5.0|beautiful creatures is such a wonderful and delightful story to watch and enjoy i loved all the awesome powers that lena and the rest of the casters have and use. yes this story takes place in the deep sound of north carlina and yes people act the same way as emily and ms lincol. i am very sad we will never see a beautiful darkness movie but since this movie stepped away quite far from the book i understand why. but i also think people want these movies to be just like the novel and in this sence that is just impossible there is so much in the book and to add everything that needed to be in the film the movie would have had to be at lease 3-6 hours long and honestly who would watch that.  SO PEOPLE OF THE WORLD WAKE THE HELL UP AND GET OVER IT AND JUST SIT DOWN AND ENJOY THE STORY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE... so yes i loved this book ive seen it 5 times now and could very easly watch it another 5 times and still want more. such a beautiful story so glad im reading the books so i can know more about these charcters and this world...

B00E3UN44W|4.0|It was great to hear that season 3 is finally seeing the light, after a wait since season 2 to shame the \\"Eagles\\". But I say it's worth it, even if some of his older fans didn't make it to the Promised Land. Us whipper-snappers of fifty still remember being glued to our clunky flat-screen plasma television sets (don't laugh - it was a very long time ago), live-blogging the episodes with our \\"tumblr\\" friends. (Ask your mother about that one.)<br /><br />Scheduling snafus aside, it's the good old days at 221B once again! Well, sort of: the story had to get tweaked a bit along the way to adjust for the tectonic shifts in society and technology between the last two seasons. We know how picky those Generation Z young 'uns are about their 'IntraBrainFlix' direct streaming queues. Thankfully, the first seasons of \\"Sherlock\\" have long aged past 'dated' and into 'retro', so the new season is sure to find its audience.<br /><br />The stories still follow the old ACD canon, with some tasteful updating for the modern times. Sherlock and John, reunited after a thirty year separation, once more chase criminals, though on rather creakier joints or strapped into their scratched-up old 6th generation exoskeletons. But if it's not quite fast times for our boys anymore, it's still high times, though Sherlock, bowing to his doctor's wisdom and his inability to keep on healthy weight, has finally forsaken cocaine in favor of cannabis, which His Nearly-All-Powerful Excellence Mycroft Holmes legalized in 2019 after assuming control of Western Europe in a bloodless and highly efficient lunch hour coup.<br /><br />Our heroes are not quite what they used to be - John's once psychosomatic limp is now a very real one due to a cyborg leg that seems to have a mind of its own, and Sherlock's back can't handle more than thirty consecutive minutes of elegant sprawls on the sofa before the A.I. climate and resident wellness monitoring system of 221B starts to chide him in a motherly tone, - but thethrills and spills are still there, even if now they sometimes revolve around blood pressure jumps and incontinence. Sherlock is still the misanthropic genius we remember, though perhaps a touch more cantankerous now that his aging 'transport' insists on regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance, and John, well, John's just happy to have Sherlock back after all these years. And sure, his four grown children quirked their eyebrows a bit at their dear old Dad suddenly running off from the family home to shack up with an ex-boyfriend in his dotage, but that's life for you.<br /><br />Favorite episodes: \\"The Case of the Missing Moon Shuttle\\", \\"Nanobot Nuisance, part 2\\", and \\"The Other Locked Room Mystery\\", where John spends forty minutes in front of 221B searching his pockets for the house keys clenched in his hand.

B007SGM084|5.0|I read the trilogy in just one week. I couldn't stop turning pages! Really fell in love with the characters and there was plenty of drama to keep the reader interested. I'd recommend it.
1611761565|5.0|I don't really see what all of the fuss is about with regard to the authors revealing trade secrets in No Easy Day.  I certainly didn't get a sense that they were doing much of that.  The book was very even and portrayed the SEAL lifestyle in a very matter of fact, and sincere way.  What I did get a sense of is how unbelievably dangerous it is to be a SEAL, Army Ranger, or in Spec Ops in general.  I'm a little surprised that more guys don't get burned out sooner.  It seems very stressful but I suppose for people who are into adrenaline rushes, it probably doesn't get much better than jumping out of airplanes into the ocean or chasing bad guy terrorists, and getting to use the latest high tech weaponry, and intelligence gathering methods to do it.  I thought it was somewhat of an indictment of the SEAL program that guys were spending their own money to purchase work related weapons and equipment.  That just should never be the case, the U. S. can afford to equip the SEALs and Rangers.<br /><br />Also the book did not really make a political statement about either party, but it did discuss who mostly benefited from Spec Ops successes such as officers getting promoted, and Obama getting reelected, but the SEALs who are mostly enlisted types not really getting much benefit other than a pat on the back.  Although, I would imagine if a SEAL or Ranger could adapt to getting older they would indeed be in line for a plumb training assignment or desk assignment.  No small thing.  I didn't get a sense that the President was doing any more or less than any other President would have done with regard to efforts to find or kill Bin Laden.<br /><br />As for setting the record straight, the author did it in what I considered to be a very tactful way.  In fact he seems to be praising the Obama administration at times and criticizing them mildly at times.  He seems to be echoing what many citizens in the U. S. feel.  Frustrations with the politics and U. S. government have gone on for years and will continue, hopefully for many more.<br /><br />I don't understand why those in the Spec Ops community are so upset with this book.  It really seems to me a very accurate and mostly non controversial book about this particular person and those he worked with, including a very excellent portrayal of the CIA and just how much they really do to assist the Spec Ops groups.  His efforts to donate the proceeds from the book should not be trivialized.  I'm sure that was his intent from the outset.<br /><br />An excellent book, one that my son and I have read.  He has wanted to be a Navy SEAL since a very young age.  This and other books have done nothing to change his desire to serve his country.  While I support him, I have no illusions about whether he will be able to attain his goal or about how dangerous it is.<br /><br />Lastly, I found it interesting that materials found at Bin Laden's compound seem to indicate that he did not want his children or family to join the Jihad and that some of those at his compound, including him, didn't really try to defend themselves.  Not that it would have ended any differently.  The author points out that he has experienced similar things with those giving orders such as Al Queda higher ups, and Bin Laden.  They want others to make sacrifices that they themselves would not make.  Namely giving up their own lives for the Jihad.  I would think as a PR tool the President and those in DC would have been all over that, but curiously I've heard nothing mentioned about it other than in this book.<br /><br />Unrelated to this review, I found Dexter Filkins characterization of the book on Wikipedia to be awful, and his comments about it to be very inaccurate and self serving.  For someone of his stature, that is extremely surprising and disappointing.
1610660242|5.0|Great book I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to be successful at starting a new venture! A A A+

0062255657|5.0|Let's just come out with it to start, I love this book. Yes, it is true that I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan anyway, but The Ocean at the End of the Lane made me even more of one. It is a short book and an easy read for most people, but it is a bit hard to classify. By length an narrator, an eleven year old boy, you might be tempted to classify it as a juvenile book, but it is not. By the subject matters dealt with, such as suicide and desire, it is at least Young Adult, if not totally an adult work.<br /><br />It is interesting to me that Gaiman started writing this work as a short story for his wife, Amanda Palmer. He started writing it as a way to, perhaps, explain who he is and why he is the way he is. It is a very personal story to him, one that is anchored around the edges to his own childhood. But it goes beyond that simple story to become a larger tale of people, the universe, and the way things operate. These subjects could come across as heavy handed except for they are approached from the innocence of this little boy, who is a bit lost and more than a bit brave at the same time.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book of light and delight and happy endings, this is not what you need to be reading. But if you are want to explore some of life's larger questions, delve into some of our more hidden emotions, and do so through the un-jaded mind of what might as well be an modern representation of the slightly nerdy, slightly outcast everyman, then this is it.

B0027BOL4G|1.0|This movie is created only to shock the public and not deliver facts.  I was appalled.  It implied that Monsanto is part of the beef industry.  This is not true.  It also never asked the farmers why they broke the contracts they had signed with Monsanto.  It made the farmers appear to be victims of the big corporation but it never asked about the contracts it signed with the big corporation.  When someone breaks a contract, there's a problem.<br /><br />This movie is only sensationalism, not fact-based.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Stumbled across this album by complete accident when I was checking out a local concert venue for upcoming acts.  I spotted 'the Dogs' in an upcoming show and thought, &#34;that guy in the front looks Mike Portnoy&#34;.  Closer inspection of their bio and spotted Billy Sheehan.  Right there I was just about sold without even hearing the record knowing such long-standing veterans would assuredly deliver.<br /><br />Let's just say I was neither wrong, nor disappointed.  Front to back this album rocks with a combination of stellar musicianship, great vocals, hard driving rock songs, and an undercurrent of blues.<br /><br />At $5.00 for the MP3 edition . . . it was a very good day.  Another good day will be in October when I get to see the boys live in San Diego!

B000S1M9LY|1.0|I just tired of two and three page paragraphs.  Author must have been paid by the word.  Parts were interesting, but the chapter breaks didn't seem to make any sense.  This is one of only a handful of books in my entire life that I did not finish to the end.  This book just did not seem to tie together. Parts were good, but not good enough to save it.
0765357151|1.0|This book is absolutely nothing like the movie.  I'm not sure what I expected... but I guess I expected that it would be somewhat similar.  Not even close.  Not even vaguely similar.  The book and movie are completely different.  I know the reason why.  Because the book is terrible.<br /><br />Yes... TERRIBLE.  Stop looking at me that way, you know this book is terrible.  If it didn't suck so much, they would have made the movie closer to the book.  No, I'm not saying the movie was great either, I'm just saying that there is a reason why the writers chose a different path and I suspect it is because the plot of the book was so stupid that they had to.<br /><br />First of all, how do you explain the fact that Neville won't leave his house?  In the book, the vampires know where he is and come out to antagonize him every night.  During the day, Neville can wander the city, collect supplies, kill vampires, etc, but apparently he is too lazy to find another place to hide.  Does this make any sense at all?  No, of course not.  The book addresses this fact and supplies some sort of dumb rationalization for it, but the reality is that it is just stupid to stay in the house.  The movie handles this by having Neville hold up in a house that's location is a secret.  The vampires don't know he is there until they follow him one evening.  That makes a heck of a lot more sense.<br /><br />Second, it takes several months for Neville to figure out that the vampires don't like sunlight?  Seriously?  He uses wooden stakes on them, garlic, mirrors, etc, but for some inexplicable reason he doesn't realize the sun is an issue until a freak accident at the graveyard one day?  Neville knows that they always come out at night, he sets his clock by it, yet at the same time doesn't realize the sun is an issue?  What sense does this make?  I can't fathom how this nonsense was written.<br /><br />Third, anyone clear on exactly what the different kind of vampires are?  Apparently, there are dead vampires, alive vampires, and perhaps some sort of alive vampire that maybe becomes a dead vampire... or something.  Ehhhh... nevermind.<br /><br />Fourth, why don't the vampires do something to destroy Neville's house.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know the book comes up with a stupid explanation that the vampires are brain damaged in some way... or something... by the fever, or disease, or being half dead or something... but it makes no sense.  The long and short of it is that they are chalked up to basically being retarded vampires.<br /><br />However, then of course you have to explain the vampire, Ruth, who is a vampire spy who tricks Neville into taking her in.  She wants to spy on him...ummmmm... for some reason.  Oh yeah, and Ruth apparently got her hands on some spray-on tan that she uses to not look like a vampire.  Oh yeah, and whatever group of vampires she hangs out with has some sort of funny pill they take so they can hang out in the sun.  How'd they figure that out?  Who knows.<br /><br />Well, I guess some vampires must not be retarded because Ruth's group decides the heck with Neville and smashes up his house and takes him captive.  Why?  They need to execute him I guess.  It seems that perhaps Neville is the last human around and now being vampire is \\"normal\\" so all the vampires are now scared of Neville... or something... or whatever.  So the smart vampires, which are not to be confused with the retarded vampires, need to have a public execution of him.<br /><br />The only decent parts of this book involved the dog.<br /><br />Therefore, I am Legend must be inducted into the Hall of Suck!<br /><br />Let the ceremony begin!!!<br /><br />(trumpets)<br /><br />Hear ye, hear ye! (I'm pounding a can of tuna on my desk)...<br /><br />(cue The Alan Parsons Project - Sirius)<br /><br />Whereas I read I am Legend, and<br />Whereas it sucked, and<br />Whereas the Hall of Suck is reserved for books that really suck,<br /><br />I now, hereby, therefore, induct I amLegend into the hallowed Hall of Suck.  So let it be written... so let it be done.<br /><br />(cue Def Leppard - Pour Some Sugar on Me)Legend into the hallowed Hall of Suck.  So let it be written... so let it be done.<br /><br />(cue Def Leppard - Pour Some Sugar on Me)
B000FCKC4C|5.0|My grandson was tasked with reading this book for his summer English project.  So, I read it as well.  Ultimately he and a friend read the book in about two sittings and then we sat down to talk about it and complete the very creative project given them by their English teachers.  Two sixteen year old football players were tremendously moved by this book.  It spoke to them.  The message was simple:  you already have what you need to be happy, look for it.  Simply find that inner happiness, and you can do those things your dream of.  I suppose reading the book and realizing what an incredible allegory it is, is one point.  The experience of reading it with two young men whom others might view as simply teens, priceless.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|A movie that had the potential to be good, but was screwed up by morons.<br /><br />As with many bad films, there are usually a few really stupid things that happen that ruin the movie.  World War Z is one of these films.<br /><br />After Gerry gets his family to the naval group, he is told by the commanding officer that he must lead a team into Zombie infested South Korea or they will kick his family off of the boat.  The purpose of the mission is to provide assistance and protection to a doctor  who is investigating the virus and looking for a cure.  Gerry is basically forced to agree, but the commander reassures him by telling Gerry that he will have the protection of a team of Navy Seals.<br /><br />Given that the zombie apocalypse is going on, I'd assume that a \\"team\\" of Navy Seals would be a large number.  Uhhhh... no.  It turns out to be like two guys.  Seriously, it is like two guys... maybe three at the most.  The world rests on this doctor finding a cure and the best they can do is send a couple dudes with machine guns for protection.  Uhhhhh... anyone else find this stupid.  Wouldn't you send an entire platoon, squad, or whatever?<br /><br />Also, why do they travel to South Korea in a giant cargo plane.  Why?  The cargo consists of the doctor, Gerry, and 2 or 3 Navy Seals.  What the heck do they need a giant cargo plane for?  And did that plane take off from the aircraft carrier?  Do aircraft carriers carry planes that size?  Wouldn't it have been faster to take some jets and refuel them in route?  I don't know, maybe I'm crazy.  Watch the movie and explain to me why the big cargo plane was necessary.<br /><br />So anyway, they land in South Korea with their awesome force of like 4-5 guys and quickly find themselves attacked by zombies.  Lucky for them a garrison is at the base.  Unlucky for them, the doctor trips and falls on the platform exiting the plane and shoots himself dead.  Boom!  Dead.  Uhhhh... why?  The plot of the movie sets up this doctor as the savior only to have him kill himself before he gets off the plane?  If they were going to kill off the doctor, why not have him killed by a zombie?  Wouldn't that have that been more entertaining or more interesting?  Was having him shoot himself after tripping really the best way to do it?  Doesn't this whole thing seem incredibly stupid?  Why set up the \\"doctor\\" character only to kill him shortly thereafter is a very lame and unexciting way?  Am I the only man on earth wondering this?<br /><br />Well, Korea turns out to be pretty lame, so they decide that they better get to Israel because the Israeli's apparently were the first ones to close off their country to keep the zombies out.  Uhhh... except when Gerry arrives he discovers that they really haven't closed off the country.  They are still letting people in.  That doesn't make sense, but whatever.  And where did the giant wall come from?  When did Israel built the walls of Troy around the country?  Or at least around a city?<br /><br />The walls just don't cut it though and the zombies get in, make a mess, etc.  In the middle of the battle, Gerry saves an Israeli soldier (who has been bitten) by chopping her arm off above the bite.  That's cool and everything, but then why does he decide to take her with him?  Sure, the city if being overrun by zombies, but wasn't is a bit odd that Gerry suddenly decides to save a one-armed Israeli soldier?  Uhhhh...<br /><br />But hold on holmes!  I haven't gotten to the two dumbest things yet!  Amazing, I know.<br /><br />Jumping forward in time (after Gerry and the soldier both survive a plane crash which just happens to be walking distance from their WHO destination), Gerry makes his way to some sort of World Health Organization lab.  He needs to get to the viruses in storage, but they must fight through some zombies to get to the vault.  Who goes on this hunt?  Gerry, one dude from the lab, and the one-armed Israeli.  What?  Would you go zombie hunting with a one-armed person?  Heck no.  And what is the number one priority? Stay quiet.  Make no noise.  Ok, so guess what the one-armed Israeli does when she sees a zombie.  Bam!  She shoots him with her pistol.  They took an ax, a bat, and a crowbar in order to be quiet and the first thing she does is pull out the pistol... which the other zombies hear of course.  Shockingly stupid.<br /><br />But to take the cake, it turns out that the way to hide from the zombies is to inject yourself with a lethal pathogen.  The zombies won't attack you if you are already infected with some other nasty virus.  Uhh... Why?  Has anyone been watching the zombies in this movie? Did you see how fast they are?  How they jump people?  How they smash their faces through windows to get at people?  Does it look to you like any of them have time to stop and take a wiff before biting someone?  And why would this zombie virus give a damn?  So what if someone is infected with something else?  Guess what, now you can be infected with a zombie virus too!  Double the pleasure, double the fun.  What - did the zombie virus come up with a way to detect other viruses and then make judgments about how lethal they were?  Chicken Pox no but Measles yes?  Common cold no but Bird Flu yes?  What the heck?<br /><br />Oh - almost forgot!  Earlier in the movie Gerry and his family are joined by a little hispanic kid when they escape Jersey in a helicopter.  How did that kid make it to the roof?  Huh?  The last we saw of him before that was inside his apartment with zombies knocking at the door.  Also, we know that the staircase up to the roof is full of zombies.  So how does that kid get around all of the zombies to make it up there?  Regardless, why does it even matter?  The kid plays no part in the plot whatsoever, so why not just have the zombies eat him?<br /><br />Very poorly done.

B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I really like this new album from The Arctic Monkeys. It's a new sound, a bit slower and rhythmic. Some tracks are just smoother rather than a hard, metal-like feel you get from the previous albums. The writing is good, lots of metaphor as usual and a few tracks make me give it five stars more than anything else. I don't think it's their most 'complete' album, but like I said, there are some tracks that I like so much that this thing warrants a five-star rating from me.

The setting is late World War II, the plot centers around a German spy and the Allies who have to chase him down before he can turn the war in Germany's favor.  A steady pace, precise detail, compelling characters, and interesting narrative techniques create an arresting reading experience.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I loved this game. It started off easy enough, then progressively became VERY challenging, yet not enough to give up! I do wish there was an eraser on the game mode...and I don't know how many times I mistakenly hit the restart button instead of the up/down which drove me CRAZY!! Otherwise, this is a SURE ALLTIME FAVORITE.
B008FOB124|5.0|I am a long time Dead Can Dance Fan and this new release of theirs is worth every penny and more.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good definitions. They were quite detailed. It helped when I read one of my favorite books with words I did not fully understand.
B00F35BV64|3.0|While generally a remake of &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34;, it took a few twists and turns here and there in the story line. My major complaint would be that they again messed with the Star Trek image. The image of the future portrayed in Star Trek is supposed to one where we finally learned from our past mistakes and were better human beings as a result. This movie made it seem that we hadn't. Plus the flagrant violation of the Prime Directive would have been more severely punished, I would think. Otherwise, the film was entertaining and kept you on the edge of your seat.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Best app ever.this app is the best app ever,but it is way to easy.I wish it it was way harder
B0060AY6FO|3.0|As usual with P.D. James, well written, but not sure why she would use a beloved novel to work from. Better left alone<br />..
B00ESY77LO|1.0|This movie spews horrible acting (despite the cast), over-saturated way too colorful cinematography, and if that didn't bring you out of the era the film is based in, the director decided to add Jay-Z to the soundtrack.<br /><br />Its awful. For any one hopeful that this movie is anything worth a lick, please, save your money. Trust me, its not worth the film it was printed on. If you're lucky enough to read this review prior to renting/buying this movie, back out before its too late to claim a refund.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|If you've never seen this film, just do yourself a favor and rent it already.  It is a must watch.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Wonderful!<br />It made me think I was actually there!<br />The ending is the best!<br />Wow<br />Great<br />Magnificent<br />Totally worth reading!!!
0525952926|5.0|This Century Trilogy series is a great work a fiction combined with history facts. If you loved this, you'll love Pillars of the Earth as well.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Great series.  Have watched these boys from the beginning and can never get enough.  If you want fun and a little scary thrill mixed with it...this is your show.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|One of the nicer movies with adult son-mother comedy.  Barbara Streisand has done a wonderful job.  Must see for all viewers..
B002IW8V0E|3.0|The DVD's work as expected but the case is slightly crushed and the LED embellishment on the cover does not work.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Absolutely love, love, love Lee Childs and the Reacher novels. Can't wait for the next adventure. Hope Lee Childs writes quickly!
1932100660|5.0|As a physician, I advise everyone to read this book and follow it's advice. I did. I have lost 15 pounds. My systolic blood pressure is down by 10 points. I feel tremendous. Remember we are a species of apes. Look how strong gorillas are. They mostly eat leaves. Our paleolithic ancestors learned to hunt, but our metabolic machinery did not evolve at the same time. Plants produce free radicals as a result of photosynthesis and have evolved thousands of different antioxidants to protect themselves. We evolved eating plants. Our diets require a large variety of plants in order for us to stay healthy. We are not equipped to handle animal protein, and this is what The China Study makes clear. The China Study showed that the more animal protein you eat, the higher your risk of breast cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and coronary heart disease. In fact it has been shown the coronary disease can be reversed by a vegan diet, and the results far surpass the high tech medical interventions for this disease.  As a country, we simply can't afford medical management of these common diseases that can be prevented by a proper diet.
B008200LHW|4.0|It took a little while to find the correct driver for a Mac, but once it was installed, the unit worked (and continues to work) like a champ. Used it on a sailing trip last weekend and logged over 100 miles with the unit reliably feeding data to the chart plotting software on my Mac. The unit acquires quickly and reports position within seconds.
B00APACSJG|4.0|Cryoburn (The Vorkosigan Saga)<br /><br />Liked it. Not as good as the best but a good book if you like the series.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because the story is so unique and, of course, a great performance by Christian Bale.  He was hard to look at though since he had lost so much weight.  The screenwriter did excellent work at making you feel sympathy for what you think is a peculiar fellow.  The ending jolted me with a huge surprise to the extent I needed to talk about the movie to someone who had seen it.  I would recommend this movie for those who don't mind a dark movie and enjoy a unique story.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Captain Vorpatril's Alliance (The Vorkosigan Saga)<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. One of the better in the series. This character is still junior enough to have adventures that do not have to involve the fate of the planet.
032147404X|4.0|I really like this book because it is helpful to help me use my digital camera.  It has some great ideas.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This has been a really great show from the beginning. The cast works really well together. Casting director deserves credit. The writers make the people all seem really human. It is very well written. I enjoy the insight we get into each one of the characters lives. I hope it never ends but, I know the day is coming.
147674355X|5.0|I don’t even know where to begin with this…. Hopeless is one of the most amazing books I’ve read in the last ten years. Here you meet Sky, typical teenager who’s been home schooled her entire life but convinces her mother she wants to go to high school her senior year to broaden her horizons… She’s lived a life of zero technology – no cell phone – no computer – no TV. Yes, just think about it – she barely knows what texting is and still writes out LAUGH OUT LOUD when something is funny. This is why I love her.<br /><br />She’s spunky – speaks from her heart with no filter and is real. Step in Dean Holder – moving back into town from his father’s, after one of the worst years of his life, Holder is trying to put the fractured pieces of his life back together after loosing 2 of the most important people in his life. When these two meet there is instant chemistry and Sky finally feel’s something – for the first time in her life – she feels something, someone and Holder is going to help her figure it out.<br /><br />Author Colleen Hoover  is one of the most talented, real writers out there today. She writes in a way that you’re in the midst of the conversation – your there – your part of the story – you feel it. She will leave you wanting more, throwing your kindle in exasperation and pleading for the squeal to come out sooner.<br /><br />Hopeless is a stand alone novel, but when she announced that she would be releasing a companion novel; Losing Hope – and that it would be Holder’s story? The interwebs went CRAZY!
B00005RDRO|5.0|All the actors here were perfectly cast and I remember how good it was the first time I saw it back in the late 70s or so.  I was glad that it was out on DVD.  Even if you've never read the mystery novels of all the different authors, you'll still get a kick out of this movie.  Peter Sellers almost steals the show!  Truman Capote was also perfectly cast.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game, play it all the time. Have not had any problems with it on my Kindle fire... I recommend this game...
0783240236|5.0|Buy the collector's edition, because it has interviews with Tippi Hedren (who still is a knockout) and Rod Taylor (no comment), and they show how Hitchcock and the editors and cinematographers created some of those spectacular scenes!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I just wish the energy life would restore faster, since the kindle can do the cheat way.
B00871C09S|5.0|Again, Alfred Hitchcock creates a masterpiece with two of his fave leading actors, Jimmy Stewart & Grace Kelly.  The supporting cast is also superb!  Thelma Ritter, Wendell corey, and of course, Raymond Burr, in the role of the bad guy.  An especially poignant scene and a brilliantly acted scene is when Jimmy Stewart sees Raymond Burr come to Burr's apartment while Grace Kelly is in there.  I won't spoil the surprise, but Stewart is wonderful, as he is helpless in the situation mentioned.  I can't believe there is a human being who HASN'T seen this film, but if you haven't, BUY IT AND WATCH IT!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I love the concept, but  when I tried the alarm, after it had been set for some time, I got a message that it wouldn't work.  Then, a day and a half later, the alarm went off.  Can't figure it out.  I'm not especially savvy about electronics, so the error may have been partly mine . . . I don't know.  I haven't tried it since and don't feel I could rely on it at this point.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I know there are mothers like this.  I loved the humor.  Nice balance between humor and reality.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well written show! Not to mention great acting! So glad not to have commercials interrupting the broadcast! And did I mention Gabriel Macht?
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Easy, entertaining read. First time reading a book by this author but I liked the who done it draw that held my interest throughout the book!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is for use with Apple, Android and USB-Charging Devices.  It is clearly marked which USB plug is for the Android.  I use it for my Galaxy S3 and my Apple IPod (works for all models) and have had both charge without an issue.  It is a smaller and narrower plug than I have used in the past, so fits great in my center console receptacle.  I have used other Anker charging produces and they are made of high quality materials and work great.  The price for this is really reasonable and I would recommend you give it a try.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This is a simple game and I personally don't find it challenging at all. I do however play it occasionally to pass the time.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Brad is a good director, I love the story, and am waiting for the next one.<br />Cinematographer needs an award.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This game is filled with awesome, colorful, graphics.  I haven't found the game to be too challenging or too easy. It is just right...for me. I would purchase any game of this quality.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Read this and you can't stop<br />If you don't read it you'll regret it(:<br /><br />IT'S AMAZING<br />Love this series so much!
B00DU74U74|3.0|Predictable plot, yet mildly entertaining. It seems like a childs movie. I haven't read the book so I can't compare there.
B000VH4OCW|1.0|The re-mixing of the songs in this collection scrape away the baritone and bottom of Stevie Wonder's voice. Here his tonal quality sounds like John Legend's. The collection destroys Stevie's unique, individual timbre. It is very apparent in \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" when the spoken part is clearly in a different timbre than Stevie's singing (yes, speech and singing are different, but the contrast here is obvious.) This is an ego-driven, I-am-the-mix-master-who-loves-Stevie and here is my opportunity to improve on his recording. In doing so, they have erased the compelling, essential quality of his voice, that thick, husky throated fog that give Stevie a thickness to his sound, unmatched by other singers. That harmonic bottom offered a rich of overtones that were like shades of color in a painting. Stevie has a unique tonal palette tied to his emotional expression that enhanced every song he performed.<br /><br />I listened to him on the original recordings. I saw him live. I've been listening to him for 50 years. This subtle cleansing desecrates his legacy and conceals his greatness under the guise of improvement.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Fantastic and timeless story. Wish it didn't have to end so soon!<br />On to another classic now...thank for the free read!
B00DV3A84G|5.0|This CD has everything I look for in an album. I heard Pompeii, like others, thanks to Spotify. It was moment where it took me a few listens to really appreciate how beautifully the music and lyrics worked together. I checked out their other songs from this album, and found that to be true there too. These songs really speak to me where I am in life right now.<br />There are only a couple songs I don't care for (Oblivion, for example) and I usually give 5 stars to albums that completely blow me away backwards and forwards, but it would be a crime to not rate this five stars, because the beautiful songs are just exceptionally beautiful.
B00007E8O5|5.0|When \\"Degradation Trip\\" came out, just months after Layne Staley died, I bought it immediately. It's dark, angry, mournful, remorseful, manic, and absolutely perfect. I had always viewed my connection with Alice in Chains as a connection mainly with Layne. \\"Degredation Trip\\" helped me see that Jerry had a lot more to do with that connection than I realized. Consider it foolish, but I always considered Layne my friend, and I still view his death from that perspective. Jerry's music helped me mourn. Songs like \\"Psychotic Break,\\" \\"Hellbound,\\" \\"Spiderbite,\\" and \\"Anger Rising\\" all provided that anger and metal-like sound that I love so much about AIC, and helped me deal with the anger I felt toward Layne. \\"Angel Eyes,\\" \\"Gone,\\" and \\"Solitude\\" are sad and mournful, and I'd think of how much I missed Layne. \\"Chemical Tribe,\\" \\"Castaway,\\" and \\"Mother's Spinning Her Grave,\\" and \\"S.O.S.\\" have this manic, pleading quality that I always identified with. \\"Siddhartha,\\" \\"Hurts Don't It,\\" and \\"Feel the Void\\" were just dark and beautiful.  I'd listen to all 25 tracks and feel like I had been taken through a full range of emotions. A few times a year I still to the album all the way through. It helps me remember my lost friend, and to appreciate Jerry and the effort he has put into keeping Alice in Chains relevant. I can't help but give the album 5 stars because of what it means to me.  So my rating is not objective, and that is OK with me, because there are few albums that are more important to me than this one is.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I compare this to &#34;Dallas&#34; and &#34;Dynasty&#34;, but set in 1920 England. The best BBC drama i have ever seen!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|The pace of the book and the scale of the final battles were just tops, a great ending to a great series.<br /><br />I will admit I was slightly disappointed witth the final scenes, but that did not make the book any less deserving of the 5 start rating it richly deserves in my opinion.
0670022411|1.0|It's a romance novel. If that is what you enjoy, this one has at least a strange cast of characters. Other than that, it didn't get picked up until it was too late to return it.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I luv this CD.  Its my 4th copy because someone keeps taking mine.  I listen to it in the car, at work, and at home.  I luv her her music!!
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|A hardworking Manhattan psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) prescribes Ablixa, a (fictional) new drug, for his new patient Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara) who has tried to commit suicide. The experimental medication, however, seems to have side effects that could ruin the lives of Emily and those surrounding her including Jonathan.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Emily's previous psychiatrist Dr. Victoria Siebert. Channing Tatum, star of the director Steven Soderbergh's \\"Magic Mike,\\" is Emily's husband Martin, which is a comparatively small but important role here.<br /><br />Soderbergh's entertaining thriller is well-acted and slick enough that it almost makes us forget the implausibility of the whole story. The screenplay of Scott Z. Burns, who has worked with Soderbergh for \\"Contagion\\" and \\"The Informant!,\\" again weaves social issues like pharmaceutical industry into the thriller story, where an innocent protagonist finds him/herself in unusual (and uncomfortable) situations.<br /><br />Of course, this kind of story - some call it Hitchcockian - is nothing new. What differentiates \\"Side Effects\\" is the confident and polished direction of Steven Soderbergh, who manages to keep us interested. Not exactly his best, but \\"Side Effects\\" is still worth watching for its storytelling skills.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This hidden object game has nice crisp graphics. The hidden objects have just enough of a challenge to be enjoyable. I like that I can play timed or untimed. I can also turn the dialogue off if I choose to. I am not finished with my first play through, but I  will play this on many times.
B000002X2B|3.0|This was ordered for my son, Ryan.  did not know he did order it from my computer.  It was for him for his birthday.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|When I try to open this game it will not allow me it just says gameloft and the I can hear the music but no game please fix!!!!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Have seen the movie  on HBO many times.  Love the last song and now it is on my I-Pod.  and many other songs are on my I-Pod.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Very entertaining story.  Gaian has always got vivid descriptions and the story always moves at a good pace.  Intriguing ideas.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up, good picture, very portable. I hope more services add support, but for now Chrome and Netflix are good.
B004J64QSI|4.0|We whole family enjoy the show especially my little 3 years old boy. He even learned to sing the songs!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I was reluctant to watch Now You See Me since it was hovering at 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, but I'm glad my wife and I took a chance on during a lackluster release month. We thought it was much better than its RT rating as it turned out to be a nicely paced thriller. Well, maybe not a 'thriller' in the traditional sense, but it was a good ride.
B005IQZB14|4.0|It brought to mind how different we all are in how we deal with what  happens in our lives. I lost my father at the same time of my life . The author needed to do something extreme, experiencing many healthy , unhealthy , risky things. My grief journey was quieter, far less exciting and yet in the end, we both found peace.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Not a bad version, though I could have been spared some of the awkwardly placed hip-hop; I'm looking at you Jay-Z, specifically the shoehorned '100$ Bill' track during the speakeasy scene. Kudos to Leonardo Dicaprio for a believable Gatsby and to Carey Mulligan for a smart Daisy. Other than that, look forward to a meek-as-ever Tobey Maguire, who was surprisingly case as the lead role.
0131480057|5.0|It is a rare pleasure to hold this wonderfully produced book in your hands and study the 1000+ pages packed with just the right balance of facts and a judicious peppering of opinion. After all, if you didn't want opinion, for example on which scripting tool/language to use or what sort of hard disk to install, you could very well just read the manuals. That's not to say that the book doesn't omit stuff. For example, you won't find a ton of information on AWK, tar, NTP, inetd, or obscure Linux distributions (also, some of the sidebar references are off, e.g. the inetd reference to page 1188 on page 681, for which I blame technology/publishing not authorship). That's because the authors had to make a choice on what to include and to what degree. I applaud the result, which is an encyclopedic treatment of the key flavors of Linux and Unix, especially as they are relevant to production environments. But it doesn't stop there. This wonderful tome goes into great detail to explain all of the related infrastructure technologies including storage, networking hardware, printers, data centers and working smoothly with Microsoft Windows (yeah, no sulking). Finally, this book is extremely relevant to developers because developers must understand (actually master) the environment in which their programs will run. Failing to do so will cause their programs (and their careers) to crash and burn, well before they can finish reciting the multiplication table of 2. I love this book.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Lots of good action and some nice twists and such. A few areas could have been better edited and the \\"alternate timeline\\" thing was irritating. That said, I was entertained throughout the whole movie.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|Love Planet Waves!  One of my favorite albums.  Bought it as a gift for the &#34;Wedding Song&#34; for a couple who were recently married.
B0086449YA|1.0|Well, I was excited to get this, and then it arrived, I popped it in, and .................really?<br />After the third song I wondered just what is the point of writing songs like this? blah, blah, blah.<br />They don't go anywhere, I could have knocked this album off in a week<br />while taking a few naps a day. How about a little effort. Sorry Mark, love your playing mate, and you seem like a great guy.<br />I'll just look forward to the next one. Now I'll go and put on \\"On Every Street\\"...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like that you can go back to the equations you've already done. And you can clear your history.<br />its good I just got it in 2013 when I was doing my math homework .
1423140591|5.0|Both of my kids absolutely love this book. They have read and re-read this one. Must mean this is a good author.
B008PSPNFG|5.0|He always delivers. More stunning guitar playing and as always a story to go along with it.<br />I cant wait for the next one.<br />Always satisfied when it comes to his work.<br />Thank you so much for sharing with us.
B00F35BV64|1.0|This was not Star Trek. In so many ways this movie was a major disappointment. Abrams turned Star Trek into nothing more than a comic book movie.
B001RLP862|3.0|Pros:<br />-Very Durable<br />-Crease Resistant<br />-Easy to wash<br />-Most paper-like plastic card<br />Cons:<br />-Float too easily<br />-Very slippery<br /><br />Holding the deck vertically is near impossible, because the cards are so slippery,  they'll just slip right out. On the other hand, they are very durable, and emulate the paper feel to a degree I have yet to see in plastic cards.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I Highly recommended it for overall athletes, people who likes sports, martial arts, mma, brazilian jiu jit su and anyone looking for motivation
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|Every move brings a pop up for another game.  And it appears that all the games would be pretty much the same concept with different backgrounds.  This seems to be nothing more than a generic money maker that probably wont accomplish the makers goals because most users wont think the game is worth paying for.  I know I don't.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|It was a good movie, glad i didn't pay $12 in the theatre, but it was a good lazy day movie.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|I have been wanting to see this movie for 2 years now and was able to find it here on amazon. I thought this movie was very moving and Temple is an amazing Lady! Five stars from me!
B00F35BV64|5.0|This movie was great! Has some action and a twist that is good at the end. If you haven't watched this movie, I recommend it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Every American should read this so they can see what these service men/women have to go through. If you're the type of person who can put themselves in a book, you will feel the adrenaline rush and anxiety from the suspenseful, unpredictable moments that will leave you unable to put the book down. What we read in such a short amount of time couldn't possibly compare to how long it felt to be there first hand. It really makes you sit and think, and appreciate whole-heartedly what is sacrificed for us. These are the people I aspire to meet one day.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|After watching the show, wanted to get into the meat and potatoes. Interesting to see the turns from the book to the show plots.
