B0055PMURG|1.0|Our soul surfer movie freezes and the pixels on the people get distorted, I called to have the movie removed and get my money back and the rep was a jerk, an treated me like I was stupid, I do the same thing he does for a living and I would be in big trouble if I treated my customers like that
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Funny and heart-warming movie about a video game &#34;bad guy&#34; (from a 1980's era arcade game) who wants to show that he can be a good guy.  My six year old watches it over and over again.  I like to watch it with her.  My daughter, of course, does not remember the old video arcade games like Pac Man, but I do, and those who remember the old classics will enjoy this movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best book series I have read in a while. I enjoyed it so much I have read the trilogy three times!
B00CL68NOG|1.0|This one could have been  really funny, but it explored a dysfunctional relationship between an overbearing mother and a son that couldn't take it to the point where I turned it off. Too sad to watch.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app I am dire every one that has downloaded has something good to say I give it 5 stars
B001HN6918|4.0|We just bought this because I was having a craving to see Kung Fu Panda....however, this one came before the first, so we watched this and found it quite entertaining.  Good humor and good story.  It was more than just about fighting and beating the bad guys.  It included beating the discord within...gaining inner peace.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|GREAT SHOW A+++++++HARD TO STOP  ALL AROUND GOOD COURT SHOW I LOVED IT WE COULD NOT STOP WE WATCH ALL THE SEASONS BACK TO BACK

B004ELSDZK|4.0|The graphics are solid, the game isn't boring...  It's not one that sucks me in to waste hours playing, but for a few minutes at a time it is fairly fun.<br /><br />I did -1 star as I think $1.99 is a bit over priced..  At $.99 it would be a 5 star app...<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />MG

B000JRYOPG|5.0|Seen this movie awhile ago without subtitles and thought it was good. But now that I'm able to view subtitles, I think it's even better. One of my favorite &#34;sreet&#34; genre movies. Put it up there with Menace II Society and Boyz N The Hood.

1452101248|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I have waited so long to discover a fabulous book like this.  It is just sensational.<br />I am looking forward to cooking every single recipe.  I've cooked 2 of the recipes already which were so easy, and so healthy. There are coloured photos for every recipe. Outstanding! Must have book for every vegetarian!  I have Ottolenghi's next book, due out in September, ready and waiting on my Wish List.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is an excellent series. You'll get to know the characters and consider them as friends (or enemies) and you just can't stop watching.
0714864803|5.0|Fabulous recipes. Exactly the type if food we love to eat.  Haven't been able to try any out as the book has only just arrived. Can't wait to cook up a feast. I am rapt to have it in my cookbook collection.
B000W9399S|2.0|I had heard great things about the Diskworld series, and enjoyed Pratchett's Landover novels, so I thought I would give this book a try. I can't say I enjoyed it - the story seemed to skip around, and the humor wasn't quite clever enough to make up for the lack. The only part that was relatively engaging were the characters and the world itself. Based on that, I thought I would try at least one more book before I gave up, and I'm glad I did. The series gets much better after this initial foray.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am not reviewing the series here, but the book, and I fear that the first book of the Diskworld novels doesn't get a high rating. I still have to recommend it, though, for anyone who wants to start on the Diskworld series, since it introduces several key points and characters. This series does get much, much better, as Pratchett's writing clearly improves with practice.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Excellent app with everything right at your fingertips. Ten day, maps, humidity rating for my wife so she knows wether to have a curly hair day or not!
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Well researched discussion of the causes of WW I.  This war arguably was the most important world event in the 20th century.  There have been a number of books written about the causes of this event, but none have the depth this one has.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|So fun building your Jurassic park and stuff like the movie as the people from the movie . Has a under water park as well.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I must admit I've never heard of this movie or the show it was based on.<br />That said I absolutely loved this film.<br />Excellent everything....story, visuals, acting, directing, score...you name it.<br />Now I have to check out the tv show.<br />If you're looking for a sci fi movie that is fresh and unique give this one a spin.<br />Recommended.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I find this a good read for commuting but it is not as gripping as his other books. Grisham has written other mass tort lawyer books and I find he is beginning to repeat patterns. Previous books sounded a little more close to reality and drama in the courtroom was less predictable than this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I enjoy the the Calculator Plus, mainly for the large buttons, it is hands friendly.  This feature comes in handy when you are figuring various amounts.
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|Having heard the hype of the movie and knowing a couple of friends who had read it, I wanted to understand what the fuss was about... what an epic adventure it turned out to be! I couldn't put it down. I could see and feel the characters in a very real universe, and I didn't want it to stop.<br /><br />I don't think I've been as consumed by a book since reading [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game]] for the first time as a teenager!
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|One of the best Trek films to date. Good story and director. The Borg were great in this. At the time a better look for the borg.Also a great supporting cast

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game probably has the best physics of its type. Very fun and attention keeping. I recommend it to all!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I really was not expecting much from this movie, but it turned out to be a great story that not only held the interest of my 3 year old twins, it held my interest as well. Again, another movie I bought as a digital download from Amazon, so no more scratched DVD's or Blu Rays!
1575666286|4.0|I haven't read it yet, but it certainly looks like a good book.  The shinny finish, on the cover is nice.
B0000047CW|5.0|I first heard this album in the mid-1980s when I was running a used record store in Florida. I didn't know samba from Sambo, and had only a vague idea of who Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd were at the time, but after playing the LP a few times I was hooked. This music was unlike anything else I was listening to at the time (classic rock, alternative rock, vintage soul, etc.) but it really struck a chord. Irresistable and magical tunes, the kind that truly evoked a unique mood and atmosphere. I played the record to death and have done likewise with my old CD copy. This music just never gets \\"old\\" or boring. A classic in the truest sense of the word. You don't have to be a jazz fan to enjoy this, just let the music play and let it soak into your consciousness. Laid back and lovely.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun fun I like playing it. so life like.  with webcould win gems faster or more items could be obtained with coins
B009NY43NY|4.0|I read the reviews of \\"Dead Ever After\\" before I read the book.  I expected to be disappointed but I am not.  I do not believe Me. Harris used a ghost writer, but, rather in, her last several books has been removing Sookie from the vamp lifestyle.  This book finished that task and allowed Sookie to return to as normal life as she could possibly have.  Due to Sookie' s upbringing and Christian beliefs, she would have become miserable devoting her life to Eric or Bill.  Rather she found love with a man who emulated her beliefs.  I don't feel that Eric was allowed to turn into a vampire \\"softie.\\"  As you read the book, everything Eric did is to benefit Eric and that's the way it has always been.  So I believe that Ms. Harris ended the series the only way possible; for Sookie to return to a somewhat normal life.
111846446X|5.0|Being a new Linux user and novice with the Raspberry Pi, I found this book very helpful.  Written by one of the designers of the Pi, it addresses the hardware and software questions that inevitably arise with new users.  Even if you're an old hand at Linux, the portions of the text which have to do with architecture and I/O will be indispensable.  The introduction, which includes a brief history of the Pi, is also very interesting.  This is an important &#34;accessory&#34; to the Pi.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|One of the most significant and convincing book on the subject of the after-life that I have read.  Very well written.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard about this book from a lot of my friends.  And, yes I have great friends.  A great book that is thrilling, unexpected, and so sexy.  I have been all over my husband after reading this book.  The dynamics of the relationship is so forthcoming.  A character that is refined, and eventually displays here strength to have and get what she wants.  A ravishing, handsome guy that can do what he feels he can do.  This couple will be interesting to continue to read about.  And, yes I would suggest this to my friends.  The mature sexual content is what some can read about, rather than experience that first hand.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book full of twists and turns. The story will keep you g es sing until the very end. Bring it in your beach bag.

1476734941|5.0|So I have to admit I did not buy the book. My husband and I saw the documentary and it caught our attention. I am a pretty good cook, so I am winging recipes, and looking on the Internet for ideas. We have been on the diet for 3 months. My husband who is 5'9&#34;, before we started, weighed 220, today is 199. I am 5'7&#34; and before weighed 145, am down to 135. I did not have much to loose, and have made it to the weight I wanted to get to. I see my husband loosing a few more pounds. It was hard at first, I would say the first 2-3 weeks of fasting days were difficult. It is easier today, but I do get grumpy on fasting days(if I am going to honest) and do not look forward to them. I actually make pretty tasty dishes, and my husband has told me he has Jenny Craig cooking for him as his personal chef! We checked with our doctor before we started, and he said he had no problem with the plan. Overall, we are happy with this, and plan to continue maybe for the rest of our lives?
1451695195|5.0|I like Dr. Alexander's honest way of writing about his life before his time in heaven. His experience is worth reading about. His family and friends were very good to keep the hope up that he was alive. What a sad time for all of them while he was having the time of his life in heaven.<br />He is right in saying that his experience was different than others but it still was just what he needed.<br />This is a very good book.

B0042TV4IW|4.0|For those who like Dowton  Abbey or any of the BBC shows this is a must see. I at first was trying to place the PostMistress Dorcas Lane... well she is the actress who played Saffy on Absolutey Fabulous, Julia Sawalha. She is one  of the supporting actors but  in my view is the main. The rest of the characters are very good too however all in all I much preferred Cranford with Judi Dench.

It's soo lively each song really connects with you on another level.  It's really a journey listening every time.  BUY it!
0783219695|3.0|I'm disappointed that a 'Special Edition' version of this spectacular movie would have hours of extras, but a main feature that is missing various scenes. This is one of my all-time favorite movies - it is not only brilliantly done, historically interesting and superbly acted, it's an excellent study in management and problem solving in a crisis situation. The extras are indeed worth having, but since I know the movie so well, the missing scenes detract from viewing it for pleasure.<br /><br />Fortunately, I purchased it 'used,' at quite a bargain, and the extra features are good enough that I plan to keep it. But had I purchased it new, I would be very upset. I have the DVD version rather than BlueRay, so I can't speak to those problems. But due to the cut/edit scenes, I can only give it three stars.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Watched Up today for the first time in years (maybe since it first came out), and my memory of it has shifted somewhat. I still think the movie's strength is in the first 15 minutes or so, but the ending is more effective and emotional than I had remembered.<br /><br />Up is a strangely unique film in that it has very well-defined characters, but not a very engaging storyline. The two heros, Carl Fredericksen and Russell, are brought to life so vividly and organically, they are literally three-dimensional personalities.<br /><br />Russell, one of the most delightful creations to come out of Pixar Animation Studios, is perhaps more interesting because so much of his tragic backstory is hidden, and we hear just pieces of it. He throws in comments like how his father doesn't have time for him anymore, or how his mother won't let him have a pet, but these clearly sad circumstances are expressed with the earnestness and surface-level indifference that a young boy would have in real life.<br /><br />Where the movie lets us down is in its overall narrative; there are many amusing scenes with the exotic \\"snipe\\" bird Kevin and the talking dog Dug, but the whole conflict surrounding Carl's childhood hero Charles Muntz is, to me at least, not particularly interesting or compelling. It seems to slow down the \\"real\\" story, of Carl and Russell, rather than contribute to it.<br /><br />Fortunately, this doesn't take up too much of the movie - the last 15 minutes or so bookends the stellar opening with their life back in the city, and how their friendship continues even after their adventure. Up, at times, is painfully moving and emotional, which unfortunately gets lost in some extraneous narrative. It's worth sticking through, though, for the satisfying ending.

B006YW6KX4|4.0|The 1950s present a very unique crossroads in the American perception of youth. The whole conception of teen-agers and adolescents as their own distinctive demographic was still fairly fresh (a product of the post-World War II era), a tension highlighted by the shifting culture of film and art during that time. The classical era of Hollywood was starting to fade away and grittier, arguably more realistic film was moving in.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine films like Picnic and Rebel Without a Cause being about the same species, let alone the same demographic and being released in the very same year. Rebel kicked off the new wave of adolescence in film as a tortured, disturbed perspective on American life, while Picnic was with the older school of thought, of classical beauty and imagery.<br /><br />While more romantic (and hopelessly idealistic), Picnic is just that: an absolutely beautiful movie. Much like East of Eden (another small-town, youth epic from 1955), Picnic is the story of a young hero trying to win over the girl and the approval of his fellow countrymen. Like most classical teen films, there is plenty of melodrama, but the film is shot in an almost transcendental manner. We are given sweeping shots of the young couple, silhouetted against the Kansas City twilight sky. They could be anybody, anywhere, at any time.<br /><br />Picnic seems less concerned with the action of its primary characters than it is to raise fundamental questions. (Honestly, not that much happens in this movie.) Instead, it provokes questions of fate, how much control we have in our own lives, and lost opportunities. In one of the more tragic storylines, one couple puts off pursuing marriage for years and years, only to eventually follow through but for the wrong reasons. At what point do our dreams become facades? How much can (or should) we change for the people we love?<br /><br />For any classical Hollywood film (let alone a youth-oriented one), these are very heavy questions to ask. Particularly in the post-war era, this film reflects the growing cynicism and sense of regret that became later associated with counterculture and other reactive youth culture (like Rebel).<br /><br />In addition to a solid story, the film also gives us a wonderful ensemble cast, led by the miscast (but still fantastic, as always) William Holden and the stunning Kim Novak in a spellbinding love story. This is a very important, and often forgotten, epic youth film ripe with nostalgia and passion.to ask.

B002C949KE|4.0|I found this book worth reading and enjoyable. In some of the experiments I feel that there were factors that should have been examined but were looked over and some had obvious conclusions, but overall they were well thought out and insightful. A large portion is mainly focused on marketing, business, and consumerism. But there are also other social factors examined that involve money but aren't necessarily business oriented, then there are a few chapters about honesty and various other social concepts.
B003KGBISY|5.0|After seeing Seven Samurai, I now consider myself a Kurosawa fan. I was first impressed by the groundbreaking Rashomon, most noteworthy for its visionary storytelling techniques. While Seven Samurai follows a more straightforward narrative, it is an excellent epic rich with meaning and emotion, earning its hearty 3 1/2 hour length.<br /><br />First and foremost, Seven Samurai just tells a great story. The basic premise is that a rural Japanese village is being ransacked by bandits, and upon the advise of the town elder (the Old Man), they seek the aid of samurai to defend them.<br /><br />As the film's title suggests, it is as much about the samurai as it is about the community. Each man brings a different set of experiences to his mission, and the ways in which they mesh or conflict with the townspeople are what bring the movie its true fire. We experience issues like class conflict, and the tension between loyalty to one's own versus the community.<br /><br />We are given an extraordinary performance by Toshiro Mifune (star of Rashomon), as a wild and coarse samurai. His acting is consistently entertaining and, while his role is not as twisted as that in Rashomon, he is still very fun to watch and he really gets a chance to prove his emotional range through this film.<br /><br />While the script's structure is not as groundbreaking as Rashomon, the overall atmosphere and mood Kurosawa establishes is often dark and unsettling, creating a distinct and somewhat surprising mood. (Granted, as someone who is used to the classical Hollywood tradition, most Japanese films surprise me.) The treatment of women, for one, is often a very unique element throughout the film; there is a difficult scene in which a farmer forcibly cuts the hair of his daughter, for fear that she be found by the bandits and captured, or worse. When the bandits do come to town, the male villagers round up the women and essentially cage them, forcing them to watch their husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons fight the more aggressive and better-equipped bandits from the sidelines.<br /><br />These battle scenes are particularly unsettling, as they are very realistic and un-glamorous, providing a fresh interpretation of the often too-sleek samurai story. There is no glory in these battles, filled with cheating (even the most honorable samurai steals a musket from the bandits) and desperation as both sides are crawling through the rain and mud fighting for their lives.<br /><br />That is what is so extraordinary about this film; the setting may be another time and place, but it was impossible for me to watch without wondering what I would do in that situation. We see ordinary people pushed to do what they have to do to protect themselves and their own. At the end of the day, the townspeople are able to reclaim their land back as their own. The samurai, tragically, do not, as the survivors stand in solace at the graves of their fallen brothers. The leader says the victory is the townspeople; the samurai, however, have failed.<br /><br />Seven Samurai is full of profound statements and often difficult emotions and situations to grapple with. The film may be easy to follow, but it is anything but certain how to weigh the moral uncertainties Kurosawa presents us with. This Japanese epic is an extraordinary film that is worthy of its ambition.nd sons fight the more aggressive and better-equipped bandits from the sidelines.<br /><br />These battle scenes are particularly unsettling, as they are very realistic and un-glamorous, providing a fresh interpretation of the often too-sleek samurai story.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|The newest Disney animated feature Wreck-It Ralph centers on a video game \\"bad guy,\\" Ralph, who was programmed to wreck things but yearns to someday play the hero. In the previews, I admittedly thought this premise a cheesy one and a pale comparison to the technological existentialism of the TRON series.<br /><br />Fortunately, as with the past several Disney animated classics, I was wrong. Wreck-It Ralph is more about socially constructed labels and how we can overcome them. Only we can define ourselves, and it is never to late to change our actions to become a better person. I honestly found this to be one of the better and more meaningful messages from a Disney movie. It wasn't about Ralph being victimized or being outcast, as much as it was him proactively seeking a better way of life.<br /><br />In terms of its pure content, Wreck-It Ralph is a very funny and creative adventure through the world of video games. I am by no means a gamer, but I could still recognize and enjoy the different styles of games that Ralph explores. Some of the biggest laughs came from the character Sgt. Calhoun, the soldier protagonist of the fictional game Hero's Duty. As one character describes, \\"she has the most tragic backstory\\": her wedding was interrupted by an alien robot breaking into the church and killing her would-be husband. The entire audience, of mostly adults at my midnight premiere showing, was dying of laughter!<br /><br />While the movie runs a bit long, it is still a lot of fun and delivers a very powerful message. The last 15 minutes or so are emotionally powerful, as the threat of loss and sacrifice put the characters' lives at stake. Each of the characters transcend what they were programmed to do, to carry out actions and relationships that they know in their hearts are right. As the \\"bad guys\\" repeat at their focus group, \\"I am bad, and that's good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me.\\"

B00A81NFAS|5.0|In a ho-hum year for American cinema, Silver Linings Playbook gleams out of the dull woodwork as a modest film about people with modest ambitions, told at such a painfully honest level that it rises above as the best film of 2012.<br /><br />The straightforward narrative, of a middle-aged man living with his parents and dealing with bipolar disorder, is enhanced through superb performances and powerful imagery. Bradley Cooper (who I'm usually not a fan of) giving a daring and moving performance as the protagonist, Jennifer Lawrence as the heartbreaking but electrifying heroine, and Robert De Niro as the well-intentioned but pathetic father lead the extraordinary cast in this tragicomedy. All three start off the film recovering from bad places in their lives, and try to build them back up.<br /><br />Reconstruction proves difficult, emphasized in moments like Cooper's character moving home, seeing his brother's picture hanging on the wall while his own has been taken down and is leaning on a table. Lawrence's character (in one of several memorable monologues) tells of having to constantly give all of herself, only to receive nothing back. While the circumstances the characters face are more extreme than most of us will face in our lifetimes, they hint at positions we have all had to grapple with, in varying degrees of questioning one's own self-worth.<br /><br />This film all seems to take place within several square miles. The characters' dreams are not impossible ones. The biggest ambition seems to be getting a 5 out of 10 at a dance competition, an underwhelming feat that provides one of the film's biggest laughs. Yet despite the understated attributes in the content of the film, the final product and emotional impact are profound and powerful, giving audiences one of the most rewarding and moving comedies in recent years.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Being a huge Lana fan I am surprised I didn't buy this sooner! Great follow up from her last album. I just wish there were more songs! I would definitely recommend this to a Lana del Rey fan or even a first time buyer of her music.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|This is actually one of the first (maybe the first?) new album I've heard in 2013, and I am happy to say it is a very good one. Dawes' sound on the record Stories Don't End is one of my favorite \\"genres,\\" a rich guitar sound that is reminiscent of 70s rock n roll and faded photographs of California.<br /><br />Their sound and energy, however, are anything but worn out. The soundscape Dawes create is lush and warm, perfect for a summer night (and its Spring Break release date doesn't hurt, either). They use clever, witty lyrics (\\"When did I decide to grow this beard and gut?\\") that are both thoughtful but unpretentious. There is intelligent songwriting, especially the multilayered \\"Something in Common,\\" which can be about an ex, infidelity, or countless other problems based on your reading of it. We also get fun, summer-ready flare like in \\"Hey Lover,\\" which is bound to be a fan favorite and likely a single for its catchy rhythm which invites us to clap along with it.<br /><br />Stories Don't End is a gorgeous record to listen to, from the chords of the opening song \\"Just Beneath the Surface\\" to its stripped-down reprise as the last track. Not all of the songs are exactly memorable, but it provides for great listening and is easily addictive. Dawes recalls Sky Blue Sky-era Wilco in their sultry, bluesy guitar and gives us a wonderful album to get us through summer 2013.

B00AFEYUVG|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is unique in that it demands a second viewing, despite being a simple, minimalist narrative built more on nuances and the passage of time than a mind trip piece like Donnie Darko.<br /><br />It starts at a deliberately slow pace, telling of a young man entering high school shy and friendless, and eventually becomes accepted into a hip and interesting social circle. Some of it feels a little too on the Juno side, constantly name-dropping \\"cool\\" bands as an initial means to bring the characters together. While this plot device gets old fast, it does feel authentic albeit tiring by the end. We get it, you make each other mix tapes.<br /><br />What the film does very well is represent the frustrations of ourselves, our loved ones, and the choices we make. The characters fight, experiment with drugs, and fall in love with the wrong people. There is a powerful quote that, when it comes to romance, \\"we accept what we think we deserve.\\"<br /><br />Flashes like this are when the movie works at its best; at its core, it is really a tragic story, and these people don't have any meaning in their lives beyond that which they create for themselves. We see these people as fully developed, flawed human beings, whose past actions shape their behavior in the present.<br /><br />A disturbing revelation at the end explains the protagonist (excellently played by newcomer Logan Lerman) and the weight he has carried for years. Even before his past is explained, his acting choices make it clear that there is something terribly wrong. We also get superb and well-rounded performances from Emma Watson (despite her so-so American accent) and Ezra Miller as the two mentor figures who take Lerman's character in.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a powerful existentialist look at the adolescent experience. It has a slow start and falls into some high school movie cliche, but the insight it provides is unmatched by most other films about youth.

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Can you make a good movie from a bad script? Yes, and that movie is called Zero Dark Thirty.<br /><br />Most of the film is the informative, though poorly told, story of a young woman at the CIA whose job and obsession is to find Osama Bin Laden. We are given vital pieces of information, and experience the frustrations, of this global manhunt. Along the way, unfortunately, the petty `n' plucky heroine has to constantly assert herself as correct. She just thinks something is so, and then it becomes right. She is so infallible that it is both exhausting and eye-rolling to watch her. She is also so arrogant it makes her impossible to root for; in the film's most ludicrous line, she states that she believes her colleagues died and she survived because she is \\"meant\\" to find Bin Laden. What?<br /><br />Fortunately, it all comes together in the last 30 minutes or so. The climax, a retelling of the operation that killed Bin Laden, is so well told and thrilling that it almost makes up for the rest of the film. Better yet, the information we were told throughout the film (what is Bin Laden's complex like? who will be there?) helps orient us during what is an otherwise dark and jerky sequence. This was a prime example of quality filmmaking, which most of the movie could not live up to.<br /><br />There has been much controversy over the film's torture sequences; I personally did not find much stock in them, but that is up to the viewer to decide. What I found interesting was how it didn't seem to take much for interrogators to resort to waterboarding; whether that is fiction or fact, I don't know.<br /><br />Which is what makes my critique of the film a bit reserved - without knowing the facts, I don't know how far I can criticize the film. Maybe Jessica Chastain's character really was right, all the time, always. Even if she was, though, that's not how you make a movie. I like my protagonists with a touch of fallibility, and Zero Dark Thirty does not meet this base requirement.nt.

B0067EKYVI|4.0|Like the tragic characters and stories that light up the screen and wrench up our hearts, The Great Gatsby 2013 film adaptation is almost more devastating for how great it could have been. Baz Luhrmann's film is a very, very good one. But it is not great.<br /><br />The performances are excellent. Reviews have been somewhat mixed on Leonardo DiCaprio, but I think he gives us a perfect Gatsby, who pairs beautifully with the always-exceptional Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, rounded out by the superb Tobey Maguire, in one of his first noteworthy roles in years.<br /><br />Luhrmann has achieved something few film adaptations of classic literature have; he has taken a work, the F. Scott Fitzergerald novel, which is of course rich with symbolism and meaning, and maintained all these complex themes that your high school English teacher beat into you, without feeling remotely forced or condescending. He allows the audience to reach their own conclusions, both about the characters (particularly Gatsby and Daisy, whom polarize audiences in both their novel and film representations) as well as the iconic symbolism (THE GREEN LIGHT, T.J. Eckleberg).<br /><br />This is where The Great Gatsby succeeds the most; when taking the source material at its most shallow surface, the story could be represented just as carelessly and giddy as the characters pretend to be. Yet, behind every line and every action, there is an air of tragedy, and Luhrmann knows how to bring that out to great effect.<br /><br />Luhrmann also does what he usually does best, through the noticeably anachronistic soundtrack. The setting may look like the 1920s, but it sure doesn't sound like it, with an urban soundscape rich with beats by Jay-Z and a haunting love theme by Lana Del Rey.<br /><br />While Luhrmann employs many of his old tricks, they do not feel as over-the-top or cinematically overwhelming as they could be taken in other films. I love Moulin Rouge with all my heart, but the fast editing and goofy humor could understandably turn some audiences off; The Great Gatsby feels so much more grown-up, as a Luhrmann film free of the cartoonish qualities that may have dampered his prior works.<br /><br />Where the film disappoints though is through its pacing, especially towards the end; the scenes, while visually stunning and often emotionally compelling through the stellar performances and soundtrack, but so much of film's motion is through mood, not action, which weighed me down by the end of this 2 1/2 hour epic. There are also some odd choices with visual effects, which you will likely know when you see them (re: the film's narrative structure).<br /><br />These slight disappointments make me hesitant in my review of this film; much of it, particularly the scene when Gatsby and Nick Carroway make their deal, and the montage of Gatsby and Daisy reunited, are excellent and still stick with me long after leaving the theater. These kinds of moments are Baz Luhrmann at his best, and I wish The Great Gatsby, for all the time and effort put into it, was as sharp as these glorious scenes in the middle were.<br /><br />It is still a very good movie and I recommend seeing on the big screen in gorgeous, colorful 3D. I will likely be revisiting The Great Gatsby and am anxious to see how my opinion develops as my relationship with this film continues through repeat viewings. But for now, I can only go so high as four stars.y humor could understandably turn some audiences off; The Great Gatsby feels so much more grown-up, as a Luhrmann film free of the cartoonish qualities that may have dampered his prior works.<br /><br />Where the film disappoints though is through its pacing, especially towards the end; the scenes, while visually stunning and often emotionally compelling through the stellar performances and soundtrack, but so much of film's motion is through mood, not action, which weighed me down by the end of this 2 1/2 hour epic.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Downloaded it on a whim, was surprised how fun it was. Definitely worth the two bucks. Took me four and a half hours to complete.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is one of the (sadly) few films that commands multiple viewings. I won't spoil any of the plot details but it's one of those movies where everything comes together at the very end, practically forcing you to re-watch again and again. I first watched this when I was a pre-teen and rediscovered it last Spring Break. Since then I've seen it about ten times and I still discover new things every time I watch it.<br /><br />When I re-watched it tonight, I found several new details: a woman asks her neighbor for her hold lamp back (possibly linking her to a web of crime), a man's associated with a cup of coffee at a dinner party (which comes into play earlier in the film). At face value it may not sound like much, but this movie is a wild psychosexual ride through the dreams and desires of a young Hollywood hopeful. Every individual and every detail comes into play and manifests itself in intriguing and significant ways.<br /><br />What I appreciate so much about this film, and its filmmaker David Lynch especially, is that it rewards multiple viewings. On the surface the movie is two unrelated mini-films, with a handful of cross-references, but you gather more clues and piece together more and more of the puzzle with each additional viewing. I can't pretend I understand Mulholland Drive 100% but I come closer every time I watch it.<br /><br />Even taking aside the mesmerizing storytelling and unique structure, this movie is nonetheless entertaining and thrilling. It can best be described as a neo-noir thriller, though it is at times terrifying (with the scariest scene I've ever watched, I can't even look at the screen) and heartbreaking. It also has what may be the healthiest and most honest love story I've seen at the movies.<br /><br />What makes Mulholland Drive so exceptional is its metafictional self-awareness. At its core, it is a mystery involving two women, one grappling with amnesia and the other a rising Hollywood actress. It plays with all the standard Hollywood cues we've seen for decades: the femme fatale, the wide-eyed optimist, the cynical Hollywood elite, and many others; but the way the action plays out distorts the grasp you think you have on the story.<br /><br />It initially clings to all the rules of Hollywood only to break them halfway through; the film hinges on a haunting scene at a nightclub where the emcee emphasizes that everything they are hearing is a tape recording; it is all an illusion. From this pivotal moment, all bets are off, as the film throttles in a totally different direction and plunging the characters into a gritty and seedy Hollywood underworld and an ultimately tragic conclusion.<br /><br />This fantastic manipulation with the audience's expectations and the immeasurable depth of the colorful Hollywood the characters reside in bring me back to this movie every month or so. I can never turn down another trip up Mulholland Drive.ywood cues we've seen for decades: the femme fatale, the wide-eyed optimist, the cynical Hollywood elite, and many others; but the way the action plays out distorts the grasp you think you have on the story.<br /><br />It initially clings to all the rules of Hollywood only to break them halfway through; the film hinges on a haunting scene at a nightclub where the emcee emphasizes that everything they are hearing is a tape recording; it is all an illusion.

B008ZENVNG|5.0|I can't even begin to say what a great surprise The Hunger Games was. Having recently finished the novel, I had concerns over how the film would adapt the first-person narrative, filled with introspection by the protagonist Katniss Everdeen and flashbacks to earlier in her life. What's great about the movie: they didn't try to do that.<br /><br />Instead, we have a remarkably directed, almost dreamlike flow through the story. The film travels briskly from scene to scene, organically blending in backstory that is easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. Rather than filling in the exposition through explanation, as the novel does, we are given the dystopic scenario and the formation of the Hunger Games through news broadcasts of the current year's Games. None of this feels forced or even too heavily reinforced.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is the rare film for children / young adults that trusts that the audience is an intelligent and mature one. It counts on the audience to pay attention, as names and details fly by in quick succession. There is very little sweet or sugarcoated about this world, and the movie doesn't bother to dwell on that. The color palette is filled with bleak greys and blacks, with some very intense sequences of violence (which honestly made me wonder how on earth this movie scraped past an R rating and instead earned a PG-13).<br /><br />In addition to its disturbing content, this film is also noteworthy for its strong performances. Jennifer Lawrence (as always!) is fantastic as the lead character, and pairs well with her semi-love interest Josh Hutcherson, who also gives a well-restrained and believable performance.<br /><br />Following in the tradition of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Hunger Games is so effective because it feels as authentic as it possibly could. Given the fantastical elements that are embedded in the story, everything else, from the characters' dialogue, the scenery, and even the wobbly first-person camera work, ring true.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is an excellent start to what I hope will be a solid film series. It is such an unusual concept for a major studio to pursue, and I welcome its confidence to present a film experience that is disturbing, harsh, and most importantly, believable., ring true.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is an excellent start to what I hope will be a solid film series.

B00BAYLRNO|4.0|Disaster movies usually have a two-pronged challenge: to make a believable film, and to make an effective film. The surprisingly good The Impossible achieves both, through amazingly realistic sets and special effects and through the intense family drama of the narrative.<br /><br />It recounts the true story of a Spanish family of tourists in Thailand for Christmas 2004, right as the devastating tsunami that affected thousands hit the shores. These scenes, which actually hit pretty early on the film, are very frightening and come about as close as I can possibly imagine the true experience of living through a tragedy like that could be. The sheer force of water plunging characters below, paired with the pounding sound design (with one character momentarily deafened) contribute to the sense of horror that these characters, and real people, had to face.<br /><br />In addition to the sheer technical feat of successfully recreating such a massive and devastating event, The Impossible succeeds by telling the story of a disaster so well. Like with other mass tragedies, such as the Holocaust, the bombing of Hiroshima, and many others, it is nearly impossible for any of us to fathom the loss and devastation behind the staggering numbers of fatalities. The Impossible doesn't try to do that. It follows in the tradition of other great disaster movies by focusing on a handful of people, in this instance a family, making the tragedy something we can relate to and empathize with.<br /><br />This is also where the movie gets its strong suit. Sure, it's about the tsunami and the devastating effect it has on Asia, but the disaster is over 30 minutes into the film. The bulk of it, and the emotional punch of this film, is how this family and those affected in a broader sense, deal with this catastrophe. The Impossible is, at its core, a testament to the ability of a family to maintain hope and love in the most dire of circumstances. It is a less hyperbolic version of Poltergeist (a movie which I frankly don't like), to test the love of a family against true, devastating events.<br /><br />We get great performances all around, especially from Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, and fresh face Tom Holland as the family's eldest son. The Impossible is definitely one of the better movies of 2012 and serves as a nice spiritual companion to Beasts of the Southern Wild as a film about disaster and how the human spirit maintains strength even when facing the most dire of circumstances.vie which I frankly don't like), to test the love of a family against true, devastating events.<br /><br />We get great performances all around, especially from Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, and fresh face Tom Holland as the family's eldest son.

B0072GPQ72|5.0|I can't believe I waited almost a year to see this. I was unexpectedly surprised and very satisfied with Spielberg's latest film (his best since Catch Me If You Can a decade ago), based on the critically-acclaimed play of the same name.<br /><br />It has a charming enough beginning and premise: a young man takes in an injured horse and trains him to plow, hoping to raise enough money to save his family's farm. As World War I breaks out, however, the family is forced to sell the horse and the movie truly begins.<br /><br />While I expected a standard narrative, the film functioned in a much more interesting way: the horse passed between different parties, British and German soldiers, a young French girl, and others throughout the course of the war. I won't give any spoilers but the ending is incredibly moving and satisfying.<br /><br />The movie seems to drag on during the second hour (clocks in at almost 150 minutes), but the payoff is well worth it. The wide variety of characters are able to come together in a believable scenario, illustrating how much the horse and the war has changed all of them.<br /><br />It is in this last ten minutes or so that the film truly blew me away; the characters gave incredibly stirring speeches, evoking themes of sacrifice, loss, and redemption.<br /><br />In addition to the wonderful emotional power of this film, it is also very well shot and produced. The stunning imagery is often reminiscent of Gone With the Wind, of characters in desperate situations silhouetted against a fiery orange sky. Their identities aren't what matters; it is the extraordinary circumstances they face and how they meet those circumstances that make this a genuinely heartfelt and inspirational work.

B003NHRIVQ|4.0|Let me preface this review by insisting that The Last Song is kind of trash. It is not your everyday studio film, but rather more closely resembling something from the same nest that Lifetime movies are hatched from. It's perfect viewing for a lazy afternoon or a rainy day, but not your typical A-billing feature to impress your friends with.<br /><br />The first half is actually laugh-out-loud bad. It follows a predictable narrative, two kids from a broken home leave their mother's home to spend a summer with their father. The situations and dialogue feel weirdly familiar, probably because we've seen and heard them all before. The sullen, rebellious teen daughter sulks around and runs into the local hunk, who is of course shirtless. The father is clueless about how to raise kids and jokes about the \\"handbook\\" of paternity. The young son (who is a lousy actor, by the way) raises his eyebrows excitedly at everything, because I guess someone told him that's how you act.<br /><br />Halfway through, though, The Last Song unexpectedly yet satisfyingly switches gears. I don't want to spoil much, but the movie shifts to a more realistic and tragic direction. We get some great moments between Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear, filled with sincerity that is lacking throughout the mostly over-the-top script.<br /><br />At its heart, The Last Song could elevate from being an entertaining time-killer movie to being a pretty good or even very good one. It has an engaging enough story, but is weighed down by a terrible script and kind of lousy direction. The opening and closing credits look as though they were made using Windows Movie Maker, and the editing is often awkward and you constantly feel as if you are watching a movie - the illusion of reality very rarely fools the audience.<br /><br />I would probably only recommend this movie to the most hardcore of Miley Cyrus fans, simply for fear that most viewers wouldn't have the patience to sit through the disastrous first hour. For all prospective audience members, however, it is a movie worth sitting through, even if it takes a while to actually get good. The Last Song offers a surprisingly painful yet believable ending that makes up for the wannabe Lifetime flick that precedes it.ll prospective audience members, however, it is a movie worth sitting through, even if it takes a while to actually get good.

B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Ang Lee's latest film Life of Pi is a visually stunning and breathtaking experience. It is one of the few films that, in my opinion, is actually better suited for 3D than boring ol' 2D, and is perfect to experience in the movie theater rather than Netflixing in a couple months.<br /><br />Pi is so impressive because it is consistently entertaining and surprising for two or so hours, surprising for a plot that doesn't have much action. It does follow a pretty standard Hero's Journey format, with some pretty sad (but not tear-jerking) moments. By the end, it becomes clear that almost every scene is necessary (save the love story that goes nowhere). Plus, it borrows from Big Fish in that much of what REALLY happened is left open to interpretation, and I like to see that in big-budget movies. It is far too infrequent that we get films that generate engaging discussion among audiences, and I am happy that Life of Pi gives us that opportunity.<br /><br />The film's strongest suit, as you've no doubt heard, is its visual effects. The best effects, in my opinion, are always those which blur the line between what is real (physical) and what is not (CGI), and Life of Pi provides consistently jaw-dropping and convincing images that are hard to forget. The camera work is exceptional as well, with non-traditional shots and transitions. Some of the most memorable are bird's-eye shots, overlooking the protagonist Pi and the tiger Richard Parker floating in the sea, at a perfect 90-degree angle.<br /><br />As much of a visual and intellectual treat as Life of Pi is, it is hard for me to imagine Academy members and audiences regarding it as the best film (not just one of the best films) of 2012. I absolutely liked it, hands down - but in a year with emotional powerhouses like Silver Linings Playbook, Brave, and many other movies that left a stronger impression on me, it is really a far cry from Best Picture 2012.

B00AHTYGRW|3.0|Argo is the interesting, if not exceptionally engaging, true story of a CIA operation to recover six American hostages in Iran during the 1980s. While the details of the mission are often surprising and interesting, history is against this film, as we all know today that everything worked out fine.<br /><br />This leads to many scenes filled with obstacles that we know the characters will overcome. They go through an Iranian bazaar, struggle to get past airport security, and eventually onto the plane to take them out of the country. During all of these scenes, the tension feels very forced; rather than focus on the more interesting part of the story (the fake movie they are supposed to be producing and the actions taken by the US government), we are given lots of 5-minute problems.<br /><br />For example, the hostages are forced to take on new identities in a very short time. What? There's no way it can be done. What? Okay, we'll do it.<br /><br />Argo is full of scenes like this, which by the end become exhausting. There's not going to be much tension or uncertainty as to the outcome of this mission, so I don't know why director Ben Affeck wastes his time and ours on trying to draw that out in the audience.<br /><br />The worst offense is when the hostages and CIA operative are on the plane as it is leaving Iran, and Iranian police cars chase after a plane as it is taking off...surprisingly, the police are unable to stop it. I laughed out loud, wondering if the moment was supposed to be funny or if we aren't supposed to know that cars can't outrun airplanes.<br /><br />One scene I particularly enjoyed was a moment when the hostages' airplane tickets had to be re-sent to the airport; I appreciated seeing the coordination between Affleck's actions (in Iran) with those of Washington DC officials. It's too easy for Hollywood movies to focus on the achievements of one individual, so I welcomed this glimpse of how missions like this requires cooperation from all parties.<br /><br />This movie was an entertaining one, though unfortunately misguided. It's as though Affleck misread what would make a good movie about this fascinating story.<br /><br />This movie was an entertaining one, though unfortunately misguided.

B005LAII6C|4.0|What a delightful little oddball of a film. ParaNorman is a stop-motion feature from the same production company who brought us Coraline, and it's easy to spot the similarities. Both are charming and creepy stop-motion family films, while bringing enough jokes and even chills to keep the parents in the audience entertained.<br /><br />The somewhat thin premise is that Norman, a preteen boy who can speak to the dead, has to break a witch's curse in his New England town celebrating its 300th anniversary. The fairly simple plot fortunately is brought to life through the colorful cast of supporting characters; Norman's school bully (voiced by the actor who played McLovin of all people!) and Norman's older sister are just two of the highlights.<br /><br />A surprising edge and wit also keep the story feeling fresh and engaging throughout the film. In one of the laugh-out-loud moments, Norman's mentor (another ghost whisperer) tells Norman to \\"swear\\" to break the witch's curse, to which Norman replies, \\"Like what? The `f' word?\\"<br /><br />Toward the third act the plot runs a little long (particularly in the surreal and visually entrancing, yet ultimately predictable climax) but the journey is consistently engaging and intriguing. Stop-motion films consistently produce fascinating worlds that are tons of fun to explore (especially in 3D) and ParaNorman is no exception; you almost want the screen to pause so you can better appreciate the detail in the setting and characters.<br /><br />While it does clock on for a bit too long, ParaNorman is still a breath of fresh air for animation, providing solid and quality entertainment with some really stunning visuals. It is very rare and exciting to find a family horror film with genuine thrills, and is even more special to find one with such a strong and endearing young protagonist.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved the book. Will not read any series by her unless they are all published. She waited too long to release the third book. When you wait that long you lose interest and have too re-read the last book before going on to the next book in the series. You have it written, why not release it.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|One of Alfred Hitchcock's most graphic, chilling, and under-appreciated thrillers, The Birds is the mysterious tale of a small North Bay town under attack by birds gone wild. No real explanation is provided, and the film ends without an answer why. But it wouldn't even matter if it did.<br /><br />What does matter is how it affects the townspeople, both in turning against one another and how they deal with the bird situation. Themes of sexism and racism are strong undercurrents throughout the story, as the locals fear the birds came along with the wealthy, single yet sexually liberal protagonist who is new in town.<br /><br />The theme of the changing role of women extends beyond the central avian conflict; the now-archaic term \\"Birds\\" used to be a derogatory word for \\"Women,\\" which can be seen through the story's human narrative. There is one male character, and four women swirling around him, competing for his attentions and affections in different ways. At times, the melodrama of this storyline exceeds the drama of the bird action.<br /><br />The bird sequences, however, are truly terrifying and unforgettable. I saw this film for the first time in theaters tonight, having grown up watching it on home video, and I have rarely had a cinematic experience as intense as this one. Hearing the audio in full stereo, the clicks and squawks of the birds truly envelop the audience as you hear them sweep through the air around you. The violence is actually quite graphic for Hitchcock standards, and the blood pops off the screen in lurid technicolor. This feature also contains one of Hitchcock's more disturbing images, of children lying helpless on the ground as birds peck them to death.<br /><br />When compared to Hitchcock's more accepted masterpieces like Vertigo and Rear Window, The Birds is less impressive; but taken on its own for what it is, an unsettling thrill ride, it does stand out as a triumph of special effects and storytelling.

B00C5W3SBE|4.0|I guess it's appropriate that the contemporary revival of the Oz saga is every bit as bizarre and beautiful as Oz itself. Oz the Great and Powerful is an engaging, visually stunning, though sometimes head-scratching prequel to the Oz universe as we know it, back to the Wizard's start in Kansas and his rise to power within this magical world.<br /><br />The story and four leads (the Wizard and three Witches of Oz) are actually pretty well developed, with each character strengthened by their sometimes conflicting motivations and intentions. Traveling with James Franco as the Wizard, we enter a world where everybody has a past history with one another, and we are immediately given this sense. There is plenty of witchy competition and backstabbing, worsened by Franco's semi-romantic connections with, well, all of them.<br /><br />I think this is when the movie succeeds at its best, though. The Wizard of Oz we are familiar with is not a great guy, and he is consistently not very nice as a young man first entering Oz. Oz the Great and Powerful meets our expectations of the Oz universe with consistent imagery, particularly through the architecture of the Emerald City, the smoke-and-mirrors tricks of the Wizard, and, of course, the Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />The film does not work, however, with some of the supporting characters. While I am happy to say that everybody and every scene do serve some greater function to the story, some characters are frankly obnoxious or aren't written to their full potential. There is more than a handful of cringeworthy moments, and the awkward scene breaks don't help ease the uncomfortable parts.<br /><br />While wildly inconsistent, Oz the Great and Powerful is actually a very clever and, for the most part, a pretty solid movie. It rises above the disaster of Alice in Wonderland from a couple years ago, and tells a story that is at once familiar and surprising. It follows a story frame similar to The Wizard of Oz, while incorporating in powerful themes of the limitations of humanity and the sometimes disappointing reality that lies behind the curtain.ing in powerful themes of the limitations of humanity and the sometimes disappointing reality that lies behind the curtain.

B005LAII08|5.0|I can't begin to say how pleasantly surprised I was by Disney/Pixar's newest feature. The mess of Cars 2 significantly brought down the mean quality of their films, so going into Brave I expected something equally lumpy.<br /><br />What I found, however, was an extraordinary and very original post-modern fairy tale. It is a solid balance of humor with the emotional weight Pixar has recently become notorious for (cough Up and Toy Story 3). Furthermore, by placing the setting in a semi-historical context, the story gains a much heavier sense of importance and meaning.<br /><br />Pixar's recent foray into more mature work also makes the stakes much higher for each new film. Their marketing team did a solid job of not revealing many plot details (the commercials just hit the tip of the iceberg), so the plot details are genuinely surprising. The main plot has not even been addressed in any of the advertisements I've seen.<br /><br />I had my doubts going into it, but Brave turned out to be a very different and far superior movie than I was expecting. Don't fight it just because it looks like Mulan or other girl-power fare. Brave is its own film that can stand proudly in the already-solid Pixar canon.

B008RYN44U|5.0|Eleven years is a long time between albums, but the wait is worth it when the end product could very well be the group's best work.<br /><br />I'm not sure yet if I like it more than No Doubt's breakout record Tragic Kingdom. I've only had Push and Shove for a couple of days, but I cannot stop listening to it. At a lean 51 energetic minutes, it could not be easier to listen to this record over and over.<br /><br />After five or so listens, I've realized that Push and Shove is a concept album, outlining No Doubt's past, present, and future.<br /><br />Past (Tracks 1-4):<br /><br />The Past segment is bookended by two standout tracks, \\"Settle Down\\" and \\"Push and Shove.\\" Both songs are about the same thing, the optimism and expectations No Doubt receives from their fans, but the songs could not be greater foils in tone. \\"Settle Down\\" is fun and upbeat, while \\"Push and Shove\\" shows that it really gets to No Doubt. You can feel them under the pressure, \\"you're hustlin' me.\\"<br /><br />In between these songs are two more fantastic records, \\"Looking Hot,\\" the spiritual sequel to \\"Hey Baby\\" from Rock Steady, about Gwen's image in the media and how she is constantly idolized and critiqued for every look she pulls off. The third track, \\"One More Summer,\\" represents the group's decision to make another record after such a long break. It is both heartbreakingly nostalgic and undyingly hopeful that they can do it again. And don't worry, they do.<br /><br />Present (Tracks 5-8):<br /><br />The Present section of the album focuses on the band members' respective personal lives, while being musically united by a more 80s pop sound than the rest of the album. \\"Easy\\" is a stellar powerpop ballad with pounding guitars and a strong reggae beat throughout. \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Undercover\\" are both more upbeat dancefloor-ready hits.<br /><br />The last song in this segment, \\"Undone,\\" is No Doubt's best song to date. It is a bona fide tearjerker that will surely be a fan favorite in live performances. Get out your cell phones, you're going to be waving them in arenas come the 2013 tour.<br /><br />Future (Tracks 9-11):<br /><br />The Future segment picks up right where the Present leaves off, with its first track \\"Sparkle\\" serving as a nice thematic companion to \\"Undone,\\" taking a step back and addressing No Doubt's future endeavors more realistically rather than fatalistically. \\"Never ever gonna be the same\\" is chanted with a positive reggae backbeat...No Doubt has accepted its new position, and is perfectly fine with it.<br /><br />This is followed by the weakest song on the record, the funky yet almost unnecessary \\"Heaven.\\" It has some good licks in it, but does not have the emotional power that the other tracks do.<br /><br />The follow-up fortunately is the gorgeous and powerful \\"Dreaming the Same Dream,\\" with a similar 80s beat as the Present segment. It almost seems to be a conversation between the band about where to go next. \\"How many times can a promise be broken? Who taught you how to love?\\" Gwen asks as the band builds up to a sublime chorus.<br /><br />Like Tragic Kingdom, you can tell No Doubt really poured their heart and soul into this record. Every song is fine-tuned and polished to the best it can be. I would not be surprised if, by this time next year, every song has played on the radio and reaches the level of cultural permeation that their earlier work has. Push and Shove is the gift No Doubt fans have been waiting for these eleven long years. Gwen even warns us how great this record would be in the album's very first song: \\"Don't get me started, I'm trying to get a hold on this.\\"mances.

B005D0RDO8|5.0|The most disturbing movie I've ever seen, both in content and the hard truths it presents.<br /><br />Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom is a not-too-far-fetched allegory about four  libertines toward the end of Italian fascism. These four powerful men kidnap eighteen young men and women and transport them an isolated house in the countryside. During the titular 120 days they spend there, the men rape, assault, abuse, and dehumanize the youth in increasingly vile and horrifying ways. One of the most memorable scenes is one in which a libertine defecates on the floor, and forces one of the women to eat it. The camera does not look away.<br /><br />This is one of many squirm-in-your-seat moments that never seem to give up in this movie. When the visuals of the film aren't stimulating your gag reflex, however, the dialogue and mood of the film are just as troubling. An older woman who helps runs things at the house cheerfully recounts stories of her youth, in which she too was subjected to terrible acts. Now, as an older woman though, she laughs it away and accepts it as perfectly normal.<br /><br />Such is a recurring theme throughout the film. As the 120 days progress, the victims become less like themselves and more like the captors who subject them to such cruelty. The movie begins with all the youth on equal ground but by the end, they turn against each other, even torturing and raping each other. They fulfill one of the film's most profound quotes, \\"Nothing's more contagious than evil.\\"<br /><br />Salo is not an easy film to get through and it's not one I would necessarily recommend. It is not for everybody and nothing can really prepare you for it. If you do have the stomach for it, however, it is certainly worthwhile and thought-provoking. It is a testament to how powerful, albeit shocking, film can be.
B00B37RYMQ|4.0|The story is a page turner and the witty conversation between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy evolves from dicey insults to words such as incandescently happy.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|The formula is broken. Writing fast chorus-verse-chorus-verse-guitar solo-chorus songs does not work 20 years later.<br /><br />Green Day's newest effort Uno, the first of three records in a seemingly ambitious three-album project, is not as much innovative as it is lazy. The songs follow the same basic template their early punkier music did, but there is somehow less angst and fury behind each song when you're a successful, world-famous forty-something millionaire than when you're a bitter twentysomething actually singing about something.<br /><br />The record isn't bad but it is honestly boring. There are a few good songs, like the bitingly funny \\"Kill the DJ\\" (a clear criticism of dancier rock music like Franz Ferdinand's \\"Take Me Out\\"), the emotional \\"Stay the Night,\\" and the album's final track, \\"Oh Love.\\" The rest of the album does feel like filler, unfortunately.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I have been a lifelong Green Day fan and I love their original work just as much as their more epic music like American Idiot. But I don't want to hear them exploring known territory. Where is the innovation that used to push this band lightyears ahead of every other rock group?<br /><br />I hope the next two albums in the series, Dos and Tres, are better both for their own sake and for the future of one of my favorite bands.
B00BLDD3A4|4.0|Good chance to get a not-so-common blend of different artists all on the same record.<br /><br />Good sounds throughout, though I thought Stevie Nicks' song was the low-point, and I'm a fan of her earlier work.

I couldn't agree more that there is a pattern in<br />everything we do and that we do not make that many decisions in life.<br /><br />I didn't understand how \\"cravings\\" work though. Cravings develops for<br />the behavior part of the habit, what's called the \\"routine\\" (the other<br />parts being the cue and the reward). For example, I can't think how to<br />develop cravings for exercising itself rather than cravings for the<br />reward of exercising (a guilt-free, ready-to-eat, meal for me).

B00CBQASCQ|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW ON THE ORIGINAL CHINESE UNCUT (130 min.) VERSION!<br /><br />It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts action in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Wong Kar-wai brings the poetic beauty of his cinematic genius displayed in such works as \\"In the Mood for Love\\" to martial arts action executed with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, bringing out the sensations of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII. The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man, and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er perfectly embodies a kungfu mistress trying to avenge her father. A masterpiece by Wong to put on a level with his finest work.<br /><br />My only gripe about this Blu-ray release (which looks stunning in its clarity of picture and color, highlighting Wong's penchant for rain and darkness) is that the special features (unlike the feature itself) do not have any English subtitling -- so unless you read Chinese you won't be able to know what Wong or his crew and cast are talking about.  The feature does, however, have full subtitling.<br /><br />A worthy addition to your Blu-ray library.<br /><br />PS: One other reviewer criticized the editing of this film which, to me, smacks of putting down the film for not being more conventional.  Sometimes it is difficult to put aside expectations of what one wants a film to be in favor of what the actual film on the screen is.  \\"The Grandmaster\\" is, in fact, brilliantly edited.  Wong is, if nothing else, a perfectionist in taking years to mold his assembled footage into his own personal rhythmic poem, idiosyncratically emphasizing downbeats and rests as precise as a great composer.  What you see here is Wong Kar-wai's personal vision, take it or leave it.  But let's not denigrate it for not being a conventional action picture or someone else's Ip man film.  I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit.  It strikes me as a perfect diamond for this exceptional, if eccentric, cinema artist.an film.  I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|It was a amazing second book to the maze runner series. There were twists in the plot and emotions that heat up! It was a well crafted book that had great detail. I could picture myself in Thomas's shoes and could imagine everything! Amazing book and amazing series, if you haven't read the maze runner series you should do so now!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Yes,it is my favorite<br />I am looking at itevefy day  and i am glad to meet my friends to chat with them<br />Bravo facebook

B005HF0GMA|5.0|Its bases on the real Alison DuBoise! Awesome show! Kept me interested the whole time! Too bad show got canceled, ver sad about that. I look forward to watching all episodes!
B00ANGICRE|5.0|Haven't watched it yet. But how could it miss with actors of this caliber. Don't hesitate to add this movie to your collection.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Great app to print pics and docs from phone or kindle fire!  Easy download and easy to use, thanks HP!
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Very good movie. The actors are all very good in this movie. Keeps you wanting to know what will happen with this guy in his future. Don't miss it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I too very much enjoyed this book though am not sure I liked how it all came together at the end... I love books that keep me wanting to read when I'm not and this fit the bill but the ending was disappointing... though having said that, not sure what ending I might have been happy with...  Still, it's a good read and would recommend... just may need to find me a book club so can discuss the ending with others!<br /><br />Also - did I notice a typo on my Kindle - Dopey vs Money?
B00B1EGP44|5.0|I bought this movie because it came in Blu Ray finally. I have not watched it yet but I know the addition of Blu Ray will add to it. I saw the original and it is so good. Can't wait to see it in Blu Ray.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good game to play to pass time....also a lot of different puzzles to choose from....and very bright easy to see matches
1439163154|5.0|I loved this story's style of writing it was brutal and simple, and told from such words that would make you suspect that this was an actual memoir rather than a fiction. I personally loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves reading.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Good to have Stephen King back to his old tricks! Left you wanting more. You can almost see his scenes.
B00C2C637I|5.0|A classic book by an author I'd never read before.  I plan to read more.  It's scary without being violent or gory.
B006X415GK|5.0|GREAT
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|We use thus charger almost every time we go out, and it has worked great. I would recommend this charger, it is a nice to have it handy.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Was very addictive. Not sure about the ending though as it kind of left you hanging
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Didn't want to put the book down.  The author did a convincing job.  It was easy to believe this could happen in real life so in that sense it had a &#34;troubling&#34; undertone simply because of the topic.  Unexpected ending.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This mind bending game will keep you guessing and searching! Truly a game set apart from the rest! You will have to think with this one...it's no ordinary bubble bashing, money hungry, endless pursuit to success! The only bad part is that the game is short lived. I am excited and ready for more from this creator. Good luck in your gaming!
B004UOE7VA|5.0|This is a great album.  I loved the original soundtrack and this takes the themes from the film and builds upon them in very energetic ways.  Reminds me of awesome 80s films and old-school video games.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I've watched this upbeat, lively musical at least 2 dozen times. Everytime my grandchildren come over they ask to watch it. It is guarenteed to lift your spirits!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Now I do not have to carry my laptop around just to connect to Social Media.  I was glad to see this app.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Good old straight from the heart song-writing. I couldn't resist this CD after seeing the movie, Searching for Sugarman. It's the best. An amazing talent!!!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book was nicely written and was a different story than the usual, and though I was curious to see it through the end I was not really gripped by it. However it s a pleasant read, although at times quite dark.
B00785P2QC|4.0|very entertaining i enjoy building my own city from scratch and it lets you do it to your own perfection and to your liking
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Given my penchant for reading at night when I go to bed, I had a hard time slogging through this wonderfully written book about an interesting subject.  When I ended my reading of it on a long plane trip, I really enjoyed the continuity and stream of the story.  I believe Adam Johnson has done a masterful job if letting the reader see some of what goes on in North Korea which I find fascinating.  I'll look forward to reading more of his work.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|The alarm clock is very quiet.I could barely hear it when I was awake.I would definitely not be able to hear it if I was asleep.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. My only complaint was all the French names that were important to the narrative but not speaking French I would just pass over them.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|My granddaughter enjoyed the movie very much, and watches it every time she comes over to the house. Thanks for a wholesome babysitter.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I got my new kindle for Mothers Day·  I was so excited to get a book I immediately started searching·  I am in awe of Telsa and this book was amazing.  It was educational, inspirational and a quick read.  I will definitely seek out this author again.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|The beginning of the book was slow in hooking me in, but San Glokta was all it took. As the other characters developed, the book became a truly enjoyable tale. Each character is intriguing in their own way, though I wouldn't choose to any to hang out with any of them on a regular basis. The grit and dark humor added to a tale of intrigue, magic. A real treat. Looking forward to book 2!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is assigned at our school for all kids in 6-8th grade to read over the summer. I read it because I wanted to discuss it with my daughter. It is a great book full of touching and comedic moments. All adolescents want that balance of being individual and yet unique but have they realized that they all want that, even when someone looks very different to them? This book has some great discussion points and the characters really stay with you after you finish the book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It wasn't too bad.  Nice little puzzles along the way and a decent storyline.  would recommend the full version to get the most out of it.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones at his best. Enough twists and turns to keep you involved. The historical back ground makes this even better.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Cool movie with a story. It has a lot of choot'in, car stunts, and some ass whoop'in fight scene by Schwarzeneggar. Two thumbs up for a great action movie!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I mean, I do love the Dash games! And, unlike the hotel dash, this app doesn't open up whenever I'm doing something else, so a plus for this one! I also got this as a free app, like other reviewers. I do think it's annoying that you keep getting ads for a paid game to purchase the full game (which I see I'm already getting).<br /><br />Now, I didn't \\"pay for the full game\\" so I'm not sure about the ads still popping up taking you about purchasing the full game. But, as I'm getting the full game AND ads, I can see that they're not lying. And, as most reviewers are having this issue (I actually haven't seen it do this to me yet), don't update the game! I'm sure the developers would give you a refund or perhaps help fix the problem, but it's ridiculous to even have this issue happen.<br /><br />The game itself is wonderful! And, like all the dash games, addicting! I like how you can go to the other restaurants to \\"help out\\". I found no issues with this app. The only issue I have on my kindle fire is that sometimes the app either takes forever to start up or it doesn't start up at all. And I know my kindle has more than enough free space that it's not my kindle. All in all, its not too annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to dash fans! I would also note, ignore the constant ads for purchasing the whole game if you get them (after purchasing it); and if you aren't able to reach all levels, contact the developers!
B0054SMID0|4.0|IT WAS DIFFERENT. THERE IS NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY ABOUT IT. I AM A MAN OF FEW WORDS.<br /><br />BYE
B0097K21YW|4.0|Truthfully, this game reminds me of an old, old console game I used to play (though the only comparison between the two is destroying buildings). So, I got it solely on that reason. Now, I've only played angry birds for about a few seconds once, but this game is definitely similar--though in this one you're spitting fire not throwing birds.<br /><br />The sounds made me smile and I think they work perfectly for this game! Like other reviewers, I'm confused on the scoring of this game. One review said they thought it might be based on speed. I think it might be based on how \\"well\\" you take down the buildings and how destructive you are. But I think speed may play into it? Either way, it definitely would be nice for the creators to at least have a list of how you can score--if only for my curiosity.<br /><br />Overall, this game can be repetitive (most games like this are) but it's still fun to play for a bit every now and then! I would recommend this to anyone who loves angry birds (and doesn't mind games similar to it).
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game takes place a little while after the movie, so if you have not seen the movie you shouldn't play the game just yet (Who hasn't seen it though?). You fly through the air tilting your kindle left in right to guide iron man. Even though this seems a little hard at times it is OK to deal with.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is alot of fun.  Just keep building!  Just keep swimming! Just keep building and swimming!  The graphics are great and sound is good too.  Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This game is a pure delight. It has all the cool items and work that you can do to your horse.
0446615641|4.0|David Baldacci has brought back the Camel Club in the third installment of this series and it did not disappoint.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|This is nothing different from the standard Bon Jovi music; however it includes all new songs including &#34;Because We Can&#34;, as well as numerous ballads, sung beautifully by Jon.  This disc is easy on the ears and is appealing to many people with a wide variety of music tastes.  Anything by Bon Jovi is traditional classic rock and never gets old.
B0076DELIG|5.0|another Connelly WINNER. I have been addicted to his books for years now . I bought my first thriller for 25 cents at a yard sale and it was love at first read.....
B007IK44CK|5.0|All I can say is my heart beat so fast when TC was on the side of the Burj.  For those scenes alone, this movie is worth it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Absolutely love this game.  It is fun trying to increase your score with each game.  Exciting and fast.  Would highly recommend it to everyone.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Even in war, men could rise above the horror and death and a mutual need to conquer, to live as humans.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great time-killer!  It helps keep you sharp!  I like it daily for mind-exercise!  The more you play, the quicker you win!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a fun mystery game but at my young teen age it really is a thinking game and every time i played it i got a migraine because you cant put it down! :)
B000ASATWQ|3.0|On first hearing this I enjoyed its cross-over reggae/roots/rap. But after a number of listenings', it did not maintain that sense of being unique or standing in its own right. Hard legacy to live under and from that point Damian Marley deserves credit for trying something other. No, I find Ziggy's offerings a tad bland, coasting reggae for Sunday afternoon vicarage tea parties in Little England. This is at least an attempt to kick start something other than extend Bob Marley. It has urban grit in its veins. He has promise and I hope it blooms into the monster this seemed to be moving towards.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This well written story brings us to India and submerged us in this interesting culture.  We experience the emotions involved in adoption, by all parties involved. The story emphasizes value of FAMILY.
B0000A118M|5.0|Mr Kim Tait, a saxophonist, muso/artist and friend argued that Coltrane was the greates saxophonist to draw breath. Hands up any of you who knew that the saxophone was invented by a Belgian. I don't think he had Mr Coltrane in mind as a prime exponent of his instrument which was more for the oom-pah generation. Nevertheless, as well as Mr Tait, there were the Liverpool poets dropping Coltrane into their verses. I stumbled into jazz in the early seventies through a Harvey Mann/Bobby Jasper track \\"Tel Aviv\\" which made me a fan of the saxophone. But Coltrane remained for many years in the too hard basket to listen too. All that discord and screech. Truth was I did not have the framework or discipline then to listen let alone appreciate what this man was able to do with music. So in comes Mr Tait-endless nagging and I succumbed. First off, all agree he is a bloody genius. No easy listening modality for this man. His whole life was spent in experimenting with the sounds he and others collectively could crate. Secondly, read his biography, he comes across as a decent human being. Not the average muso with show ponying behaviours, temper tantrums etc. But this as a first listen of Mr Coltrane's virtuosity? It was hard work. But it paid dividends to persevere. Firstly, look at the combination of players. McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones, each accomplished in their mastery of their instrument and could have been earning big bucks playing in more main stream ensembles. But they were driven to share the vision of Coltrane that everything is in constant flux. I have two Coltrane tracks on my IPod, a version of \\"My Favourite Things\\" and \\"Chim, Chim-whatever from Mary Poppins\\". Both scour you to the soul as they are deconstructed, reconstructed and just when you think they are imploding they explode in celebration. Thank you Mr Tait, you were so right. Coltrane is worth the journey and I am privileged to have made it.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|Natalie and Ashton are perfectly casted for this film. I couldn't see anyone replacing Natalie' s role. Cute, funny movie with a good ending. Definitely not a \\"chic flic\\".
B006X4758M|5.0|Yeah. Having had a number of Pink Floyd early albums thrown at me and some I tried to like. Only Atom Heart Mother stood out like a lone cow in a field. Then Meddle which I'd ignored thinking it was another obscured by clouds, stumbled into my consciousness by seeing a modern dance group perform to \\"One of these Days\\". It was the shuddering, rollicking bass and scrapey lead guitar pounded along by the drums and organ. Who's dat? I asked. Pink Floyd. Never! Not the lads of pomp and grandiosity. One of these days is still a great tub thumping anthem of a song. A pillow of winds a blues whimsy. I hope Seamus the dog received his royalties as the excellent fifth member of the band on his self titled track. But the best track on this is the last \\"Echoes\\". It takes you on a journey that is always a satisfying listen. Of course Dark Side of the Moo (original working title) has a lot to answer for. But as a trio of sounds, Atom Heart Mother, Meddle and Dark Side are in my view the best of Floyd and jolly good listening.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I love the percy jackson series so i thought i would buy this and its great! i really love this.
B0000047CX|5.0|Well, Getz/Gilberto and the chick from Ipanema-Ms Astrud. It is a classic of fusion before Mr Cooder, Simon etc. Tenor/guitar and samba with sultry vocals. At worse it is easy listening but that deceives the fragrance of the combination of playing. It works on the harmonies and creates pleasure in listening. It does not pall over time. I picked up the CD ten or so years ago and still enjoy the music and one of the better frames for how good a tenor Stan Getz plays. A must for young jazz aficionados to discover, a gem.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|A very handy program to have installed on your tablet. I like to have a program that I can write quick notes to myself so it is not forgotten. It is best to use a stylus with this application.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|This movie is visually rich. From the landscape to the period clothing to the gorgeous actors. Totally enjoyable. A great rainy day movie. Helen Hunt wasn't great but luckily there was plenty of other good stuff.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|A very good and weird spooky movie. The movie definitely stands out in the movie category.<br />I am willing to watch it again.
B000000OF6|5.0|Is this the real life?<br />Is this just fantasy?<br />Caught in a landslide<br />No escape from reality<br />Open your eyes<br />Look to the album and see<br />I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br />Because I'm easy come, easy go<br />A little high, little low<br />Anyway music blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me<br /><br />Mama, just killed a man<br />Don't know why I did it so<br />If I just listened to this album<br />Mama, life had just begun<br />But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br />Mama, ooo<br />Didn't mean to make you cry<br />I just wanted to hear this album right now<br />Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br />...<br /><br />I can't finish the rest. I'm not Freddie Mercury. Why, you ask? Why can I not finish this song, despite its obvious brilliance? Why am I not Freddie Mercury? Other than all the talent, singing talent, and homosexuality; I don't have his glorious mustache. Buy this album. Just for the mustache. It's glorious.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I'm a big Sophie Kinsella fan. I, too, get excited when I hear a new book is being released and try to get my hands on a copy as soon as I can. To clarify, though, I'm not a fan of her Shopaholic books. I stopped reading those after the second one drove me batty.<br /><br />So, this book reminded me a lot of the Shopaholic books... the characters just keep making the worst choices and get themselves into painful situations. And because they keep doing so, it's really, really hard to root for any of them, or care what happens to any of them. As another reviewer said, the only character I really enjoyed was seven year old Noah, who is a compulsive liar. That's not a good sign!<br /><br />As a Kinsella fan, if you're like me, you'll want to read it and finish it, just to get through it. But you won't get the \\"feel good\\" feeling when you're done reading it as with her other non-Shopaholic novels. Oh well, at least this means her next book has a really good chance of being a lot better :-)
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have to admit that I read this book only because it was  for free, but im very surprised about how good the book is. I thought it would be like a life story of tesla but its so much more and i feel so inspired right now. great book! greetings from serbia ;)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This experience will keep you on playing. The amazing graphics to the fights with the monsters of the night are breathtaking.
B008Y79HE6|5.0|Good job! I look forward to another one in the near future.  I'm really curious to how they will put this one together.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fantastic visual<br /><br />, great concept. Takes much longer to play if you don't buy upgrades. Really fun to play. I enjoy it.
098357670X|5.0|Another great resource to add to my library. Will be looking for more like this to buy in the near future.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This a true romance that was not to gritty. I really enjoyed the story line and appreciated that it was not a nasty read..Thank You..
B001HPP2XW|5.0|It was a Christmas gift and my daughter loves the movie.  Being a special edition gave some other video features that doesn't change the movie but is nice when giving a gift.
B002Z58GQS|5.0|I purchased this drive for its storage capacity and value. It arrived with a day or two of being ordered. It could not have been any easier to use, just plug it into your USB port and it does the rest. This device allows me to put hundreds of my favorite music on it so I enjoy them wherever I go. This flash drives does what it supposed to do, and for an excellent price. I would recommend this flash drive for storing music, photos, and backing up you computer.
B008645YEE|5.0|Dark Knight Rises is one of my favorite movies of all time along with the rest of the Batman/Dark Knight trilogy. Love the score on this as well as the other movies. Very good job.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Everything an Android game should be, it's like bejeweled with RPG elements, upgrading your character and constantly striving for the top score by matching tiles and killing monsters.
1419703692|5.0|Loved all of this. Huge book. It takes you inside the making of the movies in detail & I really loved that. Loved the pictures & concept art as well. Great book to have if you're a fan of the Chritstopher Nolan trilogy.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Bloody gory and at instilled yet with humour - this adventure takes you down some dusty roads not explored much in film -for some of the reality of what slave owners did to 'their property' and some true looks at mans inhumanity to man, and good reason of why we need to curb human populations as we really are nasty animals at times.
0399226907|5.0|My daughter loves this book.  We borrowed it a bunch of times from the library and she wanted to keep it.  She's rough so it's good to have the board version of the book and it's not teeny tiny.  Good size for a preschooler.
B00597A6NU|5.0|A great re-watch around Memorial Day!  Wonderful story of some of the best of The Greatest Generation, well done by some of the then-young actors of the time it was filmed.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I play the congas and was needed this cd to play along with...thanks! I will most likely be buying again
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like use my Pocket Pal sharpener for a quick refresh of various knives around the house. For its price, portability, and versatility it provides with carbine and ceramic sharpeners along with the tapered diamond rod, it's a no-brainer. However, if you want to get the best edge possible on your blade again, you're going to need other sharpening tools made to actually reshape the blade and put a new edge on it (like a whetsone, the [[ASIN:B004HIZKHE Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker]], the [[ASIN:B00BFFY8JI Edge Pro system]], and a bevy of other options for just about any budget. The more expensive systems tend to require the least amount of effort and the most precision, however).<br /><br />This tool is a great addition and compliment to any sharpening tool set, but just keep in mind that it's not a one-stop shop for all your sharpening needs. It does what it's meant to for a very fair price, and it's a well-built, quality-feeling tool (once you've worn down both sides of the blades/stones, they are user replaceable, too). A solid 5 out of 5 stars for performance of its intended task, build quality, and value.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to fascinate as the characters grow and change.  The insights into the effects that the war had on everyone, those on the front and those left behind, are marvelous.  Can't wait for the next season.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|love the plot twist and turns.  starts slow but builds.  have been hooked since season 1.  typical british wit and humor
B00992CF6W|5.0|mind craft is great you can build a lot of cool stuff and it is well worth the 6.99$ you pay for it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Amazing book. I love the perspective from the male lead, it was fun, light, and completely different from the norm. I definitely look forward to reading more from this author. Emma Chase knows her stuff! Not a dull moment :)
B005544TRQ|4.0|My wife and I love this show.  The only major downside was to find out after the season finale that Season 2 was not free for prime members.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had to see what happened after reading Mockingjay<br />Suzanne Collins vivid imagination is good for old and young alike.<br />I also enjoyed the movie.  It was tastefully not as bloody as the books!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have read a lot of love stories and mostly they are written in the point of view of the heroin. So it is refreshing to find this book in the POV of the story's \\"hero\\". The thing about having a love story in the male POV is that there is less analyzing and more of actions.  Women tend to be overly emotional, assuming and over analyzing because we (take note!) think too much about our situation with the male specie.  Whereas, men, may be a little slow in the feelings department but when cupid indeed strikes, they waste no time to show and get the woman they love.<br /><br />It started with Drew, a successful investment banker who knows no love or relationships, introducing himself in the hilarious way and the current state he was in. He gives the reader the whole scenario leading to his change of heart. And it is through Drew that we meet Kate, Alexandra, Matthew, Steven, Jack, Mackenzie, Delores and even Sister Beatrice. With all of them, the story is a whole lot of fun. My only regret is I started reading this at 9:30 in the evening and when I felt I need to stop and sleep already, it is way way way past the bedtime for one who sleeps for two. Regardless of that though, I enjoyed this book and now I am asking for more of male POVs. So join Drew in his journey with his family and friends as he finds his way to true love.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My granddaughter was so in love with the hunger game books I had to read this to see why and I was hooked.<br />Three author keeps you in suspence  at a fast moving pace,  Well written

B009B4ZEKM|4.0|MY FAVORITE ALBUM TO DATE IS \\"BACK TO BASICS\\". I NEVER PURCHASED \\"BIONIC\\". IT JUST WASN'T FOR ME. I CHOSE TO GET THIS ONE BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HAVE A VARIETY OF HER STYLES. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH SOME CURSING, BUT \\"CIRCLES\\" WAS OVERKILL. \\"SHUT UP\\" IS JUST PLAIN BASIC & UGLY. HOWEVER, I REALLY LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER SONGS ON THE ALBUM & FOR ME, THAT RATE UP THERE WITH MUCH OF THE \\"BACK TO BASICS\\" ALBUM. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!

B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This is a great show and I can't wait for the new season to be released. The acting is very good and the story line is intense!
B00AEBB8YW|3.0|The original was light and breezy. The remake is light with a first great hour. The last hour of this movie is basically nothing more then extremely tedious talking head shots and at the end of the day this romantic fairy tale is way too long at 127 minutes and formulaic. The mansion has a fairy tale castle feel as the chauffeur's daughter becomes the King's Queen. This is well photographed and the Paris locations have a pleasant feel. The performances of Ford, Ormand and Kinnear are likeable. The last 20 minutes really tested my patiences as director Pollack was way too respectful with his story that made it boring. There were no risks of imagination and this remake is somewhat average.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Yes, it was a beautiful movie to behold. The ending could disturb you, but that's up to you. I enjoyed it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just sown loaded this because  I said  my mom playing it and I kind  took it over an  she told.me to download it on my kindle fire HD so I Did an  the next day I had a plane to catch and I played it A LOT on the 9 hour flight
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Way Way Good! At first you don't think you will like it all being music but it works very well.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Definitely a worthy attempt at Lee Child's character.  The issue wasn't Tom Cruise, though I know some Reacher purists criticized his casting.  The issue is that the story and the screenplay just weren't very strong.  Other than Reacher himself (arguably), ALL the characters were just utterly one-dimensional. It did have good action sequences, and portrayed Reacher as the intelligent & principled bad-ass that he is. In short order though, this will be a forgotten movie by a major star, and a writer who's given us better.

1932100660|1.0|The cancer & \\"heart\\" organizations that funded this study were themselves supported & monitored by the centralized processed foods industry, including the edible oils and soy industries. Soy around the world, by the way, is mostly controlled by just a few companies. The government organizations that also financed it were headed at the time by people who later got jobs in the same industries. Quid pro quo.<br /><br />FICTION: Casein causes cancer.<br /><br />FACT: Campell and his colleagues did not use cancer-free rats for their research, but those with induced tumors.<br /><br />FACT: Casein is a supernutrient. It's the most potent form of protein known due to the availability of amino acids and the gradualness by which it is digested, which minimizes the ratio of it that does not get used as protein, as the body can only process proteins at a fixed maximum rate and cannot store it to be used as protein later.<br /><br />FACT: The best way to cause cancer cells to grow is by feeding them. The latest research on fighting cancer is attempting to figure out how to starve cancer cells.<br /><br />FACT: The evidence does not support the claim that casein causes cancer. It contributes to cancer growth as much as any equally nutritious food stuff or entire meal would.<br /><br />FICTION: Eating plants is healthier than eating animals.<br /><br />FACT: Saturated fat is a nutrient.<br /><br />FACT: Cholesterol is a nutrient.<br /><br />FACT: The leading cause of health problems related to diet in the United States is the result of one simple relationship: Over-eating and sedentary living. Eating too many calories and/or total fat per day and not getting enough exercise for that given caloric and/or total fat intake. You can try to rationalize it all you want 'till the cows come home, but that's where the vast majority of the evidence falls.<br /><br />FACT: Soy protein isolates, corn-derived processed food stuffs, and highly-processed unsaturated oils were originally considered \\"imitation\\" foods prior to WWII, and rightfully so. These are not worth even the low, subsidized price we pay for them.  They are still essentially sub-standard types of war rations barely even fit to be feeding starving people. If you had to choose between eating a bunch of vegetables, soy, and corn-derived processed products while stranded on a desert island or instead whole milk, eggs, and red meat, you would be an idiot to choose the former. Throw in grains or potatoes into both options and you still end up with the latter being the superior choice.<br /><br />FACT: When doctors have to supervise reality TV shows of people trying to live off the land for an extended length of time, and in order to prevent cast member endangerment and violations of human experimentation laws, they immediately throw all the vegan nonsense right out the window because they know it's bogus. Veganism is only useful for obese people who lack the willpower to eat smaller portions.  They will specifically instruct them to eat dairy, eggs, and red meat (including weird parts of the animals and insects) at any available opportunity.  They won't tell your average fat American that, for obvious reasons, but when they are legally responsible for someone in a contained environment, the truth comes out.<br /><br />Conclusion: Eat real traditional food that doesn't require special & modern legal relaxations to be called \\"food\\". Eat smaller portions. Work out more if you're not already doing hard labor for a living. The corporate processed foods industries hide behind front organizations and easily out-lobby small local farmers. These \\"researchers'\\" careers have been propped-up by them. It is a trend of consolidating power through influence and technology at the expense of those it claims to nourish. Those who profit from these industries are laughing all the way to the bank, after which they're eating, guess what, caviar and fillet minion alongside those veggies.the low, subsidized price we pay for them.

B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Geez! First of all...I cant believe I ordered this...in spite of the trailer...AND, I am not sure why Amazon feels the need to charge 4.99 for a movie...4.99!!! I am pretty sure this will be the last movie I order on Amazon...especially because they have so much crap for sale...NOT GOOD! This movie is like a B movie made for television...late night, you know, 1:00am in the morning when you are suffering from insomnia. The editing is pretty shoddy...like a college kid trying to get his movie on...but failed. Don't bother ordering this...wait for it on netflix or redbox (and only if you are desperate)...just not worth it.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Best DEXTER since John Lithgow season. Funny how some seasons are sooooo much better than others. Different writers? Not sure, maybe different producers. I really disliked last season. But this one was really good.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Hooks you in from start to finish, a great book, can't wait to read the next one in the series
B008NW1M4K|3.0|After reading all other comments I've thought this must be a book where you can laugh all the time, but this not really the case.<br />The most time you can only smile a lite bit. And the ending is not really what I've awaited.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I give this book five stars! It read really well! I couldn't wait for next page. I especially loved that Jace was really her brother. I thank you for writing it. Now I need to read all of them.
B0091VTISO|2.0|Painful to watch. While I get the &#34;male domination&#34; stuff, the violence was overwhelming. I think the purpose of the movie was more to shock audience with the graphics than to enjoy the story line
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|It took me a while to figure out the best strategy but I think I got it. It's very entertaining and I was lost for almost an hour when I did catch on to the strategy. So if your waiting for your DR. apt. and or just want to pass some time get this game!
B000V39KDO|5.0|This Epic tale is a must have and definitely a staple of every collection. Highly recommended and one of my personal All-Time favorites.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|I download ed this movie to pass time in car on a vacation. I'm so glad you get to see the movie for 48hrs. I watched it twice and I could watch it again. Funny thing is I was on a road trip with my mother! I don't want to give away the ending but what he does for his mother is sooo sweet. I love happy endings. Especially when you take away a sense that you have grown watching the struggles of other families and your not so different. I made me want to hug my mom and thank her and tell her I Love you.. n appreciate all the sacrifices she has made for me.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Love it.  Use it all the time.  Would probably look like a dunce without it.  Thank you and keep more like this coming,
B0063IH60K|4.0|This gane is good but a little confusing to operate. Once you figure out how, you can enjoy it, especially checking your answer as you go.
B0093LINVK|4.0|this is a very peppy unit but i would have loved to see USB3 and thunderbolt (yes i know there is one with thunderbolt but its at the expense of that gigabit port)<br /><br />but in my tests it show this little box is great and hope to a improved version soon
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The whole thing is googleplex awesome plus the thing at the back (the glossary of the gods). (Review dictated by 7 year old.)
B000U6BT40|5.0|Right now when there is nothing good on tv, I am happy to find something good to watch.  This is funny.  Rememds me of Picket Fences and a bit like Lost.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My husband is an avid Angry Birds player... so when I saw this I bought it for him.  He seems to like it just fine as he is playing it every evening on his Kindle
B006DQ1J0K|5.0|Wow.  The cast is superb but Cornell Macniel's singing is stunning.  Not a huge fan of Mr. Bergonzi  but in this role his singing is elegant.  Ms Price is as usual Priceless.  I confess to feeling a little cheated that Silvas first act cabaletta was cut because  I am a big fan of Mr. Tozzi.  I can't wait to go through it all again with the score.  My sincere appreciation to the folks that captured this gem and made it available to this opera fan.  Bravo to the  cast  ( all in heaven now perhaps).
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|My husband loves Angry Birds and plays on his Kindle... so I got him this one since he had done all the others I had gotten him. He doesn't have nor does he want a FB account so this was totally useless.
B004ELSDZK|2.0|Good download and install on my kindle fire. I played? seven levels of the game and do not understand it. I do not know if I won or lost. I do not know what the objective of the game is. Uninstalled it.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Matthew has this part down! The movie moves fast, but it has some of everything in it - comedy, sex, tender moments, drama.It's a really good movie.
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|Slow download too my kindle fire. Play is smooth but graphics are straight from legoland. I love match three games but not this one.<br /><br />The screen is too busy. Top shows characters moving while majority of screen is filled with many objects that when matched do different things.<br /><br />Very fast paced so if you watch characters you cannot look for things to match. For me this game is &quot;too busy&quot; to plan your moves and have a chance of winning. Uninstalled.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|EASY READ, BUT MAKE SURE YOU PAY ATTENTION.  CLEVERLY WRITTEN WITH ENOUGH INFO TO KEEP YOU GOING.  ONCE I MADE IT TO ABOUT THE  MIDDLE OF THE BOOK I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Delivery was quick and was in great condition when it arrived. Was exactly as described. Have not opened it yet and tried to play it since it is a gift. But am pleased with the service and condition.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a great series for the sole. The characters are nice people, though not perfect. The stories are simple but universal. There is no vilolence. A nice break from crime dramas.
B00846REIS|4.0|Enjoyed it, liked the plot,  too much like 50 Shades.. try \\"beautiful bastard\\" by Christinia Lauren, it started the whole trend!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is a must have app. Gives you clear idea of how much fuel your tablet still has. Usually free apps run plenty of ads or spam. This is aceptable.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|this game is addicting, it's not too challenging initially but wait until you're near the end...I'm stuck on day 78 but determined to figure it out!
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|The charger worked great at charging; I had no problems with that. The problem I do have is it keeps losing the connection to my MacBook Pro. VERY aggravating! I will be looking into returning this product.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I use this app on my android phone and on a small tablet. Both of those were downloaded from Google Play Store. The Visual Land is not approved for Google Play Store so I downloaded it from Amazon. When you open it, you get a black screen.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|The characters are very well devloped so it doesn't take long before you are rapped up in their daily lives of service to the rich. Life changes with times and with the death of a character. Very good read....
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|In my opinion, this is Dahl's best book. He has crated a wonderful character as his young heroine. Matilda is delightful and indomitable. The pacing of the story is brisk, and there are many surprises that will appeal to youthful readers. This is a masterpiece. Great conclusion, also.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is our book club read and in the beginning due to the subject matter really didn't want to read. I am so thankful that I read this book. The story is told through the eyes of the person going through Alzheimer which was warm and very thought provoking. You think it's hard to take care of a person with Alzheimer just try to live in their shoes and this book brings you to that level. Their daily life of what life was is changing everyday as they try to hold on to the memories. Very well written and a page turner. I started the book and could not put it down and ended up finishing it in a day. All in the book club loved the book as well. A must read to get you to see another side of Alzheimer through eyes of the victim and not the caregiver.
B00061QK02|2.0|Uggh. Imaging a Saturday Night Live skit looped back to back for two hours.  It was funny for a few minutes, and they you just hope Ron Burgundy would take a long walk off a short pier.  It's so sad that so many people remember San Diego because of this movie.<br />jf
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. my grandson got me hooked on this and it helps me to past the time away while waiting at the dr.s office
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I like electronic music. I've been a new and growing fan of Daft Punk. When I first heard this album I could quickly hear the disco influences all over it. I'm not a big disco fan but I kept listening. The more I listen to it the more I love it. This album will be on heavy rotation in my mix!
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I own the Blokus board game and love to play but it is not easy  to find three other people to play with. Thanks for this great app.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Fantastic film,well done. Well acted, and warm love the ending as well, would highly recommend this movie,put it on you must see list.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Each episode is great, I love the dynamic between Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberpatch - they bounce off each other perfectly. The only problem is that season 1 is all of 3 episodes and Season 2 isn't much longer. But, they're good quality.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Lots of action. The z1corvette was awesome and you get to see and hear the car a lot. Big guns Arnold is funny and the fight scene at the end od the movie is believable. Thumbs up. Stay tuned for arnolds next movies. Ten, the tomb, and Conan the legend.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|This is a masterfully done detective trilogy which also talks about spies, violence against women, human rights, corrupt governments, corrupt capitalists, dying dynasties, hackers and a fascinating fiction on Aspergers Syndrome. It's nigh perfect.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Catching the animals is awesome.  I love the adventure of it. Breeding and crossbreeding give a unique flair with the dinosaurs.
B005X7HAAS|5.0|Awesome film and great blu ray quality.  Kitano violence is perfectly suited for blu ray -- heightens the effect.  A must have for any Kitano fan.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Great item..features the cave system that kids like.. fun to build and love the overall design a great Lego addition
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Love Kelly Clarkson so I had to have this CD!  Really happy to have all the songs I love and ones I didn't realize I loved all on one CD.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|Their music is still solid, corrosive, acid... and now (with this third album)... they become obscure & dark.<br /><br />I liked this album a lot. It's got an space on the pedestal of my music collection.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm almost has too many choices. Great for those who want total control! May be too complicated for those who just want a simple alarm. I highly recommend this app!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Had an old pharos 360 receiver for my CarPC and had issues with looooong acquires and dropping acquisitions too easily. Saw the price on this and figured why not try it out. Boy I'm glad I did. This thing acquires extremely fast, has about twice as many sats at all times compared to my old one, and doesn't have the port connection issues my old one had either. I am very pleased.
B00CRW2066|5.0|The album is beautiful from start to finish. The songs feel really familiar by the 2nd listen.  \\"I should live in Salt\\" is such a beautiful start to one of their strongest albums ....steady mesmerizing guitar and lyrics with a very emotional and powerful chorus!!!.  Some of my favorite music from this band is on this disc....\\"this is the last time\\", \\"slipped\\", \\"pink rabbits\\", \\"sea of love\\", to name a few.  How does this album compare to their others? It's as good as anything they've done in the past (Alligator, Boxer, High Violet, etc).  I'm Not sure if \\"Trouble will Find Me\\", however, a new music obsession has found it's place for the next few years has!  Thank You \\"The National\\"
B003KVNV4S|5.0|this album makes the hair on my tender places stand on end and simultaneously fulfills my sexiest of fantasies! Woo! I Need A Mint!
B000OP1M6M|5.0|this item it perfect it exactly what I want work the way I want it so thanks  you I like it
6305212112|5.0|Thought this was a good movie for older kids and adults.  The storyline has some very funny parts, but it also hit home with the condition of racism that existed in our country.  Love the relationship between these two women, don't we all have that one best friend that we talk about everything with.  Taught me that friendship is a rare gift.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is what I call a nice story good holiday read<br />Likeable people for the most part<br />With a lovely ending.
B00008G8LG|5.0|I loved the original version of this movie so how could I not love the new version with Jodie Foster.  The movie stayed pretty close to that of the original film.  This is kind of a girlfriend movie, men would not get it.  The musical score is good and you find yourself singing the songs long after the film is over.  A definite must have for your movie collection.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This story twists and turns every few pages,<br />All characters well defined and believable.<br />Keeps you guessing right to the end.
B000B8QG22|4.0|This was an interesting mix of seriousness and comedy.  In this we see the serious and painful sides of the Vietnam was but receive relief from the intesity of the time with Robin William's comedic classic style.  This would be a good husband and wife movie, but if you are bothered by swearing and language or adult situations I would not recommend it to you.  Just be aware that it does have those elements so you aren't surprised.  However, it is a great movie that I enjoy very much
B0038YWPZS|5.0|She had a small list of movies that she wanted for Easter. I buy the people in my family movies instead of a lot of candy for Easter. She loves this movie and the Limited Keepsake Edition was perfect for her! Thanks!
B00005JMCW|5.0|The is a classic.  We owned the DVD for years and lost it on one of our trips.  We are happy to have it back in our library.  This movie is great for kids and adults alike.
B00005JPSM|5.0|I loved this movie... I never saw the German movie, so I had nothing to compare this movie to but still enjoyed this movie very much! It is sad, funny, and endearing! I loved the ending! Enjoy!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Wonderful app for consuming content feeds. In most respects better than tootle reader. Swiping is easy and intuitive. Only flaw is that saved items are saved in perpetuity - no way to delete them.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are two of my favorite actors. Love the movie, it is funny, touching, engaging, and Betty White is in it too... can't go wrong!!!
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Jo Nesbo didn't disappoint me, I really loved this book. I am still feeling overwhelmed by the evnts as I could hardly believe it. If you liked the Snowman and the Leopard you will surely like this one too.
076781326X|5.0|A wonderfully entertaining film that we never get tired of seeing.  Our grandchildren struggled a bit with their interest levels.  However, that's the whole point of getting it.  The children need to balance their viewing, which is almost entirely animated features, with a dramatic story which includes historical, sociological and artistic components.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|Watched this on a trip to Williamsburg.  Sweet and entertaining. Enjoyed by a 9 yr. old girl, 13 yr.  old boy and mom too.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Absolutely THE best show on TV these days in a world of reality television!  Hats off to The Good Wife!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was disappointed in the book. It was a phone in. I expected more for the last in the series.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Really fun but there are only 5 world's. I thought that I was buying the full version but it isn't  the full version. You have to pay1$ after you buy this one to get the full version!
B009IF7V2S|5.0|The movie itself is archetypal Will Ferrell, for all of you fans out there and the bonus is that is great quality!
B000I8JF3W|5.0|I loved this, have seen it at least 5 times, above expectation.  this is all I can say about this
B004LP601S|5.0|I can't say enough about how awesome this CD is!! I have loved Panic ever since their first album and I was a little nervous they may not sound the same minus some members. However, this is honestly my new favorite album...not just of Panic's, but just favorite period! I could go on and on about how fun, different, and catchy these songs are. I can't even pick a favorite, but songs 4, 7, and 8 have to be at the top of the list. It is rare to find a CD that every single song is fantastic on, but this is a rare exception to the rule for sure!! I recommend this whole-heartedly to any fan of Panic or any others in this genre! :) :)
B0089LOG02|4.0|It's a bit contrived in its parallel plotline, but deals with a very interesting piece of history and deals with it in an interesting way.
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|This app WAS working great. I use it for work. But now it closes in the middle of my projects. Can you fix this please. I need it to work again. It did cost ten bucks.
B009R659L8|4.0|Bought this book and  could have finished it in one sitting so I have to make myself put it down otherwise I would finish way to fast. All because Mary Higgins Clark can write in away that keeps you connected to her characters and you just want to know how it all ends.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This sb illegal it takes ur money but doesn't credit the app for the credits. Developer nvr follows thrum on support tickets u have to call amazon to have it credited. What a pain an a lot of tracking. Eventually u get annoyed an delete the app.at least I did. Kindle fire User.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is my must-have road trip CD. This group has an inimitable sound and extremely interesting musical style. They don't fall into my usual genre, but I'm so happy to have discovered their existence. My favorite song is &#34;Lion Heart&#34;. The lead female singer has a lovely voice and just a faint trace of accent that I find charming.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Wonderful performances by everyone. Special effects are amazing and the score will keep your emotions flowing with the drama. Great job!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Some artists get a little ho-hum after years of success, but Michael Buble has never let me down. He does the expected standards in his cool &#34;snazzy&#34; style and this time he has included quite a few original new tunes that I find myself humming unexpectedly. Also bought this CD for my mom for Mother's Day when I realized she liked him, too, when he appeared on TV. I've seen him perform live. Michael Buble is so charismatic, unaffected and talented...I am forever a fan.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I've been wanting this movie for a while.  When I saw this movie for sale on Amazon I thought ,\\"Wow, there's my movie and the price is only $xxxx!  Amazing!!!  Of course I ordered it right there and then!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Very boring with unnecessary details of sexual activity.  Poorly written.  Don't know what all the fuss was about.  Couldn't even be bothered finishing the book.  A must NOT read.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Very moving. Bradley Cooper, De Niro story are superb. Really is funny and moving for anybody who knows someone who has struggled with life's ups and downs. The ending is not to be missed.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|The author had an incredible imagination, but it was difficult to read the descriptions of the animals who prey upon each other in the boat.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Ok. So. A few days ago it was the app of the day and I got it for free. After I got it I played right away. It was awesome and its just like cut the rope.<br /><br />Yes, you might say it's a little hard but you'll get used to it. Besides, it just gets harder and harder........(:  You'll be fine.
B005ISZRES|5.0|This is a classic book, a good look at life in another time.  I read it about 40 years ago and did a book report in 7th grade.  (not sure students even do book reports anymore!)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. I play it daily. There are some drawbacks if something is too close to something else it wont allow you to click on anything until whatever is in the way is moved.
B004JK61K0|3.0|We need a Thunderbird port to Kindle Fire. If there is one, someone please point me to it. Thank You in Advance.
B0091REZMW|4.0|other people should play if the like hidden object games I love all hidden object games and if other people like these times of games you will love this one too
B001K3EXTA|5.0|rented this one, after seeing the current one with de caprio. Liked Redford's version better- he says \\" old sport\\" less contrived- de caprio over emotes, sometimes looked pained in his effort to trump Redford. however, I liked the new daisy much better than Mia farrow.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I am really enjoying following the experiences of Rachel, Kurt and Santana in NYC and I'm glad that they haven't just disappeared from the lives of the current members.  I am also glad that Marley's mom is struggling with weight issues, and that the show's writers haven't avoided tackling controversial issues like gay marriage and school shootings.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|It was awesome just like the other M.I.'s.  I will watch it again someday.  I have to write 6 more words.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Pretty good I would rent it again no doubt about it. Hope there is a sequel that would be awesome!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is awesome! It was pretty slow at first, but once you get to higher levels you unlock minigames and stuff. The only thing I don't like is that you have to be in wifi range. But it might be different for you so I totally recommend this game.
1609613937|5.0|Dr. McDougall is a pioneer.  Years from now people will realize that guys like him were ahead of their time.
B0063NUPQC|5.0|Simon, arguably one of the greatest songwriters and lyricists of this century never fails to disappoint.<br /><br />Each album since &#34;Graceland&#34; has been a masterpiece and an inspiration.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the underrated &#34;Surprise&#34;.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It was a gift for my son and he loves the movie.  It's an old time favorite and makes you laugh.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Love this Movie shows us older people in a positive light.  Lets you see everyone can do, regardless of age.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I have enjoyed this series but I thought it was a series of 3 books and I was left hanging in this one. I certainly hope there is a next book so I can resolve the cliff hanger at the end.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. I never tire of seeing it. The music and humor are the best!
030758836X|1.0|This book is pure nonsense. The author appears to be so engrossed by the 'complex' psychology of her characters, that she fails to even consider the 'detective' aspect of the narrative. A little bit of concerted investigation on the part of the police officers could have easily uncovered any number of holes in Amy's story. And the ending - oh come on, really?
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Heard one of her songs listening to the iheartradio app one day and been obsessed since :)<br /><br />I definitely recommend this CD!
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|Smoking hot playing all the way around highlights Airbournes 3rd release. Of coarse theres the old school AC/DC sound. But on this album they pull out a lot of Def Leppard era High N Dry sounds. Straight forward no BS Rock n Roll.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This the only thing I use to message my friends it's such a great app! It's awesome for the Kindle Fire. If you don't want a rip off get this app.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|I knew this album would be good but not this good. Burning Rain reminds a lot of Led Zeppelin and in a good way. Monster riffs through out this album. And the vocals and drumming are top notch. Very highly recommened to anyone.

B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner..couldn't stay away from it ! The twist in the story really took me by surprise. I really enjoyed this book.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Although this is not as good as the first of the three, it held my attention and provided more than a few exciting moments. I like the character of Lisbeth Salander and know someone who is very much like her (but without the phenomenal memory and hacking expertise). There is no doubt that I will continue with the final book in the series. In fact, I've already started it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album contains all her hit songs PLUS many other beautiful songs. I'm very glad I got this lovely CD.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could not put this book down. Did not see movie and I am glad that I read the book. Characters were. Wonderful. A must read for all.
B00499NHLC|1.0|The quality of the streaming was terrible. I want a refund.  It was start and stop and very sporadic.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Schwarzenegger, Knoxville and the rest of the cast deliver in this movie! Starts out kinda slow, but this is my new favorite Schwarzenegger movie. Watch it, you wont be disappointed!
B005PK57IK|5.0|totally hooked... everyone's character is well played... love Kalinda... looking forward to watching the fourth season, will there be a 5th?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I hope you all play MY HORSE.<br />it is the greatest game I have played in a while.the horses are awesome and the activates are great
B00364K6YW|3.0|Perhaps it's because I saw the feature film starring Keira Knightly first, but I found this version of P&P to be a little unweildy. I was also shocked at how poorly acted Lizzie Bennett was. I had thought I liked Jennifer Ehle's work better but I was surprised to not be very engaged by her. Colin Firth was wonderful. Now that I think of it, all of the Bennetts were pretty much over-acting, save Jane who was decidedly under-acting. And why was it that Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle) was the only one wearing makeup? She of all the girls would least likely be wearing the stuff (save Mary I think.) That was weird.<br /><br />This version is much truer to the book than the movie but I found myself really respecting where the movie chose to amalgamate characters and condense scenes.<br /><br />Any P&P fan will be gratified by watching this version but it's not my favorite.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|read all four Heat books. They definitely get better as they proceed through the series. Anxiously awaiting the fifth in September
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I love this series. It's one of the most exciting things on TV these days. I'll definitely be watching the next season.
0316286850|5.0|Is the best book about make up, and Kevin is the best make up artist, is easily to understand, and pictures is great
0670022705|5.0|This book was sent to me as a gift. After reading about the credit card and the solar lamp I was hooked. This magnificent volume can be read--and reread--at the rate of one or two chapters at a time. Professionals or history buffs may disagree with some of the interpretations but that is inevitable for any book on history. As to the illustrations, I consider them quite adequate. Online on a BBC website about this project you can view many of the illustrations in exquisite detail.
034580404X|5.0|I know a lot of people hated this book or thought it was full of \\"mommy porn\\", truth said, there's a lot of graphic sex... But it's the story I fell in love with.  The unconditional love Christian shows Ana is the very thing every woman yearns for.  The fact that it was only Ana that matter to him; he was hers and she was his and nothing else mattered.  Yes, all the holy cow's, etc. do get annoying but the reason Anastasia says all these awkward little comments is because she's suppose to be inexperienced (a Virgin), naïve, innocent-- which is what attracted Christian Gray in the first place.  Spoiler Alert: Glad it had a happy ending.. Just like every good [erotic]love story should :)
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A book about a mysterious and dour world that is full of suspense, beautiful and terrifying imagery, and plot turns by the boatload. I have no idea what North Korea is like, and hope that the portrayal here is actually not factual, but in any case this portrait of distopia and despair sprinkled with the endurance of human spirit is an amazing read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have watched from the beginning and it is one of the most addictive tv series I have ever watched.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a terrible book and not because of the sexual content but because of the poor manner in which it is written. I have always thought the Twilight saga's were written by a fourth grader. This beats those hands down. But I guess he wanted to appeal to people with a low IQ so, thumbs up!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I think that it is a great game,but the suits are hard to get its actually a challenge so it's fun
B0000X2EOW|4.0|This is really awesome. I love the cards in there that discribe all the goblins. My kids are going to love this movie.....even more so when I tell them that this movie was one I watched at their age.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was on special last month and I bought it.  I really enjoyed it. It is worth the read even not on special. It kept me interested the entire time but I wish it had a different ending.  The ending was a good one but not the one I would have chosen.  Reading about the abuse in the orphanage that was actually pretty accurate was disturbing.  Hard to imagine that religious people would have treated children in this manner.  The characters were well developed and enjoyable.
B00CVFTDKU|5.0|The most extraordinary story ever, written & produced by Chris Chipnall, one of the top British writers today. A Brilliant cast, featuring the cream of British actors. The best drama of the year, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. The locations for this film are beautiful.<br /><br />The body of a 11 year old boy is found on the beach in Dorset, England. The murder and following investigation create a chain reaction that will tear this small seaside town apart. A town wrapped in secrets, like most small towns anywhere in the world, and they become known as the investigation proceeds. The Murderer remains veiled until the final episode and a surprise and more importantly the reason.<br />The two investigators, DI Hardy a harden, efficient, and blunt outsider with the reputation for failure - played brilliantly by David Tennant - and DS Miller a sensitive and friendly local - played by the extraordinary Olivia Coleman. The interactions between these two is amazing - some of the best dialog and zingers - like when Miller tells Hardy \\"leave me alone or I will piss in a cup and throw it on you.\\" - Or when Hardy tells Miller \\"I pray nightly that you will leave me alone.\\"  The remaining Cast is spectacular - you can actually feel the grief and suspicion coming from their characters.  The film is well worth getting if you like great drama and great acting.<br /><br />This film is 8 episodes or about 6 hours, so you don't have to watch all at once but I bet once you start watching, you won't want to stop. I purchased my DVD from Amazon.co.uk, which I got in late May of 2013 - about 9 months ahead of the American region 1 version going on sale and play on a multi-region DVD player or my computer.
159463176X|3.0|I have waited with bated breath for his 3rd novel, I absolutely loved the first 2 books he wrote.  I am really disappointed in this book.  He is still a wonderful wirter, but I find the story jumps so erratically, and the links are so vague.  Each time he jumps character it takes a paragraph or two to even know who the latest subject is.<br />This book is still worth the read, but if you have read and fallen in love with his previous 2 books as I did, you might be in for disappointment.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this alarm clock. it is the only one I use now. it is great for traveling also. I love that you set it for what days you need it.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|This movie was extremely touching and well done, but it was so depressing that I could not watch it a second time.
B003XQPYR2|3.0|Well, Russell Crowe is great as always, but some of the &#34;facts&#34; weren't great.  We all know and understand about creative license, but...I couldn't let it slide on this one.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its nothing like the old school Oregon trail...but more like a ville game...energy runs out fast..and in app purchases are expensive..but if you can wait for the free ones...that this can be played with no money needed
B000I9YV30|5.0|This is an awesome movie and deserves 10 stars, however I wanted to try out a movie on my Kindle and it just didn't have great resolution.  Should've known better....

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've had this mouse for a month or two and have absolutely no issues. This mouse has very high DPI and lots of cool features like 9 programmable buttons (with certain restrictions) and you can change the color of the emblem light and change whether or not it pulses and how fast it does so. You can change the DPI on the fly with the press of a button on the top of the mouse. You can also enable or disable audio recording to the mic you have installed with the press of a button. This mouse was made for me and I love it!
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I saw all the original broadcasts in 1964 and these videos transported me back in time.  I thought they were great.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|If you need something to read, pick this up. God, it was really good. The best I've read in a really long time.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|My wife and I are both huge RPG and puzzle game fans, and playing this on our tablet (an HP Touchpad running cyanogen) we had a blast! While it is technically not a two player game, it was great fun to cuddle up and work together to beat it. I got it as a free app of the day, but I definitely would have bought it had I known about it previously, and I'll be keeping my eye on this developer for sure.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was a little apprehensive because this season was surrounded by war.  However, it did not disappoint!!  Can't wait for season 3.  Amazon- please make it prime ASAP!!!

B0025KVLTC|5.0|Classic rock and roll.  Possibly the Beatles' best. Buy it or go back to listening to Justin Bieber.  Just buy it.  You'll be glad you did.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This thriller had me going right until the end. I had no idea what was going on. Did the two hits Robie, the hero, carried out in the beginning have anything to do with what happened next or were they just background showing what the character did before his life fell apart? I was guessed right along with the character until all was revealed.<br /><br />I'll admit I had my suspicions about one character and they turned out to be true, but I wasn't expecting some of his allies to end up still being allies in the end. That was a surprise.<br /><br />This fast-paced and intriguing story was well-written, in solid third person and the author didn't head-hop enough that I found it hard to read. Mr. Baldacci clearly knows his craft (or has some great editors keeping him straight). I liked the characters and the way it ended.<br /><br />A satisfying and enjoyable read. Highly recommended.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a great game that keeps getting harder with each level. It's entertaining, addicting, and crazy fun!  Great to pass the time.

B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I believe it develops coordination - I think there is a kind of Therapy in this game - it improves as you practice - it may seem violent - the Birds are certainly angry with the Piggies - but in its essence ot is calming and helps concentration to develop
B008602KQI|5.0|Very entertaining. I hadn't read the book but if the movie is this good the books are probably great too!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The first half of Gone Girl is a description of two wonderful people in seemingly a tragic relationship and a deepening mystery about a girl's disappearance.  The story is written with alternate chapters from alternate characters view points.  One set is from the viewpoint of the lead male character.  The other consists of diary entries from the lead female character.  The first half tends to be slow and sometimes seems to be meandering.  Stick with it.  It's worth it.  Halfway through the novel the tone changes.  Saying very much more would be tough without destroying the story. The book is a lot of fun.
B0042UE0RS|3.0|Not one of the best songs, but still a very important song from a historical perspective.  At better than I-tunes prices, it was a must have for my digital library.
B000W93CHC|5.0|An incredible and exciting story.  Well researched era and believable characters are brought to life in this great book.  Ken Follett 's best book (they are all good some better than others)  I have been staying up past my bed time reading chapter after chapter of a detailed but fast paced story of people I feel I know.  My only problem is that I know the book will end .
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|if you like bejewled then you'll love this. a great puzzle game that there's always a way out of a predicament even if you have to look, although you better look fast
038533348X|3.0|some undergrad who didn't give a f*** about the book made a bunch of blotchy highlight smudges and half a**ed liner notes that amounted to a C- (at best), but they sent it fast and Vonnegut's beauty can make even the dullest of... well, a dullards scribbling's worth it and even hilariously ironic when the type of people he's making fun of in his books are not only not getting it, but writing some inane bulls*** that makes Vonnegut glad he's finally dead. amazon, you messed a little, but not that bad. no hard feelings, pal?

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|It really draws the reader in.  A good , clean book for my middle schooler daughter and she is anxious to finish the series.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|I have seen the movie four times, each time I find it just as exhilarating as the first. The soundtrack is crisp and clean, the cinematography the same, and the acting is great. The dialogue while Khan is held in custody on the Enterprise reminded me of the dialogues back in the original series. I loved the movie and hope another is made.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I never really knew what the good wife was about until I happen to watch an episode of season one and I was hooked.  This is the smartest show on T.V. I get it and I love it.
B000VSYDRM|5.0|This film is another of many directed by Tom Tykwer, a particularly inventive German director who works frequently with American actors.  There's also a book,which I haven't read. Ben Whishaw is a very talented actor, who has appeared in a great many different roles, including Ariel in Shakespeare's The Tempest, with Helen Mirren as Prospera; Bright Star, directed by Jane Campion, about  John Keats, the great British Romantic poet who died very young and his girlfriend, Fanny Brawne; and done a superb job in each of these very different roles, Whishaw also appears in Tykwer's Cloud Atlas, as a musician.<br /><br />In Perfume, Whishaw plays a man raised in utter poverty in 18th Century Paris after his mother gives birth to him in the Paris market and tries to throw him away in the garbage. He is called Grenouille (Frog) from birth. He survives relentlessly because something is driving him to persist in spite of neglect, abuse and savage attacks in the worst slums of Paris.  He is driven by a love of smells: he makes no distinction between good and bad smells, just any smell fascinates him.  Finally he accidentally bumps into The Smell he's been searching for when he makes a delivery to a formerly famous Paris Perfumer (Dustin Hoffman) who is down on his luck, and Hoffman realizes thiat this grubby, inarticulate person is a genius who will save Hoffman's declining business.<br /><br />What Hoffman's character doesn't realize is that Grenouille wants to distill young women into perfume. It's not clear just how this might be done in real life; all we know is that Grenouille stalks them, kills them, and hangs them up in a huge tub of  some liquid element until out of each body a small vial of perfume emerges.  He moves to the town of Grasse, where the French perfumers thrive: the town has become rich from their success.  There he proceeds to capture his victims and make them into different bottled scents.  Finally his evil doings are discovered and he is sentenced to a public execution (decapitation) in front of an immense crowd of angry Perfumers in the city.  I can't reveal just how he rescues himself from this situation, which is too bad because it's one of the best moments in any movie I've seen . . . the entire town suddenly adores him when he waves a handkerchief doused with his girl-distilled perfume at them.<br /><br />This book is based on a novel I haven't read.<br /><br />Barbara Guetti

0596009208|5.0|This book approaches learning Java from a slightly different angle. Its not a reference book so don't expect it to be. You need another source for reference.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I don't use 1/4 of the functions this mouse is capable of, but I do like the adjustable DPI. Just pressing 1 button cycles me through 4 programmable settings, and though I only use 2 of them, that is really handy. I also like way the rest of the mouse feels, and I have a couple of the other buttons programmed as well. I added all the weights to the mouse, and though I feel the difference when I pick it up, I'm not sure I can tell how it affects my mousing...
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written, highly recommend, I had never heard of this happening here. It was a good concept, too bad there are evil people in the world that take advantage of  innocent children.

B005PK57IK|4.0|quality of this show has not lessened but the plots are getting a little repetitive. still is a good show w/ a decent storyline.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe and friends always entertain, although I liked the &#34;Live at Royal Albert Hall&#34; somewhat better, I did enjoy Beth Hart on this one.  To true Joe fans, you'll love them all, even if this won't be the favorite. I own them all and for the best, ( in my opinion), the classic showcase, see the Vienna DVD.  It is a spectacular showcase of talent that really show us what Joe is made of and how he has grown over the years.

David is a master writer, who shares his detailed information unstintingly  with authors of any level. I can't wait to read his next offering and will be sure to apply whatever I've learned.

1250012570|4.0|I very much enjoyed Eleanor And Park. It was a warm and charming love story that started on a school bus. I loved watching their story unfold through comic books and music. Although at times the love story felt a bit too angsty and saccharine at parts, it also felt realistic. It felt like teenage love, where you everything seems infinitely more important. And it was okay to be unsure of yourself. I am usually not one for romances filled with endless love proclamations, but Eleanor and Park is so much more than that. Although I had gripes with character development, I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend this novel. Definitely one of the best I've read so far this year.<br /><br />Misfits? Who?<br />The blurb calls Eleanor and Park, \\"two star-crossed misfits.\\" But I have to disagree with that. I didn't feel either of them were \\"misfits,\\" other than their physical appearances. They were not exactly misfits because everyone shunned them, but because they were so enamored with each other, everyone else was an annoyance to them. Or they never try to make friends in the first place, especially Eleanor. And then she blames it on her appearance. All of the \\"friend\\" characters had to approach them. Eleanor and Park were supposed to be these funny, \\"cool\\" people--but I didn't want to be their friend.<br /><br />Eleanor is made to be a misfit more because she is fat, has curly red hair, and wears weird clothes than because of her family circumstances. I found her family situation heartbreaking. It is what made the story addicting. I wanted to know more about her troubled family life, especially her mother. For me, Eleanor's mother was the most intriguing character in the entire novel because of her conflicting emotions and her role in the family as a loving mother and good wife. And perhaps being divorced once has made her feel unloved to the point she can't easily walk away from domestic abuse. And I wanted a lot more backstory for Eleanor's step-father. However, Eleanor's dysfunctional family is often overshadowed by her eccentric clothing (which I see as more of a personal choice than something forced upon her.) Despite these gripes, I didn't mind Eleanor's constant attention to her personal appearance (though I don't think she really cares about remedying the situation.) Because that is what teenage girls do. I still wish she would own up to her fashion choices though and be like, \\"This is my style, deal with it.\\" Oh, and apparently can't afford toothbrushes, so she has to rub salt on her teeth. I'd hate to imagine her dental hygiene.<br /><br />I liked Park for being a minority. I feel there needs to be more minorities in YA literature, ones that aren't used as cheap plot devices. You know how those stories go: ethnic kid goes to new school where everyone are vicious, racist bullies and then somehow everyone realizes they're wrong. And then all the bullies apologize and everybody cheers. And then confetti falls. THE END. Park broke that stereotype. Despite his personal insecurities, People liked him. He had friends. What a miracle! However, here's where my gripes come out. I only liked him because he was Asian. Take that quality away from him, and he wouldn't be so special anymore. In fact, I was bored of him by the second half. I only wanted to figure out Eleanor's family.<br /><br />Let's Talk About Being Asian-American:<br />Even though I am Asian American, I can't relate to Park. This is not a fault of the novel at all. I've been raised in a very different time and place, and have never once felt uncomfortable with being Asian (though I wouldn't mind being about a feet taller.) Perhaps because of my cultural background, my radar is alert (this just made me sound like a cyborg) when I come across Asian culture in literature. For the first time in a long while, I enjoyed how Asian-American culture was portrayed. Perhaps because Park is only half-Korean that many of the cultural aspects were left out. Park's family seemed much more\\"American\\" than \\"Asian,\\" and I was completely fine with it. I didn't mind the focus being on Eleanor and Park, and their teenage romance. I'm VERY grateful that Rowell didn't use this opportunity to throw in a bunch of Korean words into the dialogue. Instead, the Korean accent is tackled in a much more subtle and humorous way. If I had a nickel for every misused Chinese word I've come across recently, I'd be rich. Stop using Google Translate, people!<br /><br />Comic Book and Music References, Thank God I Read This After Watchmen:<br />Coincidently, when I got my hands on Eleanor and Park from the library, I was also assigned to read Alan Moore's Watchmen for school. Thankfully I finished Watchmen before I started Eleanor and Park, so I wasn't spoiled. (But really, why did the ending have to be spoiled? Or a I just the last person on Earth that hasn't read Watchmen) Eleanor and Park is filled with comic book and music references--many of which went over my head. I only heard of The Smiths because two of their songs were on the 500 Days of Summer soundtrack. Shame on me.<br />I'm glad that these music/comic book references didn't take away from the story. I think there always has to be a balance with references to pop culture. While they help set the scene in a specific time period, too much of them can alienate the reader. I found that balance was done well, and I appreciated them. Not because I knew all the references, but because the romantic idea of walkmans, vinyl records, comic book serials, and MIXTAPES did a wonderful job reminding me that it was the eighties, a time where mixtapes had to be painstakingly made with CASSETTE TAPES instead of dragging song files on ITunes. If someone took the time to make a mixtape for you, it meant something.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Eleanor and Park's story. I am usually not a \\"contemporary\\" romance reader (though it is set in the mid eighties, but to call it an historical sounds like something from the WWII era,) but Rainbow Rowell just won me over. Despite being a YA novel, I feel this book will also be a good fit for older adults--for nostalgic reasons. Now, onto Attachments!<br /><br />P.S. Don't read this book if you plan to read Watchmen for the first time sometime in the near future.\\"American\\" than \\"Asian,\\" and I was completely fine with it.

B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|The movie is entertaining and it is well made. However, the story makes absolutely no sense. I am sure there is a point to the story, but I guess I was not smart enough to figure it out.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I downloaded this for my daughter since she loves My Little Ponies, but I really didn't like the idea of having to &#34;buy&#34; upgrades and additional ponies. I think that a game geared towards kids should give them opportunities to earn their way through the game. I don't like that games give the incentive that you can skate through the game if you buy everything-what does that teach people? I would rather pay up front and let my daughter earn her way through the game.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It's so cool to be able to watch a series from beginning to end in such a short time.  I knew the Good Wife was a good show when I continually felt compelled to put off watching other programs I had recorded to continue watching Season 1 of the Good Wife on Amazon Prime.  Now that I've watched all of Season 1, I have started Season 2 (also free with Amazon Prime.)  The Good Wife is a story about a woman standing by her man when he is caught in a political sex scandal.  The scripted storyline of the &#34;Good Wife&#34; is well thought out.  The whole idea of standing by your man makes most married women cringe, but Julianna Margulies portrays &#34;The Good Wife&#34; with such courage, soul, and intelligence, that most women will not find her decision objectionable.  Marriage is complicated, and this show portrays that well.
B0012Q732O|5.0|This movie keeps one interest throughout......well directed, great scenery....this movie is about survival, love, and family staying together....the prehistoric predators well depicted...great colors, very entertaining....
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that this game is worth the 7$ !!!! It is a a fun game . I had never played it before<br />And now I love it!!!!!!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|What a way to depict the end of the earth.....this movie, slow to begin with, however you need the background to know where science is coming from.....edge of your seat movie.....have plenty of popcorn prior to viewing.....a must see, if not seen yet...........
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very intriguing can't wait to start the next book then the movie yayyyy...... thanks cousin for recommending this book but the sex scenes get to boring
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, I got it when it was in NYC (my home town), and I found it to be really, fun, and I liked the &#34;clinking&#34; sounds of collecting coins, although I didn't actually like the music. It's a simple game, and I feel like it's what Temple Run tries to be. It moves to a different city every month or so, so it doesn't get to repetitive and boring.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it five stars, and the reason I stopped playing it so much, was because it cleared all my data, money, and the characters and boards I worked hard to open up. That ended my addiction. Now I only play it sparingly. It's still fun, but I know what can happen, so I'm not going to try and get special items, especially limited edition ones.
B009AMANH4|5.0|very good movie,it goes into telling about Lincoln and his fight to free the slaves,very enjoyable to watch,the acting is excellent and well done
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I had the first Temple Run, and it was fun. When the second came out, it was nice, but it did have some flaws. One of the flaws that technically isn't a flaw is the better graphics. Now that everything looks so extra beautiful, I get distracted and die easily. Then, the controls are a bit different, and require more tilting, which gets annoying on my already overworked wrists. I ended up just deleting this game, because I enjoyed Subway Surfer, and it filled the same need.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|enjoyable movie,it does follow into some ofd the lord of the ring but it has it own plot and is a lot of fun to watch,it is a little long going for 3 hours on 2 dvd,s
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I got this calender because I really needed something to keep up with my appointments and assignments. This calendar does just that. It's really easy to use, I was able to change the color scheme to one that I liked, they have alerts (although I haven't really used any), and the monthly view is one that I like a lot. I've used physical planners in the past, and I usually find that they're good, although space is limited for things. Space is technically cramped when you have a few things on a the same day, but you can easily click on the day to see everything that you need to get done. Another great thing about this calendar are the cute icons! They're ridiculously adorable, even the standard ones. There are other sets of icons that you can purchase for a dollar and some change, and they're just as adorable, and I think worth the money, although I'm cheap and I've yet to purchase them. If you want a basic app that will help you keep track of what you have to do, I suggest this one, it's served me well as I've had it.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|soft, simple, and very beautiful... intimate sounds, a lot of feelings.<br />one of my favorite bands from U.K.<br /><br />it's the kind of music you'd rather listen low.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I got it because it came up as an ad on another game, and it looked kind of fun. While the action of moving the coins is entertaining, and the graphics were nice, it get really, really boring really fast. I uninstalled it almost as quickly as I had it, because it just felt pointless, and I hate wasting space on my Kindle.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Stunning restoration... the movie's great and the colors really pop. You won't believe this movie is 60-plus years old. It looks brand new.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I think this is the Pay version, because that's the one that I really like. It's worth the couple of buck you put down, it plays whatever song you want to wake up to, and it also has some nice basic sounds if you don't have music, including the traditional incredibly annoying alarm sound. It says that you can leave it open and on like a desk light, but I don't really recommend that, even you have your device plugged in. I love the blue analog face, and that you can adjust the screen brightness, and the little weather feature. I use this every day.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Its fun and keeps them occupied for a while. Love all of the Dr. Panda games! They are sweet, easy and the kids enjoy them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The premise of this game is easy, but once you get to level 30 or 40, it gets really, really, challenging, and I like that about it. flow is a fun game, and I feel like people of all ages could enjoy it. It makes you work you brain in ways that I didn't know you could work it, and I'm still no where near fully beating it.
0061692034|5.0|This story held my interest throughout, with very detailed events revealing what made the well-rounded characters do what they did, understandable to the extent any of us can grasp why others do the things they do. I felt I knew these people with all their strengths and weaknesses but even so the story unfolded to change their lives in ways they didn't imagine, just as real life does to people. And the process left me feeling changed as well, haunted by a curious poignancy. The author skillfully laid foreshadowing hints that kept me reading, knowing something really significant lay ahead particularly for the boy and it did. Meanwhile I asked myself why I was not even worried about what was happening to his sister.  With all Ford's attempts to help the reader realize how ordinary people will decide to do things completely alien to themselves, and he made that clear, still he left us on our own, just as the boy was, to deal with the utter strangeness near the end.  The ending, plausible in context, still boggled my mind. Best laid plans gang aft aglae! Hello real world!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I got this game because I love MLP, and I love the idea of having my own Ponyville. The graphics are nice, the small scenes of hearing the characters talk are nice, but the game has too many drawbacks for me to give it four or five stars.<br /><br />The biggest drawback is that they want you to spend real money to move up in the game, and open up different obstacles. Those gems are expensive, and I know I've spent at least 20 dollars on gems to open up specific characters, even when I was working my Ponyville almost all day long. Hasbro is a money hungry company, and it shows. Not only that, they really want you to make friends and pester people, just like a facebook game, and they also want you to bother your facebook friends. Those are definitely negatives that take away. Then I have a few problems with how much time it takes to open up characters, how only certain ones talk, and even those don't have really great lines.<br /><br />If you have the time and money, go right ahead and get this game. If you don't want to spend lots of energy and cash, I wouldn't suggest it. Not only that, I've heard of the game crashing and taking all of the data and work that you've done and spitting it down the toilet.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Five stars for this one.  This game is fun and I recommend it.  It works well and the graphics are great.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I think this is the Pay version, because that's the one that I really like.

B002LYTNR4|5.0|Love this product. CDs came in a timely manner. Packaged  perfectly. No damage. I enjoy all products from Tolle, and this one is no different. Thank you for the great price and quality product. Be here now... is a great thing to practice (no looking back or regretting and no looking forward with anticipation or anxieties). It is a good, tranquil feeling.  Thank you!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a very nice game. It's different from other jewel and level games, because it has a little bit of history at the beginning of each level chapter. I enjoy it, and have beaten it once, but I haven't played it in a while. It's a nice, game, and can be challenging, and I think a lot of people will like it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|WOW, I purchased this book this morning , and really it was one of those books you can't put down!! It's a laugh out load book, 'The way Drew tell's the story from a man's point of view is just so funny!<br />You just can't help but love him! Drew and Kate are perfect!
B000GT7XXW|4.0|The acting was quite good, as expected. The special effects were a bit goofy, though -- when will movie directors learn to accept that less is more with respect to effects? Altogether, it was a worthwhile way to while away four hours of our day.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Finally!  A show that is filled with intrigue, suspense, with just a spoonful of drama.  Nothing like those CW shows, no 90210 drama, no vampires  or zombies.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I've always loved using FP-3000B. The contrast is so wonderful, and the grain shows so clearly and in such a gorgeous way. The fast developing time is only one small reason that I think this film is brilliant. This goes so well with my Polaroid packfilm camera.
B008XX6J4C|1.0|As a classical, conservatory trained musician who has dedicated an entire life work to honoring the tradition of the great composers, I find this type of music extremely offensive. I also love playing jazz and rock improv. I am not a snob by any means.<br />However the \\" Piano Guys\\"  instead of creating any truley original music take \\"snippits\\" of the great Masterworks and sensationalize them with alot of hype and artifice, playing only the basic, least technical aspects of these wonderful pieces. Evidently they count on the fact that most of their audience do not know the harmonic structure , the exquisite crafting and years of deducation to excellence it takes to produce and  perform the music they are bastardizing.<br />Yep, if its flashy enough, uneducated people will eat it up. Doesnt make it right.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great. It provides a challenge that is fun and addictive. I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to think and has some free time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love all the movies and the game is Amazing. its so real and i feel like iron man. I highly recommended it to any fan of iron man.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is perfect. I used to have this app on my IPad , and I loved it. I just recently bought it on my Kindle Fire and  it is AMAZING! Couldn't ask for anything better. I hoped my review helped. This game is perfect. I am addicted to it and I can't stop playing on it! Such good graphics. I like how you can create your own hairstyles and save them. So many different dies to choose from. You can curl/straighten your persons hair! Fun game. It's really cool how you can pick who's hair you would like to design. This app is a must have. It is definitely worth the money! Goodbye!----(:
B003G4W49C|5.0|Extraordynary book, this is one of the best sci-fi books i ever read. From the first page to the last i couldn't stop reading
B00BF123WG|4.0|I thought this movie was all about the actual event, but it went through all the hard work it took to even get to that point.
0812992784|5.0|Sir Salman Rushdie in his memoir meticulously and masterfully takes us on journey of his life from that fateful Valentine's Day in 1989 to after 9/11 when the \\"black birds\\" that started their own journey in 1989 exploded in steam to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Sir Salman Rushdie helps take us on this brave and harrowing journey which showed him the best and worst of human nature. The people of the world who supported his right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression - to the Islamofascists that demanded his death for simply writing literature - and to the cowards in the west that wanted to throw him under the bus instead of standing up for our most cherished values and principles of freedom of speech and freedom of expression. This is a long book but is a must read for those wanting to understand the journey that Salman took throughout those years.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|I have to give credit to Joe Kosinski (the director) for landing this job as his first director gig.  For the most part he did a great job, except (in my opinion) with the directing of actors.<br /><br />I give the visuals 5-stars, but the acting and story just 3-stars.<br /><br />For me the acting, except for Jeff Bridges, was a bit too cartoony for this version.  I think it could have been a really good movie if the characters were realized more seriously, which started from the script.<br /><br />But again, the visuals were fantastic and I love being immersed in that world.<br /><br />Also, Daft Punk's hand at scoring was an outstanding debut.  I bought the score immediately after seeing the film.
0525478817|5.0|Very different book from what I usually read but really loved it.  Will seek out more books by this author.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is a really good adventure and made better with Hans Zimmer's sweeping score.  This Blu-ray is so crisp and clear that it's miles above my old VHS.  Yes, VHS.
B009K0P10K|3.0|The show is great for a guilty pleasure.I would say it was the best but it was great way to waste an hour
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I first bought the Avatar DVD when it was first released, then I bought the Blu-ray, now I finally have the 3D Blu-ray and couldn't be happier.  It's such a great film!  I can't count how many times I've watched it, in any format.  It's just a perfect adventure film.
0545265355|4.0|I liked it because the package was very complete and cheap.<br /><br />The complete set of books is what I wanted, the story is just great!<br /><br />I've seen the same set of books for a more expensive price. Saved a lot and I got the items before due time.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Apart from some less than stellar writing and acting, this was a really fun film and I love the visuals.  I originally saw it in the theaters and cringed when the female first opened her mouth, but it was mostly due to the script than her acting skills.  But I love getting lost in fantasy worlds and this one did it for me, so when Amazon had a really good price for the Blu-ray, I jumped on it.<br /><br />All the effects are really well done and I like anything that Taylor Kitsch is in.
B00CW665VI|4.0|What a refreshing point of view: the male's. These two talked like real people, had real, believable reactions. Buy it, totally worth it.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is awesome and addictive.  It takes you back to the arcades of old. You will spend hours playing this game!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|If you love Hannibal Lecter, you'll thoroughly enjoy HANNIBAL NBC! I'm a HUGE fan and I can't seem to stop watching. So far so good. It'll have you rooting for the lovely psychotic cannibal that is Dr. Hannibal Lecter. :D
B009NY43NY|5.0|So I will declare myself a fan of Ms Harris and all of her writing. I appreciated Sookie being smart, but down to earth.  No reader will ever stop in a small town and think dismissively about the help or the patrons. Ms Harris gives all of her heroines dignity.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I loved everything about this movie!  Extremely well acted.  Powerful subject matter.  My only suggestion would be to have lots of Kleenex at hand.  One of the best movies I've ever seen about the Holocaust.
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|Fun Cd if you liked the movie.  If you haven't seen the movie I don't think you would like the CD, I thought I would enjoy it more, but really it's only OK.  The movie was really funny, but I think I miss the music when I drive down the road listening to the CD.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Dexter us one of my favorite shows.I found Brynn this and season two to be my favorite. I don't killer to reveal much other than, if you made it this far you're probably thinking Dexter is settling in for a semi perfect (through his values) life<br />The roller coaster of Dexter won't disappoint:)
B00785P2QC|4.0|awesome!!!! fun to play!! played for hours and cheap for the in game cash!! definitely recommend to friends!!! really fun to play!!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This is this a fun thing to do. U do not need a camera and its a quick good thing to waste time. Carlianna
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The Kindle app for Android has worked fairly well on my smartphone and tablet. I have used it for over 2 years.  Content is cleanly presented and reasonably easy to navigate.  The functionality of the application scales well between devices of different sizes.  I use devices between with 4.3 and 7 inches.<br />Recently there have been problems with the app crashing with one particular book l purchased.  Fortunately, the app seems to recover gracefully when reopened, and the stability of the device OS never seems to be affected.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Well I think the game is fun and awesome but there's one tiny problem I don't get how you can't go deeper.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I found this book difficult to get into because as soon as you get into the characters the story changes to an entirely different world of people and places.  Although I often like different styles and futuristic stories, I just never adjusted to this one. It is way out there.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game best hill climb racing game I ever played.definitely a five star rated game<br />I also have this game on my iPod but the virson on my kindle is way better
B0042TV4IW|3.0|I got a new Kindle Fire and have been watching all the free videos I can for free with my Prime 30 membership.  This series is interesting but not as  riveting as Downton Abbey or even Upstairs Downstairs.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is fun friendly and it looks awesome also like there's a real horse. I wish there was a faster way to earn energy.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This is not on the same scale as Downton Abbey, but it is very entertaining.  The dialogue is interesting and the plot kept my interest.  I finished all the seasons quickly.  I look forward to more.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Tis is a great book that I enjoyed as a teenager and was able to enjoy again as an adult
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Takes some thought process to get through but worth every penny of the $2 cost. Better than anything I've played so far on the Kindle Fire. Not the same mindless drivel. More pleases!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I had this app for 3 days now and\\" so far it's awesome\\"  I would recommend this app,  still learning how to navigate through it, but it works great
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm a big fan of  action packed sci fi and Wool has enough action to keep this reader interested.  Highly recommend for fans of Leguin, or even Mccarthy's the Road.  Can't wait to read Shift.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|The story tells much about the author however what he wrote about heaven was not that much. I did not feel his description said  much about other persons being there, God, etc.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|Everyone should have this movie in their collection.  We couldn't find it in the store so we ordered it on Amazon Prime.  It arrived the next day!  All of my children have watched it numerous times.  We have even had a cat named Jenny!!
B00C8USQEM|5.0|This is a great deal; couldn't believe it when I saw it.  Not sure where the other issues came into play with the bad reviews, but ours works great with our player.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the funniest game ever and guys in the next update they'll have pistons and redstone with real minecraft servers you'll log in with your computer account if you have one and above you your name will appear like.buckster2001 if that's your name.
B005K2Z5IA|5.0|Give total protection for my paperwhite.  I keep my reader in it when not in use.  Still fits in back pocket of my MaxPedition, so I always have it with me.  Don't leave home without it.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|Couldn't watch all the discs, because I got bored there was no connection with the story, like in Band of Brothers.  Don't think I would watch this again, unlike Band of Brothers which I will watch again.
B005TBN04S|1.0|Was looking forward to III and had not seen II. Critics were right...should have stopped at first one. Just same story at different location...and not funny..don't mind F bombs but seems that were inserted for lack of funny lines. Think I'll wait for III streaming. Probably not worth the 30 or so bucks end up costing at a theatre.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|The first time I saw Philip on American Idol I knew he would make and he is the FRIST artist that kept true to himself.<br />Can't wait for the 2nd CD to come out. I would like to see DVD as well.<br />Keep up the great performance!!!!
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|Her &#34;reach&#34; into honky tonk doesn't impress me.  I know that she probably doesn't want to be one sopund but all her previous work was enjoyed much more.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|Very funny but also poignant.  Great performances from everyone.  Can't wait to watch it again!  Harrison Ford is particularly fun.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a beautiful movie that bears watching repeatedly in order to continue receiving it's message.  I strongly recommend it.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|Wanted to order the cd but mp3 digital deluxe edition had more songs and is awesome!!! Amazing compilation of a wide range of genres and artists-love the music!
B003ELOQCK|1.0|I only recently noticed I had been billed for this item that never made it.  What a shame, this is an awesome concert from a rockin' band.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The big buttons are nice and it is handy to have for my direct sales business. I recommend this to direct sellers!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved how this book was written and was surprised by the turn of events. I have read other accounts of this type of treatment of kids in orphanages. I am a lifelong Catholic and these accounts make me very sad that this went on.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was an exceptional book I could not put down. The ending caught me off guard in that I was looking for more.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved it - great story with hope woven through the entire thing.  Proved there's a &#34;lid for every pot&#34;!
B00AG297GK|2.0|I loved Bruno and Borat as well as the Ali G. Show, but it can get old. The shtick does not hold up like the other movies.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I don't think any of the copcat versions of the original star treck are as good as the original. Amazon has done a good job with title an descriptions of episodes.<br />Ed
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game.  It does want to spend real money on game money is the only downed.  Otherwise great game and similar to simcity.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I bought this movie for the kids but my wife and my good self like to watch it as well.  It's funny and has a classic plot that almost always pleases
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very well written. I enjoyed reading every word of it. Stories like this always rejuvenates my faith.  Although I've never experienced a near death experience I enjoy reading about them. They will never get old :)
B003UYUR0G|5.0|Great movie, great actors, fun story, good plot line, great for kids and adults, good music, and overall great purchase
B00138F4OK|5.0|Note: I have some of the tracks in mp3 format.<br /><br />After viewing ROCKY IV in mid-February, I went online, and converted the songs & instrumental pieces by Vince DiCola that I like best into mp3 format for private listening. The tracks that really stand out are: Burning Heart, Hearts On Fire (Extended Version), No Easy Way Out, Training Montage, Training Montage (Film Version), War, War (Final Version) and, of course, Eye Of The Tiger. Mr. Dicola did a great job writing the music for this film under the supervision of Mr. Stallone, and the music complements what I personally think is the best of the ROCKY films (so far; I've yet to see Rocky Balboa, ao no spoilers, please). Training Montage & Hearts On Fire (Extended Version) really fit well into the movie, and there's a little surprise for fans of the original film when Hearts Of Fire plays.<br /><br />YO, ADRIAN!!!
B007U4DB4G|5.0|Our entire family loves this movie.  It is incredible to see how they can train these dogs to do so many things.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I felt sorry for the actors because the script was not bad but its author should never never have directed his own material, which he directed as though the action was all in slow motion
B000002W9Q|5.0|Patrick played his part so well in this movie, the songs were awesome and the entire movie is something all families should see.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Following the deserved success of his first two novels, Khaled Hosseini has written a third book about the tenacity of three generations of Afgans who keep a thread of their family alive, taking the reader from Kabul to Paris to a Greek Island to San Francisco.<br /><br />The heart of the story is the devotion shared between a brother and his younger sister who are tragically parted because her father must sell her to keep the rest of the family alive.  It is compelling, heartbreaking, and gives the reader a rare view of Afgan culture.<br /><br />The story begins in 1952 as an uncle is telling a bedtime story to his niece and nephew.  It's about about a hard-working farmer in Maidan Sabz, a desolate village in Afganistan (their village).  One day a \\"div\\" (evil creature) storms the village and takes the farmer's favorite child away to a distant mountain fort.  The farmer is devastated, and loses heart for years, until his other sons are old enough to run the farm.  Then he can afford to set out alone on the very long, difficult journey to find his son and kill the evil div.<br /><br />After he brazenly gains entrance to the armed fort, the div, impressed with the courage of the father, decides to let him watch his son from behind a large glass window.  The farmer sees that his son Quais is alive and well.  More than that, the son is dressed in the best clothes, playing happily with friends in a pastoral-like setting, getting a fine education.  The div says that Quais has had nothing but the best and will have in the future.  After a great struggle with himself, the father decides that he cannot return his beloved son to the hard life of a peasant.  As he turns to go, the div gives him a dark liquid to drink on his journey home.  When the father finally arrives home, he can't recall the journey to find his son.<br /><br />This sets the scene for the story to come.  It's told with piercing detail and compassion.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I enjoyed this game, though I wish three was a part two, with more powerful weapons and skills.  Good job, devs.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|I loved regular blokus (the board game) much better.  Didn't understand this version too much, it so much more complex!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|It is not for everyone.  I love the series, but I am into quirky British Sci-fi.  Entertaining adventures, over-the-top world-ending threats of alien attacks at every turn, and a good bit of humor.

B005USZML4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book even if i am a little older than the age range.Grishams books are great no matter who you are.I think the subject of abduction,divorce,and custody issues arte appropriate to kids in a context of this writing style.You can always read it first to see if you agree.I think you will like it too.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|I think this app shows more readily how much the battery is charged.  I check it often. Easier to see.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book could change your  life.  It Might at least help you change the state of your physical health.  Dr. Davis has written a completely readable, understandable book for non-medical types. When we look around at the number of health issues today, we have to look for the common denominator and that is wheat more than anything else we consume. I have friends who have tried this plan and have seen improvement in many physical issues that they dealt with long term. I have just started but I too am noticing differences that I believe will continue the longer I continue  being gluten-free. It's not easy. Gluten is in everything. But to improve your health these days, without the aid of tons of meds would be great.<br />I believe Dr. Davis is onto the cause of some chronic, long-term and preventable illnesses. Thanks Dr. Davis.
0385344228|5.0|Getting married and bringing children into this world are two of life's greatest dices.  This book implodes the question how far would you go to protect the child of your loins?  It resonated for me the brilliant book by Lionel Shriver : \\"We Need to Talk about Kevin.\\"  Particularly interesting was the pyschiatrist's (why do I always have to check how to spell that?)analysis of Jacob's psyche, laying bare the elements ie. genes, environment, nature and nurture,that influence this.  Anyone with an extended family can strongly appreciate this fact of life. Interesting too is the understandable viewpoint of how we humans are mentally tuned in to believing what we want to of those that we love, closing the mind to strong evidence to the contrary.  A nicely paced book by an author that warrants further investigation.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rented it from the library on a friends recommendation.  The story starts slow, but before long I was hooked.  The main character is captivating.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I can't remember when I first saw this, but it has been my favorite movie rendition of all of Jane Austen's novels. The most finessed in character, extremely well acted and perfectly cast. Ciarian Hinds is a favorite, and Amanda Root is also wonderful in the lead roles. A very satisfying, witty and mature love story. Austen perfection.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Was looking for a simple battery app and this one does the job.  I also like the flashlight add on.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Excellent movie based on the true story of police providing a &#34;replacement&#34; child for a kidnapped one to generate good publicity for a corrupt police department.  Christine Collins knows the boy is not her son, and refuses to accept the lie to the point where the police have her committed.  Angelina Jolie is at her best when playing real people who lived through horrific situations.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I really like kik and its a great way to communicate with my friends without a phone. It has great stuff and I loved the bubble changing color. The only problem was that to search friends, it takes a long time. Overall i think this is the best app ever!
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|This game is a great mix of match 3 style games and a dungeon crawler.  4 stars instead of 5, because of limited upgrade options.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a long, epic adventure/ thriller about different souls which find their way back together over the centuries. We are introduced to the characters right away with a mere glimpse of their story, but are not told whatsoever how they intertwine.<br />All of the performances in Cloud Atlas are spectacular, including a wonderful exhibition of the talented Tom Hanks portrayed in various roles throughout. He truly flexes his acting skills in this movie, as we can see from his multitude of roles covering a broad spectrum of characters.<br />Along with great performances, we are also gifted with an excellent storyline, broken into segments and told in a way that will keep you guessing what is going on.<br />Cloud Atlas is a very different style, exhibiting a very different cinematic effect, one I can only describe as experimental and broken. Although I use the term broken, the stories are quite intact, just told in segments. When you start watching, it will take some getting used to the movie, as it takes each segment in leaps and bounds. Some may grow discouraged by this effect, but keep watching; it gets better, I promise! While the point and general meaning of each story is not immediately evident, it will emerge later. I enjoyed each and every one of the stories immensely, some more than others.<br />Each story is told in small spurts, slowly building to some sort of union between the characters over the centuries. If it looks to be in the past, it most likely is. Except one portion, as it looks to be possibly ancient times, is actually a couple hundred years in the future. Brilliant! An ingenuous design for a movie.<br />The action is well placed, and very rewarding. The audience will get a bit of everything, from classical music, terrific scenery, futuristic culture, and some pop references from long ago.<br />Do I recommend this movie? Absolutely. Once you finish watching, if you do, you will be left wondering what had just happened. Many will most likely not finish watching this movie, as it is very long and quite confusing from the start. Once engulfed in the stories, stick with it. After you think it won't get any more exciting, it just might surprise you once more.y not finish watching this movie, as it is very long and quite confusing from the start.

B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|If you think people shouldn't be comparing the book to the movie, then it shouldn't have the same title.<br />As a stand alone movie... It was horrible. Hard to understand the reasoning behind some things, sappy, bad character development.<br />Comparison to the book... Changing important facts, easy things that could have been simple to keep such as physical features, like the &#34;green eyes of light casters&#34;. And Lena was supposed to have black hair.  Couldn't the budget afford contacts and hair color? And what happened to Lena and Ethan &#34;kelting&#34;? They did it constantly through the series unless Lena blocked him, which was an important sign. Morphing Amma and Marian into one person was a bad idea since both had very distinctive roles to play. And except for a tiny mention, Ethan's dad had no role at all in the movie. They never even mention an incubus, Macon's important role. The storyline also strayed too far from the book.<br />So much was different that I think it shouldn't have the same name as the book.  Possibly saying &#34;loosely base on Beautiful Creatures&#34; would have been more honest and accurate.<br />Because I read and enjoyed the series, I expected a good adaptation as was done with &#34;Twilight&#34;, &#34;Hunger Games&#34;, and &#34;Harry Potter&#34;. I was sorely disappointed.<br />If they did manage a sequel I'm sure I wouldn't see it. Do the fans a favor and try filming Beautiful Creatures again accurately... No one would even know it was the same movie if it was done well and followed the book.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Scalzi continually exceeds expectations.  Great military scf-fi. I loved the characters and dialogue.  Particularly the snarking, laugh out loud in places.  I particularly enjoyed the boot camp sections.  Shades of R. Lee Emory.<br /><br />The universe as presented in Old Man's War is not a perfect one.  Aliens are relatively plentiful, and they mostly seem better built for killing that we are.  That doesn't stop us from a little gene splicing to even the odds.  Add in some training, and the fact that all of our troops have 75 years of life experience, and we don't do too bad on interstellar battlefields.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the length.  It could have been much longer without bothering me.  Oh well, I suppose that's what sequels are for.  I'm off to get it not.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoy playing this as a time-filler.  Easy to start and stop the game, as needed.  Can get lost in this game and is a bit addictive!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|From my personal point of view I enjoyed every moment of this movie, I even watched it twice. Django Unchained is a masterpiece in every aspect. It has outstanding actors, a more than enjoyable plot, drama action, it incorporates everything. The friendship between Dr. Schultz and Django is just amazing and touchy. I recommend this movie to those who love history and to those who appreciate a good action/drama.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Gone Girl. The story flows, the characters are interesting and there is an element of suspense which works well. My only reservation relates to the ending which lacks credibility and was disappointing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Its a little difficult at first but u get the hang of it. Its a great game considering that it is free. I would buy it for 99 cent but nothing over that
B00280LYIC|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and adventure all in a really good, packed book. I can't wait to read the second book. I'm going to buy the next book as soon as I'm done writing this review. I will be writing a review on the next book in the series once I finish it. I hope you buy this book and like it as much as I do!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really loved this game. It kept me occupied for hours. I would definitely recommend it for someone who gets bored a lot. Definitely worth the 99&cent; !!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I received this trilogy as a gift.  I have always loved any and all super hero movies/TV shows/Comics, and the Blu-Ray version of these movies makes a HUGE difference.  Love love, and recommend to all.  My roommate isn't into comic books or anything that I am, lol, and even she enjoyed these movies!

B00BSWMITK|4.0|I like Joe Satriani. I have appreciated most of his music for about 15 years. Moreover, I like what I know of the man, having seen him perform twice. He is a consummate performer, without being arrogant or cocky. He is one of the few instrumental rock guitar players to maintain a strong solo career for about twenty-five years.<br /><br />With \\"Unstoppable Momentum,\\" Joe assembles a new drummer, Vinnie C., and allows keyboardist Mike Keneally some space to play. Joe usually dominates all the solos, but this time Mike has more room to breath and contribute. This is refreshing.<br /><br />There is nothing radically new about this CD; it is guitar-driven, with the multi-dubbing of guitars into huge choruses surrounding the leads. Joe is generally a strong song-writer, and all his pieces tell a story. The guitar seems to be talking when he plays the head of the song. This cannot be said for many (or any) mere shredders. Joe really is not a shredder (since they usually shred cheesed), but he can play faster and cleaner than anyone on the planet. You see, he plays with a bluesy feeling. His velocity has passion--and not just in facial expressions.<br /><br />One complaint is that the CD gives only 45 minutes of music--rather sparse for a medium that can hold nearly 80 minutes and for a musician who usually offers more per recording.
B003Y6GJD4|2.0|This movie was a disappointment.  It was not very exciting and somewhat predictable.  The characters were not very likable.  I would not recommend it.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|My granddaughter told me about this movie and we loved it. I am a movie buff but had never heard of this one. It is a shame that it didn't get more publicity. It has some gore but in the context of the movie it's not scary at all but its still not for the younger kids. I have recommended it to friends and they have loved it too. Thanks for such a good laugh.
B001R60M2C|5.0|Jim and I read this book when it first came out, then we saw the movie. We have been to the house in Winterset, Iowa. Jim passed away unexpectedly June 04, 2012. On June 04, 2013 I'm taking the book, going to his grave and reading the book again with him.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, true love story, the kind Jim and I had.

B00005KAQP|5.0|I love the changing of the worldly words to more meaningful ones. I watch this when I'm down, the songs lift me up to remember what life is really about----I will follow him
B008220D5K|1.0|This movie was just basically disgusting.  It's not funny, not a feel-good movie, and not enjoyable.  I couldn't even watch it all.  It just did nothing for me.  When even the children in the movie are spouting offensive language, you know a movie is scrambling for ways to get shock value to make up for being boring.  For me, it had no redeeming value at all, and that's despite the fact that I usually really like Paul Rudd.  I will never look at him the same way again.  I want to give this zero stars.  I was totally turned off.  This is the worst movie I've seen in probably 20 years of heavy movie-going.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a ton of fun. easy to play, easy to progress through the game. simple to understand. Great to playing when nature calls btw
B00005JN8Z|2.0|Although they went to great lengths to get crwd scenes and victorious marches into Rome it all seemed a litte kitsy and naive compared to todays standards. But even compared to The Ten Comandments and other spectacles of that era it was underwhelming. Robert Taylor spoke as an American would of his day. Comical really with all the glitz of the Glory of Rome around him. Even the truly great Peter Ustinov seemed a little ridiculous as Nero. There was no majesty in this.<br />The Christians thrown to the lions was interesting in that it was very graphic! When they tell you in Sunday School if you would test your faith by allowing yourself to be thrown in the Roman Colliseum with lions everyone says yes! But that is because you don't actually see huge powerful savage lions who have not been fed for three days! Wow! 20 huge powerful lions let loose and you have no place to hide or run to! You are helpless!!! A mother trying to protect her baby screaming! The lions tear it away from her as tender meat! This happened! This is the cruelty of mankind in its most horrible manifestation!<br />Deborah Kerr was very good but see her in An Affair to Remember with my man Cary Grant or The King and I.

B00CRR5YA0|5.0|The music from The Original Series episodes and movies is a difficult act to follow given its iconic status. Giacchino has performed yeoman's work to draw inspiration from Star Trek's past while bringing his distinct style to the franchise. His main theme is uplifting & inspirational without being bombastic. The music he has written fits the action in the movie quite well from the most action packed scenes to the quiet, somber scenes. I particularly enjoyed &#34;London Calling&#34; which brings a quiet dignity to a part of the film that is poignant before the movie makes the jump back into warp. My only complaint is that the soundtrack is just 47:17 long when it could have easily filled an entire CD and more. I have seen the film three times so far and the music throughout the film is thoroughly engaging which harbors the promise that an extended version will be released at a future date.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|The product arrived like the seller promised, early and in new unissued condition. The product itself is OK. The part that looks like a wand is very cheaply attached to the tool. The metal file is attached via a very cheap plastic hinge to the tool. It won't last long, just like anything from China. I am not planning on using this as my primary knife sharpening tool. This is a backup for me, and for that purpose this product will do. I would not recommend it as a primary method of knife sharpening. It is a simple compact tool to use that takes up hardly any space in case my sharpening stone goes missing.

B0064MGU98|5.0|The Good Wife has everything I want in a series, plus occasional touches of thriller tension. I avoided checking out this show because of the title; made me think it was something else. A new friend convinced me I was missing something really good, but how do you catch up in the 4th season? Then it appeared on Amazon Instant Video and I was caught. Since I'm watching the early shows alone, I never even think about the small (iPad) screen size. I love it. The foibles, courage, concern, self-absorption and interaction of the various characters are so real, it's not only entertaining, but often insightful into how people really operate within their own intersecting worlds. And it's continually insightful into how the law really works.

B00005JPD0|5.0|One of the compelling aspects of science fiction is that it allows the writer or director to create a world designed to tell a story that reveals aspects of its characters in a way that normal life is unable to accomplish.  Denzel Washington's ATF agent is placed in one of these unusual situations in this film.  Using a government facility that is able to send a single person back in time to the very recent past, Denzel's character strives to prevent a tragedy.  In doing so, he encounters a attractive young woman whose life may be in jeopardy.<br /><br />The way in which he meets this woman and falls in love with her is fascinating!  Also wonderful is the demeanor that Denzel's character assumes when he risks his life to thwart the villain.  Unlike heroes in trivial stories, he shows instantly relatable fear and anxiety in the face of this evil--which makes his courageous acts all the more compelling!
193700788X|1.0|I found all the books in the Sookie Stackhouse series to be entertaining, light weekend reads. However, since Dead Ever After is the final book in a wildly popular series I expected something better.  What readers get is a blah plot line that tries to cram in one too many past characters. The final \\"fight scene\\" was all of two pages - big build up, huge let down. In general, there were a lot of loose ends and really uncharacteristic decisions made by many of the main characters in the novel. Not only were we left with an ending that fell flat, there was no resolution, limited involvement and no ending for many of the main characters.<br /><br />And as for Sookie's dating life... The reader can easily deduce Sookie's final love choice pretty early on in the book, but like others I'm a little confused with the outcome. If Harris had picked someone the readers already saw Sookie involved with there would have been a better emotional connection to their relationship. Even if it wasn't the readers choice for Sookie, the final outcome could have been rationalized more.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This review, and many more, can be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca).<br /><br />My Thoughts:  Often times when a book is so critically acclaimed I'm a little hesitant to pick it up because more often than not the book just doesn't live up to the hype created around it.  Yes, I've become a little cynical in my reading.<br /><br />This is not the case with Wonder.  Not by a long shot.<br /><br />In fact two words that I initially wrote down after reading the first few chapters of this book were: 'touching and emotional'.  It's because of the emotion and message behind this book that I'm so excited to share it with you.<br /><br />First of all, I'm shocked and more than a little impressed that this book was written by a first time author.  I think that a huge part of the success of this book is that Palacio has given Auggie (and the five other people who provide the narration) truly authentic and believable voices.<br /><br />Auggie is an inspiring, funny and strong main character who will definitely stay with me for a long time.  Palacio has created a sympathetic main character in Auggie who is a normal Star Wars loving boy with an extraordinary face who you can't help but root for.  He's got a great support system at home which has instilled a strong sense of self and he uses his humour to deal with other people's issues with his face.  He is exceptional in that he feels normal even though other people have more of an issue with his face.<br /><br />\\"I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary, I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside.<br /><br />But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go. If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that look-away thing.<br /><br />Here's what I think: the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way.\\"<br /><br />This book could very easily do a tailspin into a very woeful read about bullying.  Sure it has it's emotional moments but it doesn't have a generally sad feel to it.  It's actually a very uplifting read and has a much more simplistic and innocent approach to it that I wasn't expecting.  If you're looking for a gritty account of what life is like living with a severe facial deformity then this won't be the book for you.<br /><br />While there is a strong moral message in the book it never felt like Palacio was pontificating or shoving the moral down the reader's throat.  It's a simple lesson: be kinder than you have to.  I would hope that we all realize that we should be nice to everyone (even if we don't do it enough) but this book clearly shows the reader that the negative effects of 'looking away' or pretending we don't notice someone with a noticeable deformity is just as damaging as saying a mean statement. It was an emotional read at times (I even shed a tear or two!) but never had a saccharine or overdone feel to it.<br /><br />It's because of the moral message that I think that this book should be read by middle school kids. I honestly think everyone should read it but kids in middle school would get the most out of it because I think it accurately portrays the effects of bullying, of ignoring someone based on their looks and shows how little it takes to just be a friend and uplift someone. To do what is right, not necessarily what is the easiest, or what others think you should do.  Those are some pretty big lessons that I think ALL of us need to learn or get a refresher course on.<br /><br />Overall I truly loved this book.  I was fully emersed in Auggie's world from the beginning to the end and found it to be a very touching read.  The story is told by these six characters with the use of short chapters that really helped to keep the pace moving. But what really stood out with me is the ease and success that Palacio had using various points of view -- Auggie and FIVE others -- to tell the story.  This could have been a literary train wreck with the number of POVs but it was done extremely well giving the reader insight into those around Auggie and how he and they experienced things differently.<br /><br />I especially loved his sister, Via's, point of view and her conflicting feelings towards her brother and all of the attention he gets from their parents. She adores her brother but the effects of his facial deformity, his numerous surgeries and how others react to him greatly influences her life.  Palacio also shows how other people in Auggie's life, namely Jack and Summer, deal with other insensitive and downright cruel people who judge them for hanging out with Auggie.<br /><br />I did have a couple of small criticisms about the book. One thing that did strike me as not quite right were the language and issues that these Grade 5 kids had to deal with. As a mom to kids in Grade 4, 6 and 8 I'd like to think that I have a handle on the voice and development of tweens. Based on that experience with my Small Humans I think that the social issues that were dealt with in the book are more in middle school (Grades 6-8) than in an elementary school setting. I don't think that Grade 5 students are nearly as developmentally advanced as Jack, Auggie, Summer etc were portrayed in the book. I think having the kids be in Grade 7 would have been a more realistic age where they would have experienced the peer and social pressures dealt with in this book.<br /><br />My other issue with the book is that perhaps because it had a lighter feel to it the ending was also more uplifting and a little too tidy for my liking. The 'bad guy' got his comeuppance and the good guys all rode off into the sunset. These are small beefs about the book (wee 'moos', if you like) but they were noticeable and may bother some readers who were hoping for an edgy ending.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book and found Wonder to be truly wonderful.  I adore the moral of the book that encourages people 'to be kinder than necessary' and that people have not only 'the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness'.  Hopefully, after reading this book people will choose to be more respectful and kinder to others even when it's not convenient for them or when it makes them feel uncomfortable. To give others dignity.  Imagine the kind of world we'd have if we all did that.<br /><br />\\"Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind.<br />One should be kinder than needed.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />My Rating: 4.5/5 starsad.

B009KEN87O|5.0|Lots of fun and easy to master. This is a retro game that is a lot of fun to play for beginners.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|From watching the trailer I expected more action.  The movie was more drama than action and in some places it felt like it was moving at a snails pace.  According to other reviews the movie is based on a book, which I have not read.  I can see, that the book would give the reader a much better understanding of the characters, their depth and connections to each other, which the movie only touches on.  The movie is more Twilight drama and less Harry Potter magic.  It was mostly entertaining, slow at times, not as much action as I would have liked and that is why I say eh, it was ok.
B0082EOJYE|2.0|I bought this because it won an Academy award, and the preview looked compelling. The male main character is just straight up unlikable. I don't like his resentful, fat-cat trophy wife, either. You're supposed to sympathize with his fall from stardom, but then the movie adds in features like the fact that he's destitute and has a \\"faithful\\" butler who works for him without being paid for a year. The scene where the butler, who is an elderly gentleman, is dutifully preparing him dinner in his apartment frankly makes my skin crawl. He still calls him \\"sir\\".<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I really didn't like it. It got two stars instead of one because of it's uncluttered storyline, and because the movie is pleasing to look at.
B004KPX5GC|4.0|Entertaining movie, very nice family-night flick.  Great story for young women, you see strength, family values, choices and juggling all of them..
B00003CXB6|3.0|the movie was not in its original packaging. the dvd was also not that great. but that is ok for now. thanks. god bless you.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|If you are new to New Order, do not buy this album.  Start with the 1995 collect [[ASIN:B001CBW15I The Best of New Order]].  If you have a hits compilation and want more, try [[ASIN:B001FBJULS Technique]] and [[ASIN:B001FBJUKY Low-Life (2 CD Collector's Edition)]].  If you have already purchased a couple albums, you should have a pretty good idea if you like New Order or not, so it is for you whom the following is composed.<br /><br />Waiting for the Sirens' Call was generally panned by critics and fans.  The word \\"recycled\\" seemed to appear a lot.  The criticisms were either that the musical ideas seemed like retreads or they were trying too hard to extend their sound, not quite pulling it off.  There were two faults that reduced the overall quality of that album.  They were 1) Bernard Sumner's lyrics and 2) Bernard Sumner's melodies.<br /><br />Consider the first three songs of those two albums. \\"Who's Joe?,\\" track one from 2005's Waiting for the Sirens' Call, starts \\"Hey, Joe. Whatcha doing?\\" Track two is called \\"Hey Now What You Doing\\" and the first lyrics of the song are \\"hey, now, what you doing?\\"  Similarly, the first words from this 2013 release of the remaining 2005-era Sirens session tracks, Lost Sirens, are \\"hey, you.  What's the matter?\\"<br /><br />This kind of laziness is also prevalent in many of Bernard Sumner's melodies of this millennium, particularly in the verses, where so many of them sound the same.  Inexplicably, the 8 songs presented here have better lyrics and melodies than anything else from the Siren sessions save the excellent title track and perhaps \\"Krafty.\\"  Those 10 Songs together would've been a respectable late career album; the rest relegated to b-sides and boxed sets.<br /><br />Lost Sirens succeeds most when New Order stretches their sound.  Possibly the purest pop moment in New Order's catalogue, \\"Sugarcane\\" thumps a disco beat with jangly guitar riffs that requires dancing.  \\"Recoil\\" glides on piano and acoustic guitar, with some nice riffing by Peter Hook. The remix of \\"I Told You So\\" transforms what they claimed to be their first reggae-influence song into a Blur-esque guitar-strum sing-a-long, building layers as it goes.<br /><br />\\"Shake It Up\\" is the dance-rock song New Order does so well, and should be a single.  From the precise beat that could be drum machine or Stephen Morris to the guitar and keyboard hooks, it has all the elements New Order is known for.  Sumner delivers an impassioned vocal performance and highly singable chorus that would sound great on the radio.<br /><br />Throughout the album, the instrumental passages showcase New Order's ability to layer interesting parts from all the players in to a tapestry that conveys the mood they desire.  Fans who enjoy that aspect of their music will find many satisfying moments here.<br /><br />With the future of New Order releases up in the air, Lost Sirens is a welcome addition to the discography, even 8 years after it was recorded.  On that note, the closest thing to a New Order album that has been recorded since the Sirens sessions is [[ASIN:B002Q5O6SO Never Cry Another Tear]] by Bad Lieutenant, which is highly recommended.
B0081336FO|5.0|Smart Writing and brilliant acting what more could you ask for? the season only consists of 3 episodes but the quality of each episode is more than some tv show who make 12 or more in a season. watch just one episode and you will buy the next two as well, don't take my work for it just watch for yourself!
B004ELSDZK|1.0|App didn't download to kindle, despite advertising that it would - appears in my amazon orders - and that's the only place I can see it - never mind play it - choose something else! Only 1 star because you have to give a star regardless!!
0152023984|5.0|I've loved this book since I was a child, and I lost my copy a few years ago, so I decided to get it again. So happy! The only thing I'm slightly mad about is that, on the actual cover underneath the slip cover, there are all these strange marks, which isn't cool. That, and I think it's an odd edition or something because the title page is off-center? Anyway, if you don't care about stuff like that, order away. I'd just recommend getting it at your local book store. But if you're considering getting this book in general, just do it. I think it might be one of the most important books in the existence of the world.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I want MORE!!!! I watched this for the first time AFTER seeing the movie. I became a die hard fan.  AFTER the series was cancelled. I still want more, even 11 years later.  I have never seen a cast with the chemistry and unity that this show has!  Again, 11 years later, I am waiting for more.
0756407915|1.0|This book is frustrating and redundant. The promise that Rothfuss built with the name of the wind is unachieved. I quit about halfway through realizing that Rothfuss just may not be as good of a writer as I initially thought. He's lazy and very uninspired in several sections of this book.<br /><br />In the first book, the present time stories of Innkeeper Kote were slow, but never as boring as they are here. It's like he tries and makes those sections boring so you can be as bored as the characters. And Kvothe is just a really dull character after you read him for so many pages. The Name of The Wind was like bubblegum reading, nice and fun, no worries, and it lacked for it...This one on the other hand, the flavor is all gone. You're chewing on nothingness! He's never in any serious trouble, he's perfect in most everything he does and is the smartest dude around, he also sings like an angel, plays his instrument like van halen and steve vai combined and all the girls like him. It's like a little kid is picking out all his childhood fantasies and putting them into Kvothe. Also, his love story is lacking, I have no idea why the hell he likes Denna. It's pointless.<br /><br />Anywho, one word to sum this book up is simply 'frustrating'. The adventure from the first isn't present. The things that had me feeling like I was breathing a breath of fresh air have become tired and overdone.
B005CM1IMU|5.0|There is only one thing better than watching this Excellent copy on Blu-ray at home with friends; going to a theatre with someone who has never been indoctrinated to 'The Show' before!
0812550706|4.0|This book was really, really, really awesome. I enjoyed the hell out of it! The last 6 pages or so were very annoying though.  I wish it had been left out.<br />Everything up to there was PERFECT. I had it as a solid 9 until I read that crap about religion and then it lowered to a 8.4 or so. I'd recommend this book to everyone nonetheless. I thought it was pretty genius. The ending was genius, the climax was awesome, and the story was killer. Just that stupid religion stuff, blaaah.<br /><br />Check it out if you want to read some good sci fi.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Very good show, well cast, even better written.  Starting to die off though, was much funnier when it was just the four guys sitting around their living room.  Now you can tell they are running out of things to come up since the boys all have wives or girlfriends.
0756405890|2.0|I really enjoyed this book! It was a fast read and there were cliffhangers at nearly every chapter. Also the chapters aren't long, so it keeps you going.<br />The magic system in this book is different and really well thought out;creative. The primary story is a story the protagonist is telling to someone, and it makes things a bit more interesting then if it was just told straight up, or at least I think. The characters are fun, although there aren't too many major players.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this book is that SO FAR in the series, the main character, Kvothe, is kind of too perfect. Which makes sense, I suppose, that's the pitch they use. It's his story of how he became the greatest magician/wizard of all time. And remember, the story is a story within a story, so the he's still in danger and such and it's an interesting and entertaining journey, so it isn't lacking tension or anything. I dug it and I think they set up a whole lot of background for the sequel to be out of this world amazing, and I'm very excited to read it.<br /><br />You should check out this book if you dig Harry Potter, this series reminds me a lot of that series. A lot of it even takes place at a school. So there are a bit of similarities. I friggin' love harry potter though. We shall see if my adulation for Kvothe grows to that level.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />EDIT: The 2nd book stinks, so I felt obliged to rate this one a little lower. The story gets worse, the characters grow dull, and the adventure disappears.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|for a simple game format, this game does a nice job.  dont be surprised by an extra file download after purchase, but it is free, just takes a while.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I think this game is worth download it is very fun, imagine call of duty and battlefield 3 and you get the idea
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is a great solution to paper notebooks. All these notebooks are at my fingertips for easy location of subjects.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend and I finished it in one day. The writing is fabulous and the author is gifted at delving into relationships and their highs, lows, regret, redemption...in so many creative ways. A very well written, engaging, and original work.
B0012IWNTA|5.0|Despite there was a scratch on cd I can watch the concert. I love it. I recommend because I enjoy it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This video game is awesome I 'll die if they never came out with this game. Now only 99 cents .amazon gives you 5$ free and I just got the game . Awesome.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm completely enthralled by this book , second in the series , my son is watching the t.v series and I'm reading the book and we compare, the series is true to the book, the details are amazing, I can't put the book down, I would never have thought that I would become so involved in a story that has no historical context !
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put it down; very well crafted short stories that connect into a haunting dystopian reality. Absolutely in the best post-apocalyptic sci-fi dystopian genre today.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is better than the Weather Channel! It gives you all the info right in one spot, you don't have  to go searching for it and I like that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very fun game to play! If you don't have your laptop, get it on this, so you can take this!

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I've waited my whole life for a film of Edgar Rice Burrough's Mar's stories...and this didn't disappoint...just wonderful, awesome stupendous! Don't miss out, and see where everyone in sci-fi and fantasy in the last century got their inspiration! Please make a sequel!!!!
B004J00KJ8|5.0|Great British humor throughout the film.  Hugh Grant at his best.  Funeral is rather sad - but even then there is some great script
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have downloaded a few battery apps in my day but this is the best and last one I will ever need! Thanks!!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a beast.  Never disappointed with his forays into fantasy. Everything about this novel clicks together perfectly.  GREAT!
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|...because I've been missing a very intense, sexy show called Lost Girl. I just started watching it on Netflix and I feel robbed that I wasn't in on this show from the beginning. And it's been a very long time that not only I was hooked by one episode, moreover that I wanted to get the entire series on DVD on the second episode. (A first for me)<br /><br />I foresee myself posting about Lost Girl and the \\"very talented\\" and The Real Anna Silk on Facebook for a long time.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Fun reading romance with some mystery thrown in.  Very fast and easy reading.  Recommend it.  Better than watching tv.  Lots of laughs.
B00CW665VI|4.0|When reading Tangled at about 5% I said to myself this isn't a book. Its a MOVIE SCRIPT! Have you seen the movie Hitch? Well thats what Tangled reminded me of. I literally could see Will Smith walking down the street talking to me as Drew saying, \\"Juewelz this is why you can't keep a man.\\" LOL With that being said when reading Tangled it took a bit for me to adjust to the writting style. A little inside info on me , in college I took theatre classes . No I didn't want to be an actress but loved being on the set. So reading Tangled again I felt like I was reading a playright/movie script rather than just a book.<br /><br />It's so nice reading a male POV. The author did an amazing job writing as a female in a male POV.You know how sometimes (all the time) we wonder if men notice us, if we have affected them. It was nice to see from Drew's POV that YES we do affect them and that when a man is acting like a 3 year old and he's 30 he likes you. LOL<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I started and finished it in one sitting. Lots of people have compared it to Wallbanger but I have not read that so I had nothing to compare it to when reading. I have to say that it does stand out compared to all the romance books coming out theses days. You will literally be LOL and squirming during some of the intimate parts. Drew is a cookie monster ladies #Nuffsaid! If you are looking for a quick,fun, cute read PICK UP TANGLED!<br /><br />-Laters, Juewelz xo<br /><br />SMIBookClub received a ARC copy of Tangled from Omnific Publishing in exchange for an honest review
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|What an Awesome album she is so talented. Absolutely love it. Nine more words required for this review so here.
B00555X8OA|3.0|The ideas were very interesting and surprising.  But if you want to write a great selling book, leave out the overwhelming academic references and the more heavy duty calculations.  Make it a bit lighter.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|Really enjoy this film! Awesome movie filled with lots of action packed scenes. It's great to see Arnold back. Love the fight scene with UFC moves. Arnold still has it! A good entertaining movie from start to finish. A must see movie whether you are an Arnold fan or not. Hope to see Arnold in more films in the near future.
B004SBX112|5.0|Love the challenge. Keeps  you playing for ours. The game maeks you want to get the little pigs, always smiling when you miss. keeps you motivated.
B009AMANH4|5.0|it's is no wonder Daniel Day Lewis won best actor.  He is awesome in this move.  Feel like Lincoln is in my living room.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This album is sort of alternative rock in my opinion.  I really enjoy listening to it. The download is only four dollars!  I listen to it on kindle.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|If you're looking for great actors and action, this Bourne follows in the footsteps of the others. You won't find over the top romantic scenes that some directors use as filler. As a matter of fact, the lack of overly indulgent romantic scenes leaves that question hanging for a decent portion of the movie.<br /><br />The female lead - Rachel Weisz - is also portrayed as a strong character and has some very courageous portrayals in quite a few scenes.<br /><br />Even with all the action, there are deeper issues raised and the character played by Ed Norton and others highlight some interesting and provocative items.<br /><br />I liked it and I'd recommend it to others looking for action with great actors.
030758836X|5.0|Although a page turner, I was constantly aware that the author was pointing out how clever she was (not the character), by saying \\"Yes, that's the correct grammar.\\" The book was over written, contrived, and had a typical \\"Hollywood ending\\".  It is probably because I read more non-fiction, that I expect better, more concise writing style. For the average mystery reader this would be considered a good book. I found it wanting.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Wow this game is so fun!  I played it on the Galaxy S2, it was great!  So then I installed it on my Galaxy Note 8...EVEN BETTER!  Using this game with it the stylus puts it over the top!  I would give it more stars if I could  LOVE IT!  Lots of weapons and power ups...very nice retro feel to it.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This show is going to be timeless because it deals with women's lives and it doesn't matter if you're 20 or 50 you can get something out of it.  Buy this series if you haven't already.
B008OURHPY|5.0|I was turned on to Lianne La Havas just in time to miss a local concert. :o/<br /><br />I am enjoying this CD.  She has such a clean and lightly earthy voice.  I don't know how to categorize the music, but it definitely has hints of jazz. Sweet!  ...The song that sparked my interested in her music is probably now my least favorite--after experiencing the entire CD.<br /><br />There is music that I enjoy, but not enough to buy or experience live.  But I will KEEP her on my radar and if she is ever near my city again, I won't hesitate to see her in concert.<br /><br />This CD is hot!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The characters have changed and developed in such interesting ways.  Great story line--lots of twists and surprises.  I love this show!  Can't wait for season 4!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I was told by a friend to read this book,the name of the book didn't appeal to me too much but how I was mistaken. It is simply one of the best fantasy book I've ever read. A must-read for any fantasy lovers!
0385040253|3.0|But it's so arcane in its nomenclature and varieties of apparently identical knots, that I would not recommend to even a somewhat experienced knotsperson if a practical how-to is needed.  There are a plethora of more specific alternatives, and far less expensive.<br />However, the sections on decorative knotting are extensive, and if one is ready for that, this is a good resource.
B000MMMT46|4.0|I love this album, and the vinyl makes the difference.<br />in the first box I received a set of dice, I had to write to get my record and that took a while... but now I'm satisfied!
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|I was not expecting much from this one, now I can't put it down. Plays incredibly smooth, the touch control is spot on ;-) Graphics are really nice
B00005AQE7|5.0|I'm really happy: great quality vinyl, great quality wrap, quick service.<br />I couldn't ask for more, I'll trust this store in the future
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Any phone or pc I've had I've always used a Kindle app to read books or newspapers.  I've always had minimal trouble &amp; am now syncing to a Kindle fire hd with no problem at all.  Great app. I'm happy with the changes as they are similar to what I'm used to with my Kindle.  Recommended.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is SOOOOO addictive!! Bought it today and has been playing it non-stop, all my siblings have just downloaded it too and are also loving it! It's a bit like temple run.... but amazing quality for a free game. The only issue is that in this game you can purchase extra add ons which are REALLY expensive for what they are. GREAT GAME PLEASE GET IT!!<br />right now...<br />Just do it. Please.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The story in season two gets richer and deeper.  It's more than a continuation of season one.  The plot weaves like plots weave in real life and nothing can be taken for granted in it.  I'm committed to this series... I don't want it to ever end
B0091REZMW|4.0|Its a pretty good game. Especially for a hidden objects game. Loving my kindle fire. Hope they give me a lot to do with it being free.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I loved season one, so I bought season two, and then I got HBO and brought myself up-to-date in season three.  I think it's great.  Now I'm going to read the books.  There is so much to say about this series.  It deserves a lot of discussion.  I like the way it examines the concept of honor and how the characters express their sense of honor or, in some cases, the rejection of a need to behave honorably.  The story is very realistic and the magic in it is being gradually woven in, in a way that makes it believable as well.  This is fantasy unlike, and so much richer than, any fantasy I've every seen.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This book is full of great information it is just great I love it try it out even if u don't need it but maybe u will because I thought by I didn't need it but on the first page it changed my life hahaha I'm kidding this book sucked
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I downloaded this game for my girls (4,6).  It took a little time to figure the game out and then they weren't that impressed.  They played it a while because they love My Little Ponies, but the fun was not there to hold them in.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|The first  book I purchased from Amazon kindle. And we'll worth the  price  . A charming tale of . Love And true romance.  the. Book was hard to..put  down. Milan. Kept the story moving  with interesting plot changes  and very special characters.  I am,looking forward to the next book in the series. A  kiss for  midwinter. My second purchase from Amazon.  Usually able to borrow the books I want to read from the..lending library. You therefore can tell how much I enjoy ed this series of books called the brothers sinister.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|All three of my kids love this game.  They enjoy every aspect from cutting, to coloring to shampooing and blow drying the character's hair.  Lots of simple, clean, fun.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was the best yet in the Percy Jackson and hero of Olympus series. It contained the perfect amount of romance, action, thrill, mystery, and mythology all wrapped into one book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Everyone in my family, kids and parents, love this game.  The higher levels provide enough challenge for the grown ups while the beginning levels give the kids a chance to master the concept and move up.  Overall, great game, great at challenging thought processes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game I ever I played I totally agree to 5 stars to this game so get it and have fun but get the pocket wider.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is not quite what we had in mind.  We ended up deleting it shortly after downloading it.  My girls, ages 4 and 6 were not that into it.
0988936402|3.0|This is the first book in what is shaping up to be a series that targets young teens who want to read fantasy books. As a fantasy novel, it has the usual premise of a fight between good and evil where our hero emerges as the main character who can help save the day. In the case of this book our hero is an incoming Freshman who is ably assisted by two lifelong friends who decided to attend the same college. One of the original premises here is that our world is connected in some un-described fashion to the land of Everville and also to eight other lands who all interconnect at Everville. This allows the bad guys to try and take over the worlds by filtering in and amongst the various worlds and also draw supporters from the various worlds.<br /><br />The story flips back and forth between the activities of Owen Sage in our world, and either his presence at Everville, or the story of a Keeper who preceded him during a previous invasion of the bad guys. Since there are multiple worlds, there are multiple races here and they belong to either the side of good, or the side of bad; bad in an interesting twist, several of them are actually neutral and will join one or the other side as fits their particular needs of the moment. It's not very difficult to follow Owen's story, or the story of his predecessor as he fights his own battle in his own time. What is nice about this interleaving of storylines is that the older story tells Owen what he will have to do when it's his time to run the gauntlet in Everville. The object is to reach a pillar where superior beings can help in stemming the tide of the evil encroachment. As we are told in the book, there are a total of eight pillars, but only one makes an appearance in this book - albeit twice. I suppose this points out that in future books, Owen will have to visit the other seven as this invasion is considered worse than any before!<br /><br />Because this is a book intended for teens, the author has taken some liberties and shortcuts to keep the book to what he considers a reasonable length. Unfortunately, I think that this decision was not wise. It results in the story line being very abrupt and having many transitions that are too fast and not as fully developed as I would have liked. For instance, there is a bad guy in the story who is never named, nor is any reason given for why he chose the path of evil. Another, in our world, initially appears as an eccentric professor who likes to reward his students, but is revealed in the end as one of the evil types. Unfortunately there is no backstory here, or any other indication as to why this was with the exception of one statement about his arrogance after he gets his just desserts.<br /><br />I was given this book to review by the author and as a result shared some of my concerns with him. He explained that he intends to improve in future books and that there are reasons that have not been revealed yet that resulted in some of my criticisms. All in all, this book is a mixed bag. It has some good points, and it has its negative points. In balance I decided to give this book three stars and I hope that the author will improve on some of the things in his next effort as he has stated that he will, and I wish him well and success.hortcuts to keep the book to what he considers a reasonable length.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|This version is similar to the original Temple Run.  My kids enjoy it and now prefer it over the first version.
B00CL50KDY|1.0|This is supposed to be an adorable Twilight wannabe feel-good movie.  It wasn't.  New flash:  there's a big difference between vampires and zombies.  This was dopey and un-engaging from the beginning until I stopped watching 45 minutes in.  Friends of mine thought I 'd like it, and for all the world I can't imagine why.  What were they thinking?
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Not what I would expect from Dean took me a month to read. I read 10 other books before I could finish this one. Good but very slow.
B004LQI2YA|5.0|This was recommended to me, otherwise I may not have chosen on my own.  The concept was hard to come to terms with, but I found it fascinating.  Watch the trailer, and decide for yourself.  If you can handle something sad, I highly recommend it.
B008Y79HE6|5.0|Have watched this many times. does not get old. good graphics, acting and who doesn't love Godzilla. that is all I have to say.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is for all ages and is highly addictive. Very polished and you earn awards and new swords all the time. Overall one of the top touchscreen games out there!
B008RKKUZ0|5.0|Have always loved the Addams Family. Only the newest movies went bad. Christopher Lloyd is one of our favorites and the rest of the cast just made it better.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I recently completed the first two seasons on Amazon  that i had missed previously.<br />What a great way to catch up on missed episodes!
B00AG297GK|3.0|not that funny, just ok. Sick humor that was not funny, some parts were good. and this is going to do what to the rating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was an amazing story<br /><br />I can't wait for the third book and the movies I truly love the hunger games series
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|This app is very useful and cool because you can make hundreds of different notebooks to use, you can draw pictures that go with your writing and or story. I like this app but there are still sime things that don't work or don't make sense, overall it's an good app.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book has made me begin reading all of Spark's books.  I am now on my 4th and plan to read all of them.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|O.K., I'm old.....but trying to learn new tricks!! I follow my favorite news guys, some celebs.....we'll see how long it takes me to get bored tho.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|It is better than the old app I had. You see your profile they way you do on your computer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really liked minecraft because you can make whatever you want to. I made a mansion and the mansion turned out to be good. I would of never been able to have so much fun. I think you should get this game if you are looking for something to do. I think it is worth $6.99.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|The game itself is cute and entertaining.  But there is a pop up between EVERY scene advertising another game.  And, I got this as a free app of the day and it was advertised as coming with 12 different restraunts.  But after a day or two 6 of those restraunts are locked but I can pay to unlock them.  I'm a little annoyed at the money grabbing attempts so would not recommend this.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is amazing and I wish they would make a  update soon because I beat it in 2 days spool please hurry its a amazing game
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|I think that anyone that's seeking for knowledge of the experiences that African people encountered throughout history should see the fight and the knowledge that these brave little girls possessed.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Normally Sword & Magic books are not don't interest me, but I found the book a good match with the HBO series. Driven by a problem keeping track or even remembering the numerous characters, I decided to read the book. It certainly helped in keeping the various Houses and characters in order.<br /><br />But surprisingly, the problems with the book, primarily the thin and clich&eacute;d characters (this is the smart son, the brave daughter, the evil knight, etc.) was much improved by the fine actors the HBO series had. Particularly Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, is probably the most interesting character on HBO since Ian McShane in Deadwood.<br /><br />If long novels of quasi-medieval kings is your thing, you probably already own the book. But if you are just struggling to understand the HBO series, and you have a lot of time on your hands, the book is worth it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone.  Very hard to leave alone. So many intersting ideas, recipes, quotes.  So much better than facebook.  There's no mess here.
B00CL6GDF2|4.0|This show follows in the heart of the Hannibal Lectar series, and for that I thank the writers.  The acting, story line, and character development is incredible.  However I will complain about some small things.  This story happens just before Hannibal is caught- however the actor is a bit young.  The time-line is a bit wrong- rather then the 80s it's in modern times (that takes out the Hannibal Rising book).  Also instead of the incredible and beautiful music by the composer Hans Zimmer, we get this overwhelming synth and pad music, followed only by some actual instruments- I wouldn't complain about this but I have to take a break in between shows now because my ears hurt (when watching with headphones).  However- those are all minor nit-picks and really shouldn't deter any Lectar fans or anyone in for a good thriller.  I just hope when (if) season two rolls around they will fix the soundtrack for the sake of my ears.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Its great fun . My grandkids can play this game. Its just loads of fun, very enjoyable and hard to put down.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I love Dexter I have the whole series I haven't watched it yet but it can in no time at all and I am sure they will be great
0345803485|3.0|I chose this rating because it took me to long to read it.  It didnt end like i thought it would and I havent recommended it to anyone.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Loved this show - wish it had continued into more series. I'd still be watching it today. Please bring it back!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Excellent series! It just keeps getting better! I'm extremely happy to have found this.  I'll be sorry to hit the end.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|gameloft should make two more games like infected or search and destroy<br />on multipayer but other than that this game is awesome
B009K0P10K|5.0|love Aiden, he really takes it to another level. - and most of the others.  Victoria, just perfectly crazy horrible...can't believe the writing, so well done.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I loved their first album, liked the second, but I was unprepared for how much I'm loving this one. This seems like a huge leap forward in the sophistication of the songwriting and inventiveness. All the playfulness and polyrhythms come together with the new elements and result in some really beautiful songs. I don't know the last time an album made me smile so much.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Never thought I would connect with a contract killer!  Baldacci did a great job in this and certainly has me hooked ....
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|If you like the early I&W but didn't like Kiss Each Other Clean (KEOC), I'm gonna guess this one won't be your cup of tea either.<br /><br />I thought KEOC was pretty good and enjoyed hearing Beam branch out to try some new approaches to his songs. The new work comes into its own here with some 60's R&B sounds and a lot of jazz influences. Still one of my favorite songwriters and Ghost and Ghost helps make it clear just how good he is.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I really like this version of mahjong. I had downloaded different versions looking for one that is like the one I play on my computer. This version is the best one so far. What I like is all the different layouts this one has. The tiles are at least for me easy to see unlike some of the other versions where I has a hard time seeing what was on the tiles making matching them almost impossible. There are a couple of thing I don't like  there is no undo option and I can't find any place where it keep your score or your stats. There is one option people might have a problem with, the reshuffle one. This option let you reshuffle yout tiles after there are no more moves. I have  done this and have not lost a single game. For some this  may feel like it's cheating but while I do like a challenge I play this to relax and sometime when I played on my computer I would get frustrated if I could not match all the tiles and instead of relaxing I was getting upset and  would play a game over and over. With this version I do relax and enjoy the game. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good mahjong game
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Well written, although two many characters to keep straight in the story.  I didn't like the fact that everyone I liked had bad things happen to them.  Oh well. The story makes the books hard to put down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the way the show lets you see what life was like during the time around WW1.<br />I couldn't wait to watch each episode.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|interesting to read in the original after Russian translation.ingenious author of the book that are not possible to break away
B008602KQI|4.0|I read the book first and the movie seemed to leave out some of the details.<br />I did enjoy the movie.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book was excellent!  It had a very good story plot and it was very well written.  Recommended to anyone who likes fiction.
B0000029DD|4.0|I missed this album when it was released. I just purchased it. Much music in this era was not to my taste.  That said - I cheated myself for all these years to a wonderful album.  Moving songs with actual stories/meaning in a not overhyped musical format is a breath of fresh air . If your tastes lean toward serious/moving/reflective songs and away from techno/dance/rap/music for 10 year olds, hip hop and hard rock, pick this album up.<br /><br />The principal reason I picked this album up was for Jeff's version of Hallelujah. For me this is the best version(out of many) of this powerful song. Basic guitar and wonderful voice - not overdone! The only downside is I wonder why virtually no one sings the complete lyrics to this great Leonard Cohen song.  Tell the whole poem!! The only reason for 4 stars.<br /><br />Enjoy
B00AYM6JFO|2.0|I was looking forward to this album so much.  I absolutely loved his album &#34;Heroes&#34; which did include family.  It was not what I was expecting.  I didn't recognize any family members in this album.
B002VWNID6|4.0|I enjoy this movie a lot.  If only Kevin Costner had attempted an English accent like everyone else in the movie, it might have been a little better.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best game I have played in a very long time. I hope a new one comes out soon
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I love this game! I loved playing it at the arcade when I was little and now it doesn't cost another quarter for more lives. Too much fun! Thank you Spikepit for a great game app, and thatnk you Amazon for making it the App of the Day!
B009K0OL06|5.0|Keeps moving.  Always has several events happening at once.  I enjoy looking at the beautiful costumes and nice houses.  I do like also that the show depicts that taking vengeance can have some nasty consequences, even if it is deserved.  I think life has it's own karma without our help.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this is the best game in the world so stop what ever you are doing and get this amazing app.
0786860707|5.0|yep - probably.  chapters on everything.  flip books on the corners of the pages - how cool is that?  I gave it to my niece who is studying animation at BYU and she was lost for the rest of christmas day.  This book is like a time capsule crown jewel of a babylon candle wrapped up in unicorn mane.  So only get it if you are prepared to see behind the curtain and pay attention to the man.
B0007KTBIU|1.0|Purchased as a gift and it was a bootleg version of the movie. Totally embarassed but have learned my lesson not to purchase movie from Amazon again.
B00005JLIU|4.0|My Grandfather took me to see this when i was a kid, so I was a sucker for it.  Seeing it as an adult it was a fun silly homage to the twenties, flappers, silent movies, and Buster Keaton stunt work.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|A Star Trek classic,even though they're so many ones that come before, this on that I can watch over and over.  Even the Borg Queen is hot in a creepy way, even though she is Borg, she still has that female attitude.
B00C1S945G|4.0|Some 26 years later, ST-TNG holds up fairly well. It had a strong core group of actors who seemed to enjoy working together and which was solidly anchored by Patrick Stewart. At the time it ran in original syndication, it really was about the only quality sci-fi offering out there and it introduce us to the then chilling and soon-to-be-iconic Borg (&#34;Resistance is futile.&#34;). While it didn't have an overarching story arc like Babylon 5, the wild fantasy palette of Farscape and seems tame in comparison to the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, it brought the Star Trek franchise back to life and allowed it to mature. It's nice to revisit it via Amazon streaming.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Excellent game I've been playing the game for a while now and had no problems and the game is a good pass time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have played it a long time but after some time it gets boring. I mean look at the pieces  are they high for some things. Like the 5 boost start 3000 coins! I mean that is a lot  for the boost!I  hate the stupid prices!!!
B000SNW0HA|5.0|I love Daft Punk, and realized I didn't have this album which didn't make sense, so I bought it. The new album is also pretty awesome. Definitely buy this album and listen to it before you buy the new one. SOOO GOOD
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Book was pretty good, but sometimes it got boring. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to anyone. But all in all it wasn't too bad.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Basically, it gives you what you need to write a good story. Mr, King makes it very interesting by giving his own experience. If you are looking for a typical Stephen King book this is not it. He takes his own life stories and shows us how to use them in writing our own stories. He can be very funny and it is an all around entertaining book!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|It's totally of the hook ... maybe not to everyone's taste ... great acting ..good plot  .. cinematography  well done ... and well jeez what am I in school ... an essay .. 300 words ... HA!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Finishing this book on Memorial Day fulfilled the meaning of this holiday.  These men paid the ultimate price to defend the very freedoms many take for granted.  This book made me laugh, cry and left me inspired to never forget the sacrifices that every soldiers, sailor, airmen and marine and their families make everyday on our behalf. Thanks to Marcus for writing such an inspiring story born out the courage and Sacrifice of his team.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My fianc&eacute; and I watched this one night because we had heard mixed reviews about it. Let me tell you, this is a good movie! It had enough old video game references to keep us entertained and it had a well thought out story line with a good message in the end.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|This is one of the best anime's made.  The animation is brilliant.  The characters are heart-wrenchingly real and the story is weird and a little hard to follow but then you just have to watch it again.  My gf was very reluctant to watch anime but I tricked her into watching this one and she was blown away.  It makes me sad when white and black miss each other and awed when they are leaping across roof tops.  Watch it and stop being a uncool person.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|i didn't like this game at all. It was a waste of time to download and not any fun at all.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This didn't take long at all. Not really worth the money IMHO. Yeah the graphics are good but that doesn't matter.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|It is baf.Bad app never loads up.I will try it again before I delete it. I don't have anything yo say.<br /><br />I don't like this app¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002QYNIHU|4.0|S.H Figuarts is known for its fine attention to detail and the articulation of its figures. Goku is no exception. He can pose in many ways like the anime and looks simply fantastic. I only have two issues with the figure:<br />One is the fact that his clothes is yellow. In the anime its more of an orange but I guess its the super saiyan transformation that makes it look that way.<br />Two, I wish he came with some sort of energy ball like Cell did as well as more face options.<br /><br />My score:<br />Articulation 10/10<br />Detail: 9/10 (Very well detailed, I just wish he was orange instead of yellow)<br />Extras: 8/10 (Wish he had more faces and a prop energy ball)<br />Durability: 10/10(So far. I only display and change poses)<br />Overall: 9/10<br /><br />I totally recommend this figure to any DBZ fan out there. Its the best Goku you can find right now for a reasonable price. I am well satisfied with it.
B000U7SN8O|5.0|Mangum is a genius, music and lyrics are amazing. If you are a music fan at all, buy this and listen to it. It might change your life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book full of fire and love a nd sadness and hatred.<br />I would recommend you all to read all the books once you start reading them you can't stop.<br />When I finished this last book I was sad that I finished all of them!
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|Excellent production. Excellent quality and and jacket. This is a movie for all time and well displayed in this offering.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|good storyline good characters...keeps u watching week to week,i like how new characters are introduced,worth watching,each week,i enjoy it much
0689835604|5.0|Our baby loves this book. She enjoys the flaps and pointing to the baby then herself. She, of course, loves the belly button page :)
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|this show is the best on tv,great story great characters,an so in needs to lean back towards the earlier season style a bit more though,
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|One of the best shooting games out ther there.  Very fast pace and awesome graphics!  So far one of the best games on my phone
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I loved it - I didn't put it down for any longer than I had to till I was done.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I downloaded it, but I really don't use it a lot, so it's just ok for now or until I figure out how to use it.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I will be the first to admit that the price is definitely off-putting. I'm not sure what SE is thinking as I'm sure they've done themselves a disservice by chasing away so many customers with such a high price.<br /><br />With that being said, this game is worth every penny for anybody that loves classic RPGs. The controls take some time to get used to but after an hour or so, it should be fine. The music is enchanting and the colorful visuals are delightful.<br /><br />What more can I say? This is pure Final Fantasy. Back when that meant something.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I downloaded it so that I could check my account while mobile. Nice to be able to do that not just at home.
B005IS56CG|5.0|this a replacement of the one i lost  very awsome cd these guys kick major ass over and under is a great song
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|She is pretty negative on some subjects, Also it seems like she is trying too hard to convince the reader how cool she is. Pretty good read, just not that inspiring. Most of what she writes can be found in all the other books on new age help.
B00594XOZU|5.0|If u don't have a phone like me this is great for u. A fast txt app, free, picture sending, and every thing u need while texting and more.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Good exciting read. Lee child does it again writing a good story line. A must read for a true fan.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Labyrinth channel is very clear, very light, does not affect vision, suitable for children.My 8 year old nephew loved it, I loved it. I hope more complicated maze, which is more challenging
B005HSL626|3.0|it is your opinion. if you want to play this game and this game is stupid good. bye bye see you
B0091VTISO|2.0|Terrible acting.  After 20 min. I dumped it from my watchlist.  The original was so much better even without all the newer special effects.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love it I neva New about till diss guy on worldcraft told me about it sense then I've Ibeen lovin the app my user is DreamArmy13MC Diss is not no joke peeps u need to get diss app it's free and u won't regret it kik such an easy name to spell to
B009MYARIK|4.0|Kinsella fans will enjoy this book - it's very Kinsella and a great, easy, quick read - you'll want to keep reading.  I would say I liked &#34;I Have Your Number&#34; a smidge better, but this is a solid 4 stars - and if they would let you give it 4.5 I would.<br /><br />Good beach or airplane read.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Game lots of fun but bingo cards are a lot of money and u don't get enough credits other than that game is a lot of fun and very addictive
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|This is just bad. It is very slow moving and very juvenile. so in that vane I say move on.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I don't know what else to say. It was an amazing book. I'm glad I don't have to wait for the next book.
0316017930|1.0|I think the Gladwell method would be something along these lines:<br /><br />Take an interesting, even if not so original, idea. Present it as if it was not conventional wisdom but almost a revolutionary proposal. Prove with many, very different, sometimes funny, catchy examples how true it is, in spite of the supposedly prevailing and supposedly more influential opposite ideas. Expand, expand, expand, expand so as to make what would be an ok article for The New Yorker (if there had been any concerned attempt at synthesis) into a profitable, easy to swallow, \\"successful\\" book for the uncritical masses. Along the way, the mandatory \\"expansion\\" requires quite a bit of repetition, which transforms the point to prove into some sort of indelible mantra. In Outliers the expansion is punctuated by tedious, intolerably long lists and tables of data to prove the point in question (lists and tables that, when you happen to overall agree with the author's main thesis, seem like unnecessary excesses), all of which progressively compromises the interest of the essay, which gradually becomes more and more and more tiresome, less and less and less engaging.<br /><br />Outliers contains the material for an interesting magazine 8-page article. Soon enough, when you've only read 20% of the book, you feel you already know the tone and the content of the rest of its pages. Unluckily, you are not mistaken: there aren't any surprises lurching in some subsequent chapter, only a few purposeful fire crackers scattered here and there to keep the story from dying.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Really great game, I see how it has won awards. It's challenging and visually stunning. I plan to recommend this to others.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Cool game and lots of fun<br />Can't put it down and looking for it each morning and late afternoon.<br />This game is really fun
B003G4W49C|4.0|Not my usual genre of choice,  I found it interesting, intriguing, drawing me to read on...As far as Sci-fi goes it kept my attention, thru its\\" description I could be there with Ended and experience his life of challenges..
B008DK3QBY|5.0|This is a great set from a great pianist. Everything was just perfect, from the little box to the clear recordings on each CD.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb is the best game of all time for all ages so I'm giving it five stars in hopes of more updates
B00785P2QC|4.0|too expencive but pretty legit and if you like the regular game then u'll like this. and yeah that's all I have to say. so play it. pike it. like it. just play it. its legit. and I don't have more to say so....

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh's music is always very, very good! &#34;Brave&#34; is my favorite cut on this CD, but all of his music is very enjoyable for listening.  I especially like to start this CD as I'm getting to sleep.  Of course, then I miss some of it, but there's always tomorrow!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If you liked the movie you will love the book. There is so much more to the characters and events.
B000JMKNZQ|2.0|Was looking forward to reading this according to the reviews.  Instead of offering thoughts to ponder I found it too wishy washy...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Only wish it had more levels to keep it challenging, heavier objects and the walls stayed up longer. Its addictive though.
B005K17RU0|1.0|DO NOT INSTALL! Because of this app my Kindle Fire is currently hung and will not even hard reboot. I hope when the battery finally drains completely I will be able to reboot and delete it FOREVER! Otherwise, I might be looking at the prospect of purchasing a new Kindle. Not good.<br /><br />Edit: I did finally manage to hard reboot my Fire. Now AccuWeather is deleted forever!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He has done it again. Dug deep into what makes us human with profound understanding. This book makes you laugh, cry and smile through characters who are you, me, and those we know and love. Thank you Mr. Hosseini for making me see things in my own life through the eyes of those who populate this book. Your finest work so far.
B00BL5YQKS|4.0|Got in on the series halfway through when it was on tv. Have enjoyed getting in on the beginning this time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is such a cool game. I like everything about it. totally worth five stars! Anything other than 5stars is not forrect
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is great. It does what t is supposed to do. The screen is large...so are the buttons. Perfect for quick calculations that you don't feel like TRYING to do in your head:-)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Three  persons suggested this book and I in turn have told at least five so far.  I would love to read a squal.
1400069742|4.0|Lynne Olson again proves to be quite talented when it comes to research and narrative. Her treatment of the dynamic between the hero, Charles Lindbergh, and President Franklin Roosevelt helps us to understand those fascinating times.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|Horrible idea that you are the one inflicting the virus in so many countries. I didn't like to have that role, even if it's game.
B00C2VGB30|5.0|I may be biased as a huge fan, but this is truly sublime. It's a perfect showcase for her range of expression, her voice and her unique artistry ... Definitely is an example how song choice completely determines what you get to hear in a particular artist. These song choices are sublime, and I will definitely spend a long time enjoying them. There are no duds on this disc. It's rich and it puts a spell on you. If you've never listened to her, this is the disc to get, without a doubt.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|A great movie and a lot to think about. Tom hanks and hallie are fantastic I had no idea how many characters were actually them!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT BOOK I COUDN'T PUT DOWN... WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FEMALE FRIEND WH O IS OPENED MINDED. MUCH SUBSTANCE.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Unbelievable, the twists and unexpected turns the plot takes.  There has to be a Season Eight because we were really left &#34;hanging&#34;.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It was beautifully written thru a childs eyes.  You are able to feel the hopelessness and ultimate cruelty that this horrible time in our history imparts.  Its ironic ending is not to be forgotten, just as the entire Holocaust is not to be forgotten.
030758836X|2.0|As a disclaimer, let me say I love psychological thrillers but cannot stand Stephen King type crime/horror stories . . . So, this started out as a great summer beach thriller but ended with such a nasty turn that I was left feeling disgusted with all the characters. All through the first 2/3 of the book, the author had some very interesting plot turns which happened just as I thought I'd figured things out and kept me riveted.  However that last 1/3 of the book got way too contrived/crazy for me.  By the end, I really didn't care about/like any of the characters.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good graphics and smooth play with inner games. Stays interesting in a smooth story line. Always something to do and build and changeable.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|great book recommend to all ages a real page turner. cant wait to read next book in series .really enjoyed it

B004I8WD6E|3.0|I needed to make the holes bigger just to make this work. After that, all went well. If you don't have a pile then don't buy this.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|My belief that J.J. Abrams can't (or won't) do original films the past few years is nothing new, and seeing his latest escapade into film making this morning did absolutely nothing to change that. My initial suspicions going into the theater proved to be right in that Abrams simply drew from past material and put a little spin and shine on some of the elements. In case it wasn't that depressingly obvious leading up to the release of the film, yes Benedict Cumberbatch actually does play Khan, with \\"John Harrison\\" simply being a cover. We've seen this done before recently haven't we? Just last July Christopher Nolan had Joseph Gordon Levitt go by the name of \\"John Blake\\" in The Dark Knight Rises before revealing that his real first name was actually in fact \\"Robin.\\" But Abrams borrows(I'll call it that in a nice way) more than just that little nugget from Nolan.So far as I can tell, ever since the Joker allowed himself to be captured in the middle of The Dark Knight in 2008 to ultimately corrupt Harvey Dent, Star Trek Into Darkness marks the third big summer film in the past year that has attempted to mimic Nolan in this regard. Loki gets captured in The Avengers to turn the group against each other, Silva gets captured in Skyfall to attempt to assassinate M, and Khan surrenders in order to save his 72 supermen and women.Going even further, the scene near the end where the Enterprise is falling to Earth and Kirk and Scotty are running sideways on a wall in a hallway, images of the hotel fight sequence from Inception raced through my mind at warp speed.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, borrowing elements from others seems to be a specialty with Abrams (the Hollywood Tarantino). The Star Trek reboot that he did in 2009 owes an enormous debt to the original Star Wars. His reasoning that if Star Trek were classical music and Star Wars was akin to Rock 'n Roll, in order to make Star Trek appealing to a present day audience, some Rock n' Roll needed to be injected, is certainly something I can understand. I would say he injected too much but that's another conversation. The same goes for Super 8. I can understand an homage to the Spielberg films of the 70's, but again it's really nothing that original or something that hasn't been seen before, (as far as I'm concerned) and therefore not all that interesting or memorable. Star Trek Into Darkness borrows many elements from both The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek: Nemesis and if you've seen both they should be pretty obvious. I will say Cumberbatch did a decent job even though he wasn't given a whole lot to do and was underused in my opinion. Some of his facial expressions made me think he would have made a far better Voldemort than Ralph Fiennes was. A few reverses, primarily Kirk sacrificing himself to save the ship rather than Spock and Spock fighting Khan rather than Kirk (if you've seen the original Space Seed episode) did virtually nothing for me. Even Spock yelling Khan's name out loud in a rage (as William Shatner famously did) turned a rather somber moment into an extremely corny one, akin to Darth Vader yelling \\"no\\" at the end of Revenge of the Sith (and Return of the Jedi if you own the Blu Ray). Thankfully Kirk's body was not shot into the Genesis planet and we will not have to suffer through \\"The Search for Kirk\\" 3 or 4 years from now.<br /><br />But what I groaned about the loudest, more so than any of the previous things listed, was this insistence to essentially turn Khan into a terrorist. Even though the word \\"terrorist\\" is never mentioned once in the entire film (\\"one man war\\" is used instead), the fact that he is behind a bombing that takes place in London (July, 2005 ring a bell?) and pilots an enormous starship into a bunch of skyscrapers should say enough. Interestingly, the word \\"Arabic\\" does get mentioned though in an argument between Kirk and Spock, with Kirk citing \\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\\" in a positive way to justify his forth coming actions and Spockflipping it around to reveal the negative reality. Funnily enough the fact that the phrase has an identical Chinese origin is never mentioned. But getting back to Khan, he isn't really the primary villain of the film is he? It just so happens to be the commander of Starfleet, who for whatever reason feels a war with the Klingons is inevitable and is just looking for some excuse to provoke a conflict. Sound familiar? I suppose if you rolled up Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rove, and George Tenet into one you would get Admiral Marcus, but isn't it long past the time for finger pointing now? I had sincerely hoped that after Bin Laden had been found and killed in 2011 this so called \\"War on Terror\\" would finally come to an end and we could finally put that entire mess behind us and move on.Obviously a film had to be made chronicling as much as possible and earlier this year Zero Dark Thirty came out. And that was it, reflection period over,time to move on. Right? Apparently not. Given the recent bombings in Boston,this terrorist thing is still not yet over with and goes on in another form. If anything the Boston bombings have brought a new, fresh sense of fear to Americans. Let me provide you with an immediate example. Early this morning I had planned to see the film (in 2D, I hate Stereoscopic) at the first showing at 10am. I do not have a car so I always walk whenever I see something at the Bow Tie in Richmond. I had brought my backpack with me containing only my most recent paycheck (I went to the bank afterwards) and a Red box copy of The Bourne Legacy (which sucked in its own right). Upon reaching the theater I was immediately turned down by the person manning the ticket booth, saying the theater had a no backpack policy. Now I've taken my backpack to that theater off and on in the past 4 years whenever I feel I'll need to save my seat so this was a new thing. Security wouldn't even hold it for me. So, since I had no car, I had to turn around, walk back to my apartment(1.8 miles), leave my backpack there, and walk back to catch the next showing at 11:20. It didn't need to be said, but given that the two Boston bombing suspects carried the bombs around in backpacks......well. Thinking about it a little more I suppose the word \\"caution\\" not \\"fear\\" would be more appropriate, but then again there has to be a certain amount of fear present in order to initiate caution, so they basically walk hand in hand more or less. Not to mention the overly excessive amount of force used to find the one living suspect, if anything, shows that after 10 years of hunting Bin Laden we haven't learned a whole lot about going after people who've done us harm. Even at the end of the movie, a special thanks is given to the post 9/11 people protecting us.<br /><br />Obviously this film was written and shot many, many months before the bombings took place. It's a common thing for Star Trek films to have some sort of social commentary on the current present, and again I'm still annoyed Abrams chose to talk about terrorism. The fact that the bombings took place after the film was shot but before it was released will make it so that the film shall reinforce the need for caution in the wake of new domestic incidents. T.V. episodes of Hannibal, Castle, and Family Guy were pulled due to sensitive subject matter right after the bombings happened, but I guess its too much to ask a studio to push back one of their summer releases, like they did with Gangster Squad last July after the shootings in Aurora, Colorado. I guess Star Trek was too big and important a film for something like that (Gangster Squad didn't do so well financially).<br /><br />In closing, it seems that Abrams has successfully evolved from a film maker into a plastic surgeon, with the ability to dissect something old and worn out and make it feel and look new and shiny, grossing hundreds of millions of dollars as a bonus. I can see now why he was so heavily, secretly coveted to helm the new Star Wars film coming out in '15 for the growing corporate empire known as Disney. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he drew from past Star Wars material for the new film and put a personal spin on it like he did with Star Trek. We'll see. Time will tell.<br /><br />Oh, and I still hate those damn lens flares.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I downloaded the Splashtop2 software to run Rosetta Stone software on my Android stick used on my tv.  Works really well with no noticeable lag on my wireless network. On my tablet, the limitations are noticeable but that is probably more about the tablet. Recommend this highly.  Don't know if I would pay for the remote access, though.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|The concept of the movie is great.  Barbara Streisand is a wonderful comedic actress in my opinion, and she did a great job as an overbearing mother.  I think they put a couple instances of foul language in there just to get a rating that might increase viewership; I could do without that, it certainly doesn't improve the movie.  I would have been disappointed if I paid full theater price to see the movie, but well worth watching it on Amazon.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It was for me a pleasant reading time. The author shows through Tesla's biograohy, which features are common between genius and gives tips to develop it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey gets better and better!  I was totally shocked at the Season 3 finale.  Can't wait for Season 4!!!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|An entertaining movie that keeps the viewer wondering how the film makers accomplished the shot.  I did find the animation to occasionally become too unbelievable.  I do recommend the movie as a &#34;must see&#34;.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is that hero.  Lee Child does not disappoint.  It's hard to beat entertainment and drama.  This book has both.
B003TY3F06|4.0|I am not a big action adventure shoot 'em up movie type or even Hollywood romance type, but this is really a nice movie for a wide variety of people. Really sweet music too. Love the instrumental that plays throughout the movie. You won't forget the music.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child has me hook on this series.  Jack Reacher is a unintentional hero, who isn't always believeable; but he is always entertaining.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have not read in a while but this read has definitely made me remember why I  loved reading in the past and I will continue to read more and more wonderful stories like this one...

B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Years ago on a chat show Arnold Schwarzenegger was asked about his limitations as an actor.  His response was he couldn't play Hamlet but Olivier couldn't play the Terminator.  \\"The Last Stand\\" is testament that Arnold is back in a big way.  It's a film that harkens back to his heyday in that it's heavy on action but also story and character driven.  Arnold slips into his bordertown sherriff duds like he wore his Terminator leathers.  The stunt work, notably the car chases, are absolutely jawdropping.  This film is oldschool in a good way.  It puts the tired 3-D CGI exercizes to shame.  I know that Arnold has been tabloid fodder of late and it's fashionable to dismiss him as a hasbeen.  This film bombed out of theatres before I knew it even existed.  \\"The Last Stand\\" deserves to be a home video hit that it was denied at the multiplexes.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Simply put, I could not put it down! Wish it never ended. When is the Room 2 going to be out?  I want more!!!
B00BNWWVFG|2.0|\\"Side Effects\\" starts promisingly enough.  A young housewife(Rooney Mara) whose husband has just been released from prison for insider trading tries to kill herself.  The attending psychiatrist(Jude Law) at the ER asks to see her at his office.  After some perfunctory questions he writes her a prescription for a new anti-depressant and sends her on her way.  Moments later we see him at lunch with colleagues where the tab is being picked up by a pharmaceutical saleslady whose company is marketing the drug that Law's character prescribed.  I'm thinking great this movie is going to be an indictment of the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry.  Wrong! It turns into one of those thrillers where nothing and nobody is what they seem.  In a word, trash.  Sure the film as helmed by master director Steven Soderbergh has a certain ominous feel to it and the performances are pretty good notably Law's.  Regardless, I prefer my trash to be without pretensions instead of elevated dreck like \\"Side Effects\\".
B00003CX9W|5.0|I remember this from my childhood and couldn't WAIT to buy it!!  My daughter and I enjoyed this in the theaters many times.

B009ZQNN90|1.0|Shame on you amazon - I want my money back.  I am sure the film is good - I loved the broadway show.  Who would know - amazon was dreadful.
0718157672|5.0|I simply love this book! Beautifully published, with stunning photos, a pleasure to look at, and most importantly, the instructions are so so simple to follow! True, I don't always follow his recipes step by step, and there's no way I'll ever be able to have a meal ready in under half an hour, but still Jamie's food is always delicious, and easy to prepare:) it just always works! I highly recommend!
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy Lindsey's YouTube channel, videos, and music. This album is very well produced and all of the songs are great. That said, I feel like it could use some diversity. Some songs sound very similar - not because they are but because the timing and beats in the background bleed/flow into each other. I'd like to see more creativity such as Moon Trance. I feel as if that'll come with time as a musician for her.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Rarely can we come across a book of this magnitude..It does feel like an achievement having read through all these countless chapters, but I think I can honestly say it has made me a better human being! True enough, to a modern reader some of the descriptive passages might appear a bit tedious, but the story is so gripping, heart-breaking and uplifting at the same time, it is all worth it! It simply gives you back the belief in humanity and the power of goodness!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is actually a really good game. The armour designs are amazing. My favourite is the starboost armour. I would recommend this game for people who like iron  man<br />.

B009MYARIK|4.0|Ms. Kinsella delivers once again a tale full of startling and often comical adventures involving characters that are delightfully human.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|I watch this every holiday season and love it. I think it is the best holiday movie of all time. I don't know what else to say except that anyone who has not seen it should watch it at lease once.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I didn't see anything special about it except for the hot air balloon. I like the temple run 2 better
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a book I could not quit reading.  I had to finish but didn't want it to end. I recommend highly.
B0058SNKNS|4.0|I got these shoes because I've been having foot problems and am having to walk on a lot of hard wood/tile floors.  I had hoped that these shoes would protect my feet.  They've done pretty well. I wear a 7 1/2 shoe, and from reading the reviews, thought that the 8 would have fit okay.  I maybe should have gotten the 7.  They do stay on pretty well, though, and I like the style.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was funny and had me cheering and crying for the characters. I found characters very real and likable.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As always, Grisham book &#34;The Racketeer&#34; was GREAT, I'm never disappointed with his books. My all time favorite is still &#34; The Street Lawyer&#34;.

B000M2O6AQ|4.0|I felt it strayed quite a lot from the book but the message was still there. We are all in a battle to make our selves feel good. We need to find it within ourselves instead of trying to steal it from each other.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the very best book in the world and I really like all the series I just can't wait till the 8th book comes out!!!! :):):):)
B00AG297GK|2.0|I was hoping for better, but this was just a really poorly made movie with bad lines that tried to be funny, but failed at that.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|Simple to use yet does everything I could want of an alarm clock app.  The free version has all the functionality of the paid version and the ads are unobtrusive.  But after using the free version for months I paid to upgrade out of appreciation.

0812983459|5.0|A wonderful book.  Exquisite prose. Poignant, profound, moving, hope-giving.  To be treasured and relished.  A fabulous book club read since there is so much to talk about.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Loved the movie.  Just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, with a satisfying ending. I would recommend it!
B005SAYRA6|5.0|I think this one is the best I have seen yet!  Cant wait to see the 6th one.  Its action packed and full of thrills!  Its a must see!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Turned it off two minutes in. The black and white ruined it.  I was thinking Good Will Hunting and was greatly disappointed.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a nice story with interesting characters and plots. Easy to escape into their world and enjoy a simpler time!

B009CGR416|5.0|Ok, nothing will EVER replace Goonies, but Scott Pilgrim comes a close second. Scott is the guy inside every (dorky) guy.
B009EFP278|5.0|We heard him for the first time on Dancing with the Stars and liked the song a lot.  Ordered the CD and boy were we pleasantly surprised -- every song is a hit.  That's saying a lot from &#34;oldies&#34; and &#34;C&W&#34; fans!
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|The Miller family lives in a private, wealthy community with a sophisticated security system. Nicole Kidman is entrusted with renovating their mansion while fast-talking diamond salesman Nicolas Cage is often away. One of the alarm installers, together with his brother, brother's girl-friend, and an 'enforcer' (his brother owes $180,000 to a drug dealer), plan and execute a home invasion.<br /><br />The plot is dreadful, stupid, and ridiculous, Nicolas Cage is tired, bloated and as improbable as one could be (probably his worst film), and Nicole adds nothing. The Academy should have taken both their Oscars away for this one.<br /><br />The 'good news' is that I got the DVD from the library - at least it didn't cost anything.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|All the important relationshipo are touched upon.  Reminds the viewer about the importance of maintaining thos relationships.  Mordrid's role is a major plus.to the story and it is well played.

B009AP2G26|5.0|I'm 75 years old & GLEE is still one of my favorites.  Great acting & writing.  I didn't start with Season 1 but went back on the net & have now seen all 4 seasons & hope it's still with us.  Season 4 covered the after high school transition & did it well.  Glee rocks as does Amazon that brings us great offers as a member.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I loved your sharks. I spend hours playing the game. My favorite shark is the megladon. I complete each legal as quick as I can.
B005544V6A|4.0|I like the  relationship between the &#34;Suits&#34; characters.  They're supportive & respective of each other.  The fast paced story line is cleaver.  Every character is well developed.  I love Suits... when is the new season beginning?
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Instantly became my favorite album. I would rate every song but one 5 out of 5 stars. I love One Republic, but this is their best yet.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely worth the $1.99 price, this was a challenging and addictive game with just enough of a spooky Victorian mood to make it fun without being over the top. Looking forward to the next room!
B00942G4UA|5.0|scary, but it should be required viewing for the American public.it will really make you think about what you put in your mouth, and what we have done to our precious food supply.

B00CWV8X04|5.0|I had read reviews of this movie when it came out in the movie theater, but did not get a chance to see it.  Its a great movie, and has an interesting story and twist, was really happy I rented it.  One of Soderbergh's better movies!  Great casting and great story.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I just felt the book was a little slow in parts.  The plot was interesting, but a little too convoluted.
B00BEJ5O6Q|3.0|Ok I am a huge Country Fan.  Huge.  I like Blake Shelton.  I only have this cd and his last one.  His last cd is great, this one not so great.  Its got good songs on it, but its alittle vulgar.  Which normally from Country Artists this isn't normal.  That's normal for pop artists or rock artists.  I mean my 5 year old daughter can not listen to this, so its hard for me to find time to listen to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a really fun app except the fact I cant get to the menu without leaving and playing a different app and get back on other then that I totally recommend it
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|I don't normally comment on movies ( to each his own), but this is a real stinker. Entirely too long, never even watched it all. I lost all interest as I and everyone else watching with me could not understand the dialog and it just went on and on and on.  Why it needed 3 directors is beyond me.  The only riveting part is the rivets I'd like to put in the DVD itself.
B004GYY714|5.0|The best radio station ever!! Everything is on this radio station, everything!!  There's 70K + music, podcasts, talk shows & everything in between.  I love it TuneIn radio!!

B0087EACJK|2.0|My little nephew liked it but I did not. It is too boring for me, you might like it, it was just not for me
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I really enjoyed the characters in this book. The author had a detailed and humorous way of describing the scenes. It brought me back to San Francisco. The  progressive unique nature of that city. The book was the right kind of nerdy with great vocabulary and fun to read  aloud on a train. It connected the old world of books and craft with new innovative technology an  ideas.<br />The ending was a little disappointing but real. I  was as if it could be true.<br />I would recommend this book to those who like books , San Francisco and technology .

B0000AVF29|5.0|Relive Eric Burdon and the Animals in their most intuitive creative stage. The poet's cynisism and tone poem textures of Eric Burdon excel as this band of Animals paints your ears with memories of sonic bliss. Eric's uses his mouth as an instrument creating the sounds of the sea and the band never fall flat in virtuosity. It's the mind coming aware with age weighing out indecision and offering several possible solutions. Subconscious meets the conscious as &#34;Winds of Change&#34; truly does alter the ways to define reality. My only regret, that this combo,which recorded &#34;A Girl Named Sandoz&#34; did not offer a stereo mix of this B-Side, but everything else is engineered wonderfully, recapturing the innovation of the artists and composers.This is no piffle, just laying down the world as Eric knew it.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|So far, this is the best app I've found for Kindle HD users to have fb on their tablet.<br />It's limited and that's why I say it's just okay.<br />It at least let's one access their fb account and perform some functions.<br />If I find better I will definitely make it known.
0061537969|5.0|I first bought it for the dog angle, having recently lost my dear Boston buddy, but I am really into auto racing and I hadn't realized that this was the kind of racing he was talking about. I was delighted to learn that the dog was named Enzo and that he had so much to say!  I loved this book. I've played the end several times. The reader is great too.<br />Wow. Something for everyone. Just fabulous.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is my go to app for keeping an eye on my Kindle Fire HD battery status.<br />Gives good status updates that you can define within optional parameters.<br />Never fails to work as described. Free version is great.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It is a bit of a \\"chick flick\\" but I loved the theme and the acting was superb! Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro do a great job together.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A very innovative and cool game. Entertaining and fun for everyone. Definitely challenging since it actually involves thinking things through rather than just blatant shooting and destruction like fps games. Fun 2D side scrolling game. Worth a look for anyone that might be skeptical of giving it a try.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|And in this movie I love her even more so. If youre a fan of the first one, then this one will go down just as well. Ms. Beckinsale is beyond HOT in her skin tight, all black one piece jumpsuit and the way she mows down those lycanns one by one is just bada$$ in my book.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|After trying a few different media server apps for my Kindle HD I settled on this one for now. I may find others in the future that top it but as a very picky software user I found this media server to do everything it should do. Definitely lives up to being a great media server. Finds everything on my PC and lets me play everything. Transcodes almost every type of file as well. Definitely worth checking out.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books of the year. Beautiful story a out what it means to be a really good person as well as those who are not so good.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This little free calc app work as described. Responsive interface. FREE is nice. No complaints. Definitely recommend to fellow Kindle Fire HD users.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew Evans thinks he has it all. A top job, the perfect bachelor pad, and enough charm and good looks to make sure he gets any woman he wants - just for one night, of course.  All that changes when he meets Kate Brooks.  No one has intrigued - or infuriated - him more, and the sparks that fly between the two of them are something he has never experienced before. Told entirely from Drew's point of view, Tangled by Emma Chase is a hot and hilarious read that will leave you smiling.<br /><br />Do you see that unshowered, unshaven heap on the couch? The guy in the dirty grey T-shirt and ripped sweatpants?<br />That's me, Drew Evans.<br />I'm not usually like this. I mean, that really isn't me.<br /><br />From those first lines, I knew this book was something different.  The way he talked to the reader, the male's point of view - I had to know how this was going to play out, and how he ended up as a heap on his couch.  The resulting story was nothing short of entertaining - watching the banter and competition between Kate and Drew had me laughing out loud constantly. But more than that, through all the antics I got to know them.  I wanted them together, could see how they were just right for each other.  I didn't realize that was happening, until it came to the point that I just FELT for them and what they meant to each other.  This book wasn't just funny, it had my heart wrapped up in the characters. Sneaky you, Emma Chase!! How'd you do that so easily???<br /><br />While sometimes I didn't appreciate the asides breaking up the story, one of the best parts of the book was getting inside Drew's brain. A romance entirely from the male's point of view, and a cocky male at that, make this book really unique.  We know the reasons behind every word, stare, and action - whether we want to or not, lol! His thoughts and his defence of said thoughts are more often than not funny or crude, yet they ring of truth.<br /><br />Like a guy's going to say to his friend, \\"Dude, she was one fugly chick, but once I saw her chomping that romaine, I just had to nail her.\\"<br />No man wants to f*** a skeleton - and nibbling crackers and water like a prisoner of war at dinner isn't attractive. It just makes us think about what a cranky b**** you're going to be later on because you're starving.<br /><br />I was dying laughing! My husband was asking me what was going on and I was all \\" chomping romaine!!\\" and he didn't understand.<br /><br />Plain and simple, read this book. It was funny, enjoyable, and feel-good all at the same time. You will fall for the characters and root for a happy ending. You will not be disappointed!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is the best shooter I have ever played. Great gameplay, cool vehicles, and plenty of weapons. And the best part is that its free
B00BZODDYU|5.0|--NO SPOILERS--<br />I must say, this movie was really good.  Not over the top special effects (that usually ruins the movie) and the storyline was excellent!  The movie had it's own pace which allow you to sit back and enjoy a good thriller -- that has a good storyline!<br /><br />Totally recommend this.
B0041D843M|4.0|I am still reading this book and only for this reason to I give it a 4 star rating. I have been very inspired by its content and though I have been vegetarian for 42 years I am now becoming Vegan also. Very interesting information offered in a very user friendly manner. I so appreciate this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this or not... Love my Bible... I have it highlighted, marked, written in, ect.  This  is something different that I can pick up and it gives me a chapter to read ... it just pops up and it may even be a book in the Bible that I have not studied much before... it helps me step out of my comfort zone...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|All of us real demigods LOVED this book! We liked how it showed how it was to be on a quest (have completed 2) and how it had plenty of action. Can't wait for house of hades! Plus, spoiler alert, demigods are real! - A real demigod
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great movie, great performances. It was a great portrayal of high school life.<br />Logan Lerner, Emma Watson and other characters Pop on screen, making it a great performance to watch and enjoy.<br />I reccommend it highly.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I FOUND this game to be very enjoyable. You must practice patience if you want to move up in the ranks....or spend real dough!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is my favorite game. I play it all the time. The only complaint I have is that there hasn't been an update to add more puzzle in months.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game!!! I want more games like this one! This is a game for people who not want to pay for thier fun.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Old school fun,  simple to learn/play,  no long, boring, dumb,  tutorials, if you like Galago you're going to love this
B00CRW2066|5.0|Love this album!  I started listening to The National under High Violet and played that album over and over. I think this one might take its place. I bought a few older albums but nothing could compare to HV, but now things have changed.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I've always loved to watch Star Trek. Its one of those shows u couldn't miss because it came on tv everyday. It was a family affair, we all watched Captain Kirk and Spock travel the universe meeting new beings and exploring the frontier. Star Trek is a classic and First Contact keeps me watching more and more.  The Borg in First Contact are the one of the many enemies the crew of the Enterprise must conquer in order to maintain order within the universe. Just a classic show and I love to watch over and over.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|I can't even get the game without deleting everything off my kindle. Lower the space required for this game!please. And when I got dungeon Hunter 3 I can't delete it off my device!wth!!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I cringed at some of the graphic parts, but I'm not a real squeamish person - thank goodness.  I don't normally watch a movie more than once, but this is one of those movies I can watch multiple times.  I liked all the main characters.  I liked the fact this movie had both serious and funny parts in it.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I do not usually like movies that much  with females in the lead role, but this movie was as good as they get!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This was  a replacement item for  a cord that no longer worked.  After keeping my Kindle connected for a long time, it would not take a charge with the old cable
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is really cool!  It has great graphics and makes you feel like you really are underwater.  The memo reef game has new characters, and characters from the original film.  This game is the best of all the underwater/aquarium games I have played so far.<br /><br />Thank You.
0670026557|5.0|I have admired Dr. Adam Grant's work for some time and was very aware of his groundbreaking work in the area of introverted leadership( ex. introverted leaders make better leaders of proactive employees). Several of the concepts in this intriguing book, especially the idea of \\"powerless communication\\" (an oxymoron, right?) align with that of introverted leadership. Listening and not making it all about oneself is a hallmark of quiet influencers.<br /><br />One case illustrates the author's refreshing style. By recognizing \\"the elephant in a room\\" of seasoned Air Force colonels he took them by surprise (\\"I know some of you are thinking right now: What can I learn from a professor who is twelve years old?\\")  and won over a skeptical audience.<br />Grant's summaries and case examples are clear and the research is used to make key points, not to fill pages. I also like the three concepts of Givers, Takers and Makers. A useful model for tracking the patterns of our own behavior and that of our colleagues. You will learn from this new take on reciprocity. I highly recommend it!
B00A32CKKI|5.0|Incredible acting! Its amazing to see what the US passed through in this era. We were very strong then yes
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great ending, in my opinion.  Surprised by some of the characters that died, but think it was needed for the ending of this magnificent series.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great story, well presented, talented acting, superb screenplay, emotional and memorable. I recommend this to everyone over 13.  There are a couple of scenes where nudity is inferred but not shown.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great storyline, graphics, and puzzles.  Loved the bonus game at the end. Would definitely recommend purchasing this game for anyone looking for a good hidden objects game.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Could not put this down once I installed it. Beat it in about a day and a half, but I keep playing it for fun because it's just... fun! Wish the game itself was longer though, otherwise it would have gotten another star.
B000PC0SPU|1.0|Wonderful and insightful.  I was making lots of notes every chapter.  The chapters on meaning and play will change how I function at work.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started 2 days ago and had to skip yesterday because my legs are so sore!! Level 1 is no picnic but if you have muscle plain with just one workout, that means it works!! It's nice because if you want an easier workout you copy one fitness model and if you want something harder, you follow a different one. Keep in mind that you will need to get a set of hand weights for this video!!
0553386697|5.0|Has some very interesting points.  It's good to be reminded why some kids make such poor choices and gives practical ways of helping kids.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|This movie might not have been so bad if the language wasn't so bad.  Guess the actors didn't have to learn to many lines as word (F) seemed to be the main one used. To bad good actors, like Cooper, Lawrence & DeNiro have to stoop to using filthy language to sell movies.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|Started watching Suits, finished the whole season in a day. Best new show and am addicted love Harvey great character, cannot wait till July 16!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|A gripping and entertaining classic for years to come. A must see for everyone. And don't give me that horn swaggle about all the extra features not being a part of the original book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Would recommend to others, has very descriptive scenes that people would really enjoy. Especially women, they would really love it.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|By far the most impressive handheld title I've ever played across every available system since GameBoy. It takes a little getting used to, but the story and game-play here are very interesting and fun. Be prepared for a pretty long intro segment (anywhere from 2 to 3 hours) in the game in which you're pretty much just learning the story and getting to know the characters without any combat or real control over your party. It's not really a tedious part of the game, but it could turn some people off before the actual game truly starts. You will get over 50-60 hours of story gameplay here, possibly more depending on play style. Well worth the 40 dollar asking price. Persona 4 Golden will go down as one of the greatest JRPGs of all time.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Thought it was a children's  game, became addicted instantly. Follows the usual pattern of accumulating resources to obtain rrwards and fullfil missions.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|It sucks right now. Purchased walking dead 3 to watch but I can't get it to work and no one has responded to me.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|Book 3 of 1Q84 was just as satisfying as #1 and 2. The story- though kinda weird, moves along throughout-scattered amongst three main characters- who are linked together in a number of ways...though not all of them are clear at the onset of the novel.<br /><br />Reading the book is akin to opening- or wrapping for that matter- one of those meticulous Japanese packages, whose paper is exquisitely delicate and all of the folds are perfectly even. I loved Murakami's imagination, and the frames of reference in the book are wide reaching across many cultures. The book is set in Tokyo, in reality [however there is questionable reality going on throughout] but the imagination spans generations and cultures. There are pop music references, classical music and literature references abounding. I never once felt lost in a particular cultural framework.<br /><br />It takes a long while to read 1Q84 from the beginning to the end, but it is worth every moment.
B000005GYI|4.0|I love Milton Nascimento, I buy this one because of: &#34;1001 albums you must hear before you die&#34; excellent both music and lyrics
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Bet Michael Buble album yet!<br /><br />Sure hope Wendy Wax is planning a sequel to While We Were Watching Downton Abbey!<br /><br />Izzy's (Israel K) rendition os Somewhere Over The Rainbow is the one they will play 100 years from now.  Hope he sees the joy he gave the world from where he lives over the rainbow now.....Thanks and rest joyfully, Iz.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Once my daughter starts playing she doesnt want to stop. SHE loves it...me, not so much, lol! Set a timer!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think diary of a wimpy kid is the best: it is funny and cool.I wish you luck with the next book. You are the best!!! (my 8 year old daughter)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I love Martin's works.  You never know where he is going to go. Keeps you on your toes.
076115678X|3.0|But I was a little disappointed.  I expected more details about curly hair management.  The book was ok for beginning curly hair maintenance.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Although the first few episodes were a little slow, the most recent ones have really picked up.  Episodes 7, 8, and 9 have built some momentum and increased interest in the characters.
B000FCJZ3G|4.0|Good book.  I learned a lot about wealth and wealth mentality from this book.  The author does spend a lot of time promoting his Seminars, but I would too, I guess.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Each time I pick up a Lee Child Reacher book I am never disappointed. Reacher's logic and reasoning abilities keep me absorbed to the point of total escapism. The writing's are well researched and believable. I would like to see him get a ' bit roughed up' in some of the situations he encounters- he can't always get it 'right' Certainly would love to see some movies with say Liam Neeson as 'Reacher&#34;. What about it Lee?
B0088WK6CE|5.0|Actually, since I am a huge fan of anything Glen Hansard does, ever since his appearence in the movie, The Commitments, it may not be a good idea for me to say much.  This is a much more stripped down record than most of his work, and the tempos of the songs are more on the slow/mellow side.  His delivery is still strong, intense, and passionate, and the songwriting is as good as ever.  If you like the Frames and the Swell Season, this solo effort is not a far stretch from those projects.  But then again, I pretty much like everything he has done.  Go buy it!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this version as much as I love the others. Cut the rope is a great game for all ages!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Wish you got more bucks but I'm impatient...all in all good game you can play forever or a few minutes at a time
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show offers something different from the garden variety shows that are being offered. It isn't always predictable, and has great witty humor with a great dynamic between the lead characters.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Ok game but it wants you to link it to your Facebook way to much for my liking. I don't like having my Facebook news feed full of game crap
B00CW665VI|5.0|Seriously...oh my freakin god I absolutely flippin loved this book!!!! I laughed so much!!! I even teared up a little for Drew!!!! When his sweet side came out I just melted!!!! I love love loved him!!!! Can't wait to read more from Emma Chase!!!! If I could I'd give this book 10 stars!!! Awesome awesome read!!!!
B005PTQPU0|2.0|I've been a fan of KB's since I was 12 years old. I'm not a devotee but I loved Aerial,etc. This album is simply boring - it is mostly piano noodling (although done with her usual aplomb of course) and gets old fast. Wild Man is the only \\"conventional\\" KB song and it's a worthy addition to her catalogue. Otherwise, I feel cheated - that she didn't spend any time composing, arranging or recording.
B00BEU19ZU|4.0|I like this app because I do alot of flying with my job.<br />it let me check the status of my flights on the go.<br />If you travel, it is a whrth while app to have.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Fabulous continuation to the first book. Can't wait to read the next one. It keeps getting better and better. The characters are much better fleshed out than the first book.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Requires good eye and hand movement.  Can unlock new blades for better slicing.  Graphics are colorful and response is good.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie is good therapy for the soul.  We laughed.  We cried.  My son almost got up and walked out, because it hit so close to home for him.  However, he was glad he stayed, because it is a classic.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I have played it for a while now and I gave the game a lot of time. It is a fun game to pass time but has no challenge to the mind. Don't get me wrong a great game to just be dumb and not challenge yourself and relax. So thumbs up to relax thumbs down to be challenged. You choose.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great cast, elegant script and interesting context.  Looking forward to the next season. Definitely a five star experience! thank you
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Or perhaps I should say stories as each of the characters experience their own losses. I would have given 5 stars except that I sometimes had trouble keeping my place. Both the timelines and multiple character threads were at times confusing.  Each of the characters are well drawn and developed; each of their stories can tear at your heartstrings.  And, as in life, even with &#34;closure&#34; there is often no closure.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|There is no other book that I have read that even comes close to the paradoxical humor and complex storytelling that happens in this work.  The work is lengthy, but once you catch on to its ironic humor, deep themes, and incredibly complex literary pictures it paints, you will be hooked.  In my opinion this is one of the greatest works to come out of the WWII era, and it is a masterpiece of literature on so many different levels.
B0090SI4LU|1.0|This movie is horrendous from the word go.  Bad writing (laughable.)  Bad acting, but with such bad writing not sure what could have been done.  Bad scenery (totally unbelieveable.)  Bad direction (the writer directed.)  Slow, boring, plotless and pointless....unless maybe if you're a 12-year-old girl.
B0079J28NW|4.0|What can one say - its Beatles, its classic - no more no less.<br /><br />I have to add this sentence because the box is telling me '6 more words required'
B001974DG0|3.0|I really did like the premise of the book, but disappointed in the execution of it.  The dog was the most well defined character.  I had a difficult time caring about the 2 protagonists and the bad guy was a one dimensional creep.
B006ORLAPC|4.0|Sadly, an underrated movie (box office wise) but well worth the time to follow through with it. As usual, performances are all fine, The story, though not entirely accurate historically is a fascinating one nonetheless. If you like your spy movies to have a little less double OMG in them then catch this one - an excellent companion to Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games and this is one of the most unique games out there.  Makes you think of puzzle solutions not just in two dimensional ways.  Definitely would like more games like this!!  First review I've ever felt compelled to write.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Easy gameplay, great graphics and very addictive! Fun for the entire family. My five years old twins love it, they really enjoy the fruit mess!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's just another solitaire game but I like to play solitaire.  Just another way to spend me free time.  As long as I'm winning, I'm a happy camper.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked this book. I am really into erotic trilogies. I liked the fact that Gideon is domineering in a settled way, and it is obvious that it is not a Fifty Shades knock off.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game very day.  Love it.  I have it on all my devices.  It's easy and challenging at the same time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book. I had a hunch about the ending and I was right. Not only is this a love story it holds suspense. I recommend this Trilogy. I am waiting patiently for book 3 to come out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This has got to be one of the best dystopian science fiction stories I've ever read. The characters were so well developed and complex, and one quickly drawn into the atmosphere of life in their world. As the mystery unfolded, I could not stop reading and just had to know what the big mystery was.  How did they get there, what was REALLY going on.  I simply didn't want to put this book down. I had the WhisperSync version, so I listened to the audio when I wasn't reading the Kindle book.  I could see it easily jumping to the big screen as a movie -- it's such a compelling story! Definitely  going to read the sequel, Shift Omnibus, to see how the story continues.
B006M4F67A|4.0|The pile of tiles is more complex than other Maj games. Backgrounds and music. Just a neat presentation. Iwould recommend to a friend.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I did not like the way it does not let you back  if you have no credits and I not being a good player was thinking this was like a practice game to become better at BINGO. Not interested in purchasing credits. Not a big fan of the free download.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|Refreshingly fun Brit pop music.  Really good album and you can't beat the price.  The majority of songs are well made and thoughtful.  No filler!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome game. Simple but addictive. Glad that they brought to Kindle. I had the game on my phone for awhile.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|After their near-perfect debut album, Tourist History, I was hesitant to even listen to Beacon. After purchasing the MP3 album at $5.00 (which I had no hesitation whatsoever doing), I was pleased to find that Beacon is a solid follow-up to their debut. Although the two albums sound similar, Beacon does have a refreshingly different sound, especially in tracks like The World is Watching and Sun (my personal favorites). The inclusion of a female vocalist makes The World is Watching one of their most distinguished tracks. The title track, Beacon, is arguably their most unique song to date and is a perfect end to the album. It is a slow-paced song in comparison to Two Door's consistently high-energy tracks throughout their discography. My only criticisms for this are its short playtime (just under 40 minutes) and that the songs slowly begin to blur.<br />The thing I love about Beacon is that the songs don't require attention, so the music is good for doing almost anything. Most music distracts me when studying or reading, and Beacon does not, despite its high-energy.<br />Buy this album. You will not regret it.
B007N85POS|5.0|Fun break from reality.  I do not get to play it long, as soon as my kids hear the music they want to play!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really fun. Links to facebook so you can send credits back and fourth, and as you advance and accomplish your daily credits go up. Also their is a point on the experience meter that gives you credits, keys, power ups. Can socialize with others while playing or completely shut that feature off. A daily tournament is held every 24 hours and let's you play 5 rounds 1-4 cards free. I play daily and love it. Glitches once and a while but if you make the company aware the reimburse you any lost credits (like 24 hours)
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Best holder for my iPhone and I suppose other smart phones these days... works great, is some what robust, however, it is more on the consumer side then pro for ultimate use.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great game with great graphics would like more games like this one!!!!!!would like it to last a little longer but still a wonderful game
B0095ZQ36G|1.0|I'm troubled by the apologetic, even laudatory reviews of this book, but genuinely appalled at the author for having written it and the publisher for having published it. More than either by the man it heroizes. In the course of his meetings and discussions with this ex Luftwaffe officer, a man who, with great pride, skill and pleasure, fought, killed and maimed on behalf of the most monstrous criminal empire ever to scar the face of the earth, the author, like the German nation under the Third Reich, lost his way. 60 million people died in the cause for which Franz Stigler fought, and the worst he can say of it, years later, in \\"thoughtful\\" retrospect is, \\"I must admit that I was . . . very indifferent, and thought it was all bulls__t to be honest.\\" No matter. All is forgiven, and readily, for the great Franz Stigler, idealized for one decent, human act and for adhering to the glorious code of the Luftwaffe, was never a member of the Nazi Party. He didn't even like the Nazis! Imagine that! Liked them so little, in fact, that when asked, \\"are you a Party member?\\" \\"No,\\" he replies. \\"I don't need a politician to make me go to war.\\" Talk about heroism! integrity! independence of thought. Stigler didn't need Hitler to tell him to fight on behalf of the Third Reich; he'd do it on his own. Not belonging, you see; that's what cleans a man. Doing his work skillfully; that's what elevates him.<br />Or try this: It's 1942. Millions are being slaughtered everywhere in Eastern Europe by the juggernaut Stigler fights for, hundreds of thousands (soon to be millions) are being rounded up, imprisoned, starved and tortured in concentration camps Stigler conveniently knows as little of as he wishes--he is busy making \\"kills,\\" you see, demonstrating his prowess as a fighter pilot. Never mind that it's American and British pilots and crewmen he's killing; they're only \\"kills\\" after all. And while all this is going on off stage, safely out of our sight and the author's and Stigler's morally fogged minds, we read about the jolly times the Luftwaffe pilots have back at the old air force base between battles: \\"The other pilots laughed. A few whacked Franz on the back with friendly slaps as they departed. With relief, Franz finished his dinner in solitude, but knowing he was no longer alone.\\" Isn't that wonderful? Haven't I seen this before in Johnny Joins the Boy Scouts or Mikey Makes the Team? Are our hearts not warmed, do tears not well up in our eyes when we learn that Franz had been accepted as a friend, a true equal and comrade, by other pilots engaged in this same fiendish enterprise initiated by the Fuhrer, whom, we're delighted to hear, Franz never really quite took a shine to.<br />Somewhere along the way, the author of this book underwent the same insidious process, the same conscience-numbing process the alleged \\"hero\\" of this book experienced as an adolescent during the rise of the Third Reich and as a fighter pilot in its demonic cause: namely the collapse and forfeit of their moral compass and judgment.<br />Though I had never regretted purchasing a book in all the many years of my life, I regret purchasing this one and strongly urge you to keep your distance. Reading other reviews and comments, you will see how many have been taken in by the cheap and undiscriminating sentimentality of this story. It happened first to Makos and his readers at Berkley Caliber Books. It can happen to any of us if we're not wary. If we sell our moral judgment to what sounds, if you don't listen too carefully, like a grand uplifting story.
B00BT0ZDF2|2.0|The movie did not engage my imagination.  The cinematography was uninteresting.  Acting was dull.  Generally i was bored with the movie.  Compare to life if pi, the opposite in each regard.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I cannot phantom the idea of children slaughtering other children just to gain a crown. It is dispicable and brutal. I miss the complete essence of the movie.it was lacking everything except the violent nature that it protrays of youths today - killing for fun. It is the worse I have ever seen, and hate myself for wasting time watching it.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over....it's my dad's favorite so I think of him every time I watch it!!!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is a show that is greatly under appreciated. The writing and actors are excellent, and the plot is original and compelling. That being said, some seasons are better than others. Season eight is definitely one of the better seasons. There are some great new characters and some old favorites return. The storyline is new and exciting, with abundant plot twists. I would absolutely recommend this show. It does have some darker themes though, and is probably not appropriate for viewers under fourteen.
B004P52NP6|5.0|Coverdale and Aldrich are a great duo! I put them right up there with Ozzy & Randy as well as Dio & Vivian Campbell (who Aldrich also played and wrote with). David can still write and sing well and has added some great musicians to present another solid Snake album!!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|One of the funnest games I've played in ages!<br />In 10 minutes it became my favorite game!!!  Full on arcade style, fast paced & love the lasers that come out of nowhere...
B0092EE5HY|4.0|An entertains read that starts out fast and then slows considerably. The thing that keeps you going is Martin's signature character depth and development. Worth the read if you are a George R.R. Martin fan or a fan of intelligent well developed characters.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I have enjoyed this album, beautiful songs with obscure lyrics that i can relate to in some obscure way. Its a good listen all the way through.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|The engaging story line documenting the life of a family reminds me of a simpler time. This show captures your interest and heart.
B004UIOUHC|4.0|Found the embedded browser of my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to be overly sensitive sending me off to a site I was scrolling past or popping up the Google search screen. After reading the reviews I selected the Opera Mobile to try. Am very satisfied with the results. I just use it for basic browsing so I can't say much about bells and whistles that I don't use.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|$o cool I recommend this for anyone interested in dinosaurs<br />AWESOMEST GAME EVER SINCE THE MOVIE JURASSIC PARK<br />STILL AWESOME
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|There's not a bad tune on this album. The production is top notch, as is Steve Morse's guitar playing and Ian Gillan's vocals. I have to admit that I like the current Deep Purple better than any iteration of the band up to this point. Richie Blackmoor's guitar prowess made Deep Purple relevant in the 70's and 80's. But, I think it's safe to say the mantle has been passed to Steve. Ian's vocals are as powerful as ever. The tracks \\"Blood From a Stone\\" and \\"Vincent Price\\" really stand out. This entire CD is bonafide \\"headphone music\\". Do yourself a favor and spend the pittance on this album. You just might be surprised. I know, I was, and pleasantly at that.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Every song is amazing. Seriously, just buy it. The long wait for the album to come out was more than worth it.
0345803485|4.0|again I find author repeating things that happened in #1 & #2,  I already read it ...don't keep repeating...Also no one owns everything you visit or go to...hard to believe...but it is only a book...would have liked to read something more believable,  even thou he has money he can still own a few thing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Is the best game ever need to try it I like the keys because it saves u when it really far and it does upgrades like ever month whoop whoop
0425263908|5.0|good read, could not put the book down.  Only thing is she repeats things to much jut move on to the next
6305176299|5.0|A nail biting crime drama, that keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat wanting more, I've seen this before, but with the cleaning of my closet/bookrack, I came across this video, I couldn't quite remember what it was, but then I read who the actors were and just had to see it again, in my book, I'd give this the ol Siskel and Ebert, \\"TWO THUMBS UP
0345803493|4.0|liked the book , but found myself skimming over some ideas since he owns everything.  but would love him in my dreams
B00000JLWW|5.0|to sum up A review, this movie was excellent I have watched this movie 13 times, and I could watch it again, I really go for these ,movies that depict disaster, that, and the steamy love affair scene, S, A MUST SEE in my book, definitely A \\"two thumbs up\\"
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have read several books by Kathy Reichs, and am a great fan of Tempe Brennan.  I really like the tv program named Bones.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish you could add every thing the Xbox has tu11 which was a bug fix oh well colored wooden planks the end sprinting hunger bar potion enchanting the end was In tu9 I mean it would be epic if you did
0783240236|5.0|MY BEST FRIEND JUST LOVES THIS MOVIE!!!  SHE WILL NOT EVEN OPEN THE PACKAGE BECAUSE SHE IS GOING TO ADD THIS ITEM TO HER &#34;HAUNTED GUEST BEDROOM&#34;.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I had fun reading this first book in her series and have just bought her second.  Looking forward to getting to know all her characters more.
B000068FWC|4.0|PURCHASED FOR A GIFT,SO I REALLY DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS GROUP. MY BROTHER-IN-LAW SAID THAT HE ENJOYED IT AND WANTED IT FOR HIS &#34;OLD-SCHOOL 'COLLECTION.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|I recently saw the  car Eloise sell at the Mecum auto action. So I had to watch it a second time, I enjoyed it just as much a second time around.
B000002KGT|5.0|MY BROTHER-IN-LAW'S SON LOVES THE MUSIC FROM THIS ERA. WE WERE SURPRISED DUE TO HIS HEAVY METAL BACKGROUND. I TRACKED THIS CD AND IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.
B002LANLDK|4.0|Loaded with lots of excitenent. Great stunt driving and computer graphics. Can't wait for the next one. Hope it comes out soon.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|After reading the negative reviews, I decided to read this book that was assigned as required reading for my daughter before she did. I was worried that the content would be too heavy for her. While it covers some serious topics, I didn't find it to be as ghastly as some of the reviewers made it out to be. Of course the concept of euthanasia is a difficult one, especially as it relates to those other than the suffering, but it's a concept alone, and one that I can discuss with my daughter as she reads the book. I found the ending to be a bit abrupt for my tastes, and I was definitely left wanting to know more, but the book was otherwise a quite enjoyable read.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|My wife and I both have copies of both discs in our cars and pretty much listen most of the time.<br />We swap discs occasionally.  Sometimes we wake up at night singing one of the songs in our head.<br />We have old versions, 10th, 25th anniversary editions and the movies both with Liam Neeson/Geoffory Rush and the 2012 version that this the soundtrack for as we can relate to the actors.<br />The movie has a few songs not on the soundtrack, wouldn't fit on two discs, I suspect.
B0086700CM|2.0|Not what I expected. It is too fast for me.  I have tried to play, but I am not fast enough for it.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|Nice job on a topic the author knows well.  Gamers will love it.  Just not for non gaming sci fi readers.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I went into this film already knowing the spoilers so not really surprised.  Disappointed that Khan was used as the villain. As much as I am a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, he will never compare to the scene chewing madman with the massive chest that was Ricardo Montalban. The underwear scene with Carol Marcus was a cheap exploitation with no purpose (except to have geek fanboys include \\"boobs\\" in their write up. The fact that the female members (all 2 of them) were wearing miniskirts is ridiculous. My biggest beef is the ending. No continuity, no closure. One minute Spock is wailing on Khan, the next Kirk is waking up in the hospital and we are shown a sleeping Khan. How did they bring him in? He thought his crew was dead. This in my opinion,  was amissed opportunity for some moving and dramatic acting. Its like JJ said \\"ok, we're out of minutes\\". Totally ruined the movie for me.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Have always loved his music and his work.  This is another example of creativity and genius and a great contribution to the music world.  Bon Jovi is one of the greatest musicians of his time, and this CD is a great addition to his collection.
