B003HKN52U|5.0|This film is one of my all time favorite movies so when my original disc was ruined i immediately had to have this film back immediately! The cost was wonderful on Amazon and the quality was great!
B009WHDE3C|5.0|This movie is tops.  It's especially relevant to &#34;boomers,&#34; even those in the States.  I found the humor wonderful, the setting exotic and the personal stories both moving and hilarious.  For example, &#34;How will you celebrate your anniversary?&#34; says one character to a couple.  The answer comes back from another pensioner, &#34;With a moment of silence, I imagine.&#34;<br /><br />See it and enjoy the pathos and fun of being able to love!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|It starts out a bit easy but becomes challenging after you get a hang of it in the higher levels. I thought it was entertaining to customize my money and would recommend the game to others.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I thought this would just be a show about a women that gets cheated on and doesn't get divorced.... But the legal story lines are great and very entertaining
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|Complete Spoiler Alert<br /><br />Lots of misdirection and slight of hand but the lamest of endings.  Did the writers really think that Morgan Freeman's character would make a good fallguy.  He couldn't be convicted for anything . . . How could they explain that he was doing this to steal the money in the last safe?  Do they think he was going to get away in a vehicle so full of money that he couldn't even get in to drive away?  How about the four magicians?  How do they feel when they get invited to join the eye and find out it's nothing more than a free ride on a carousel and having to hide for the rest of their lives because, afterall they're wanted criminals.  How does Mark Ruffalo's character think he'll skate the rest of his life without being found out as the mastermind?  Afterall, the four magicians or at least some of them will eventually get caught and tell the FBI who the real mastermind is.  Perhaps Ruffalo's character doesn't care as, afterall he got his revenge and satisfaction and doesn't care about anything else.  That would be the only thing about the ending that makes any sense.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|The new American Idol generation should watch this to understand what making music was all about. It's not just fame and getting on TV and being autotuned.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This was a captivating read.  I couldn't put the book down until I knew that this survivor was safe.  The ending where it updates you on his life felt a little rushed, I would love another update as I feel like there is so much more of his life yet to come that will be book worthy!  :)
B000063V8T|5.0|They just don't make shows like this anymore!  A great cast and fine writing make this show a treat to watch!
B00004WG2F|5.0|Recently discovered this film. Was intrigued by the use of the method from the point of view of a storyteller. I found the cultural &#34;lesson&#34; most informative.
B002F6FQGK|3.0|I pretty much only like Dog's day is over. The rest of the songs are kinda blah!!! I should have just bought the single.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|I got this for my soon to be 8 year old grandson, he loves it, said that he would give it 10 stars.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Excellent movie. original story line, beautiful and uplifting music score and awesome cinematography and effects. will buy the DVD and watch again.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|How can you go wrong with Guy Clark? But this one touched me even more, because of the title track.  One of my favorite song writers.
B000FA675C|5.0|Got this at a great deal and enjoyed it very much. Way better than the movie and written well. Definitely worth a read.
B000069KE0|4.0|Chicago's music still stands the test of time. I really enjoy most of the songs, but there are a few that are just average. I believe this is their best work as an album or CD
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ever wish you could do whatever you wanted? Be an actor, hero, in a video game? Than read this. Can't wait for the movie. I think this might be the moat hours I have spent on a book corn10 years.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I LOVED Downton Abby and until it resumes this is an excellent placeholder. It is not as serious and the acting is not as dramatic, but you really connect to the main characters. It is really good!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It is a lot more challenging than any of the other escape games i have palyed.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game  lots of different quest and collections to search and complete<br />FUN addictive and a great way to past time
B004XN3FHA|5.0|After doing a few hours of flashlight research I finally decided on the Fenix TK41.  I was hesitant at first because it has only one bulb (a small one in fact) and uses AA batteries, but after a few days of using it at night here in Alaska I have to say that I am VERY pleased with this purchase.  It is built heavy and solid and doesn't feel awkward carrying it around all night.<br /><br />The light itself is extremely bright - the brightest flashlight I own.  It has several settings to adjust the amount of light and the two buttons keep things simple.  You will not be disappointed in the amount of light the Fenix TK41 puts out.  Yes, of course there are tons of other brighter flashlights but I was not looking for the brightest flashlight in the world.  I was looking for a flashlight that was extremely bright and versatile, and I found it.<br /><br />I live at the end of a 600 ft dirt road and I went outside at about 1am when it was plenty dark (I live in Alaska where the sun still is bright past 9pm) and shined the TK41 down to the end.  The end of the street lit up just fine and I'm sure the light could go much farther.
B0024FA9IM|4.0|If you were a fan of the television show, then I recommend you see this. Otherwise, you may want to skip it. It's played more serious than the television show and the special effects are pretty good. There are also some nice cameos with the original cast. The special features include some interesting interviews with the original cast.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I always use this app.<br />I like how it shows you what the previous value was.<br />Easy buttons.<br />The best part is that it's FREE.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I like it.  It keeps my children and I entertained.  I am curious to see what will happen when I beat everyone.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This thing is, BOSS I mean, I got 255 diamonds in 12 seconds! I feel so pro with this app. I got slime balls and a ink sack! Also, there are stuff u can get that u can't get in reaguar  survival mode. U can also get skins! Just not on this app. Just get BlockLauncher pro! It's better. Also, I got a cool skin. I'm actly a youtuber. So, umm ya. I do minecraft pe vids. This is what I think of this app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a masterpiece that most people don't find because they don't look hard enough. They have their eyes closed, not able to see, just like Isaac. But i- a 12 YEAR OLD GIRL -found this book! I am so glad that someone was so brilliant that they were able to make this AMAZING book! Thank you, John Green for making this wonderful book
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was nice, the first one was better though but still is book that's easy readable and it remains as a nice story
B004KKXMSI|4.0|Having all 3 in 1 collection on Blu-ray is awsome. The picture and sound clarity are so much better than the DVD collection I have.
B00005UWMX|1.0|This DVD will not play in my dvd player. I did not understand the region 2.  Should send it back....
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|This sounds almost reminiscent of an older generation of rock with deep heavy riffs, guitar solos, hard stable rhythms, and just an all around hardcore sound.  It's not like their previous albums and this one is a great breakout from their typical metalcore sound.  Can't stop listening!
B000I9YV3A|4.0|A feel good sci-fi movie. It is also a love story. The music will stay with even after the film.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|The coolest adventure game ever. A feeding frenzy within a maze with lots of bonus objects. Makes me wish I was a shark, eat tons of seafood and grow larger and stronger...just to eat bigger fish!
0061950726|4.0|So, I've read the novel and did really like it.  I also ordered a used (orginal printing) of The Orphan Trains: Placing Out in America, to get a more complete historical perspective, but haven't opened it yet.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it never did work on my Kindle Fire so I got rid of it.  Have it on my computer and works great.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is a quick read-- I read it in less than an hour. But it is jam packed full of inspiration for any creative person. &#34;Steal Like an Artist&#34; is humorous, inspiring, and fun.
B000W4HFY8|5.0|This was a Christmas present to one of our children and know that they thoroughly enjoyed getting it - it was well worth it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game and it's super fun but it's difficult to earn gems to buy other horses I really like this game but it's a difficult game too. So that's why I am giving it four stars.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|this movie is amazing and shows the strength of the human spirit and what people will do to survive and help one another!
B0000DIXDR|4.0|Great. I liked making fun of this movie, everybody says &#34;It's a great movie!&#34;<br />I say &#34;Do you support Pedophilia?&#34;
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Fun for the whole family,,,sounds like a sales pitch but true,,,captivating and sweet,,,and wonderious performance doing with talent and love
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This was a Christmas present and I'm sure that the recipient of the gift truly loves it a lot - great.
B008KHRODG|4.0|This is the first time I have ordered anything from amazon.com. My shipment was received very quickly and was in good condition. No scratches and the disks did not skip or have any issues when watching them.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Little slow at times but still good till the end, kept the interest up - feisty old man. Thanks - G
0679735909|3.0|All pages were intact and present.  The cover was considerably worn, but the book was written in 1995.  Several pages were folded over a the top corners, but the book was basically intact and readable without difficulty.  Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hours of fun, all ages can play this game &amp; it's really addicting. If your patient then you don't have to spend any $, but if your not then by all means buy the extras.
B000RMQH30|5.0|This was a present to one of our children and it was probably something that they had requested for Christmas.
0739456962|5.0|It arrived sofast, its in perfect condition. Nothing wa wrong with it at all. I love this arthur and it was one of the only ones I was missing.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Most enjoyable. Cerebral, suspenseful, and exciting. Prometheus easily exceeded my expectations and was worth every penny. Great high-tech eye candy and the story completely made sense to me (I've heard people complaining that they didn't get it).<br /><br />What with Prometheus' high production value, original story ideas, solid acting and steady pace, I easily suspended my disbelief and enjoyed this not gratuitous new chapter to the Alien franchise.<br /><br />There's plenty of great breakdowns posted here in the reviews, I won't even attempt to go there, suffice to say, I found it to be a damn fine piece of entertainment that I've enjoyed re-watching more than once, and I don't watch flicks a 2nd time very often.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|I really liked this game and thought there was a good spread of difficulties throughout the game.  Definitely recommend this game!
B0064MT1QW|5.0|I have always wanted this film and add it to my world war 2 inventory of films and documentaries. My girlfriend had surprised me with it one day and we watched it. The movie shows Fiennes(Harry potter i.e. he is Lord Voldemor) acting at one of his best. I enjoyed the original screenplay and some techniques I haven't seen before. The quality of the bluray was also good, I will need to watch it again in November which is my World war 2 month.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Totally awesome.  Daniel Craig was absolutely fantastic in this movie.  The girl, whose name escapes me was outstanding in the role.  She was an excellent choice for such a complex personality.  I appreciate the American version of this film because I dislike subtitles.  I believe that the time in reading the subtitles and comprehending the action within the movie, something is lost in translation, especially if it is an action scheme.  I highly recommend, wonderful plot, and a superb ending.  I cannot wait for the American remake of the entire trilogy.
0375869026|5.0|I think this book is important, well-written, easy-going, funny and beautiful all at the same time. As an adult reader I sometimes missed a little depth and severeness to the story but this is a book where older children are the main target group and it is also told through children´s eyes.<br /><br />The story about August is told with several perspectives. Even though most chapters are through August`s eyes we also get to read the points of view of his sister, Via, her former childhood friend Miranda, her boyfriend Justin, and August`s new friends Jack and Summer. I liked most of these chapters, but maybe we didn`t need all of them. Especially the part with Justin seemed a bit redundant. On the other side Via`s chapter definitely brought an important layer to the book and most of the other chapters did too.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game. It really keeps your interest and you'll love playing it for hours and days at a time.... My grandkids like it tooo..... three thumbs up.....
B009NH6JRE|5.0|We watched the first 10 episodes in one sitting (stayed up until 3 am!) !  It captivated us completely.  We couldn't put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 4 yr old grandson wanted to play this on my kindle, because he played it on his Daddy's phone, so of course, i got it for him,  he loved playing this game and he played for a good while (about 30 min) until I suggested &#34;lets go outside&#34;
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|...even if purists have issues with the Silmarillion references. I enjoyed it, and this seemed like a good choice to see if the new 3d thing was worth the hype.<br /><br />Excellent buy. This product arrived in a timely manner, and was exactly as described. I would have no issues with buying from this seller in the future.
B005XUC398|3.0|For a much more detailed and intriguing analysis of the crash, I'd recommend reading Michael Lewis' book, The Big Short.<br /><br />This movie covers the topic adequately, but I was a little disappointed by the superficial treatment of the technical aspects of the crash, and of some overly-preachy moments.<br /><br />The movie failed to give any particular insight into the origins of the crash, and seemed to call on the standard stereotypes for the characters involved. I did appreciate that they didn't choose to portray any of the characters as black and white villains, but I felt that their attempts and humanizing the protagonists sometimes felt clumsy or overdone.<br /><br />Overall - I don't regret watching the movie, but I was left wanting more.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Best new trio since Rush and Cream....these guys are experienced musicians and write great songs that should be momorable in the future.
B00EOO55GW|3.0|Normally i can listen through an entire A7X album from first track to last track without skipping.. this is sadly not that kind of album..
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun game but I wish I didn't have to pay or use coins and that it was longer but it was very fun :)
0307744434|4.0|We discussed this in our Lit Group and had some who disliked it and some who liked the magical qualities.  Most enjoyed it.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil is a genius when it comes to writing modern day fairy tales. The road to the ending is great.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have to admit, I look forward to each new book like a kid at Christmas. Eye of God was no exception. I greatly enjoyed the introduction of the newest member of Sigma, and imagine the passing of the torch may be coming for some characters...we'll see.  But like all sigma stories, it was the science, and history weaved so perfectly with action and story that drew me in and made it impossible to put down. Mr. Rollins has made me last for work quite a few times over the years. Anyone looking for an action packed shoot-em-up and get the bad guy/save the world while romancing the hot smart chick movie in book form should read this series.
B004N868DS|5.0|I wanted a good mouse pad for gaming. So i saw this one and got it and its really awesome. Its bigger than your regular mouse pad but comes with a pad for your wrist to lay on. Great mouse pad for gaming, and i would totally recommend it.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|Entertaining, night maker, great date night movie, it's a must see if you are a Leonardo DiCaprio Fan.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait till Season 4! What a great show!! Acting is superb and the story is delicious!! No one should miss this!
B00B31CVK2|5.0|Frank Zappa has been my favorite artist since the 1960's. This album is special as it is a combination of songs from the beginning, to brand new tunes. Fantastic musicians, great music, and an incredible horn section make this a must for Zappa fanatics to those new to his music. Frank is gone but not forgotten.
B001NHNG64|4.0|As usual, I always like Lee Child's Jack Reacher books and this one was no exception...fun, quick, exciting and as usual you wonder &#34;how is he going to get out of this one?&#34;
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Easy and addictive game for all ages. My son really likes this game and he has his favorite bird and piggy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There's a reason they turned this book into a movie: It's action packed and makes you want to come back for more. I read the whole thing in 2 days! Couldn't keep my hands off it!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was so disappointed with this book.  I've read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns (twice), so I am a big fan of Hosseini, but this book really disappointed me.  The first half was wonderful and the writing was so beautiful, but the last half made it really hard to finish this book.  I couldn't wait for it to be over.  It was almost as if the editor told him to make it longer, just for the sake of having a bigger book. There were too many stories being intertwined, and in the end it just didn't work for me.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|It's a classic - it's NOT your typical Hollywood movie - full of great one-liners! The lead actors are wonderful.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|This CD is exactly what it should be. I wish the songs were a bit longer. They're the same length as in the movie.
B00E193TM2|4.0|Crushing guitars, strong vocals and good flow throughout the entire album.  Love the bass sound through all the songs and also the guest appearances.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|having seen The Phantom of the Opera three times in the theater, I did not know what to expect from the film.  I should not have worried.  This was a tremendous adaptation of this fine musical, and everything about it was first rate.  I highly recommend it!
B008469DGY|5.0|Even better as free app of the day!<br />I would have bought this game even if it wasn't free app of the day great gameplay idea and good time waster while your out eating!
B00BS1VVIU|4.0|This laid back collection of songs is not something with a big bang. There's nothing to dance to, probably not even something to whistle mindlessly and obsessively as you walk down the street. Gentle and immensely appealing, though, it grows on you, subtle being a very good thing at times. It reminded me a bit of a cross between A Fine Frenzy and Allo Darling. I don't think there is a lot of point to a song-by-song detailed review, especially on an album that has a fairly consistent stance and posture. When you're in the right mood, this will hit the spot.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved the throwback western style movie.  It was nice to see a strong African American lead actor as well
B009LQKHIO|5.0|What a great book. Love reading about survivors. Can't wait to read the next Pride Series book.<br />Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.
B00821OW8K|1.0|This show is just painful to watch, amazingly stupid, loves guns way to much, and every character is as dumb as a door knob. I couldn't watch any more, it was physically painful.
B004MPESSY|5.0|This was a good movie.  Her revenge at the end made it worth sitting through the sick and twisted beginning.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|So far this case is just what I wanted.  Works great. Love the leather and that you can charge it while it is secured.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It was pretty good. I liked it and my grandson liked playing it. We got to level 26 and it locked up. I have tried everything to get it to work but it won't load. Everything else on my tablet loads with no problem but no Nemo
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I have just learned  about Altucher, this is the first book of his I've read.  I suspect it is a compilation of a lot of blogs, but that is fine.  I like the personal writing style, and the ideas in the book are useful and also intriguing.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I love being able to reach Facebook with clicking on the icon rather than going through all the steps to get on-line and find Facebook. And to think, Amazon offered this as a free download App!!  Can't beat that for sure!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting and great insight into a world I knew existed but never had 'experienced' it.  Cannot WAIT for Season 4 to start!!
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Being a science fiction fan, I grade these movies very closely. This movie gets a very near the top rating.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I loved it.  I couldn't put it down.  I read it on a long flight to Europe.  It certainly passed the time.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I wanted to read this book from front to back cover in one sitting.  It really keeps your interest the whole way through.  A difficult story to handle, but very real as to what happened in the Deep South  in the 19th century.  But could all this happen on one plantation, or are these stories of what happened on many plantations put into one?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Best book!!! Really really really really really  Good y'all should all read this amazing  book!!!! I think y'all should read it
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Great quality, quick shipping and nonetheless a wonderful movie to watch. Nothing else much to it and I wouldn't have asked for anything more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|a lot of fun. just wish game companies would stop trying to be clever and tricking you in to having to pay just to get anywhere in the game
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I am enjoying this series. It has captured my interest. I have a hard time putting the kindle away while here at work. I have laughed and I have gotten angry with the characters. They are a must read series. If you like Fifty Shades you will absolutely love the Crossfire series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The only bad thing about this season is that I finished it and have to wait months for season 4 to start!
B002FQOI0A|3.0|My daughter said this book was just okay.  She said,  &#34;It was a good summer read but hard to get into.&#34;
B00181JGI2|5.0|Classic flick, more sound bites and references here then any other movie. Can watch it over and over and still laugh my ass off.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is freaking hilarious. I love all of the characters. I can not wait for season three to start!
B009KEN87O|3.0|Its fun in a pinch when u gotta kill a few min. But to play for long-  no weno at all
B008Y6RYDS|2.0|I really liked the idea of a cross country trip but the tripped out hippies just make me ill.  It wasn't exactly my cup of tea.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|UPDATED: 09/26/2013<br /><br />I have updated the rating from 2 stars to 4 stars for their excellent customer service and seemingly working replacement battery.  Immediately after my original post, the customer service contacted me via email, offering a replacement battery with the USPS shipping label attached.  Soon after I dropped off the return package, I received another email informing me that the replacement battery is on its way.<br /><br />I charged my phone several times now with the replacement Astro and I have not experienced the same on-off-reset issue that I had with the original unit and it does what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />I took 1 star off because of the rather short built-in USB cable and a bit of \\"heat\\" issue.  It is convenient that I don't need to carry around a separate USB cable but due to the short length and design, I have to twist the USB cable to connect it to my phone and then stack the phone on top of the Astro, causing \\"double\\" heat while charging: both the phone and the Astro get quite warm \\"together\\" after a while - especially if I use my phone while charging.<br /><br />If the built-in cable was just about 1-2 inches longer, it would have been a 5 star product - it will allow the phone placed separately from Astro while charging and there will be no heating issue.  I could use a longer external USB cable but it would defeat the purpose of having the built-in cable.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I used this charger about 5 times so far to charge my Galaxy S3 phone and it works fine when it works.  I only used the built-in USB cable to charge my phone. However, it suddenly lost the power (stopped charging) about 10-15 minutes after I plugged it to my phone.  It happened twice already.  The Astro battery was fully charged (4 lights) before I connected it to my phone.<br /><br />The first time when it happened, putting the built-in USB cable back into its charging USB port (where you plug back in when the Astro is not inuse) a couple of times somehow reset the Astro and it came back to life. The same power loss happened again today, in the train on the way home, but the resetting trick didn't work this time.  However, it did come back to life when I plugged it to the USB wall charger at home. When I plugged it to the USB wall charger, the 4th light started blinking immediately so the Astro definitely had at least 3/4 of battery power left when it suddenly stopped charging my phone.<br /><br />I don't know if I am not supposed to use the phone while the Astro is connected or I got a bad unit but I am quite disappointed.<br /><br />The unit itself feels solidly built, though. It is about the size of iPhone and very light and, I have to admit that it looks pretty nice.  Wish it didn't play dead....
B008AWBQGW|4.0|i am probable like every skynard person missed ronnie steve artimus allen now billy the album is great but imiss those guys dont mean to leave no one out ed king and others i saw skynard a few days before the plane crash in charleston wva i like the mention of jesus in the album he lives in my heart and i hope he does in skynard to god bless you all.
B00DGR8WSQ|5.0|The play back for this classic TV series has been great whether watching on my Kindle Fire, my computer, or on my TV through my gaming system. It is great being able to find and watch the shows I grew up with and not have to spend hundreds on DVD/Blu Ray that I may or may not watch again.Thanks Amazon!
B000G6R7B8|5.0|My husband just bought me this watch for my birthday- I prefer a man's watch because they are easier to read and tend to be more durable..I have had a couple of Skagens that were nice looking but very cranky, fragile and with short battery life. As a result I had been wearing an old men's quartz Seiko that had some history I'd just as soon leave behind... Anyway, I was convinced by the reviewer who described the relationship you develop with a watch that relies on your movement to keep running. It sounded practical and appealed to my sense of durability. So I am excited to see how this keeps time... I need to watch my time carefully on the job I have.<br /><br />That aside, this is a beautiful machine, well made and clean looking with a  decent weight to it. The clear back so you can view the internal works is an elegant touch and the band appears to be well made. Definitely not a junky throw away quartz.<br /><br />I have now had the watch for about a month and the only time it lost time was when I didn't wear it all weekend. No big deal. I just reset it! I did feel like I had abandoned it though!
B000FA57US|5.0|I enjoy all the movie that he was in the Halloween's ones. this one is for any fan of Donald pleasence.
1442359315|2.0|I thought that the writer spent too much time talking about his illness and his family and not<br />so much time talking about Heaven.  I'm glad his family loves him and I know that he had to describe<br />what put in into his near death experience,  but I really wanted to know more about the after life.<br />Since I will be going there pretty soon.  thanks.
B0068857QA|5.0|Generation Kill is a great starting point when you're ready to start thinking about the Iraq war.  Worth checking out the article/book it was based on.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|To tell you the truth I had never heard of James Rollins. I was in a WalMart in Canada and picked this book up off a sale table and began to thumb through it. It appeared to be a good read so I went back to our RV and ordered it on my Kindle. I could harldy put it down! I thought it was fast paced, well written and the story a believable tale.<br />His work reminded me somewhat of Dan Brown. I realy enjoyed the book and will check into more of the Sigma Force Novels. You should do the same if you like a good mystery and a bit of sci-fi on the side.
B0087ZG7NO|5.0|I enjoyed all of the movie. this one is good with jeff goldblum. this is for any fan of the jurassic park movies.
B00640UICA|5.0|Really fun and challenging game. You need to connect each little character given certain rules.  The boards are colorful and the touch controls are perfect.  You will get a lot of levels, and some can take quite a while to figure out.<br /><br />My only complaint is that all of the characters are on the game board at the start of the puzzle and cannot be removed.  This can make it hard to see what is happening when there are a lot of units on a single board.<br /><br />On a side note, any graph theorists out there will see this as a cute graph construction game.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I saw Red 2 first and found it hilarious... the first one is not bad but not as good as Red 2.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I use this to hone my knives at home as well as to sharpen any that are severely worn down. Keep in mind though, that once you do sharpen a knife it will need to be resharpened some time soon. As the action of sharpening it decreases the hardness of the material. Unless you're knowledgeable in heat treatment, the sharp edge will not last too long.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone who is in search of a cheap quick method to sharpen an old or worn down knife.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I hard about this one getting a lot awards and wining best movie. i am glad to get it and see it.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Love the game! Can't seem to put it down. Was up all night playing!!! Starts of easy , then get tough!
B00275EGWY|5.0|I highly recommend this to all of your customers that love action and suspense!  I have watched it many times and my adult sons have as well.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I received Chromecast dongle approximately 4 weeks after I ordered it. Today it finally arrived (it was ahead of schedule, actually). I plugged it in, and started the setup process, which took only a few minutes to complete, and went reasonably smoothly. However, after using it for less than 30 minutes, I decided to return it. I'll explain the reasons but first, a little background:<br /><br />I watch a lot of online contents on my large screen TV, so I keep my computer connected to the TV using a HDMI cable. Because the TV set has only two HDMI sockets, one is being used for connecting to a blue-ray player, to use the Chromecast dongle, I had to unplug the cable that connects the computer.<br /><br />Here comes problem #1: Chromecast dongle takes a HDMI socket, but it cannot entirely replace the cable because it only &#34;casts&#34; limited set of programs (youtube, google movie, etc.) to TV. Which would be fine IF that were the only thing I watch. But I also want to watch the other stuff. So the only way to it, if I keep the dongle, is to keep switch back and forth between Chromecast dongle and the cable. It would be a big hassle with no apparent advantage.<br /><br />A second problem I had was that when I use Chromecast to watch programs on TV, for some reason the audio signal failed to reach the stereo system connected to the TV. So, in order to watch youtube etc. on TV through Chromecast, I would have to rely on TV speakers, which are not that great.<br /><br />A third (potential) problem, is that Chromecaset relies on home wireless network. It uses a lot of bandwidth, so depending on the speed of your wireless router, it may or may not be a problem. It wasn't a problem for me but I could imagine that it could be an issue on some older home wireless networks. By the way, the dongle gets really hot after about 10 minutes of use.<br /><br />Anyway, it worked but after the initial excitement, it was quite a disappointment.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I have not seen this move in years this one a good one to get if you like this movie.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Intriguing from start to end. I really enjoyed the book. So many different actors and twists; it does not get boring for a second.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I cannot get over the action and stunts in this movie.  If I wear it out, I will buy it again.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I absolutely love the vampire diaries and was really excited to finally own the first season it also has a ton of bonus features that I really enjoyed
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I enjoyed the 1,2,4,5 one that fallow the Michael Myers and how it ends. this one is for any fan of this movie series.
B000077VR3|5.0|We loved Moulin Rouge, It should be ranked right up there with the best-ever movies this is a must-see and love to hear &#34;Spectacular&#34;
B008SOSBJM|5.0|My daughter is a fan and I have bought a lot of things like this for her collection.  Prices and service at Amazon are the best.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|This is a fun and fast paced match 3 or more game. Most people will enjoy it, if they like to match objects.
B000WCDI64|5.0|I grew up with her music and she was great. this one is for any one who like her live stuff.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The 5th season is the best so far.  The story lines are great and the writers can keep you smiling at the end.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and I found it riveting and difficult to put down. I read it so quickly that I plan to read again soon.
0345803485|1.0|This book is not worth wasting my time writing more than that.<br />All I can say when I finished the book (with great difficulty)<br />The level of writing is very low, this book is a scam.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I haven't purchased a CD in a long long time but am very glad I picked this one up. Great blues.
B005O7PXNS|4.0|Story is good and the chemistry between Becket and Castle is improving.  The 5th season is improving on their relationship.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I love the old Star Trek series. It seemed at the time to be so &#34;futuristic&#34;. Special effects were awesome for the technology.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|I must admit, without Rob Arnold, I didn't have high hopes for this album.  The replacement for Arnold, Emil, can definitely shred.  He'll definitely remind you of Arnold. Funky time signatures and that sludgy Chimaira sound is still there!  In all honesty, I'd rate it as Chimaira's 3rd best album after IOR and S/T.  My favorite tracks are Plastic Wonderland, All That's Left Is Blood, No Mercy and Spineless.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book! First one I've read. Can wait to read the next book! The sea of monsters is next.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Can't wait for the next season. Love seeing the ensemble of actors in different roles each season.  Wonder what Coven will be like.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|It may be geared for younger adults, but I loved this movie and c ant wait for the second one to come out on DVD.  It is an excellent addition to anyone's collection.  I've watched it a h Alf dozen times.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was completely engrossed in Gaiman's latest masterpiece. It's a short novel and can be read in just a few sittings. Definitely worth purchasing and reading!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4. I got my husband to watch Downton and he even liked it. We both are ready for next season.
B002NNA9N0|4.0|Being a big fan of all those in the cast I was surprised that I have never watched this movie. Really was an excellent film. Almost like watching a play. Always a pleasure watching real actors act. I found myself entranced with the dialogue.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|One of those films you want to watch over and over again. Even after seeing it 6-7 times and knowing some of the line by heart, I still jump out of my skin during several scenes. Fun to watch with someone who has never seen it before.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Fun series with madcap adventures in every episode.  We thoroughly enjoyed Christopher Eccleston's interpretation of the doctor as well as Billie Piper as his companion, Rose.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I thought well this is one BaIdacci book I wasn't going to finish. I was wrong. Once all the characters and details became entwined it got really interesting and captivating. A good read with a somewhat surprising twist and resolution. I rated it 4 out of 5 stars because of the slow start. If you like intrigue The Innocent should definitely be on your list.
174316498X|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books, and could not wait for this newest story. Although I initially found the book a little difficult to get in to, after 100 pages or so, I was hooked. What an interesting, riveting story. I couldn't put it down. I actually accidentally dropped, and broke, my kindle while reading this book, and promptly went to the library to check out the hard copy!!! I couldn't even wait a few days for a replacement kindle. If you enjoy drama, history, and surprise twists, you'll love this book.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|At times humorous. At times sad. But mostly a very touching true story.  So glad a friend of mine recommended it.  Outstanding film!
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Loved watching when it was on first runs.  Love it more now.  It great to see Richard Dean Anderson again
B003K16P3M|3.0|The story line was great but some of the challenges the main character had to face were not resolved in a way that lines up with my values.
B004SM4IE0|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five certainly looks a lot different to me than it did ten years ago back in UMKC. For one, I thought postmodernist literature was just some yuppie terminology for a new writing trend. I didn't know that it was something I've been doing as an author all along. Granted, I found Billy Pilgrim's rambling narratives as annoying as those of Ray Bradbury's Montag in Fahrenheit 451 (which I'm now reading as well). It just goes to show what happens when you don't take time to stop and smell the roses on the cactus bush.<br /><br />Vonnegut's editors should have warned him that his 'time travel' gimmick with the Tralfamadorians was like running with scissors, and it ended up getting the story shot to spit. If he would have approached the Dresden holocaust with the reverence shown by Dalton Trumbo in Johnny Got His Gun, this could have been one of the greatest anti-war books ever written. Instead, we get these metaphors for hallucinatory flashbacks that, like the flying saucers, sailed right over the heads of most folk. Took me a whole decade to go back and look for this frisbee.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim's Kafkaesque gift for understatement and depressive ennui make this a work of genius just as much as it can easily put off its audience. It's almost impossible to like this guy, but if you can hang in long enough to let Vonnegut show you what (or what doesn't) make him tick, this can turn into a compelling postmodernist read.
B008469DGY|4.0|I really love this app, very intuitive and simplistic controls. I do wish you could  chip and putt, but I've just started playing so it may happen later in other levels.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|This show keeps you wanting to know more and every episode is extremely interesting. The show makes you want to watch more to see how the characters lives are going to pan out. One of my favorite series when it comes to law and order!
B0009A40ES|5.0|I lost the dvd somehow and had to buy this uncut version to replace it...love Christian Bale in this movie...classiC!!!
1878424319|5.0|Easy to read, and follow.  Provides good life examples to being a better person.  I have several friends who have this book, and are trying to adjust their lives to follow its advice.  Good service, and product as advertised.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Need a little inspirational reading? This is a wonderful app that provides just that.<br />The Bible has always been a source of truth and comfort for me and this app not only provides that,<br />but in several versions as well! Choose your favorite and enjoy!!
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|This is an awesome movie with an excellent cast. The movie starts off slow but becomes interesting very fast. This is a must see!
B000ID37LS|5.0|A oldie, but a goodie.<br />If one likes Micheal . J. Fox and his acting they'll enjoy this film.<br />A must see if the first time or after a long time.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|If you liked the T. Selleck remake of this movie, then you'll love the original. This is another one of those movies that was out of print for many years and then became available. I scarfed it up when it went on sale. It is a classic cowboy movie in the same class as Will Penny, and the acting...well, Lee Marvin, what can I say, he's one of the best ever. This is one of those movies that I will probably watch at least once a year as I never get tired of it.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I was most impressed by the first half of the book, thoroughly enjoyable. It may have tapered off slightly towards the end. Captures well his way of speaking and expressing himself.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I have no complaints.  the keys are nice and large and I appreciate how landscape gives more options.  very handy.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Once I figured out how it worked, I was addicted. The simple games are always the best and this is now my go-to when I'm bored or trying to pass the time by.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing I could not put it down.  It was  an easy read and left me wanting more.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I watched this on epix and on youtube.. and just like most of her other tours, it was absolutely brilliant... a must see for any Madonna fan! Can't wait till my blu-ray disc gets shipped to me! :))
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Paramore is the best. Love their new style! :D its totally just them. they did what they wanted & dont care what people think. they care about the music. thats whats up!!!
0525478817|4.0|School required reading which I really enjoyed once I was able to get into it.<br />The ending was surprising and did not think that I could get so involved with the characters that it could actually become emotional.
B00008IHN1|5.0|I bought this for a friend of mine who has three children. Watching the evolution from &#34;I'm by myself&#34; to &#34;We're in this together&#34; is inspiring. And the music's great too!
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Kingdom of Heaven, Gladiator, Master and Commander, The Eagle, Despicable Me, Dude Wheres My Car, How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Bringing back standard set with the album Lullabies to Paralyze.Seen them live twice and can't wait to hear this album live!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It looks up things that i need! I like books. They smell old and funny. I<br />Like books a lot, so u should read more.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Finding yourself through sounds, then beats, then rythmns, then chords, then harmonies and finally through a melody that leads you home. Wonderful and engaging movie.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I upgraded from a SunPak 3000 because it couldn't do what I needed on a bright sunny day on the beach.  This was a big step for me, but I was very please with it from the moment I started testing it.<br />The one disappointment I had during a photo shoot is that it froze 3 times.  I was using it on 1/16 power and it wasn't overheating, but I went to change the settings and got no response.  I simply had to open the battery door and close it back and I was good to go.  After the 2nd time I started to worry.  Could just be mine.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Pretty good for a movie I had never heard of before. Just happened upon it and decided to watch it.
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|This book will appeal to anyone interested in WW2 history and to anyone with a heart! Couldn't put it down.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I F-ing Love this song, I heard it for the 1st time on The VMA'S, and have listened to this song everyday since . But this is just one of many on this one album . Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake, Ceelo & PINK  are the best Musicians out there...
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just received mine and for the equipment I have, it works well!  I currently have a D3100, Nikkor 50mm, Nikkor 24-70mm, Nikkor 18-55, SB-700, 1 transmitter, 2 sensors, softbox, 22&#34; 5-in-1 reflectors, and light stand bracket.  All those items fit comfortably with ample room left over.  The bad thing is when you have space, you want to fill it.  I also threw in the instruction manuals, cables, battery chargers, extra batteries and memory cards.  My vertical battery grip is on the way.<br /><br />There's more than enough room!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Fast read (just over a day to finish) and it kept me wanting more. It was hard in the beginning to understand her behavior but it becomes clearer as the book goes on. My heart just breaks for the sisters, Elizabeth and Catherine.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has been recommended to me by many individuals and there has been a bit of hype.  I did not really know what to expect but once I picked it up it was quite a read. I could not put it down as this Grisham style suspense moved from point of view of the \\"gone girl\\" in Amy and her beau Nick Dunne.<br />This couple came together by fate as the spark that ignited the passion flame and as often the case the flames wane to a flicker.  Then Amy disappears leaving behind some violent clues of her disappearance.  Nick the dotting husband is placed in this swirl of scandal as the media scrutinizes this fairy tale episode.<br />An attention grabbing story that will take you on quite a spin of a story, Gone Girl goes beyond he said/ she said into a heck of an adventure.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've always loved playing bingo. This game gives you a good variety of themes, winnings, and types of bingo plus slots.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Brandon needs a lesson from Thom and discover a new word, other than tempest. Other than that I loved the book
0375851569|5.0|Perfect shower gift as nursery theme is Dr. Seuss.  Mom loved it and was going to keep them at Grandma's.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read reviews before getting and agree with most. I wanted to run and hide so much tragedy and pain your forced to form a picture of. But so well written you can't put it down. Better than the first, on to the next don't let me down Suzanne!!
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|Have you ever recommended a movie to a friend, hoping they'd love it, but their reaction is negative. You feel as if they didn't pay enough attention, or didn't give it a chance, or for some reason were not emotionally connected to it like you were.<br /><br />Music that makes you feel a lot of emotion is art and art is subjective. I get that not everyone will be on the same page. However, most of the potential buyers on this page are NIN fans. You know what to expect. If you're a NIN fan; lock yourself up in a room, put on headphones and play this album all the way through (loud). It's the only way to get past the barrier between liking it and undoubtedly loving it.<br /><br />* I do have to say that there is one exception. If you absolutely write off everything Trent's done since \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and dislike the use of computer-generated sounds in music, then maybe you just like Industrial Metal, which is not what NIN is today.
B008745B32|3.0|Many good books are interesting for a while. Then they fade. Great books seem to ring true for centuries. this is a kind of post upstairs/downstairs piece that characterizes a part of English culture that we don't care that much about.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|We haven't seen these episodes in years and it was fun to watch and laugh at the clothing/styles.  Definitely a classic!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|It was a great movie with great actors! I would watch again. I do recommend it for other people to watch.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Nice little puzzle game. 44 levels, some really easy and some really tricky. Graphics are good and the app doesn't ask for unneeded permissions or have ads (there's a link to the developer's website when you finish the final level.)
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I bought this for my mom at her request since she saw this group at the White House on PBS and wanted their CD.  She loves it!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|it downloaded but don't open I tried everything but it still want work the game needs to be fixed because the is so wrong
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book series by DGS. I can assure you book 1 will draw you in. The mystery. The characters. The plot. A little southern version of murder she wrote meets nancy drew for 2013. Rose isn't your average girl like you think. Her life is pretty extraordinary. In book 1 you get to find out a little about her and her background. In book 2 you become vested, wanting to know more, and the suspense is amazing. DGS is a skillful author; she knows exactly what she is doing. From making a list on a walmart receipt to serving a jury. You will not be disappointed in this series. I can assure you, book 3 will keep you wanting for more when released in Sept. Happy Reading!!
B005QYKD4I|5.0|This is a great movie. It had a little bit of pixelation due to loading but other than that it was fine.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really  fun entertaining im a horse lover so it's great : yeahh but I think little kids would love this game :D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I tried to ignore the hype but when I saw that it was available at the library I figured why not.  This book is very good.  Extremely tantalizing and sexual.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The movie was mediocre at best but what made it worse was that I streamed it over Amazon on WII. The stream quality was garbage. I can stream netflix all day in HD but amazon's app cant even make a clear picture. Lets face it, we didn't watch OZ for the superior plot, we watched it for the visuals. I didn't get the visuals at all. It was like watching an old television with and antenna that had poor reception.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The protagonist returns to his childhood locale; the rest of the book describes paranormal events that take place during his childhood.  It wasn't a &#34;couldn't-put-it-down&#34; tale, but easy to come back to at any time without having to go back to see who was who. Entertaining.
B0040LLLMQ|4.0|Well, it is a finale, so it's bitter-sweet. I can't give too much away, but there are definitely mixed reviews regarding how the series ends. Of course I had to have it, since I have seasons 1-5
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|I found the story to have too many disturbing parts for young children and far different than the beloved movie
0553381687|1.0|Not what i expected when I ordered the book. It shows a different picture then what they had sent me. Also it took up to two weeks just to get the book. Not worth te price, the wait or the time. Don't buy from this company at all.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|grandson loves this movie. Good movie to have in your library. Very good movie. GREAT GREAT GREAT movie . Great
B004YLCKEU|5.0|A-ha is one of the best &#34;undiscovered&#34; (at least by the general population) bands around. Though they have diassempled, they continue to put out great thoughtful music individually. I am so glad I bought this.
B001EBWITA|3.0|Movie had its moments, nothing spectacular.  Not a movie for kids.  It would help if you have some religious history knowledge.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Worked great with Windows 8. I would recommend it to any one worked within seconds<br />Worked well with NCapn  gps  system
0553801473|2.0|Too long and I didn't read many of the chapters. Who is this new person and why do I care about him/her?  This book was a long slog to nowhere with plenty of time for naps along the way.<br /><br />Similar to previous books, the author seems to get bored with an interesting character and all of a sudden - off with their head! Stab them in the gut! Toss them overboard!<br /><br />Save yourself the tedium of reading 959 pages by reading the Wiki synopsis. You're welcome.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I am a Castle fan, so I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Nikki Heat. I would read more if they were available, especially as inexpensive Kindle downloads. However, I had to pay for this one.
034580404X|5.0|Have not finished it - but very impressed. But I do find that I have to write a certain number of words a little off-putting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|we love this app.  Can  not  put  it  down. So many great ideas.  Have to peak every  day to see what is new.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For $35, it is a GREAT device. I will be buying another one for my TV in my room. Requires USB for power.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  Netflix works great! Makes searching and loading movies<br />  Loads from device, not from phone, which makes it not use your battery!<br />  Pandora works great<br />  Google Music works awesome too!<br />  You can add to devices playlist<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Not very many apps support this<br />  Chrome browser doesn't work all that great<br />  Playlist feature still buggy. It sometimes clears out all that you have put in the play.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you are looking for a cheap way to make Netflix, Google Music and Pandora easy to use on your TV, then get it! If you want more out of this device, wait until more applications utilize it.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Characters are pretty well developed and the storyline never bogs down. Fun read I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre
B002X9W50E|2.0|I ADORE David Bowie, but this bored me. Yeah, I said it. I was actually bored by this CD. It's sitting right next to me now, and I feel as though I should give it another chance, but I'm too tired, and I'll end up falling face first onto my keyboard and we don't want that.
B007OXWWX4|4.0|You would recognize his guitar work instantly! Its got slash written all over the music.. Great album!<br /><br />I wish they had sent me that T-Shirt as promised though! They didn't although I signed up for it :(
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|If you like rock music that will get your blood flowing? This in an album for you! Avenged Sevenfold has out done themselves again. Great album
B00E978FGQ|4.0|This movie always keep you guessing what will happen next.  It is one of those movies you want to watch again just to see what you missed the first time.
B000I8G5NA|4.0|Not quite as much fun as the first go 'round, but not a bad flick. Check it out if you've yet to see it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful to look at, engaging characters, engaging story.  The quality of this show is refreshing compared to the usual TV fare.
B007AL48UK|4.0|If you like Mahjong it is a nice change of pace. I tend to like the 24:7 Mahjong games anyway.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing spider and probably play too much so enjoy.<br />l usually play until I have to recharge my battery and sometimes continue while charging
B0036BK6MW|3.0|Thought I'd like this better, but got a little miffed at the &#34;rich white woman with too much time on her hands rescues poor black kid&#34; story line. Saw through it like Swiss cheese.
B0031RS42K|5.0|The story and script retained my interest from start to finish.  Love the way Dan Brown weaves in science facts with his stories.  Excellent structure and flow.
B00969PR18|3.0|Haven't used it much, but from what I have seen, it does the job right.  Similar to on line versions of maps and directions.  I may be updating this when I get to use it more.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|My whole family loves this movie!!  It is funny, and sweet, and even entertained my three year old!!  Fantastic family show!!  Great cast!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|an excellet love story, full of joy, happiness and sometime some sad moments, but is lovely really lovely. A good book for teenagers.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This was a very boring movie. I did not like it at all. I would not recommend watching this movie.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The topic of Nikola Tesla and his accomplishments is fascinating.  I would have, however, enjoyed it a lot more if this book gave some more details about him and his personal life.  Not much is written about his family, friends, or love interests.  All in all, I would say this is an excellent book!
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|I guess there are just too many of these comic book adventure movies for my taste.  Plot has been done many times before.  Acting just so-so from everyone involved.  It was free on Prime or I would never have seen it
B00AECGQF2|5.0|omg I love this game ekkkkkk I love it so much I first played it on my cousines I pod omg
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun and super addictive I have this game on my kindle and my cell phone. I play multiple times per day.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Great characters and storyline! Could get hooked on it for sure. Lots of cool sublines within the story!! Pilot a full length movie which is great to get you into the show and wanting more.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I think this book had really strange symbolic references.<br />I suppose it's because this doctor is so cerebral.<br />But they are hard to imagine and unlike any other<br />I have read.  Perhaps, he put a spin on it to make it sound<br />different and interesting.  I would not suggest it to<br />anyone.

0345530578|4.0|This thriller/murder-mystery starts in a Federal Prison Camp in Frostburg, Maryland where Malcolm Bannister, a former lawyer,  serves a ten year prison term for racketeering, a crime he didn't commit. Initially depressing, the book picks up speed when Malcolm cuts a  deal with the FBI by providing the name of the killer of a federal judge in exchange of his freedom. From that point on, the story line has so much action,  adventure,  twist and turns  that one has a hard time following it.  The book has an unexpected surprise ending and at the end, you find out nothing is what it appeared in the book.<br /><br />The writing style and the thrilling factor are priceless. However the content of the book is another matter. This book is better than ninety nine percent of the books I have read this year, but I would still expect something better from a brilliant author like Grisham. I wish this book were more humorous like \\"The Litigators\\" and the characters would have some redeemable qualities.<br /><br />At the beginning, you feel and care for the main character, Malcolm or his new name Max, who happens to be a good father, husband, son and a law-abiding citizen, a good person all around, and you feel outraged for him  being framed for something he didn't do. You get more and more involved with the main character until it gets to the point of him being like a robot lacking any feelings or caring but having only one goal of being very self-serving and all about money. At the end, you find out  he lies  to everyone throughout the book and has self-serving goals without any consideration for his family members or loved ones. The bottom line is lying to someone dishonest is still lying and stealing from anyone including a criminal is still stealing. I can understand this character's appeal in general because he gets to live the dream a lot of people have: coming into easy money, lots and lots of it without any effort of one's own, living in a tropical climate with no worriesand spending the rest of one's life lying in a hammock drinking oneself into oblivion. I guess a person like this is considered more interesting than someone who would do something redeemable such as working toward changing the criminal system which put him behind bars in spite of the fact he was not guilty.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|This order was fulfilled by Amazon itself, not a third party.  Glad I did this, the first one never made it to my house.  Absolutely wonderful Amazon customer service from Stephanie in resolving the issue and getting a replacement shipped out (overnight, even, which she didn't have to do. Was nice, though).  I bought Season 4 first, since it's in my opinion the best place to start in collecting the series again.  It is so nice to see much more detail and brighter colors than ever before.  I'm very pleased overall with the re-mastering and restorations.  Not bad at all ... I'll buy other seasons as my cash flow permits :-)

B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This outrageously funny satire of the Cold War \\"MAD Doctrine\\" is quickly receding into obscurity by upcoming generations who weren't \\"there\\" at the time, but to those of us who were, it remains a classic counterpoint to the bunker-building alarmists of the day. Who among today's younger generations can imagine routine atomic attack drills with elaborate evacuation plans and grade school children taking cover under their writing desks? But for several decades, the sturm und drang of atomic war with the USSR seemed very real... except for a few who saw it as a persistent form of mass hysteria. This film does a wonderful job of satirizing that hysteria with caricatures of such Cold Warriors as Curtis Lemay (the film's Buck Turgidson), but its relevance for youngsters along with other existential events of those times. Too bad! But we baby boomers will understand, and enjoy.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|In many respects, \\"Another Self Portrait\\" is the most important of the Bootleg series yet released. Whatever the glories of the earlier sets (and there are many), this is first one to actually demand that we reconsider a particularly maligned phase of Dylan's career - here, the \\"Self Portrait\\" era when Dylan was castigated for releasing what many considered to be a shoddy, uninspired work. As \\"Another Self Portrait\\" shows, Dylan was, during 1969-70, searching for some kind of renewed musical identity and turned to traditional folk songs and quieter, more observant compositions than he had previously done.<br /><br />This two-disc set of outtakes and unreleased arrangements is a surfeit of riches: orchestral dubs on \\"Sign in the Window\\" take Dylan's testament to maturity and turns it into something majestic and the violin arrangement on \\"If Not For You\\" is sublime; the stripped-down folk tracks \\"Tattle O'Day,\\" \\"Copper Kettle\\" and, best of all, \\"Pretty Saro\\" have a powerful immediacy to them. At times, the producers' selection choices are quite annoying - why stick on one Basement tape track (\\"Minstrel Boy\\") from 1967? (Better yet: how about \\"Bootleg Series No. 11 - The Complete Basement Tapes?\\" Please?) The two live tracks on Disc 2 are quite annoying - yes, they mimic the sequencing on the original \\"Self Portrait\\" but here, fidelity to the original is not exactly a virtue. And, like many on here, no kudos to Columbia for charging a steep price for the 4-disc set.<br /><br />But there's much here to savor and, as the essay by Greil Marcus included rightly says, each person will find her or his onto way into this cornucopia. What is indisputable is the sheer creative ferment on display. And the best is saved for last: a demo of \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" that ranks right up there with \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" as a long lost treasure deserving of canonization.

B0088W6Y7K|4.0|Final season of this series in the Stargate franchise.  Towards the end it seemed that the stories were familiar (it might be because I watched them back to back) and not much new in the way of adventure. Overall I enjoyed the series and I think the show was wrapped up well considering there was supposed to be a film to tie it all together.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I'll be as generous as I can regarding this rushed effort. Compared to the more evenly and dramatically paced stage musical, I not only found the pacing to be hurried, but was a bit dismayed at how many stanzas were cut from its many iconic songs. I know there is some tradition of that being the case when musicals are transported from stage to screen, but here, it was a bit over done.<br />  Where Director Tom Hooper does receive points is in accurately capturing the griminess and dankness of the squalid areas of 19th century France.<br />  We do feel the grime and misery of the chain gang on a ship where we meet Victor Hugo's fabled protagonist Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman, who successfully captures his character's formidable strength) as he is given his parole after serving 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving nephew. The sentence was increased due to  Valjean's multiple attempts to escape.<br />  I would have chosen Will Theakston the actor who played the character, Marcus Flint in the \\"Harry Potter\\" films (or someone like him) to play the self-righteous police inspector, Javert, since  he more or less fits Hugo's description of that character. But Russell Crowe brings a firmness to the part. His experience in heading his own rock band serves him well here, despite much criticism. His rock tenor voice was suitable enough for the part. Javert hands Valjean his yellow parole pass. Valjean travels to the designated areas, but due to his pass can neither find shelter or work until he encounters the saintly Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson, the musical's original Valjean, whose powerful vocalization initially sold this musical to all of us who have enjoyed it from its earliest years), who covers for Valjean when he steals the Bishop's  precious candle holders and is re-arrested by authorities. The Bishop gives him the holders and the candlesticks with the proviso that he become a better man, telling him he has purchased his soul for God.<br />  Although in violation of his parole, Valjean tears up his yellow parole pass and decides to begin life anew.<br />  Several years later, assuming the name Monsieur Madeline, he becomes the Mayor of Montreuil-Sur-Mer, and brings industry to the region, including a factory. The female workers endure sexual harassment  by the factory foreman(Michael Jibson, whose character, although not featured in Victor Hugo's novel, illustrates the plight of the working women of that time who had no rights, but endured unseemly treatment to be able to pay the bills), whose main target is the young Fantine.<br /> Having viewed this film in a theatre a week before Oscar Night, I felt that there would be no justice in Hollywood if Anne Hathaway did not win the Best Supporting Actress Award for her role as Valjean's ill-fated female counterpart, ousted from her job after being exposed as an unwed mother by malicious co-workers. Valjean was there, when that happened but failed to intervene. While in the past, I had hoped  that whoever directed the film version of this musical would cast someone with the fair-haired-blue-eyed looks with which Hugo ascribed his tragic heroine, since her coloring made her stand out among other French women and was the envy of her co-workers. But I appreciate the lengths to which Hathaway went to play her Oscar-winning role(which had once been played by her mother in a traveling stage production), starving herself to the point of emaciation, and receiving 2012's most-talked-about tonsure to reenact Fantine's sacrifices which pay for her daughter, Cosette's( Isabelle Allen, who would have more closely resembled her character if her naturally chestnut hair were not dyed blonde)lodging with an innkeeper, whom she fails to realize is extorting money from her. Fantine sells her teeth(in the book, her incisors), and finally begins to prostitute herself. Frances Ruffelle, The West End and Broadway's original Eponine, cameos as one of the ladies of the night. The sceneof Fantine with her first client as the drugs she has taken to numb herself to his advances kick in is devastating.One can appreciate the symbolism in the difference in coloring between Fantine and her daughter in a way; a destitute mother embracing darkness so that her child may embrace light.<br /> Valjean still finds Javert in pursuit, as he has broken his parole, and an incident involving a man named Fauchelevant(Stephen Tate), who is rescued from being pinned beneath his cart by someone that the ever-vigilant Javert recognizes a former inmate with formidable strength. A man named Champmathieu(James Simmons) is arrested for Valjean's crime.<br /> In the meantime, Fantine is taunted by an idling dandy who pelts her with snow as she is working the street. Enraged, she attacks him. Javert shows up in time to apprehend her, and she pleads for mercy, as she has a child to support. Javert is unsympathetic, but Vajean, who saw the incident from the beginning, rescues the ailing, emaciated, and frightened young woman, and has her taken to the hospital, vowing to reunite her with her daughter upon learning of her wrongful dismissal from his factory.<br />  Valjean agonizes over the Champmathieu affair, but exonerates the wrongfully charged man. Then he visits the dying Fantine, reassuring her that he will find and raise her daughter. Javert shows up to arrest him and they duel before  Fantine's deathbed and the astonished nuns who had  nursed Fantine .Valjean escapes through a window and plunges into a river.<br /> The next scene is of the Thenardier's(an appropriately cast Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter)inn in the  village of Montfermeil. Amid the squalid splendor of Christmastide(which in the novel was nine months after Fantine's death), we meet the abused and forlorn Cosette, who has been enslaved by her guardians, wishing for a better life. The Thenardiers indulge their own daughter, Eponine( a dark little Natalya Angel Wallace, who bears a stronger resemblance to the Thenardier's other daughter, Azelma, who is excluded from the musical), filch their guests' possessions, raise prices for services unduly, and serve them a gruesome concoction of mystery meat.<br />  A frightened Cosette is sent to refill a bucket at a fountain in  the dark woods when Valjean encounters her and rescues her, informing her and the Thenardiers of her mother's death and that he is to take custody of her. The Thenardiers reluctantly relinquish her. But as Valjean and his little charge travel away, Javert is still in pursuit. Valjean makes a daring escape over a wall with Cosette in tow, and they arrive at a convent where Fauchelevant, the man rescued from his own fallen cart, works as a gardener. He helps Valjean secure a position there,and Cosette will be educated by the nuns. Javert remains determined to reincarcerate Valjean.<br />  By the 1830s, Paris simmers with political unrest. A cholera epidemic will soon claim the last Napoleanic general in the government, Maximillian Lamarque, the government's last champion of the poor. A group of idealistic college students who have formed an organization called Friends of the ABC(ABC being a play on the word \\"abaisess\\" or \\"abased\\"), feel that an uprising is on the horizon.<br />  We see young Gavroche(revealed in the book to be the Thenardier's son, here played very precociously by Daniel Huttlestone), mixing among the various social classes and crudely pushing his way into an upper class carriage in the crowded Parisian streets.<br /> We learn that ABC member, Marius Pontmercy(Eddie Redmayne), is estranged from his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand(Patrick Godfrey), due to differing political ideologies.<br />  In the decade since leaving the Thenardiers, Cosette(Amanda Seyfried) had grown into a beautiful young woman, very devoted to Valjean. Despite an unsettling  encounter by a gang led by the Thenardiers, Valjean and Cosette live quietly in the city. Both Marius, and Eponine( Samantha Barks) spot Cosette, and while Eponine wistfully admires Cosette's change of fortune in contrast to her own dead-end situation in the underworld, Marius is smitten by the young beauty.<br /> While recruiting Eponine to go scout out Cosette's wherabouts, Marius must face a dilemma about love and war.<br /> A pensive Cosette wonders about Marius. Unaware of her attraction to a young man, Valjean acknowledges her lonliness, and that she is changing, but declines discussion of her past.<br /> After leading Marius to Cosette, Eponine laments that Marius could never love her, while watching the infatuated pair draw closer, and wards of her father's attempt to rob Valjean's house with his gang shortly thereafter. Hearing noise outside, Valjean assumes it's Javert, and  decides to flee with a reluctant Cosette.<br /> The song \\"One Day More\\"-highly reminiscent of \\"West Side Story's\\"  reprise of \\"Tonight\\" , provides the segway between the beginning and end of the story, presenting a summation of all the characters' anticipations during the coming uprising.<br />  While performers voices were allowed more subtlety and nuances than they  would have been onstage, where a singer really has to belt out to sell a tune to a live audience, the live-recorded voices had just the right amounts of  emotion, strength, or weakness when necessary.<br /> The film accurately depicts how the student uprising began as Lemarque's funeral cortege proceeded through the streets. The group leader, Enjorlas(Aaron Tveit, who seems a bit lightweight compared to the stage's Michael Maguire) leads the demonstration of solidarity with the poor that results in a volley by the National Guard. A barricade is quickly formed by the rebels and their supporters. Soon, Marius deals with a tragedy there, and sends Gavroche to deliver a message for Cosette.<br />  Valjean intercepts the letter and realizes there is another man in Cosette's life besides himself. He heads towards the barricades to find him, andat one point Jackman does solemn justice to the iconic showstopper, \\"Bring Him Home\\".<br />  After a volley, Marius is wounded and Valjean, after releasing  the captured Javert, whom Garvroche exposed as a police spy, flees through the sewers with the unconscious Marius. The other rebels don't fare so well. While Javert remains adamant in his determination to capture Valjean, Crowe's interpretation of Javert  gives him a brief moment of humanity when he places his medal on the corpse of a fallen street urchin(perhaps a gesture recommended by someone with two young boys of his own). Valjean's refusal to retaliate against his long-time pursuer leaves a scarring impression on the policeman, which literally sends him over the edge.<br /> Peasant women clean up the blood from the cobblestone streets, Marius recovers and mourns his losses, and there will be familial reconciliation, and a joyous union before our story concludes. The Thenardier's comical exit-- a far cry from the fates they meet in the novel- is reminiscent of the exit made by Fagin and the Artful Dodger in the musical, \\"Oliver!\\", which also preceded a dramatic and emotion-laden conclusion.<br />  But we are happy to know that Cosette has been ushered into a better life, justifying her mother's sacrifice, and while the grime of the streets is never far from view, nor the mantle of suffering far from our grasp, the demand for a better world from the spirits of those fallen on the barricades will long stay in our memories.

B000002B1M|5.0|This was the album that introduced me to Nas and hearing his single hit \\"If I ruled the world\\" (featuring Lauryn Hill) is what put me onto him. Til this day this album still gives me chills as it did back in my childhood days! What still makes me scratch my head is how most nas fans say this was when he fell off or \\"sold out\\", how? He made 2 acceptable/good single hits to gain a mainstream fanbase while still delivering street tales with top notch lyricism. If it weren't for his mainstream breakthrough myself along with many others would have went years on not knowing who he is. It's not like he dumbed or watered down his style & content (like a lot of artists today). If you ask me Nas was hungry on this album with nothing on his dinner plate and came with full force. This album is near flawless, with the exception of \\"Nas is coming\\" which I skip everytime. It Was Written, in my opinion is Nas best album while illmatic is still a marvelous classic of its own

It was a wonderful story of a young woman who finally was able to put the scars of her time in foster care behind her with the help of other equally damaged folk.<br />Of course there was plenty of improbability, but it didn't stop the book from being entrancing. The language of flowers gave the characters ways to communicate when life had left them mute.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|JOE has been making for twenty years and he's one of the most constient singers in R&B music. Led by the lead single I'd Rather Have A Love this just may be the best R&B album of year The album opens up with the grown & sexy Something For You, which had me tapping mt feet and ready to hit a happy hour. Easy and Mary Jane both drip of seventies soul, while JOE sets the mood with Sexy and More with his smooth voice. Other highlights on the album include the duet with Fanatsia Love & Sex.

Unimpressed by the lead single the Rick Ross assited Who Do We Think We Are, I had reservations about this one. However Legend has enoungh classic material in his catalog for me to support his music for that reason alone. The album does have a few missteps but the strength in the common sampling Open Your Eyes, the ballads All of Me, Tommorow and Wanna Be Loved more than make up for it.I would have to say though my favorite song on the album would have to be Asylum which ranks as my thrid favorite Legend song behind (Tonight and his cover of Love Won't Let Me Wait). Other highlights include So Gone, Aim High, For The First Time and the interlude What If I Told You. This isn't Legend's best album or the album of the year but with more hits than misses, Legend is an artist that I'll contiune to support.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Consistently fantastic writing and amazing acting make me able to watch these episodes over and over again.  Absolutely brilliant in every way!
B00AG51V8E|5.0|Looking for Henry Cavill. Found Henry Cavill. Love Henry Cavill. This movie has a good plot, but really showcases Henry's ability to convey his portrayal of panic, bewilderment and resolve amid the realization that his family vacation in Spain becomes a quick lesson in courage, kidnapping, deceit, and espionage and the scenario of &#34;what would you do if...your family was kidnapped while on vacation?&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|There were times that I don't need a calculator, but this one for my Kindle, I like showing the numbers to my son so he would recognize the number. Not that he has to use it for his math problems, he's only three.
B004SGWYW4|2.0|This was... not good.  I think that sums up my entire experience with this.  I had high expectations, and as a hard core zombie fan, I was actually more forgiving of this anime than I otherwise would have been.  Not good, but I didn't outright hate it.  I've seen worse, which isn't saying too much I suppose.<br /><br />The English and Japanese VAs were good and the sound effect also good.  I feel that everyone did a good job in that department and the music also helped the mood and atmosphere of the series.<br /><br />The animation was nice.  Very clean as digital cell coloring tends to be, and smooth. However, a few scenes were a little awkward where they seemed to incorporate computer models for the characters - if you've seen Blassreiter you know what I'm talking about.  These were fairly few though, so it wasn't a big deal.<br /><br />The story was... sub par and unoriginal.  As I have stated though, I am a big fan of zombie films in general so I wasn't actually bothered by the weak, generic plot.  If you're looking for something more original however, this is not for you.  It was your typical zombie outbreak, survivors run for cover, ta-da.  There's a lot of inconsistencies in the series, that are glaringly obvious and makes it seem like a chimp typed out some of the plot while smoking a lot of pot.<br /><br />The characters.  Here is where my gripe takes hold and drops this sucker down to two stars while I rage in frustration at how appalling terrible these characters are.  They are flat, two dimensional, irritating, and so boring I had a hard time getting through this.  The only characters that has any sort of depth (not too much either) is the husky kid, Kohta Hirano and to a degree Saeko Busujima (mostly because she seems to be a murderous sociopath).  The main male character, Takashi Komuro, is so excruciatingly boring in every respect he's almost painful to watch.  He has no emotional complexity to him at all, and the main female character, Rei Miyamoto,is even worse.  Oh god, don't even get me started on Saya Takagi.  \\"I'm a mean tough smart girl, but only to cover up the fact I felt my parents didn't love me enough.\\"  Really?  I get that they're teenagers but holy Christ they are all so stereotypical without anything interesting or complex about their personalities.  And then we get to Shizuka Marikawa.  Big breasted blond bimbo who is book-smart, somehow.  Allegedly she is a doctor.  I don't really... I mean... argh.  Please, someone save me from the stereotypes and these horrifying excuses for characters.<br /><br />The fan service was, in my opinion, over the top making the series awkward and hard to get through.  It relentlessly interrupted the action sequences, disrupting the entire flow of the scene.  Let me state, for the record, I do not dislike fan service.  I have nothing against fan service animes.  HOWEVER, in this anime it was pointless and done to death.  Let me recreate some of my viewing experience for you:<br />STABBING, KILLING-*BOOBS!!*-BLOOD, GORE-*PANTY SHOT!!!*-SHOOTING, RUNNING-*JIGGLING BOOBS!!!*-KILLING, MORE BLOOD-*JIGGLING BOOBS AGAIN!!!!-*SURVIVAL, RUNNING, JUMPING-*PANTIES!!!!!!!!*-<br /><br />And I hadn't even been watching a full ten minutes yet.  I am also not super sure what everyone's breasts were made out of but they jiggled far more than a boob should.  They actually bounced and flapped around as the girl's spoke.  I don't know about you but I don't know who's breasts waggle about as they are speaking.<br /><br />So, it was alright.  I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you desperately need a panty shot or breasts to vibrate for no apparent reason every five seconds to be able to get through a show.
1847392148|5.0|My 7 year old son loves Indiana Jones. He can read a bit, but more so has fun looking at all the great pictures, maps, etc. in the book and playing like it's Indy's dad's journal from the movies. He even started his own journal to mimic this one. It will definitely grow with him. We've enjoyed it as well.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching this show on my kindle....hubby & kids watching their own things and I retreat to the bedroom and lose myself in this very well written and superbly acted show!

B000JCSPG0|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and still find it enjoyable.  This is a well done SiFi, great cast and story that started an excellent TV Show.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A story that has affected me deeply and will remain with me forever. Where there is pain, there is life and with life lives hope and love. All of those are this story.
B0072KZ0Z6|4.0|This is a cute show. It's a little predictable at times, and it doesn't necessarily crack me up, but Zooey is very likeable.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I took my daughter's kindle on my flight from NY to Seattle. After perusing her Cosmo subscription and watching Free Willy I scrolled through her ebooks and stumbled upon Seriuolsy I'm Kidding.

And when I get home from my trip I will be planning a garden ; having a pond built in my back yard and I will purpose to be kind honest and helpful to this  around me!

B006LSZECO|3.0|Wanted to like it, but just found the characters annoying and the ending way out there. Not my favorite read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it and couldn't put it down! Amazing story that kept me captivated throughout the entire story. Absolutely love Katniss and her ending.
B00756GRUE|5.0|This Seiko solar watch was an awesome deal for probably the best value around!  This watch was priced much higher at our local stores, and is as accurate & beautiful as described!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best show ever made and well worth the money paid to see all of it without waiting each week and without commercials!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season, like those before, left me wanting for more. The characters are easy to get attached to and the story changes constantly.
0425188809|5.0|I read this a long time ago.  It may have been my first Dean Koontz.  Loved it.  Wish he had written more in this series.  Very addictive.  There were some nights I read until like 3-4am and went OH Crap I have to go to work tomorrow.  Still had trouble putting it down.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I like Karl Urban and think he is working his way into being a really good actor and am glad to see that he's getting leading roles.<br /><br />So about the movie, I can't remember who the director was but why he had Urban play Dredd like a clone of Sylvester Stallone is beyond me. There was always a shadow on the right side of Urban's face which is exactly where Stallone's birth defect is and he played the role like a robot. I guess Stallone was busy and didn't want to do this movie so they decided to take a really good actor like Urban and told him to bring nothing to the role other than an imitation of Stallone. But Urban pulled it off and turned in a good performance - sign of a good actor.<br /><br />The movie is really gory and a little predictable but after all was said and done I did like it. I'll watch it again. The woman who played his partner was good (sorry I'm bad at remembering names) and the entire cast played a tight ensemble group.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Truly one of the best entries in the Bootleg Series. Listening to this after listening to the original Self Portrait is like listening to the complete Basement Tapes (available on, say, The Genuine Basement Tapes or A Tree with Roots, or hopefullly, someday, on their own official Bootleg Series volume) after listening to the released version of that album. In fact, Another Self Portrait and the complete Basement Tapes put together suddenly place the late 60s-early 70s in the running for Dylan's most creative period ever, and makes the so-called &#34;dry period&#34; between John Wesley Harding and Blood on the Tracks seem more like a flood. Who would have thought that?<br /><br />And for alternate history buffs, just listen to the orchestral &#34;Sign on the Window&#34; to hear what it would have sounded like had George Martin produced Dylan rather than the Beatles. I'm pretty sure I don't want to live in that parallel universe, but it's intriguing to be able to put your ear up to it.<br /><br />Oh, and buy the 4-CD version. It's bloody expensive, but buy it anyway.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great alarm clock, Love it, I love that the clock has different displays that  I can set and the different displays makes the clock even better just love it.

1608871452|5.0|This book is a must have for Supernatural fans.  It not only helps you recollect some of the best episodes of the TV show, it really shows how much care and attention to detail is put into the series.  Each episode is almost like a mini movie with as much work, special effects and stunts that go into them, not to mention the great story lines, acting, & classic style.  This book highlights those facets and made me love the show even more than I already do.  It's worth every penny!
B003L77G38|5.0|One of the best series ever on TV really comes to life in this Blu-ray presentation.  Powerful stories, remarkable actors and visually stunning.  And the music score is a big winner too.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|SF classic! I wish someone would adopt it into modern high-budget movie. This book was way ahead of its time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't express how much I am enjoying the You version Holy Bible.  Now, I can read and listen to the holy scriptures everyday.  Many thanks to all.

0062073486|5.0|Its a great book. It came in good conditions. I just keep falling in love with Agatha Christie's work. I recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat!  I highly recommend this book.  The author does a wonderful job keeping the reader guessing throughout the whole story.
B00EY8ARYS|5.0|If you were one of the Marvel fans who like me was crushed by the \\"death\\" of Phil Coulson the arrival of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC beginning September 24th would naturally be an event to look forward to; but this clip promises more than usually delivered in a series for television. The involvement of Joss Whedon, director of last summer's phenomenally successful movie The Avengers gives this series a bigger than the small screen \\"realistic\\" feel that is exciting, and seems very well scripted besides. Its not everyday that a studio acknowledges the fan base of a character to give us the opportunity to continue to enjoy his further exploits but Agent Coulson and an excellent supporting cast are proof that Marvel respects its fans. I for one can hardly wait for the show to air.
1452126577|5.0|I think Grumpy Cat is the cutest, funniest thing to come along since Garfield, and if anyone wants to see another adorable Kittie, look up Lil' Bub on Amazon. He is ADORABLE!!!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I have never read the book although I still plan to. This movie was exceptionally bland and predictable. My expectations were high considering the actresses and actors in the film.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|Informative but brief. I had expected more. Still I did learn a few things. If you need advice on formatting this is it
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|We just got rid of cable and have switched to streaming.  Amazon Prime is just as handy as a shirt on a pocket.  I had looked for this dvd after we saw Monsters U in the theater and could not find it anywhere.  So we did the digital download and it's ready to go anytime the boys want to watch it and on our iPad.  Genius.
B005636EA6|5.0|Well, I bought this because my daughter who is 1 heard it and starting dancing when it was on the radio.  So I bought the single.  She loves it and dances.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really am enjoying this app although i can't seem to get through to the end yet.  The features are really distinct, the music eerie and the puzzle very complicated.  Thank goodness it will give you clues if you get too hung up.  I wish it were longer though.<br />Highly recommend.
B0000VD04M|5.0|An interesting view into the life of ED Wood, the director, who in 1980, was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time. How he got there was explored with bitterness and humor, showing us how &#34;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#34; came about, and the famous people who helped him get there. Johnny Depp became Ed Wood for me.<br /><br />I enjoyed this B&W movie, and had to watch it again.
0811877485|5.0|I don't see where it falls off. I read some bad reviews but have had no problems  of it falling off walls. Stays in place. I set this up for the theme of my classroom and it is simply adorable! Must get!
B008Y6YCB0|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow is nearly perfect as Emma, and the rest of the cast supports her well. Her contrition, when it came, was both greater and more needed than I expected, leading me to recall the novel and agree.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works well.  Not too bothersome with ads.  Gives choices for what type of deal you want.  Price was definitely right.
B0000DZEA1|3.0|Bought all three cds and probably could have went with one.  My wife is a big fan and even she says they all sound the same.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Left me angry at the way the adults manipulated not just Ender but all of the kids in the program.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|We have developed labels and categories for the various movers and shakers operating in and about the Roman province of Judea approximately 2000 years ago.  Reza Aslan feels that Jesus could properly be referred to as a Zealot (Judea for Jews, by violence if necessary, and it will be necessary).  He makes a case, thoughtfully, but not entirely convincingly (for me).  This is no great condemnation because any historical assessment of Jesus must rely upon fragmentary evidence, and evidence associated with very partisan and polemical viewpoints, supporting agendas and positions that began evolving, practically from the morning after the crucifixion.  His is an unusual but not unreasonable view, that can and should encourage both believers and non-believers to further study and consideration of the Man of Nazareth.  More importantly, he brings to life the environment that Jesus lived and taught in, that shaped how he was viewed by different constituencies, who in turn passed (some of) their ideas down to us.  It teaches us humility, that we really know very little after all, which is no bad thing.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|So cute! Good family movie. There is one happy part that makes me cry every time! Tears of joy of course.

B003VIWZNS|1.0|Hard to imagine that Jennifer Lawrence who did a fairly good job in &#34;Hunger Games&#34; &#62; COULD have such Tremendous FLOPS to appear in like &#34;Winter's Bone&#34; &  &#34; The Poker House&#34;..  As an Owner of more then 15,000 Movies, there are some that were a waste of MONEY $$$ &#62; &#34;Winter's Bone&#34; & &#34;The Poker House&#34; are two such Movies, and it's not the MONEY $$$ that I spent that boathers me as much as the fact that I can NEVER  get back the WASTED Time that I spent viewing these two complete FAILURES.
B00CA4S3UI|5.0|I bought this album off of a recommendation and was plesantly surprised. I found myself singing along after the first listen and liked every tracked.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I was happy to find that these headphones sound so good and a comfortable to wear for hours at a time.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The Husband's Secret is an intricate novel of multiple stories and lives that all affect one another in the end. I was impressed by the way the author handled this, although I must admit, in the beginning, for the first few chapters, I was a bit confused about what was happening and where it was leading. There are a lot of secondary characters introduced in the first chapter, and they were a bit hard for me to sort out.<br /><br />Once this novel really got moving for me,(along about chapter three) this became a book that I didn't relish having to put down. I loved the quirky characters and the way the story expands into other areas and then folds back into itself, creating bonds among the various story lines.<br /><br />This is not a book that I would recommend reading whilst you are distracted. This story deserves your full and undivided attention for it to truly be appreciated as it should. This is the type of book that I would take with me on a vacation or for a lazy weekend and read when there are few other commitments.<br /><br />For being such a complex and unique story, it was still a relatively easy read to finish in a short time. As the tale grows, it becomes more an more interesting and captivating, leaving you desperate to know what happens in the end. The ending was not only appropriate, but handled so well that it felt like a real reward once I got there.<br /><br />Overall, this was impressive and a book that I would certainly recommend to others. It will make you laugh, cry and think about things. Keep a box of tissues nearby, don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />This review is based off of a digital review copy from the publisher, in cooperation with Netgalley and shereads.org.
B009WUBERW|3.0|It's good for an action flick.  Doesn't make too much sense.. but there is a lot of &#34;inside&#34; jokes from the 80's action stars.  I like the scenes with Chuck Norris the best.  Completely insane and makes no sense.. but Chuck Norris &#34;facts&#34; are awesome!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I love anything Daft Punk puts out. It's not quite like their usual stuff, but it does have their usual style. You can tell they wanted to have that 60's and 70's disco sound.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Not a huge fan but there are several Daft Punk songs that I like. This is one. Pharrell adds to the level of enjoyment.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app not only has a decent range of sounds to mix and match, the sound loops are pretty good about not having noticeable end breaks that are so often noticeable in other similar apps.  I also found the app useful for creating environment mixes to create atmosphere during table top role playing sessions.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This show may not be for everyone, and certainly may not be for all ages, but it works for me. It has a harsh humor and juvenile wit to it, yet still mellow enough that someone in their 40's can enjoy it. High school memories brought back to life...hysterically.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it every day. Awesome app - used to waste time with documents and this note tool offers so much more with easily referenced notes.
B000VWGYHU|5.0|Arguably eminem's best album. Every track is amazing. I lost my original copy and have been craving these beats so I ordered another copy.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|What a great story. I was most surprised by the twist near the end. The acting suburb. I will definitely buy this movie for my collection.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Great book. Somewhat predictable but always a great story! Sparks does a great job capturing the emotion and love shared between two soles.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|\\"Beyond Bridalveil Falls\\" by Sheryl Seal,<br />this book captured my attention right from the get go, when Oria turns 18 she discovers the world of shape shifters  and other fantasy creatures including a tribe who all fight vs a terrible evil. Oria discovers she too has powers which she learns to use over the book, she comes across as a bit of not want to do this heroine despite powers she still comes across as human with all our downfalls.<br />It was has tribal roots with it's spiritual elements and magic it was all great and a fantastic read really enjoyed it and would recommend this to any fantasy such as i am. I was gifted this book for an honest review and i'm glad i did haven't enjoyed a read this much for a while.<br />A feast for fans of the genre
B00542USJW|3.0|My ten year old really enjoy this, I myself grew up to Looney Toones, so guilty here as well. Get the popcorn and enjoy this All-star fun movie.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|True to its roots but with some new nuances thrown in to keep it fresh.  I really love the casting for our old favorites with the young  superb actors.  I love that they don't stray to far from the established canon but still give it an interesting take for the new direction.
B00DB624GS|5.0|I'm a huge Peter Green era Mac fan. Then Play On is always considered their best record. And Now It Is! Rhino did an excellent job on restoring the bands intended version. Just the addition of the songs taken off the American release make the whole album flow so much better. It's like night and day, to me. All the instrumental jams make sense now that the songs in between are there.<br /><br />The addition of the singles from the era at the end of the album also make total sense as a listening experience. Just put this on and all the way through it flows perfectly. Now it has become the definitive Peter Green era Mac record. It really shows what they were about. It really rocks. I'm so happy they put this out. I love it.
B002YCVX5S|2.0|We won WWII...You don't have to make it better because it was pretty epic as it happened, so this story line is pretty much silly nonsense..Christopher Walz did a fine portrayal as did Diane Kruger...I think he did his part OK (just OK) but this is the worst movie I ever saw Brad Pitt in...It bothers me somewhat that a movie that glorifies breaking the Geneva Hague Convention is somehow very American,,,and a reviewer on the cover wrote, &#34;Riveting and viciously funny&#34;...It was riveting in that you wondered who was going to die next  (pretty much everyone)but I saw very little &#34;funny&#34; in it...This is immediately going in the sell pile as i will not be watching it again.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|Reason why I purchased this movie is because of Alex Jone's review of it. The mentions a secret Elite group and their rituals and what me in high powers do in their own time, it intrigued me to want to see it for myself. I was hook to the seat till the end. if you are into movies that exposes Illuminati stuff, this one needs to be in your collection.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|While henry was walking, you felt as though you were hearing from him as he did so. His walk truly enhanced his lif3. he realized mishaps and regrettedthem. I am sorry it ended the way it did. It makes you want to touch base with people whom you think you will never see agin. This is not for their sake( althouhg they may get something from it also) but for your sake, your piece of mind, and your need to really move on...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Different types of puzzles- something for everyone and just hard enough to be engaging. Hidden object and different types of puzzles provide hours of varied entertainment. It is never boring!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I really liked this movie, but the ending is one of the worst endings in the history of horror.  I think they could have done better with the last 20 minutes of the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the complexities of each character and the interaction that ultimately humanizes each in rigid class and family relationships. The story line is interesting and plot line is not static, but evolves as do the characters with each episode. Amazing the contrasts and similarities in society as each generation faces their own strife, social, political and class issues. That said, the unique characters and fantastic acting along with the period details amaze me every time!
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|Obviously an american movie, they have never make characters fly﻿ smoothly. They always look hanging with a crane...still a lot to learn from old school Asian movies..a LOT to learn. Pretty lame movie also...nothing to envy Ninja Assasing, not to say Crouching Tigger Hidden Dragon.<br /><br />Got to mention the crappy bronx rap music in asian surroundings, which is completely out of place.
B002T66IHC|5.0|My top 5 favorite songs on this album are from the Platinum edition, and 4 are in my top 5 all time Taylor Swift songs.
B000FBJHT4|3.0|A difficult read due to the rambling info.,  but still very interesting.  The author certainly has the credentials and was in the right place at the right time.  I'm shocked that he would release this kind of information and not be in fear for his life since he was bound by the rules of secrecy in the military.  Maybe he was close enough to death not to care anymore.  At any rate, if you can trudge through the fluff, the facts are very interesting.  If this is true,  then there is no question that important information has been withheld from the American citizen and the world.  I tend to believe that the story bares some truth.  Read with an open mind.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's quick, easy to find and fun to play. I really enjoy playing solitaire anytime and I can play it anywhere.
B004LWZW7O|2.0|I would agree with the other reviewers in most respects.  I think this is a fundamentally fine idea.  It's obviously a heavy handed metaphor for the evils of Capitalism:  what won't the rich co-opt next?  Here, it's time.  So it's not bloody and not terribly acted, though it isn't well acted, either.<br /><br />My analysis would lie in large part with the dialogue.  It's lame and stiff.  Now, the director may have made that decision because the society of the era is lame and stiff, but to trot out some old English class stuff, it's \\"mimetic fallacy.\\"  Meaning that, in my weak paraphrase, using the flaws (in this case) to reflect the flaws ...  well, it's not compelling stuff.  I think the film would have been better with stronger dialogue from at least one of the characters.  Being vacuous is not really revealing the vacuous.<br /><br />I also felt that the use of my town was pretty lame and cliched.  Take the River, for instance.  At least there were no giant ants coming out of tunnels.  But it's not technically where we're at with the River these days.  There was just this typical dystopian feel about the whole set design that annoyed me, it was just way too cliched, but that is a personal predilection.  The romantic sub plot is superfluous and not at all earned from anything else.  And, to parrot a prior reviewer, I really didn't much care about the romantic feelings anyway.  I got more honest emotion out of \\"Cowboys and Aliens,\\" and that's pretty faint praise.<br /><br />So I don't think this is a good film.  But it's always easy to criticize from the laptop.  At least the team got the job done, and for that, they deserve respect, if not fanfare.  Sincerity counts.  And craft raises sincerity to art.<br /><br />My thinking.  It would make an interesting re make/re model down the road apiece.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  I almost like the soundtrack versions of the classic ABBA songs better than when ABBA themselves performed them.  Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep singing their hearts out?  I'll take that any day of the week!  Amanda Seyfried has a beautiful voice as well.  This CD is currently on constant repeat in my car!
0061950726|5.0|I didn't want to put it down.  I liked the parallels between both stories. The characters were easy to connect with.
B00881VLCE|4.0|There are great puzzles, but, again, it would be easier to work on the computer rather than the Kindle.  The Kindle is much better for reading books.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story kept me reading, however, it needed more depth to the writing - it was easy to see how this was going to end.  A good summer read though.
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|This album/EP is worth it for the cover of Barracuda that I've been waiting my whole life for. The cover of Break On Through didn't do anything for me, but High Wire, Romeo Delight, and The Mob Rules are excellent! The cover of Barracuda, however, is my favorite on the album.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I would like to say that personally I prefer animated movies.  I really liked this movie as it takes the average character and thrusts them into a role or situation that requires greatness.  It presents the story that dreams can come true and that everyone can learn something from someone else, no matter how ordinary the person or how extraordinary the person may be that you're learning from.  It also presents the theme of teamwork and support.  I like the humor that this movie injects with Jack Black as Po.  It has the emotional ups and downs that any good animated film requires to capture people of all age ranges.  The scenery and graphics are also very well put together and it's easy to be fully captivated by the story.  Overall a great movie for all ages.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I like each character there are relly different each ones but at the same time are connected  never get bored about the hostory. I love it
140006922X|4.0|As an atheist with a passionate interest in the birth of Christianity as a historical phenomenon, Aslan's book was exactly what I was looking for:  a look at the life of Jesus placed solidly in political context.  It is beautifully written and dense.  Best of all, I could trust the author's grasp of history completely, even if his interpretation is rather radical.<br /><br />Aslan's Jesus is essentially a Jew of his time, concerned with the Roman occupation, in spiritual crisis about the direction his faith is taking, and in search of a new political way.  As such, his words and teachings were directly addressed not to humanity as a whole, but solely to those of his faith, the Jews.  In Aslan's view, his message is not universal, but narrowly sectarian.  Indeed, among the Jews themselves, Jesus in this interpretation was a zealot, who preached a radically strict adherence to Jewish law in direct opposition to the corrupt official guardians of the faith.<br /><br />In accordance with Roman practices, the Romans gained control by co-opting the elites of the nations and kingdoms that they occupied.  To do so in Israel, they reached agreement with the religious leaders, who were also a hereditary caste.  This kept tax revenues flowing into Rome, but also allowed them to pursue their faith in the manner chosen by the elite and eventually supported by the exceptionally brutal Herod the Great.  It was against this arrangement that Jesus - and an astonishingly wide range of other prophets of the time - arrayed themselves as revolutionaries preaching various interpretations of the way forward for the Jewish faithful.  In this context, Jesus and many of the others were arrested and executed for sedition against the Roman occupation.<br /><br />What distinguishes Jesus, according to Aslan, is a combination of factors.  First, there was his purported resurrection, which Aslan essentially dismisses as myth.  This fit with the prophesies of the Old Testament.  Second, certain aspects of his teachings, such as the baptism by the wilderness ascetic, John, gained attention by many as a way of life that was realistic and apolitical.  Third, with the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 CE, the alternate (strictly Jewish) interpretations of Jesus' teachings, in particular that of his brother James and his coterie, were wiped out.  Fourth, and most importantly, a series of writers reinterpreted Jesus' legacy for a Greco-Roman audience, essentially transforming a Jewish message into a universal one for export to anyone.  This was the work of Paul and then the writers of the Gospels, who added \\"Christ\\" to his name.  Aslan argues that without these factors, Jesus would not be viewed as any different from the other prophets of the period.  The process is identical to Buddha's transformation of Hinduism for export.<br /><br />I do not mean to advance Aslan's interpretation.  But I do recommend it as a fascinating and highly readable inquiry into one of the most influential lives in human history.ects of his teachings, such as the baptism by the wilderness ascetic, John, gained attention by many as a way of life that was realistic and apolitical.

B003Y5H574|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I'd buy it a million times. I laugh, cry, and fall in love all over again.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great music history and sound track.  I am looking forward to listening to the CD and will watch this one again.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was fresh and new with its twist on a post revolutionary society and how they now keep the peace. I am now reading the books (there's three) and am waiting to see if another movie(s) will follow the first.
B00171EO0I|5.0|The plot was surprisingly good and Gerard Butler was so freaking AMAZING! I have never watched a love story quite like this one...LOVED IT!
B009RX85N0|5.0|Totally love this series...both season 1 and 2 and looking forward to season 3.  Such an interesting approach to fairy tales and the cross of modern world versus fairy tales.  Unique !
B004UFEJXK|5.0|we love the movie! we don't have a blue ray player yet. this combo was perfect for us, especially at that price!
B0033AX26I|4.0|A great blend of Irish and Mexican music telling the story of St Patrick's Brigade in the Mexican army during the Mexican American war
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This show is so much more than a &#34;motorcycle gang&#34;. I thought that too until my DIL told me it was so good I had to watch it. We did but really did not expect much. Well 4 seasons later we are hooked. Each episode has so much action in it and always leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for the new season to start next week.
B0096HL33G|1.0|I only made it about 15 minutes into this movie.  The scenes were all very dark and difficult to see.  The background music was overpowering to the degree that you could not hear the characters speaking.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is a favorite movie or ours.  So realistic.....I almost felt like i knew these characters and the suffering they were all enduring...
B00112GVFO|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining movie, it was somewhat true to the book and with great action scenes. I'd watch it again.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I've read this book more than a few times and it gets better with each read.  Every time I pick this book up I learn something new, I gain a new perspective and see things differently.  Read it.  Read it at least once, but I also recommend that you read it more than once - especially when life gets the best of you and you need a new perspective.  You can read it in a day and you won't want it to end.  I highly recommend this book to ALL.  Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I heard that some people were angry about the ending. So I had steeled myself for worst. But it ended differently than I had expected. That was the most beautiful ending I've ever read. I just couldn't stop crying. So perfect and so beautiful.
B009RX8MQ0|2.0|THE PARTIES AT the Hamptons are wild - especially at the Graysons. Season One gave us the murder at the engagement party; now we have a character dragged off to rehab at her mother's memorial service, the pregnant mother's swan dive at her baby shower, and the groom's arrest for murder at his wedding. My favorite character, the unpredictable Nolan Ross, played by Gabriel Mann, is dragged through serious trouble throughout the season.<br /><br />It's not looking good for him in Season Three either.<br /><br />Seems creator Mike Kelley and producers Mark B. Perry and Marty Bowen decided to opt out of their \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" revenge motif and embrace the night time soap opera format - and it also seems there are plenty of people who love it once you count the rave reviews on Amazon. For me, it's not as good as Season One, where Emily Thorne (Emily Van Camp) donned her black hoodie and put the hammer down on those who had wronged her father and ruined their lives. I miss those photos, where she would cross off the guilty with a big red \\"X\\" after executing a clever payback.<br /><br />Now - surprise! - Emily has a boyfriend, a hunk she met in Master Takeda's school for revenge. There was no mention of this in Season One, but we are dealing with soap opera rules now, like is Amanda's baby Jack's or the result of a one night stand? Two major characters get over-the-top death scenes (where I began to wonder if they would actually die or not. They do.)<br />Cinematography is excellent again, making the most of beautiful Southampton scenery, gorgeous sets and high fashion style. Madeleine Stowe, playing matriarch Victoria Grayson, wears a fantastic Vera Wang gown in the wedding episode; the designer is recognized in the end credits, too. Sound is just fine for this dialogue-driven show; the occasional ambient sound and special effect blends in well.<br /><br />ABC Studios also provides a generous batch of extras for Season Two beginning with three commentaries: executive producers Sunil Nayar and Melissa Loy, and writer/co-executive producer Michael Foley on \\"Illusion\\"; executive producer/writer Mark B. Perry, writer/executive story editor Joe Fazzio and actors Nick Wechsler (Jack) and Margarita Levieva (Amanda)on another, and creator/executive producer/writer Mike Kelley and Emily Van Camp on \\"Truth, Part Two.\\" The one with Kelley and Van Camp hint at spoilers for Season Three, so be on guard.<br /><br />There are three interesting featurettes: \\"Schooled in Revenge,\\" that gives us a peek at Master Takeda's new students in his martial arts school of vengeance; \\"The Sound of Revenge,\\" showing how iZLER composes music for the series; and \\"Haute Hamptons: Dressing Miss Davenport\\" with costume designer Jill M. Ohanneson again demonstrating how she chooses clothing for the characters, focusing on Ashley Madekwe, who plays Ashley Davenport this time. There are deleted scenes on each disc and the bloopers on Disc 5 are funny again, mostly because it's a treat to see the so-serious Stowe and Henry Czerny (Conrad Grayson) crack up<br /><br />Who knows if the series will return to its thriller format? Once sucked into soap opera, it's hard to get out of it. \\"Revenge: Season Three\\" will premiere on Sept. 29 on ABC.<br /><br />-- Kay Reynolds
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I use this to sharpen my pocket knife (my whetstone is too big to get into the fine grooves). It feels a little bit flimsy, but perhaps its just light--in any case, it works quite well, and its much simpler and more convenient than my full sharpening kit (whetstone, oil rag, etc.)
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|With the coming of Nightmare, we saw a group of individuals hurt by the loss of their friend. Rather than pack it in, like many do, they pressed on. What they decided to create and give to us is Hail to the King. This album is a band going back to their inspirations and attempt an album that brings the best of the heavy metal genre. With their signature style, Avenged Sevenfold goes classic but at the same time updates it for today. Much more accessible than their previous entries, Hail to the King is sure to draw more listeners in and create more fans among the younger audiences while at the same time deliver to older listeners some amazing sound!
0307476073|4.0|I haven't gotten into this book very far yet, but my daughter-in-law finished it and recommended it very highly to me.  It really does seem to be quite fascinating!
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book was very informative and made me think twice about what I'm eating.  I have no weight to really lose, but I still reduced the amount of wheat I was eating after reading this book.  I felt really good off of wheat and working my way towards limiting my intake to 1-2 times a week for those situations where it's just too hard or when I want a little treat.  I'm a runner, and at first I thought it would be really hard since I'm used to loading up on carbs before races and long runs, but I found myself not even wanting to eat a bagel or big bowl of pasta.  I have been pretty satisfied eating vegetables, fruits (I haven't limited myself there at all), and protein.  Good read overall.  Some of the information was a bit &#34;unprofessional&#34; in the delivery, but I understood the message.
B004DSX5B6|2.0|First time using the flathead screwdriver it snapped off. I was tightening up a clam around a water hose, and it wasn't even tight yet and it just snapped off. I'll be looking for a replacement.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The Tudors is a fabulous series about the reign of Henry VIII. The series was as informative as it was intriguing. I highly recommend watching the series & falling in love with this period in history.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The acting is very good and the plot while slow does develop into an engaging and thought provoking climax. There are issues with Mike being annoyingly moral (at a law firm). Overall, it is an enjoyable show that you can watch at night and identify with your favorite characters. Enjoy!
B00821P036|2.0|Great show until 6th or 7th episode.  Why does every post-apocalyptic show have to suck so bad?  I mean, you're in a survival situation and the good guys won't ever kill the bad guys.  Everybody wants to talk before they shoot someone or let the bad guys go.  Main character is giving himself up as a hostage instead of fighting?  WTF?  Can't anybody write a believable plot anymore?  I mean, you're running from aliens, world as you know it doesn't exist anymore, but the main character doesn't want to take on 6 bad guys with another shooter, a sniper rifle and an AK-47 from.... I dunno maybe 100 yards.  God, why can't the good guys in any movie now days, grow a pair of balls and kill someone that needs to be killed?  I mean seriously.  The kid at the door could have shot 3-4 guys when they're standing out front of the door about to take them hostage again.  But guess what, he needs to say something before he sprays blindly at the bad guys.  I'm so angry, thought this show had some potential.  waste of time.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book will keep you awake at night trying to finish as many chapters as possible to find out what happens next--it did for me. As many turns as a steep mountain road, the story unfolds in a fascinating reveal of character and love gone terribly wrong. Gone wrong. Gone girl.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|This production is not as good as the 2012 edition. But if you want to see how the characters in the more recent production developed check it out, but be warned.
B00065MDRW|2.0|Other than the titled song, can't figure out the nostalgia and why I ever liked this album. Great cover art though!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow...this was by far my favorite of the three books. The depth of the character development is superb. I felt totally invested in every character and the losses that they suffered. I couldn't put this book down and I can't wait to read the series again.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this is one of the best games I own for my kindle. so much fun, great time killer, updates that keep things fun. only problem is kindle gets things after everyone else:( but its ok, amazing game and its worth the wait. co op mode, I'm ready for you.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fun app on kindle fire but lots of ads started appearing after level 11 which stop gameplay and cause my screen to go black while they load.

B008469DGY|3.0|The golf game works as you might expect - swipe the screen to launch the ball and try to get it in the hole However, most people want to play a round of golf (18 holes, or even just half) and then get a score. This is more of a practice round. You try to get a hole in one.<br /><br />The game is responsive and the graphics look great on the Kindle Fire HD, but I didn't care for it because it really isn't a game of golf.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An amazing story of all the months of training, planning, replanning & more training to take down the monster of our times!<br />At the end of all that planning, other than the helicopter going down inside the compound,  it went down like clockwork, in just minutes!  God Bless these guys!
B000005Z0G|5.0|I've been wanting this record for a while now so I can add this album to my 2pac collection. Te whole albums is nice. The way the beats play, the sample music 2pac added with different artists. The way 2pac says on this record. I recommend to buy this album! You'll enjoy it!

B00AECGQF2|4.0|I got this as the FAOTD and love it!  It's an adorable game. My 4 year old loves to pretend to cut hair so this app is perfect for her. I'd recommend it=) You can cut, style, has a bunch of hair dye selections, you can blow dry, wash, straighten, curl, you name it! Only reason why I gave it four stars is because they only offer 6 different people to choose from and only 2 are female=( other than that it's a nice game for all ages=)
B001FSDOZO|5.0|My son & I used to fight over this till he got a copy on itunes. WE LOVE IT! He's seen them in concert
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I am not a big fan of Matthew McConaughey, but that did not stand in the way of me enjoying this film. Ultimately, the storyline was not what I thought it was going to be - not quite sure what I thought. However, it was good and it was different. The acting was on par, and it was nice to see a film that did not retell the same story. Although it would not rank amongst my top or favorites, I think anyone who rents this will not feel as though they wasted money or walk (or get up from the couch) being disappointed as I do more times than I would like to remember.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I just can't stop watching!!!!  Episode after episode after episode!  Can't wait to start the next season. No other series compares

B0042QB2Q4|5.0|Science will never be able to explain it but I love this movie. Mediocre acting and cheesy story lines but still... I really do love this movie. Def recommend for a lazy Sunday on the couch.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I always liked the Beatles, as does most of the world.  I bought a couple albums took a listen and enjoyed them, but the remastering was poor...  they were old.  So I sold them and decided to snag this.<br /><br />There are SO many Beatles hits.  The remastering is perfect.  A ton of great tunes and some I'd never heard before makes for well spent money.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book started slow to slow I was ready to put it down, but I continued because of the first two book that only took me a week to read.  This one took three weeks I hope the next one is no a slow read.

B008469DGY|5.0|At the very first moment when I tried to start playing this little game I was confused. It seems to me too different from the similar games I played before. How to kick the ball and to move it on the fly at the same time. Problemwas that the camera shows my direction while kicking, and the target views of the flaying.<br />It was something new for me, different and funny. Very soon , after a few minutes I was thinking that it is too easy, and I went to the championship. Ha!<br />It was not easy at all and at the very first game I was very last. Everybody was better!!!<br />Second game I played after a while ( one, or two hours) then I backed and won!!! OMG I was happy like a little, just little child, proud too.<br />Game is realty great enjoy and I recommend it as a must have one.
0525952926|5.0|This takes up just where the previous part of the trilogy ended.  I love the characters, and the historical events of the time are great reminders of what our world faced during the 1940s.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Of Uno, Dos and Tre, this is my favorite. Something about the feel of the album...I relate to a lot of the songs on it, and play it a lot. Almost every bus ride across town I have to take weekly. X-Kid has become I think my favorite Green Day song, and gets played on repeat a lot. Walk Away is another favorite. Green Day at their best.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good action movie. Tom Cruise was good in this syfy thriller. The concept was one that has been used many times but this one has a different spin on a familiar theme.

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Exactly as described. I can't see movies in theaters, so I waited patiently for this DVD. I bought a BluRay player, and was all set. I've watched BluRay DVDs but this was my very first one! I am a huge LOTR geek, and I think even if a person were not, they would enjoy this movie. Lots of action adn humor, great music by the incomparable Howard Shore, lovely visually. Just a fantastic movie! I was not sorry I had to wait to see it! Looks beautiful both on my small computer monitor and our slightly bigger living room television!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great movie can't wait for the next one will be waiting. Loved the concept of the games which decide the areas winner.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|Very imaginative and fun.  Scalzi throws reality a curve when we follow the lives of some secondary characters in a Star Trek-like universe.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I went into this show expecting a standard police procedural that just happened to have David Tennant in it. Boy, was I taken by surprise.<br /><br />Focusing around the murder of an 11-year-old boy in a quiet sea-side town, Broadchurch follows not only the investigation into the boy's death, but the fallout to the entire community. A media circus ensues, and mob-mentality leads to further revelations and consequences.<br /><br />The show starts slow, reminiscent of the heavy focus on the anguish over Laura Palmer's murder in the first episode of &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;, but as the investigation continues, the time spent with all of these characters really pays off and allows us to be invested in their stories. By the time the season ends, it's hard not to feel something for everyone involved, which is lost in a lot of procedurals thanks to the standard 1-case-1-episode format that has characters coming and going all of the time. Here, we're living with these people for all 8 episodes. We know them. And we suspect everyone.<br /><br />David Tennant is great here, although written somewhat cliche as the gruff detective with a guilty secret seeking redemption. He gives his character some great (and much needed) humor as his out-of-touch-overtly-serious character is at odds with everyone, even/especially our other protagonist, Olivia Coleman's DS Miller. He really is an amazing actor, and he elevates what would have probably been an abrasive and annoying archetype otherwise.<br /><br />Coleman is the real star of this show. Her character is the emotional backbone of the series, as we see her initially naive and trusting nature (a product of the &#34;perfect sleepy town&#34; mentality) continually challenged by the revelations of the investigation. She's a detective who's never had to deal with investigating a murder, let alone the son of a dear friend. She knows the killer will be someone she knows, and that fear is gut-wrenching.<br /><br />No spoilers, but the story issurprising. Thankfully the plot doesn't revolve around a huge twist, but suffice to say it isn't predictable in the slightest.<br /><br />I'll stop there. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a more dramatic and emotional investigative drama than the average show. I'll just warn that it's very heavy, despite the occasional funny bickering between Tennant and Coleman, and is not for anyone looking for a &#34;fun&#34; show.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. It is basically the bible when it comes to getting started and making an impact in the dog-eat-dog world of self-publishing. Very clearly detailed and rendered, and every piece of information is a stroke of genius.<br /><br />Not only does the writer give sage advice, he also warns of the many pitfalls associated with self-publishing.<br /><br />Brilliant book.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love this game except for the ads, which sometimes causes the game to hang.  But easy to recover.  Well worth the price (free).
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I didn't start watching BB until Season 3  so thought I'd do some back fill binging to &#34;catch up&#34;.  Glad I  did. Season 1 is as good as 3, 4 and 5 (to date). No commercials is nice as well. Wish it had been about $5 less but at $12 for 7 episodes it worked out to be about $1.75 per hour for first class entertainment. Not a bad deal.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|My husband and I were glued to the screen watching this show!  We love Sherlock Holmes starting with the fabulous<br />Jeramy Brett in the production put out by PBS many years ago to this original modern adaptation.  Johnny Lee Miller<br />is a riveting force as Sherlock and the interesting new plots keep you in suspense.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good game. Realest horse game I've seen. Some times the horses move awkward but it is after all a video game app
B0071MDA2U|5.0|So the more I read dystopian fiction, the more I find myself having to divide my reviews into two major sections. Whether or not I buy the society, and whether or not I liked the story. Most of the time those two line up, but with Delirium they didn't.<br /><br />I didn't buy the society of Delirium. Oh I can buy a society choosing to lobotomize itself in order to cut down on destructive emotions, after all, Uglies features a society that intentionally gives itself brain damage in order to be compliant. The difference with Uglies though is the trade off, the near perfect society, made me wonder if it would be worth the cost.<br /><br />To me, that's what a good dystopian novel does. It behaves like a Utopian society in every way until you realize the price. The hidden horror lurking just beneath the surface, and your dystopian protagonist has to decide, is it worth it? Do I become complicit in these horrible happenings to reap the reward of comfort, society, and equality? Is THIS what it takes to have it all?<br /><br />Now obviously, many famous dystopian novels don't go the Utopian route. 1984, Anthem, Brave New World, not a single one of those societies featured a place I'd want to live. And more and more, YA dystopian stories are modeling themselves after those stories. The Hunger Games, Matched, Divergent. Class struggles and poverty still exist. It makes me a little sad to see this theme becoming predominant in YA.We paid the awful price, and what to we have to show for it? Nothing. No one from the outside looking in would think they've landed in Utopia. Everything is so bad we don't even bother with the illusion of prosperity. The trend of dystopian novels in YA already reflected an uncertainty about our future, the shift to bleak dystopias indicate sheer hopelessness.<br /><br />Another thing that a dystopian novels has to do, to me, is make me buy into the dystopia. There has to be logic, no matter how twisted. I can see love becoming a horror story, but the actual procedure doesn't behave in consistent way. If you lobotomize the brain, it's not just love you get rid of. It's personality, hate, fear. You become a zombie. And the adults sometimes acted like that. Sometimes they were aggressive, and judgmental, and violent. Now no procedure on the brain is going to impact everyone the exact same way, so I was willing to accept the sheer number of people in the society that seemed to enjoy being violent. But not within the same person. So one of two things was happening in this society. Either the author wasn't consistent with the procedure (no one should have felt extremes, thus you shouldn't have enraged child abusers and over aggressive soldiers) Or the author didn't do a good enough job explaining that it is not in fact a lobotomy the characters are getting, just a diminished capacity for love. In which case, her descriptions were inconsistent, and the cure would not have &#34;cured&#34; an urge to exercise, a sexual preference on a base level, the urge to reproduce, ect. The people in this society stilled cared what others thought of them, still exhibited pride and judgement, they still got angry. It just wasn't consistent so I could not buy the society.<br /><br />That being said though, I still liked the books. The story was good, even if the society wasn't. The writing was beautiful! Poetic! Flowing. Honestly, it was fantastic writing. The descriptions!!! The nursery rhymes, the book of Shhh. While not believable to me, the world building that went into this was still amazing. I didn't really like any of the characters that much but I didn't like them because I wouldn't like them in person, if that makes sense? They were 3 dimensional, well developed, whole characters. I just happen to dislike most of their personalties. I never really bought into the romance, but for a book series about love, I have to applaud that Oliver never actually made the story ALL about love. The world, the characters, and everything EXIST. The love story doesn't drive the plot of the series, it could stand without it, the world didn't stop and revolve around the two characters. Yay for having an identity Lena outside of lovestruck teen! Good for you :) I did love the friendships formed in this series, and I love that those friendships didn't revolve around the romance either. The girls talked to each other about things OTHER than boys. As in they had a life. Identities outside of their crush's. I'm super impressed by that, and very happy to see it in a book that could have SO easily slipped way too far in the other direction without being called on it, because of the whole love is literally forbidden angle of this story. Like, in this context, and this context alone, disappearing into the romance would have been an act of rebellion and the romance could have actually been its own character and everything could have been all codependent and reliant on the love story, and for book 1, I was a bit worried it would do that but it didn't!<br /><br />I did feel that the ending of the series was rushed. I like that everything wasn't neatly tied up with a bow, but despite not resolving much, the ending just felt gleaned over. And Oliver can DO endings. I read &#34;Before I Fall.&#34; Endings, are her fricken forte. I wouldn't be surprised to learn there's one more book for this series. There's enough there for one.
B000AMUU94|4.0|Great sound great songs but the first showcases songs from ziggy statists as if it were his only great album in this period.  While I love that album, there are several albums such as &#34;Heroes&#34; &#34;Low&#34; and<br />,&#34;The Man who sold the world&#34; which get less shorted as a result.<br /><br />It's not really a greatest hits package, has some rarities and you couldn't classify it as &#34;The Essential Bowie&#34;<br />;
B000VSYDRM|4.0|Reminiscent of Fellini's Satyricon. It is imperative that the film be watched from the beginning, or none of it makes any sense. The subject matter is very dark, so don;t expect any giggles while watching.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it is fun but addictive. A friend has been playing for two years and kept talking about it...I finally tried it and he was right. It's a lot of fun. There are a few glitches here and there as with any game online but nothing major.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The characters in this book stayed on my mind for a long time.  Trying to picture what this family went through was so heartbreaking.  William Landay is a great writer.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|A fascinating book, enjoyable, clear, engaging and enlighting. You'll enjoy every page, and start looking differently at things and, especially, at the people that surround you.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|There's a lot of twists and turns and a few things don't get answered, but overall a great movie for everyone, well maybe not the kiddos...
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is awesome. The gun actions are very accurate. Can sit down for hours and play this great game.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|NOW I need to see the movie. Yes, I think I am the only person around who hasn't seen the movie, The Silver Linings Playbook!<br />Well, I read the book and now I do want to see the movie. Of couse I already love the actors in it, so... I do always think the books are better... but sometimes stories can have a bigger impact on the big screen too.<br />Glad it was a good read!
B003G4W49C|3.0|This book had an interesting message but it was quite dry and somewhat boring buti still recommend it it makes you think
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I absolutely love the two actors chosen to portray Holmes and Watson. They are perfect. Lucy is top notch and Jonny Miller is captivating! I can not wait until the next season! They have a fan for life!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The writers have certainly woven a wonderful tale of mystery, intrigue, and some pure evil thrown in.  Wonderful acting takes place in a historic setting.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I grew up watching Doctor Who since the Tom Baker days during the early 80's.  Chris Eccleston is one of my favorite doctor's.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I enjoyed this show. It had just enough drama between the husband and wife to keep you wondering and a new legal situation in each show. I couldn't wait to watch the next show and watched a show almost every day!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It was in good condition. I absolutely love this film. I cannot wait for the KA2 to come out on DVD!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Such a great book. Well written and great ending. Never saw the end coming. I read it in 1 day
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I don't want to give anything away, but I found this (second) book very frustrating where the drama was concerned. For example - at the end, it builds up to something, then defies all odds and the thing doesn't happen - FOR NO REASON. No reason it didn't happen and then the story just moves on like it never not-happened. It should have happened. That's all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so freaking addicting i love everything about this game LOVE IT BEST GAME EVER YES! I am so happy my friend taught me how to play and told me about it too.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|Books 1 and 2 is captivating. Strange to see how the TV series moved away from the book, especially the Red Wedding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun experience and I love the jumping and I love the price of their game and like that that you can customize or change it and I love it.
B004XISI4A|3.0|Good to see what happened to some of the other caracters. Can't wait to see who will finally sit on the Iron throne.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I have tried serval Kakuro games and I've found this one to be the best. It is very well organized the layout clear and there is plenty of room for my fingers. 0
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|As a rule, I hesitate to watch any film that features Tom Cruise as the lead character, not only for his personal life headlines, but because of his poor acting skills, in my opinion. But being a lover of sci fi, I reluctantly decided to give Oblivion a try, and found myself extremely entertained.  The suspense is sustained throughout the entire movie, and needless to say, the special effects are absolutely riveting.  Tom Cruise continues to score wonderfully entertaining movies that excel despite his presence.  Definitely worth viewing.
1250012570|5.0|Here is what I love, an author who take a seemingly tired topic (teenage romance) and infuse it with such brightness, reality and love.  I would recommend this fabulous read to anyone who grew up in the 80's.90's.  It was nostaglic without being trite or sappy.  Absolutely wonderful.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched the whole season in one weekend...and I never do things like that!! Addicted to the whole series and am anxiously awaiting season 4!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Excellent performances - great story. Everyone should see this movie!  One of Tim Robbin's and Morgan Freeman's best performances ever.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Well balanced between easy and challenging. Very fun. Some are really difficult. Nine out of ten would recommend. Get it. It's not bad for a free game.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|This remake is way too gory in an almost laughable way. Especially the chainsaw scene........I would not waste my time on it and suggest you do the same.
1401307787|3.0|I buy the books for a study group.  We discuss various points the author makes.  The choice of book is a group effort and we have<br />three more to buy, study discuss.  As long as I keep purchasing from Amazon, I am satisfied.  No more surveys, please.
B000IZXR20|4.0|This movie is way out there and existed before cell phones but it's darn good entertainment. I recommend making snarky comments a la Mystery Science Theater 3000 style.

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Really perfect love story between two confused teens in high school.  It's a quick read and makes you remember what it felt like to first fall in love.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Johnny Depp is in this movie, need I say more? Nope, I think that says all that needs to be said for you to know it's a must see movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has been so much fun! It is good for all ages. My 3 year old nephew enjoys it as much as I do!
B009K916ZK|4.0|I've gone through 3+ cheapo adapters from amazon that seemed like exactly the same thing, but they always stop working after 1-10 months.  I decided to bite the bullet and get the real deal hoping it will last much longer.  Its not just the price (at ~7$, I could get 5 of the cheap ones and if they last a year each that'd be great, but sometimes they dont), its the inconvenience of being unable to plug my macbook into my tv for use as a monitor when I have homework due that made me finally pony up the big $.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I was not that impressed by this movie.  Matthew McConaughey was pretty good, just didn't care for the movie though.
068485743X|5.0|The First Five Pages is an excellent book for someone who is just diving into fiction writing. The book is short and easy to absorb without being overwhelming. I read it a few novels into writing and found it helpful in reinforcing things I'd already learned. Very well done.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I was mesmerized and enchanted when I read \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale\\" by William O'Brien, and when I saw that this poetry collection came out, I couldn't wait to read it. Once again, I wanted to be transported to the magical worlds that Peter explored in the novel. And this collection felt even more magical than the novel itself, perhaps because poetry tends to rely on sounds, rhymes, and hints more so than prose.<br /><br />I loved all the poems in this book, but here are some lines that I especially liked and my reasons:<br /><br />From \\"Drawers and Doors\\"<br /><br />Chase the light, chosen one<br />Do you hear the ticking of the clock?<br />Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock<br /><br />I love these lines because they remind me of the inevitable  passage of time, of the fleeting moment that is our life, and of the need to \\"chase the light\\" or seize the day, have adventures and try to accomplish dreams while the clock of our life is still ticking.<br /><br />From \\"Wandering Twondle\\"<br /><br />Mr Twindle Twondle climbed<br />Mr Twindle Twondle crawled<br />Up high through the tower<br />Curly tail and all<br /><br />To me, this poem feels lighter, more playful, reminiscent of old-fashioned nursery rhymes and clever poems of Lewis Carroll. It's a fun one to read aloud.<br /><br />From \\"Frozen Magic\\"<br /><br />Hidden from all, some will seek<br />Frozen gifts not for the meek<br />Brave of heart soon shall find<br />Tiny glaciers worlds do bind<br /><br />This poem and these lines feel very cinematic to me.  Combine these lines with the image of \\"sacred fire\\" from an earlier line, and you have a world of contradictions, of duality of fire and ice, a force that can either create or destroy. I love the reminder to us to be \\"brave of heart,\\" a quality that will help in any quest.<br /><br />From \\"Kiylore\\"<br /><br />Crashing glass, growing ivy crawls<br />Snowdrops push splitting claws<br />Breath of fire engulfs fierce and true<br />Returns a life that you once knew<br /><br />Beautiful imagery here as well.

B007FKI9G0|5.0|A true classic mockumentory. Songs  written and performed by Michael McKeon, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer .British accents spot on . awkward moments intact. Guest went on to raise mockumentories to the gold standard for the genre.

B00DL47RQ2|4.0|Woody Allen has been excellent in cinematically portraying (and poking fun at) various aspects of growing up absurd in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan, growing up as Jewish kid with a very subtle sense of the outsider coming inside as things changed in the post- World War II American sociological landscape. Changed in the red scare cold war night of the 1950s which charged everyone from Jewish kids in Brooklyn (and those other city locales) to Irish-Catholic kids from Hullsville on the Massachusetts shoreline to turn in vanilla Americans. Check. Woody Allen has been excellent in cinematically portraying the East Coast-West Coast culturati warfare (now decidedly won by the Left Coast). Check. Woody Allen has been excellent in transferring his comedic writing and directing skills to Europe over the past few films. Check. Which leads us to the few under review, Blue Jasmine,  his updated echo of Tennessee Williams' dramatic look (Street Car Named Desire, The Rose Tattoo, with a touch of Suddenly, Last Summer)  at how the mighty (or one mighty) has followed in the post-2008 world of high stakes high finance.  In short a look at class in contemporary America, a small snapshot of the one-sided class war where the good guys are not winning but maybe, just maybe they will survive.<br /><br />We have known ever since F. Scott Fitzgerald that the rich, hell, the very rich and not just the ordinary rich, are different, very different, from you and me and Woody here tries to rub our noses in this difference even when the rich are on the way down, down into the mean streets (here of Frisco town). I am not altogether convinced, at least off of this film presentation, that he succeeded in that effort. What I am convinced of though is that Cate Blanchett (and to a lesser extent Bobby Cannavale and Sally Hawkins as two working -class characters) saved his bacon on this one by both breathing life into the character of Jasmine and by flooding the screen with one of the most nuancedperformances in her outstanding career.  Beautifully mannered and at home amount the rich and famous or manic, alcoholic and nothing but a drag on company she forced the viewer to deal with her presence. Woody on his own on this one, at least based on the story line and the over the top dialogue, could not have pulled as much power out of this film without that performance.<br /><br />Here is why. Through the devise of having to two non-biologically connected sisters (Jasmine and Ginger), the one upscale with great expectation Hamptons dreams and the other strictly working class with small, or maybe no dreams, maybe just trying to keep above water, Woody is able give him take a look at class society in contemporary post-crash America. And it ain't pretty, even for the fallen of the one percent. Except Jasmine steadfastly refuses to believe there was any such thing as downward mobility in the world (downward mobility courtesy of a reckless wheeler-dealer husband played by Alex Baldwin who turns out to have been just another guy working the age-old Ponzi scheme and who also committed suicide in prison after she turned him in). And so she lives in her own little universe, keeps her own sense of self up  by berating Ginger and her obvious working class ethos (pizza and television sports, sex, hell, maybe even bowling) and by scheming to get back on top anyway she can. Unsuccessfully as the film ends, and end though where she is as befuddled by her life and its downward drift as when she started. And that may say more about Allen's ability to do more than make stock figures out of his characters than what was possible to explore here. What you see this one for really is the performance by Cate Blanchett, and you should see that.
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|Great game, fast, smooth, very precise handling and looks great. So much better than the previous Riptide (that already very good). 5 starts without any hesitation. I recommend this game to any racing games fans...
B008469DGY|5.0|Good game. Free deal of the day. Wish I could flick putt to finish holes though. Oh well. Still good.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Looks great, fun game. The game handling needs a bit training. I like it and recommend it for your kids.

B002EDH0FE|5.0|I liked the movie. I like action flicks, and Robert Downy Jr. I am also being forced to write this. All I wanted to do was to give it as many stars as possible without having to go into a movie review. I was high when I watched it, so I can't possibly remember the details. I do remember being excited while it was on and smiling about it for a day afterwards. (Can I stop writing now, Amazon??)
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|awesome true account of an astonishing world war 2 story. gives an insight of soldier who fought second great war.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Can the next movie top this one?? Perfect mix of drama, criminal intrigue, tugging of heart strings, and comedy. I would also suggest, spend the few extra dollars for the HD version, it's well worth it. For the price, I easily could have spent 3 times the amount going to a theatre.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I can't add to the praise that's been written by many who know Hitchens's work better than I. Suffice to say the world is a slightly less erudite place without him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read it so fast that I had to read it again. Both times I cried so hard for Rue and I fell in love with Peeta almost instantly. The story flowed smoother than anything I've read in a long, long time. Ms. Collins is a very talented writer  and her imagery is absolutely amazing. I plan to read it again and again. I am so glad that I read the book before I watched the movie.<br /><br />The storyline is brutal, but life is brutal. Just watch the nightly news if you don't believe me. Teenagers see and participate in worse than this in most video games.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm a male of a certain age, and bought this book to see what all the fuss was about. Now almost half through it, it's been tough going much of the way. The writing is too florid and the characters have, at least so far, utterly no depth or believability. I gave it three stars (instead of one) because...actually, just out of hope that it will get better in the remaining pages. Hey, you girls probably love it, and may even think your life could be like this. But for wizened old men, the book borders on trash.

B00DGKQF2S|4.0|The power trio format generally leaves nowhere to hide any weaknesses. So if you're going to do it, you'd best start with the best three members possible - starting with your rhythm section.<br /><br />Billy Sheehan? Top notch, legendary bassist.<br /><br />Mike Portnoy? Second youngest drummer ever inducted into Modern Drummer's Hall Of Fame (behind Mr. Peart) for a reason.<br /><br />Ritchie Kotzen? Awesome guitarist, and to my complete (inexcusable) ignorance, a very soulful, powerful vocalist.<br /><br />Then, there's the songs.<br /><br />I absolutely love a good number of them, and like most of the rest; But just the sheer joy of hearing these guys play together, without a great heaping buttload of unnecessary overdubs? Worth the price of admission, no question.<br /><br />Shred-fest? Only tastefully so. But if you want 128th notes played in unison for an hour, you will hate it. This is about groove & soul & feeling, IMHO.<br /><br />I do hope these three stick together & develop this band into more than another one-off project. One listen through & the potential of what this could become was abundantly clear to me - you can't fake chemistry. They have it.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Good movie. Pretty heavy in the violence and language so keep the younger viewers away. Heavy use of the\\"n\\" word but I guess that is sadly accurate for pre civil war times.
B001NB545Q|5.0|So many fantastic rock bands came from Great Britain, and these guys are one of them. This album is excellent!
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|I was surfing through channels one evening and came across this movie on the Disney Channel and was pleasantly surprised.  The music is awesome, especially Cruising for a Bruising.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very very good...terrible ending. Would highly recommed though...it's hard to put down. It's a &#34;who done it&#34; for a very long time!!
B005LAIII0|3.0|the story is so slow moving...it's visually beautiful but just not my kind of movie, It was just not fond of the story
B00821OX98|5.0|And keeps getting better with every season. Can't wait for season 4, next year that is. I do wish each season would have a few more episodes though.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|Awesome classic coming of age movie.  My 8 yr old loved it too . I recommend it Yes. 0000000 0
B00005JOA0|3.0|I enjoy films depicting this era.  They used their vocabulary to express themselves instead of with slang and body language as we do today.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it is strange.<br />The life of John Nash was very strange, and<br />Ron Howard has captured that in this film.<br />It leaves the viewer wondering what experiences<br />were real and what was part of John Nash's<br />mental disturbances.  Interesting and thought<br />provoking.
B007A2O3FO|2.0|A poor story and I didn't like the was it was put together.  Seven more works?  Give me a break.
0679805273|5.0|I love this book because it helps us to realize difficult situations will happen and how to deal with them.
B00005UOXN|2.0|This is yet another best of Billy Idol type of cd. There is three or four others that have the same songs as this cd has. I really love Billy Idols' music and have been a fan for many years but this cd was not worth the money I usually spend on, for Billy Idol music. Needless to say i am not pleased with this cd.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|my great grandchildren absolutely love it; their  ages are 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, they can play it without help!.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome!  i can't put it down.  I like the adventure.  I do wish there were more scenes to play.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|My husband loves this rangefinder and uses it every time he plays golf.  No more frustrated golfer who overshoots the hole because he misjudged the distance.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I liked this game a lot, but after a while found it kind of boring and a little juvenile, so I keep it for when my friend's kids are around.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I am sure there are far more eloquent reviewers who have commented on this work, and I will leave the flowing verbose reviews to them. I will, however, say this...<br /><br />If you are like me and can devour a fantasy novel in 3 hours, then pick up Gardens of the Moon. Erikson just drops you in the middle of his world and makes you hang on his every word to orient yourself. The world he builds is rich and beautiful. Once I finally figured out who the characters were and such, I was at the end of the novel... So I immediately read it a second time through. I was looking for a challenge when I picked up this book. I can't wait to tackle the other 9 in the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great show with a wonderful cast of characters.  You won't be sorry you watched! Looking forward to season 4 in January.
B000FBFML6|5.0|I absolutely love the story of fitz-chivalry.  I've already got the third book waiting for me! And i have the starter of one of her other series waiting for after
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This is classic movie with a timeless message. Some may think this is &#34;chic flick&#34; but it crosses both gender and racial boundaries. Civil rights are for everyone, black and white and must be defended and held sacred for all peoples. This film focuses one groups courageous fight for their civil rights. Excellent film.
B009ZM76J2|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  It was one of the choices that I had to watch for my world religions class and I am so glad I chose this movie.  In a time when people thought taking children from their homes and putting them in internment camps was helping them.  Now the camps weren't prisons per se.  But if the children escaped they were tracked down, whipped and put back in with the others.  Their living conditions were bad at best, but the government did this for the children's own protection.  They wanted to civilize them, to make them acceptable for domestic work.  But in all it was just a form of legalized slavery, at least that's the way I saw it.  The film also had an Uncle Tom feel.  When the girls escaped it was an Aboriginal tracker that tried to track them down, granted there were some circumstances for why he did it.<br />This movie just helped to show that back then people and the government didn't want to co-exist with native religions.  They wanted to convert, and at times forcibly so, to what was considered the civilized religion.  This movie is very similar to the way Native Americans were treated in the past when halfblooded children were taken away, against their will, to be taught at schools.  To have their lives and culture stripped away because it was considered to be wrong or barbaric.  I cheered the girls the whole way through this movie and was glad to see they help along the way from others, though one turned out to be a double crosser.  I wanted to throttle these people that felt they were doing the right thing, that the government knew what was best for these girls, even though they were growing up happy, healthy and strong.  But this movie is set in 1931 Australia and people then were just ignorant and self-righteous.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn about the blights of native people in the early twentieth century
159463176X|5.0|a well written and well documented book, a heart rending story that makes you realise the drama and tragedy of those characters involved and also how lucky you are to live where you do.  Educational, I have given it to my 14 year old grand daughter so that she can learn how the other half live.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|What an awesome app. They did a very good job making it easy, fun, &amp; entertaining. I also appreciate how nicely the hair moves &amp; how everything works so smoothly. No glitches whatsoever. I spent hours messing around with this thing &amp; Im a grown woman who doesnt even do her own hair. Im just a tomboy but even I think this app is awesome.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time.  Not to be missed for sure.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I voted for Arnold when he ran for Governor of California. I always liked him since Conan. After reading his book I like Arnold more than Maria. Arnold came from a rags to riches life, and made all his dreams come true, in a new country. Maria was the opposite, she had the best of everything this country has to offer, and still didn't learn common sense. I almost feel mad at her, as a woman for letting herself be used and abused. She had to know what kind of person this man was, before she married him. I think they lived together five years before they married. After reading this book, I don't feel sorry for her. She took the risk and only got out of the marriage after the world was about to find out that Arnold Fathered a Son with their maid. At least they made four beautiful children together, and lots of money.
B005544TRQ|5.0|this is a very well written show.  actors are perfectly cast.  really enjoyed watching it!  blew through all the episodes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Takes about 10 minutes to complete a room. Great for a short diversion. Only has 10 levels at this time, though. I hope that they come out with higher levels.
0446547646|4.0|I've read many Nicholas Sparks books and this one was good, but not my favorite. I enjoyed The Lucky One the most.
0800141849|4.0|Excellent love story. Love the lecture scene with Streisand as the professor. Jeff Bridges great line is, &#34;How do you get them to stay?&#34; Truly enjoy this movie and will watch it at least once a year if not more often.
B000VRIQ58|5.0|The music on the download was crystal clear. It sounded great and brought back memories of when I bought the LP back in the day it was released.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Five &#34;words&#34;  * * * * * 5 stars! I adore Suzanne Collins! She is such a good writer! Ugh! GET THIS BOOK.<br />Also, there are a lot of curveballs I didn't expect AT ALL. Loved this series and not a single regret about reading it. Don't be hesitant to try and buy.... I guarantee you'll love it! My favorite was Catching Fire, but both of the others come in close runners up!!<br /><br /> ~ANG-EL.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game. Very addicting to play. they keep adding levels too so it doesn't ever get stale.  would recommend to anyone.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I downloaded this app and i love it. My 2 year old sister loves it and my 16 year old sister loves this app just as much as me. I just wish that there were more people to choose from. But other than that i love it
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|The underlying story is interesting and I suspect the book was probably pretty good, but the movie spends 80% of its time focused on Tom Cruises's character's patrol flights. Some cool effects, but most of the movie is just Tom and his outpost partner patroling the planet. Morgan Freeman is maybe on screen for 15 minutes. So some good eye candy with the effects but no character development and minimal plot.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Having read the book, I couldn't stop comparing the movie to it, unfavorably. The book is subtle and fluid and mysterious. The movie hits you over the head with its themes. The movie becomes an anthology of stories whose connections are not central to the stories, and the transitions in mood between segments are jarring. I also thought that the sci-fi futuristic chase scenes, which were 90% special effects, were unnecessary and actually against the spirit of the novel. The same goes for some of the gratuitous violence.<br />Having said all this, I'd rather watch &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; 10 times over than some of the super-hero movies than, say &#34;Man of Steel&#34; or some of the other super-hero movies out there. &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; (the movie) does have excellent performances by actors playing multiple roles, an unusual central concept, and a mind-stretching arc through time that you do remember afterward.
B00640UICA|4.0|Like  the game, hate filling out these stupid reviews.  Too many characters are required before I can get on with my life.
B000BT97AO|1.0|I bought this because of Neil Gaiman's name.  I loved Neverwhere (both the series and the book), however this is nothing like that.  I did not like the visuals and did not find the story interesting enough to make up for that
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is about love, devotion, and romance. Easy read and definitely entertaining.  What's not to like? Read it if you have the time.
6305807086|2.0|It sounded great and had many great elements, however for me it just did not work. It was not enjoyable to watch and and was unmemorable.  I think this belongs to the arty farty crowd
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I'm always on the look out for &#34;classics&#34; at a reasonable price.  I've heard about this book for a long time, but never took the time to read it.  I'm so glad I did.
B00002E233|1.0|That is where it belongs.  It is generic and pretty stupid. I think this may have been written by a computer, or possibly by the shark.  It was that good
B009CCBCU4|3.0|it was okay slow very wordy end was the opening for the rest of the series but I didn't like it enough to go on
B005CAATXG|5.0|Have to thank Spotify for coming across these guys. They were referenced as someone whom I might enjoy. What I heard the first song, which was &#34;Only a Memory&#34;, I must have listened to it some 20x before I went onto the next song of theirs. I listened to their album kid you not over 50x in a week's time easy.  This is one of those albums you can listen to from start to finish and never touch the remote control to forward, it's that stinking good!! How many albums can you do that with, seriously?<br /><br />I can’t say they completely compare to any band, albeit you’ll hear from different reviews here and online ones that reference Paramore, Flyleaf, etc. Ok, just some minor similarities, but I get a completely different vide and impression from Icon For Hire. Completely different energy.  I love the fact I hadn’t heard any cussing in their lyrics, and seem to care about their fans to a massive degree and want to keep it this way.  There are one or two online YouTube videos that review (non industry reviews) IFH, and hit it pretty close to perfect, in accurately describing their sound and depth of music ability.<br /><br />What’s nice is they aren't commercially fabricated and synthetically put there for our enjoyment.  What you see is what you get. It’s all them. The music, the lyrics, the clothes, all of it. Heck, Ariel, the lead singer makes the majority of her own clothes and even has her own side business, her own clothing line.  What’s also nice is Ariel doesn't strip down to near nothing like most artists do these days to get attn., esp in the area of rock or punk, etc. She stays covered up and respects herself doing so, along with paying respect to other females because of this.  Very noble, and hope she continues to keep this attitude.  She’s quite beautiful, so I can’t say this also doesn't help their cause!<br /><br />I’m not going to try and break down their music or try and compare them, let me just say this, I bought their CD, and I hadn't bought a CD in more than a year or two.  Also, here’s a FIRST ever for me, and I’m 36 years old and like a lot of artists!! I actually just missed their local concert here where I live, so I literally booked a ticket out of state and am going to their concert NEXT MONTH!!  That’s how much they rock.  Need I say more???<br /><br />Put simply. If their next album is near or above the quality of this one, they’ll be getting bigger whether they want to or not.  They’re special in their own way and once people get a taste of their goodness, they’ll instantly want more.<br /><br />Great stuff and look forward to seeing them in concert.  I’ve only heard great things about their concerts too.  These guys are getting great reviews all over the place.  There’s a reason for that. They’re that good and will continue to hone their art in music.
B008469DGY|4.0|I got it for free, so I have no reason to dislike it! Good mechanics and looks nice as well. 4 stars because it isn't perfect.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|Good, but confusing. Too much back & forward. You have to keep track of time if you don't want to miss the line of the story.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I can not play the games because it wouldn't show up. It only says that its not responding that's why i can't play this game

B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Works just like it should.  Cool light for above the front door.  Great for going out to get the paper.
B00006AW2G|5.0|a lot of standby's on this particular album...the original Rolling Stones personnel have a couple of cuts. this music is really timeless and focuses on all too familiar refrains in western culture...
B00DW5IM9Q|3.0|There were only 3 songs on this album that I didn't already have on other bootleg albums. Guess it's time to stop collecting Bob
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love my new pink life proof case . To be honest it was the color that drew me in but the quality is great to.<br />The other day I was shopping at Lowes and an employee came up to me and asked me if I could tell him<br />where I bought my case from. He said his girlfriend wanted a pink one and they couldn't find one any where.<br />I was more than happy to tell him where I purchased it, he Thanked me and I felt good knowing that someone<br />noticed my case. I am anxiously waiting for more colors to come out....  :-)
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Could have been much scarier, even more &#34;boo&#34; factors! Nice effects and good story to start which could have made a terrifying movie.  The girls could have been much more terrorizing.

0062238868|4.0|The way Chris Kyle downplayed his own actions it took away from the overall excitement that I expected to find in this book.
0823023494|5.0|Im a self-taught graphic designer and this book has helped me IMMENSELY over the past week. I've never been that good at drawing people or faces but this book broke down the entire process into an easy to understand guide with tons of visual examples. Just looking at my character designs before and after reading this book you can see a very noticeable difference and I can't wait to continue implementing these into my everyday work.<br /><br />I will definitely be re-reading this book several more times just to make sure everything soaks in because it really is that useful.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is quite fun and entertaining.  It is far from boring.  It will keep you clicking away for hours.  I like the fact that there are several playing options and not just one.  A very nice game to take a short break with and most of all, just have fun.

B00AQK4EWY|5.0|Kindle version is complete, no issues there. Also this is so actual in the message, even if nowadays the poor is well protected, maybe to well protected, so personal responsibility is somehow taken out of discussion. If you are a faithful Christian, this is a book to read!

B008JFUN50|4.0|Your opinion of \\"Elysium\\" will likely hinge on your opinion about income inequality and how it relates to healthcare. If you happen to disagree that the future of capitalism will lead to a widening rift between upper and lower class, you are going to find this film highly unpalatable.  \\"Elysium\\" drives this point home with a capital \\"E\\".  But if you are willing to entertain the idea that the increase of have nots is a trend, \\"Elysium\\" is here to tell you that by 2154 Earth is going to turn into a toilet.<br /><br />Our protagonist Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is a man from a difficult past trying to make good by following the rules.  Well, almost -- he's still a wise ass, particularly when it comes to being interrogated by the robots that enforce the law in a world teeming with crowded humanity.  Once we see what Da Costa does for a living it's easy to see why; he BUILDS the same robots that oppress him. After mouthing off to a bot and getting his arm broken, Da Costa crosses paths with his old childhood flame, Frey (Alice Braga).  Frey's daughter Matilda is dying of leukemia, but that's not enough to motivate Da Costa to risk his life to save her.  And her salvation lies in a Stanford torus known as Elysium, where the rich live with robot servants and cure-all medbays that fix every conceivable ill.<br /><br />A word about Elysium from Greek myth, an afterlife for demigods and heroes, from Pindar's Odes:<br /><br />...the good receive a life free from toil, not scraping with the strength of their arms the earth, nor the water of the sea, for the sake of a poor sustenance. But in the presence of the honored gods, those who gladly kept their oaths enjoy a life without tears, while the others undergo a toil that is unbearable to look at.<br /><br />The \\"toil that is unbearable to look at\\" is Earth.  Da Costa finds himself irradiated in a blatant EHS violation that ensures he'll be dead in five days.  With nothing to lose, he reconnects with former criminal employer Spider (Wagner Moura), a near unintelligible gangster with big plans.  He regularly smuggles the desperate to Elysium so they get a chance at healing, but with Da Costa he has bigger plans: the kidnapping of an executive.  Da Costa agrees on one condition.  He wants to go after the CEO of the company where Da Costa was irradiated, CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner).  The catch is that Carlyle is in the midst of a coup against Elysium by Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster, sporting an odd French accent). When Da Costa ambushes Carlyle and downloads his brain, he picks up more than he bargained for, and thus a cat-and-mouse game enuses between Da Costa and sleeper agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley, nearly unintelligible with his accent).  Kruger's chasing Da Costa, and Da Costa's chasing a dream, saddled by guilt that the love of his life's daughter will die soon if he doesn't do something.<br /><br />And oh yeah, Da Costa wears an exoskeleton that has some Christ-like allegories if you squint at Damon when he stretches his arms out.<br /><br />What ensues is a lot of shaky-cam combat in director Neill Blomkamp's trademark dirty sci-fi universe, the same backdrop that was so effective in \\"District 9.\\"  This is an ugly war in an ugly place, and \\"Elysium\\" doesn't have many nice things to say about just about everyone involved.  But that's what makes it so compelling, and what makes the film worth watching.  Yes, there's often some logic leaps between scenes, and the transition between scenes and sets seems to be so tenuous as to be nearly ethereal, but this message movie has an interesting tale to tell if we're willing to listen...cybernetics and gunfights not withstanding.r (Wagner Moura), a near unintelligible gangster with big plans.

The story is weak.<br /><br />The characters like Hit-Girl, when you see this frail looking girl with no muscle what she can do it just seem unreal and for a twelve-year-old,  she is so wise.<br /><br />Not one character is interesting.<br /><br />The acting was poor.<br /><br />I suggest you wait until it comes to TV.

B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This is a super cute movie. I hope you like birds though, because that's what you'll get. Jack Black is nice and toned down, so you don't get annoyed. And Owen Wilson is annoying but in a sort of an endearing way.<br /><br />Watch it with your girlfriend who doesn't know the meaning of 'put a bird on it' but has plenty of birds on it.

0143039482|5.0|This story by Steinbeck is a break from his seminal works dealing with working class people struggling to get ahead.  This is a story of a family with roots to the founding of America that over time goes from Landed Gentry to hourly worker in a local grocery store.  There are not many stories that feature Harvard Graduate at the check out counter of an Italian owned grocery store.  The central character is saved from his penury by his dedication to an old friend from a similar old family of high standing.  The business morals of Small town America are challenged and defeated assuring the return of stature to the once proud family.

The ravages of the depression multiplied ten fold by the drought and dust storms in the 1930's caused whole family's of share croppers to pull up stakes and go West where the brochures being circulated promise steady work and good wages.  The families pooled their meager resources to buy a worn out vehicle for $25 and start the 1800 mile trip with as little as $100 cash to buy gas and to live on.The journey is fraught with terror and hardship only to arrive in California and find thousands of other migrants lining up for the work and security a job would provide.  Your stomach turns when all the family has left to eat is fried corn meal with nothing better to look forward to.  If you were ever hungry or cold you will feel this families pain.  This book tells the story of the Joad family but it is about you and I and our deepest instincts to survive.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|I saw the graphics and thought...cool, another nice looking game. After I hit purchase and it was already downloading, I saw the word DRAG in there so I wasn't expecting much. The game is WONDERFUL! I didn't know that I could have so much fun racing without a steering wheel...lol.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|This mic is worth the price for it's quality. The difference between this mic and the regular Rode VideoMic is noticeable, especially if you're plugging it into your dSLR.<br /><br />dSLRs all have a noticeable static hiss, just watch any YouTube video filmed on a standard Rode VideoMic and you'll hear it. The VMP has a +20dB boost option, which, when combined with lowering your mic levels in camera, effectively neutralize that annoying dSLR hiss. It's important to note though, that you need a dSLR which allows you to set the mic levels manually to utilize this. The popular entry level Canon Digital Rebel T4i can do this.<br /><br />The construction is solid and the way this mic is suspended is far more sturdy and reliable than the awkward mount on the regular VideoMic. I bought the deadcat for this mic and leave it installed 24/7 to kill most wind noise. It lasts a LONG time on a single 9V battery, which is great since I often forget to turn it off for hours after use (whoops).<br /><br />I do have 2 gripes with this mic though. First, the shoe mount can be unscrewed to allow this mic to be attached to a tripod or boom. The screw for this often loosens which causes the mic to not stay snug on the camera and wobbles around. since I don't foresee myself using this on a tripod or boom, I may use some thread locking fluid to prevent this from happening anymore.<br /><br />Secondly, the cable comes out of the left side of the mount, and then is supposed to run across to the right side, passing through a very small clip on the front of the mount. The cable frequently falls out of this loose clip (more like a divot). Also, this leaves the cable on the right side of the mount, which is odd since nearly all dSLRs have their mic input jacks on the left side of the body. This means the cable has to do a contorted loop around the camera to properly be isolated and plugged in. The cable is also fairly short at roughly six inches. I'd like to use a shoe V mount adapter so I canuse this and a light, but the cable' short reach makes this impossible.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent shotgun mic for dSLRs. For most the Rode VideoMic will be sufficient, but for the discerning user who really cares about getting broadcast quality audio without that hiss in a smaller higher quality shell, the Rode VideoMic Pro is perfect. It comes with a 10 year warranty and a free license to the plural eyes software.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Excellent audio quality<br />- High quality sturdy isolation shock mount<br />- +20dB boost eliminates dSLR hiss<br />- 10 year warranty<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Expensive<br />- Short cable<br />- mount screw requires frequent tightening

1936608898|5.0|If you have commitment issues and you don't have any desire to change your life, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!<br /><br />After lugging my own body weight around on crutches (after an ankle surgery), I just KNEW I had to do something to change the way I was living my life. I was REALLY heavy! No wonder I had such a difficult time running. I was sad, mopey, lethargic because I hadn't been able to exercise so I posted online my desperation to lose weight and asked someone to help me find a way that didn't include a whole lot of exercise (I was still post op). A friend recommended this book.<br /><br />As I read through the chapters, I began to dabble in cutting out certain foods that were not Whole 30 compliant, still unwilling to make the commitment. After I finished that last chapter, I was convinced. I set my own kick off date (Memorial Day 2013) and jumped right in. Two weeks later, I was down 12 pounds! TWELVE! I finished my first Whole 30 down 14 pounds. I attempted another W30 in August (made it to day 21) and while I didn't shed a lot more weight, I did shed a LOT more inches. I've gone from a size 10/12 to a size 6/8. This is HUGE for someone who's only 5 feet tall. I've also stopped taking my acid reflux medication because I no longer battle with that issue. I sleep better, I have more energy during the day, and I'm able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! Ok, that last part isn't true, but you get the picture.<br /><br />I no longer look at pounds as much as I assess how my body feels. I've made some MAJOR changes to my lifestyle and I am soooooooooooo thankful that Dallas and Melissa wrote this book. I've even got a group of friends who have started their own Whole 30 challenge for the month of September!<br /><br />You NEED this book! You can do ANYTHING for 30 days!

B00004RF83|5.0|Unless you are addicted to having stuff blow up and seeing car chases, this movie provides plenty of heart-pounding suspense!
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|The Fragile was Trent Reznor's last attempt at a sprawling masterpiece. Following that double album, he tightened up a lot of his compositions, found a new path in life...and in some cases (most notably The Slip) the music became unbearably stale. Hesitation Marks breaks all sorts of new ground, both thematically and sonically. Gone is the unrelenting, blast-furnace anger (which Reznor outgrew years ago), and in its place is a more balanced and in some cases, more disturbing, sound. If you've only heard the radio singles that dominate the first half of this album, do yourself a favor and listen to the rest of it. This one really doesn't take off until after the (rather puzzling) \\"Everything.\\" This is a must buy.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Free trade. Peer pressure. Selfishness. Creating enemies. Teaming up to take down the leading player. Collecting resources. Cursing the robber. Settling for dev cards. Strategy with a little bit of luck makes this one of the best board games I've ever had the pleasure of owning. Also be careful for people who want rematches.

B001KRVLCI|5.0|Bought this movie because I had it in VHS many years a go and I loved it. looked for it in retail stores with no luck and the price was better on line to. If you want a good movie this is a good one for your collection.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show just keeps getting funnier. These guys never get old, and the ladies that have joined the cast just add to the mix.  This is what good TV really is.

B00AACNVFO|5.0|I loved this album in vinyl when I was a younger man, and I am awreety awrighty now that zappa and the mothers catalog is out on digital. I hope the family gets decent royalties from Amazon and iTunes. ok, if you don't know zappa, then Cheepnis is probably the best introductory song to his world, and this album is a good introduction, his weirdness is tempered down and the jazz/blues/rock musicianship is mighty fine. After this album get Apostrophe, and then Overnight Sensation. After that, you are on your own.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|genraly a very good game but the last time i upgraded to Subway Surfers Beijing it wiped all of my data i had 75,000 coins and i was not happy at all everytime you have internet if it is time you will upgrade all of my friends had the same thing happen to them and they are furious.<br />depends what sort of person you are to how much you like it.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have been using the app for the kindle fire quite well until this latest update.  Terrible for kindle fire users.  I can't read any of my old emails that I have.  I was able to get into a new email bit not the old ones.  I also liked the window that just told me how many emails I had without going to them.  Yeah I am sure others didn't but I can deal with it.  You certainly need to fix this glitch.  I need to see the old emails
B005K17RU0|2.0|i wasn't impressed with this app...at all. it wasn't fast... it's confusing.... it's also very hard to find the thing you want to see....
1623650003|5.0|Since finishing the final book in Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy, I have longed for a new mystery that boasts a heroine with the ferocity and mystique of Lisbeth Salander. Fortunately for me, I found her in Alex, which is popular French author Pierre Lemaitre's first book to be translated into English. Though it is not encouraged for the faint of heart, it comes highly recommended for lovers of international crime mysteries with a twist.<br /><br />We are introduced to the title character, Alex Prévost: a carefree young woman in her early thirties, as she playfully tries on wigs in a small French shop. Her jovial mood darkens as she becomes increasingly aware that a big, brutish man she does not recognize has been following her all day. While walking home from dinner, she is suddenly abducted by this man, and held prisoner in a derelict warehouse. While Alex is in captivity, the local police force (lead by cantankerous dwarf Commandant Camille Verhoeven) scrambles to find a motive for the kidnapping, and more importantly, any evidence that will lead them to Alex before it is too late. As Commandant Verhoeven starts to piece together the circumstances around Alex's disappearance, a picture starts to form of a young woman with an unconventional childhood who has established some controversial survival tactics. The book is told from both Alex's and Verhoeven's perspectives, and the alternating story lines accelerates the plot towards a very satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />While the plot of Alex may ring familiar to seasoned crime readers, I must assure you that there is nothing ordinary about this book. Pierre Lemaitre is a masterful storyteller who has the ability to keep readers completely transfixed from the first to the last page. Lemaitre held me as captive as poor Alex: I neglected plans with friends and even sacrificed favorite television shows in favor of immersing myself in this book. The unrelenting twists and turns makes Alex the ultimate page-turner you should add to the top of your reading list this fall.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Mel Gibson and Danny Glover rock! They mix funny with action and kick ass through the whole movie! I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it!  The characters are so cute!  I do wish that you could spend that banannas that you earn more instead of having to purchase other things.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Extremely interesting accounting of the Christ's life and times it provides a lot of food for thought. I recommend highly
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is one of those movies you see and want to watch over and over again. Great cast, unpredictable events, and a backdrop that is supposed to be Alaska. Very fun -- every time we watch it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is cool and if yilou never play minecraft before I hope you like it you craft and build things. you dream of I love it I bet you would like it
B00280LYIC|3.0|This book is pretty much just a Harry Potter rip-off, but it was entertaining enough if you don't expect too much from it.
B00884GR0W|5.0|if you love minecraft you will like block story. block story has a rpg twist to it than minecraft. I hope you like block story
B004MPESSY|5.0|I would be traumatized if I rented this movie without knowing what it was about or without watching the original! I watched the older version on Netflix and decided to rent this one from Amazon. It was much better between the acting and much more believable than the original. I highly recommend it if you like thrillers!
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|........thin content and lots a of bad language.  If that's what you really, really want then this is the movie for you.  Didn't work to well for me.
030758836X|3.0|I started \\"Gone Girl\\" with great hopes.  The initial chapters were compelling.  A unique voice was being heard.  And then it all went so wrong.  How did that happen?  The promise of this novel was profound.  The initial execution of the premise, an explication of a marriage in dissolution via the two involved voices, was brilliant.  Nonetheless, by the time I was into the third section, the voices had become tiresome, the narrative energy wholly dissipated.  I sensed that the author encountered a major block towards the end of the novel.  The open-ended ending, while reminding one of some of the great experimental novels of the 50s and 60s, was possessed with none of the power of those novels.  In \\"Gone Girl,\\" the world ends with less than a whimper.
B00BTFJZYM|4.0|It was a gift for a preteen (who loved it). Nice telling of the Jack Frost story, and the other &#34;mythical&#34; beings were wonderfully cast and played. A few scary bits if your watchers are very young and easily scared, but even the scary bits were bearable (and the way they were portrayed was a lovely bit of animation)
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|If I had to describe this book in just one word, it would be the word \\"smooth.\\"  The writing is smooth, the transitions from section to section and chapter to chapter are smooth, and the plot devices are smoothly executed.<br /><br />But don't think that being smooth means that this is a cozy beach read or a light romantic suspense.  Oh, no, not at all. This is a fine police procedural, which just happens to be infused with serious emotional growth on the parts of Heat and Rook, professionally, individually, and as a couple.<br /><br />The police procedural portion is defined by an investigation into the murder of a highly influential gossip columnist with enemies galore, making suspects rampant in number.  And the emotional growth is defined by a focus on communication skills, listening skills in particular.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, the author has the characters struggling with their choices, both professional and personal, over that which needs to be done as opposed to what they often wish to do. The author also has the characters struggling with what they want to say as opposed to what they need to and should say to others. And the emphasis the author placed on focused listening and on silence as tools for interrogation as well as for personal communication was better than any self-help book I've ever read.<br /><br />However, as much as I read mysteries, I did not have a clue as to who orchestrated the murders until the very end, not a clue.  After that identity was revealed, I thought back through the book to determine how I had missed those clues.  Frankly, I don't think there were any clues to miss. The character was never mentally or physically alone with the reader but was always presented in the presence of our protagonists. And I don't feel that character's actions or words ever led to any implications or suspicions. One simple piece of paper, one sentence of data in a larger report, collected as part of a lead involving another character cracked it all open. Like I said in the beginning: smooth, very very smooth.it all open. Like I said in the beginning: smooth, very very smooth.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I've played this game daily since i downloaded it. Fun stuff! Really enjoy this clean and challenging (and free) game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Contrary to what some people have been saying, this game does have instructions in the options tab.<br />This is a VERY fun game, and although there is some memory and math involved, it was very fun and I finished the first ten levels in half an hour. Can't wait for more!<br />I will recommend to everyone!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game although simplistic is fun and challenging. The app is very playable for the free app. Never had any problems with it on 3 different devices, no bugs, every update adds to the fun.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Kept me intrigued, could not read the pages fast enough! I had read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; first, loved it so have read her others.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|King and Maxwell are one of those fun-to-read crime fighting duos. I had not heard of them until the TV show began this summer. The characters were very interesting, so I thought I'd go to the source and read the books from the beginning. Can't wait to start the second book in the series! Thanks, David Baldacci!!
030758836X|2.0|The book was fascinating, but I'd hate to be this author's husband.  He needs to watch his back with the way she thinks.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well I have read this book many times in the past. But seeing the movie trailer made me go and get the ebook. Its a fast read.  I recommend it highly. BUT do NOT read book 2 right away - it takes place well in the future. Instead read the Enders Shadow series as all of them take place &#34;now&#34;.. And then go on to the rest of the Ender series.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie..
B000FC146C|5.0|Loved it! could not put it down! great story and characters! Will read it again! Highly recommended! Read this book!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Current pure action movies today always have issues in creating an enjoyable experience throughout the entire movie.  Dredd is the perfect example of how to do an action flick right.  The story is very simple and straightforward in order to keep the action continuous and entertaining.<br /><br />Karl Urban's face is hidden behind his mask for the entire movie, but what he does with just his grim frown and 5 o'clock shadow makes you wish he could be the next Batman.<br /><br />To sum up, this movie is just a fun, simple action movie that probably went under your radar when it was in theatres.  I highly recommend to any fan of action or comic book movies.
B000SEI230|5.0|I can not believe I read this book I. Only two days. Once I started it seemed as if it caught me and would not let go.  I laughed cried and had all the emotions the writer wanted me to have. He is truly a great writer to bring that much emotion over the reader with just his words and the story.
B003F46RVO|4.0|Like most Corey Feldman/Haim movies, The Lost Boys is pure 80's.  The style, the slight campiness, all of it reminds us of the time before cell phones and internet.  This movie is very enjoyable, and exactly what I was looking for in a fun vampire movie.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Blake did an awesome job on this album!! All the songs are catchy enough to keep you listening! I enjoyed this album.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Nice mix of songs, really shows her vocal abilities.  She is a powerhouse, but can be smooth and easy listening also!
B00008QSA5|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who Loves the Blues, with strong electric guitar licks. This album displays the talent, and heart felt emotion of M. Bloomfield
B00COGXX7A|4.0|Along the lines of the other Hallmark movies Notebook etc. Simple love story with complicated plot that is sometimes distracting unless you read the synopsis to discover the plot which you must do to understand the beginning unless you wait to the end.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The story was a little slow before the plot got thicker towards the last 1/4 of the movie. But if you like Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman and SciFi flicks, this is still worth a watch because of the interesting concept.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I think this is a great game. Trying to find all the missing collections are very fun. I only wish the images we a little bit easier to find and I'd rather not have a timer limiting you. Other than that it's a great game and would recommend it to anyone who likes hidden object games
B00003CXA6|1.0|I was really looking forward to this film. Disappointed. Awful acting. Bad casting. Fake beards looked like something out of an old Marx Brother's movie.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. From beginning to end it was a page turner and I finished it in one afternoon! I would definitely recommend it to every cat lover! I can't wait to read the next one.

B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Remakes of 80's TV shows, especially kids shows rarely are good on the big screen, so I didn't expect much when I sat down to watch The Smurfs.  However I was pleasantly surprised, and it wasn't the comedy acting from Neil Patrick Harris, Hank Azaria or even any of the Smurfs that had me thinking after a minute or two, hey I'm really enjoying this, but the antics of a cat.  I don't even really like cats but I've never seen a cat character like Azrael on the screen.  It was just damn funny every scene it was in, especially when highlighting the incompetence of Gargamel.  I'm not saying Neil Patrick Harris or Hank Azaria didn't do a good job either.  Both did, but it was Azriel that outperformed them all and why I would recommend this to others.  I do remember the cat being in the cartoon I watched as a kid but nothing specific, so this CGI cat's screen presence on the screen was something I didn't anticipate.<br /><br />The Smurfs casting made a good selection of actors to fill the non Smurf parts, taking actors who were part of the biggest shows on TV, like these shows or hate them, Glee (Jayma Mays), How I Met Your Mother (Neil Patrick Harris) and Modern Family (Sofia Vergara) dominated the ratings in 2011 when this movie was released.  Throw in Hank Azaria (The Simpsons) and the voice of Katy Perry as Smurfette and it surprising that this movie didn't do better in cinemas.  But I guess it's the 80's TV show remake as a movie curse as I mentioned before.<br /><br />Although the movie was predictable in every scene, it was still fun viewing.  Gargamel's nose was obviously fake and the Smurfs didn't entirely look like they weren't superimposed on top of real world footage but that's okay in a fun film.  I liked how they made fun of the staples of the cartoon like the fact they use Smurf as a verb in every sentence.  Smurfette is asked how it's possible she's the only girl in the village but gets distracted before answering other than Gargamel made her, I would have liked them to have answered that one.<br /><br />I'd recommend this film to others, especially those with pet cats due to Azriel's mocking actions and fits of laughter at its hapless master.iked them to have answered that one.<br /><br />I'd recommend this film to others, especially those with pet cats due to Azriel's mocking actions and fits of laughter at its hapless master.

B00BP0QPJE|5.0|One of if not the most beautifully written and narrated story ever. Steinbeck is our American Tolstoy. Caution though, make sure you have the time before starting or chores won't get done.
031265068X|2.0|The writing was mediocre to say the least. Maybe a native English speaker would have done greater justice to the subject matter. The writer also comes off as a fawning admirer of Rich....nothing wrong with that, just a little annoying.
B004SEUJYG|5.0|It is rare in my rather extensive experience of watching movies, to see an actor who so fits the character that he is playing as well as George C. Scott portrayed George S. Patton in WWII. A truly exceptional movie which I have watched over and over again. Karl Maulden does an excellent job as Omar Bradley, as junior to Patton and then by a series of mishaps by Patton - as his senior.<br /><br />A great movie for those who want to see more of the only WWII US General truly feared by the Nazis!!

B000026E2C|4.0|Just what I wanted. Good group and great music. I have all their records and listen to them all the time.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|I found this film cinematically stunning.  Sure, no astoundingly new tricks but a very graceful and beautiful film.  At times heartbreaking and difficult it is a meditative portrait of the human condition.
B00C1TOTK0|2.0|I'm a customer from Australia who bought this movie on blu ray. On the back of the cover it clearly states that the movie is in a widescreen format 16x9. Customers beware:(This movie is not in the 16x9 format as stated on the back cover). Yes the movie is very clear in 1080p HD. But the movie is in the 4x3 format. On the back of the cover it says disc made in Mexico. I can't believe that they went to all this effort to put this classic movie on blu ray in a 4x3 format.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Second time reading through the series. I loved just as much this time! I can't wait for book 6!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Like being able to get temp and humidity first thing in the morning.  Like the display and the ease of the app
B0089LOKHG|2.0|It was too much of a good ending. Everything and I mean everything seemed rushed! There was no anticipation or surprises that were realistic. I know you don't have to be realistic in literature, but it was to good to be true. Not the book, but the plot. Overall I did not enjoy reading this book, I loved the first two books in the trilogy but Requiem completely blew it.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|Yes,I did enjoy watching Rambo. I love to watch any movie with Slyvester Stallone. He is a great actor. He is one of my favorite actors.

The other 3 flick apps from these devs or even better , I got all of them the football kicking , soccer is all that , the extreme gold is harder than this one , then the zombie flick is good as well . It's worth every cent or free of the day if u ask me . Peace..
B004GHNIRK|1.0|can't stay interested in it enough to get into this book. Maybe if I saw the movie I could follow it better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Moaning you did a great job but how long do I have to wait for 0.8.0<br />Please hurry I am bored
B0089LOG02|4.0|An interesting story. Not a true story necessarily, but interesting and  kept you wanting to finish it. Liked it very much
B00BR476TG|3.0|Better on the plane without sound than in the living room with sound.  Not a movie to see twice.  The CG for the tiger leave a lot to be desired when seen on anything larger than the 8 or 10  inch screens on the a320.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|My favorite's album all the time!! it's worth to get one for yourself!! it's VERY DIFFERENT kind of POP MUSIC!! SO??!! What are you waiting for?

B00821OX98|5.0|Waiting for Season 3 to come out for Prime members to watch it for free.  Really enjoy it.  Good entertainment.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I had to watch this movie twice, because I couldn't seem  to stay awake. After watching it the second time, I thought it was a good movie. The ending was sad, and I wish it had ended differently. It is a good love story. I felt sorry for Gatsby because he had a lot of love for the young lady and I just think it was all about the money for her, if she really loved him, she would have waited for him.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I am so in love with this song! Also Lady Gaga's performance at the VMAs was amazing. I love Gaga.&#60;3
B00AAQHP66|5.0|loved it, an oldie but a goodie and now I can watch it all the time it was sent on time and arrived in great shape

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really love the show.  I enjoy watching it.  Especially watching granny.  Wonderful actors, love the characters.  I look forward to watching more of this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so beautiful. It shredded me. It is so worth the read and I will go buy the second book right now and read them both over and over and over again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game keeps you on the move.  Speed in running, jumping and taking corners requires quick finger movements.  A good game for the for the alert.
B002PEP4U0|1.0|This was required reading for my incoming freshman.  It was a painful story to get through. Though I can appreciate what William managed to do, the story is hard to relate to and was difficult to hold my and my 15 yr olds attention.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of my favourite games to play when you are relaxing.  A hit with everyone. I recommend a great game for anyone who want to relax.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|good action movie. better than the first.  kahn's character is well played and adds a new dimension.  hope they do another one.
B005HSL626|4.0|A good game to keep you occupied when your bored.  Great for children, who have good motor skill with a quick finger.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|action, comedy, with good actors. if you like shows like leverage you will like this movie. the plot is well thought out.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love this game and the many verities there are to pick from.  I recommend this game for family to play.
140191716X|5.0|I always am pleased with all of Doreen Virtues products, gifts..Inspirational Material. Helps me to continue on my Angelic Path.
B000W6Q1KU|5.0|Michael Moore brings a compelling indictment of healthcare in the US. He focuses on people unable to afford care in our country and contrasts that to the situations of patients in countries with universal healthcare, as is the case in the rest of the industrialized world. He makes it plain that we are failing many of our citizens who need and deserve care that they would get even in nations far poorer than ours. His evidence of heartless insurance company decisions, the inequality of care resulting from the economic burden imposed even with insurance, and the neglect of the uninsured and underinsured is utterly damning .
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|There is not a lot I can say about Mr. Gaiman only that he is.. Brilliant! This will be my second book that I have read of his the first was American gods which totally captivated me, I couldn't put that one down and I am saying the same about this one..I didn't want either of them to end.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I work on a Dell Vostro 2510. I have been using the latest and less than greatest version of Yahoo mail (because I had no choice) and it is dreadful. It constantly freezes so that you have to shut down and restart to move between folders. E.g. - when I try to move from my inbox to spam. Then there is a problem when you try to open an email and they tell you to keep re-trying. I did that 5 times on an individual email and the instruction was to click on the link to a help page to fix the problem but the link didn't work.<br /><br />I've been a Yahoo client for over 15 years and I gone through several \\"new and improved emails\\" but I've had enough. I'm going to make the move to gmail. At least you can get help if you need it - it is impossible to contact Yahoo for help.<br /><br />With all the problems they have been facing in holding on to their base, you would think they would do a better job on QA
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Great game overall: nice graphics, great music, and gameplay that you can get right into. The game does get rather repetitive after a while, though. Once you've done each type of level there's not really anything new, just slightly more difficult variations that amount to the same thing. If it had more types of gameplay or more music in the soundtrack, it would keep its entertainment value longer. All the same, still a great game, and one I like to come back to every now and then.
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the books but really enjoyed the movie as well.  Cant wait for the next two movies to come out.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Steal Like An Artist tickled my creative bone as well as my funny bone.  A quick read and useful to jog the creative block whether a writer or artist.  I liked his humor and advice.
044024630X|2.0|***Spoilers Possible***<br />To be fair, I've only read or heard three Jack Reacher books. The other two (Worth Dying For and Never Go Back, 15 and 18 respectively) I would count hits. This one, I'd say is a miss.<br /><br />The back cover of the book makes it seem like Reacher and Sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux would work together (\\"reluctantly join forces\\"). I know these books are about Reacher, but there's not much mystery or detective-like work going on from either of them. The Sheriff did little more than eat at the diner, hand Reacher a shotgun at one point, and sleep with Reacher. At one point he basically calls her a lousy investigator. I'd call both of them lousy investigators. The mystery, what little of it there is, practically solves itself for them.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The game is really good, and the graphics are one of the best in tablets. What I don't like is the grenade button, it's very close to the fire button. But besides that I recommend this  game  to everyone
B006SAR6P8|5.0|One of my favorites!  Classic Tarantino.  Can't go wrong.  I plan to order my own copy so I can stop renting it.
B00243FQFA|4.0|I love the Atlantis series. The quality of the DVDs were good except for some glitches in a couple of the episodes.
B005QBBC2S|5.0|I am not sure where it ranks exactly as I prefer not to rank my top 5, but it is among them.  To me it is an exceptionally acted, intense, and romantic movie.  In a word, it is a work of art.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandchildren really enjoy playing this game..they are really into action type games and my kindle comes in handy<br />.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very compelling.  Love the way the story unfolds.  Interesting from the beginning.  Really had me in knots with a satisfying conclusion.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I loved this app. Then one day I went to play it and all my progress was gone!! Fun though.
B0024DF9MU|4.0|I think all single women once a year should read the book or watch the movie to help keep them strong!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Wish I had read it years ago. It might have saved my marriage. Now I know for next time. Next
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I liked very much. Modern clock, beautiful. I liked it so much that I bought more than one.Thanks Invicta. Good work...
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great read! A bit of a slow start but it gets more and more interesting as you go. Hated to see it end.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Loving this series... what a twist on the fairy tales!  Can't wait for season 3 now! This is a welcome addition to our video library.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written, most interesting book.  The author's perspective on the roll of Jesus in the development of Christianity is thought provoking.
B006885EFE|5.0|This HBO mini-series of the men of Easy Company is a truly inspiring tale retold from the original book. I don't think I go 6 months without watching it.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I had previously seen the first movie, The Bourne Identity, and was pleasantly surprised by the other two. The story line was great as each sequel built on the previous movie. Its rare when sequels are as good as the original but they were as good in this case. Enjoy the movies.
B001XUPF2O|4.0|Fun, with unexpected attributes. Not the comic book hero, but exciting nonetheless.<br />We will now watch the sequel and see if it continues.
B001HBYHFA|2.0|When I heard that Joss Whedon was quitting Buffy to make a sci-fi movie, I didn't know Firefly (the series) was his.  This movie is the sequel to the one-season series, with the same cast.  Neither series nor this film depict anything of the sotto voce sociological genius we saw in Buffy.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />Cast is okay, but no chemistry; lapses in continuity, abound.  Series came out a few seasons after Farscape, and has something of the same beginning; except that instead of aliens, it's a human-populated universe.  Mandarin Chinese is spoken as routinely as English, so if you don't speak that language, you miss many of the asides.  Obviously someone was trying to make a point about this being the Asian century.  And as usual, Bible is maligned.  That, with the de rigeur sex and violence, bid for power and money, make the staple of both series and film.  Yawn.<br /><br />Else, you have an eclectic mix of old-time Western and modern sci-fi.  Oh: and the zombies are created by drugs the powers-that-be used to calm and dominate the populus.  That's about the extent of the innovation, in this otherwise trite story.<br /><br />Well, the western music in the series intro and ending, is good.<br /><br />Technically, the special effects and scenery are worth watching once.  Hence two stars.
1451688091|3.0|This book reads like a history book.  Good information but it needs to be in a more reader friendly formaqt.
B00BEU19ZU|4.0|The app provides an overview of the selected airport.  It does not have all the bells and whistles, but for the price provides value.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read the kite Runner and didn't think this would be as good but I couldn't put it down. A great story and a great writer. You are drawn into the story and live it. Very good.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|A feel good book that ends perfect and the way it should. Loved it! Loved the characters and loved the plot!
B00B19H2KU|5.0|I'm not going to go on an on here, but this was simply a great watch.  Very little CGI, creepy effects, and for anyone with children, your worst nightmare!<br /><br />The pace was a bit slow at times but that was a method used to up the creep factor.  For those that say it has the \\"Disney\\" factor, not all movies have to be gore fests to be great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to horror fans as well as those that don't like the blood and guts but like a bit of scare in their movie!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Each one that I've bought start's to have working issues in less than a month, @#$% Sony, @#$% them in there diarrhea smelly ass.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I wish I could chat with Austin Kleon a little bit each day.  Great words of wisdom for anyone artist or not!
0800141660|5.0|I love this movie! Time will tell if it lasts the number of times I will watch it, at least 20 so far.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|I have a really good internet connection but the movie was downloading really slow and it kept adjusting from regular to HD the whole time so I didn't actually watch the whole movie. I ended up going to Netflix and watch something else because I couldnt take Amazon connetion.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i love this gamee sooo much.. a new update came out so ill see but its better then temple run i really want funrun so i hope that comes out.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Super addicting and lots of fun to play. The best part is that it doesn't take long for the lives to fill up so you can get a little break but don't have to wait all day to have full lives again. Love it!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Great info! I have tried a lot of diets & read a lot about them but this one aCtually seems attainable. I can't wait to try it!
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|I've seen this movie several times.  Each time is always as good as the first.  It is not so much about the action though there is some.  It is the story line and the characters.  All can be loved in different ways and for different reasons.  It is interesting to look back and see how those in 1980 expected 2019 to be.
B005544TRQ|2.0|The premise is interesting - could have been interesting better said, but I don't like the characters or the acting.  The bad guy is too transparent and the good guy and his genius too unbelievable.  I watch the pilot and started the second show, but didn't feel like sticking with it.  I'll probably check in from time to time when I'm desperate for something short and mindless to watch.  If I change my mind, I'll adjust my review.
0345529057|4.0|These paperbacks aren't, necessarily. I've only read each book once and already there is a lot of wear and even tearing of the covers/spine. I am not hard on my books by any means! I do love this series though so I will most likely invest in hardbacks later down the road. Fantastic books, though the quality of these paperbacks aren't so hot.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Looks great!  It's a bit tough to figure out at first, but once you understand what's going on, it's a really good game.  Very tough trying to figure out the right strategy though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of this show! Watched all 3 seasons online and now have to wait all the way until Jan 4, 2014 to see what happens next. It's going to be a long four months...
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game.If you are looking for a great rpg this is the game for you you can pick cool classes battle other people online also fight with them I just can't put all the fun stuff in this it is just a really fun game that's all I have to say.IT'S GREAT
B0046H95PO|5.0|I love Agatha Christie and have since I was able to read - I discovered murder mysteries through her books.  She always writes a great &#34;who done it&#34;.  Good plot, great character development - they come alive in the story.  I have read every one of her books and have never been able to pick who did it!  Her stories are rich in imagination and colour.  This is one of my all time favourites.  It takes place on a train mainly in the dining and sleeping cars in the middle of a huge snow storm.  No one gets off the train and no one gets on - any and everyone could have done it.  It doesn't matter that this written a long time ago - it could have happened yesterday.  A great rainy afternoon read.  Highly recommend.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Okay entertainment if you just want to sit and click without having to think - but I sure wouldn't pay to play.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Recommended by family and so glad we read it! It's well written and makes us want to read more of his books!
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|Our granddaughter loves this game. She picks it to play every time she sees my kindle anywhere. We are getting ready to go on a trip and I finally downloaded the full version for her to have more to play with.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It is so true that opposites attract, that there is magic in being with someone who is different, and in being able to accept the differences.  It is inspiring for those who look for love.  It is good writing and good reading.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Eh what can I say, its a great story, and the books are loooooooong, which is good if your read a lot like I do! Can't wait for the 6th and 7th books.
B00AW57L96|5.0|This is another of Liane Moriarty's masterpieces.  It's a great read, interesting, entertaining and worthwhile.  Why do we keep secrets?  Is it better to find out when no one can ask you questions?  An interesting dilemma.
B00C2C637I|5.0|Loved this book.......Great plot, Great writing, different from what I expected....Something Wicked This Way Comes is now my<br />favorite book by Ray Bradbury......
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC has always been a good source of news because they are factual and represent a view from all sides, around the world, and not just what is going on inside the DC Beltway.
B00C2IN76C|5.0|Beautiful case, worth every penny. Now, I've just gotta find a buyer for my old copy!  This case does justice to the book's cover.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have thorougly enjoyed this series and with it being so inexpensive on Amazon, it was worth purchasing! I plan to buy season 3 next!
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I loved this book!! The passage ~ &#34; how we can't actually know anything about this forest...For you see, we create meaning, Dr. Drake, when really there is no meaning in nature...&#34; just spoke to me. Bravo!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is Addictive and strategic. I would definitely recommend others to download. i think its better than angry birds.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Good writing, interesting facts, well done all round! I learned so much about the life and times of Jesus,his brother James and the politicial influences affecting their message. I strongly suggest you read it.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This is a great case.  It stands up easy and you can put it in either direction.  I would really recommend this case.  Plus it was a decent price.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love these books so much and I am so sad there will not be any more to enjoy.  I loved the ending too, Sookie and Sam deserve it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I kept waiting to get to the good part and suddenly the book was over.  Took me 2 months to<br />finish it as it did not hold my interest.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|Best reviewed protection out there and no problems yet. Very easy to install and navigate through. I'm vary happy with Bitdefender.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|GRR is so engrossing. This was so good even though the ending was such a bad clifhanger. Can't wait for him to finish up the next two installments to quench my thirst. If you are a GRR fan you will enjoy this.
1452657661|4.0|I liked this book, I did but something about it was annoying.  I loved the beginning, learning about how a very young Piper seemed to lose her way.  Her initial time in jail was fascinating but then the book became bogged down with so much fellow inmate detail that I found myself losing interest.  I understand that it was necessary to fill enough pages with this information but it seemed disjointed.  I enjoyed the Red Sox references (being a fan myself) and agreed with her political stances on mandatory sentencing and the lack of rehabilitation programs in general.  The kindnesses that were extended to Piper were touching and the references to fellow inmates children visiting their mothers was heartbreaking.  I'm glad I purchased this in audio book...not sure if I would have completed the read had it been in book form.  Oh and by the way....I think Larry is a saint!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I do not want to give anything away but this was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. I read it in 5 hours.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got sucked into this series and truly enjoy the character descriptions and portrayal.  It is a fantastic series and am looking forward to season 4.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|Another great edition to anyone's DVD library. Tons of extras, documentaries, character cards and booklets make this a worthwhile purchase!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this series! True-to-life character flaws. social issues, and interpersonal relationships are dealt with in a most enjoyable fashion. I love the self discipline of that time...as in Miss Lane doing what is right not what she would like to do!<br /><br /> I really appreciated that when tea is served...there is hot liquid steaming from the cup...attention to details! All elements are there...staging, acting, direction, editing, filming, and character growth to make a family oriented series.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|Another great edition to anyone's DVD library. Tons of extras, documentaries, character cards and booklets make this a worthwhile purchase!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Never read the book or viewed any of the other Gatsby movies but am glad I watched this one.  Try it......you'll like it!
B003EYVY04|5.0|This is a great purchase but I'm sad to see that there's no extended edition of this film like the first two but don't let that stop you from purchasing (in my own opinion) the best Potter film.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Terrible with a capital T oh did u say terrible weak but the men did look good ok ok ok
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game. So addicting and so fun to be creative and explore! You have to try it and play with your kids.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Hamlet is my favorite Shakspy play.  I'm familiar with all the productions on video. The Gibson is surprisingly very good. This one is outstanding. It is completely unabridged. Moves along and some edge seating scenes. Some scenes with surprising performances by actors we don't associate with this. Remember it is complete so runs twice as long as what you may be used to.  It is worth it.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|This novel was a well-told story of courtroom drama and supernatural horror. The story surrounds a lawyer named Cheryl and what should have been a simple court case, a bankruptcy. When elements of the bankruptcy threaten to uncover a school's devious student loan practices, a corrupt court tries to put a halt to the lawsuit. What's been uncovered is more than it seems as drugs and supernatural events come upon Cheryl brought into her life by an old boyfriend named Travis. As she continues to peruse her case, more and more frightening events begin to occur. A scary and dramatic read.
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|HE looks like a good Conan, but I dont know if when i watch the original Conan with Arnold I was less picky. I wont go back to watch it though. the plot was really lame, and didn't get what power granted the mask.
B005I0DV4Y|5.0|The Whale Rider was a beautiful movie about a young girl by the name Pai looking for approval from her grandfather, Koro. Koro, the tribe leader, is a descendant of proud a Whangara chief. In this culture, the first born son becomes chief, prophet, and leader of group. The Whangara legend states their people come from Paikea, a brave man that rode to their from Hawaii on the back of a whale. Pai's father did not follow the same teachings. During childbirth, Pai's mother and twin brother were both lost. The loss took a toll on the family. Pai's father left the country for Germany and her grandfather was disappointed she was not a male and savior of their people. Over the years, Pai and her grandfather built a special relationship, but he still held on to the pain of not having a grandson.<br /> Koro built a school to teach the young boys, the ways of their ancestors in hopes of finding their new leader. Pai spent time trying to learn to old ways and continually looking for the approval of Koro.<br /> The film is a great representation of how people try to hold on to the culture of their ancestors while living in today's world. At Pai's school presentations, she showed the family and her ancestors respect with native dancing and chants. She even knew some of the language. Koro teaching the young men the fighting styles of the ancestors represented leadership, strength, courage, and intelligence. In his old age, Koro understood someone needed to understand the old ways and teachings of the ancestors to help bring the tribe out of struggle.<br /> The Whale Rider is an excellent example of a world religion most are not familiar with. The film is simple and beautiful representation of Whangara culture.<br />  .
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Better than the original, if you like action this movie is for you. I was very entertained. it had some great action.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Seriously though, this movie is good. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this movie is if you don't want to end up getting obsessed with Star Trek.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Love Milla! (be still thy beating heart! &#60;3)
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|im not going to tell anything thing that happens in the movie . it was very entertaing then all goes cheesy torwards the end . it did scare me a few times but didnt have gettiing girlfriend up to turn on lights for me to go pee
B000069HZP|5.0|Sometimes scary! Fairly well planned out! Comes with both full (gag-me!) and widescreen.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|the movie was great except it didnt finish off with the last battle like it should have which is the total rip off entirely film makers fault . baggin looks ugly as hel being old
6305428220|5.0|Caught it on cable - quite by accident. Couldn't find the clicker to change the channel and didn't feel like dealing with getting up. Lol! Then I had to buy it. All cable and dish companies seem to think it's okay to edit their viewing of all movies by making them fit on todays TVs - 16:9. The most common aspect ratios used today in the presentation of films in movie theaters are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. When they edit it to fit either 4:3 or 16:9 on a movie produced in 2.39:1 they cut off the left and right sides so that it fits the screen. That means your movie has been censored and you don't get to see what the maker of the flick wanted you to see.
B00005K3O0|5.0|This movie is such a great old movie and I think when it first came out, there really weren't alot of movies that dealt with the subject matter of reincarnation. Very well acted by Sir Anthony Hopkins, Marsha Mason and other main players...but especially the young girl who shows transitioning from herself to her reincarnated self. The ending is bittersweet yet satisfying given the circumstances. You gotta watch it! Very intense!
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Very fun and entertaining! Def recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie night in or something to get into.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Great information based on known history of the times which reveals many truths about how Christianity was born. I never realized the basic differences between Jesus the man and Christianity the religion.
B000GOSVEW|4.0|I really just wanted to figure out how to rate movies. I guess since I am here I will comment on this movie. This movie has a very good cast.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Liked it.  Weird but a great read.  It kept my attention and scares me to think that there are people out there getting ideas from this.
B001PSEEFI|4.0|I really just wanted to figure out how to rate movies. I guess since I am here I will comment on this movie. Not the best movie in the world but worth watching.
B008469DGY|5.0|KINDLE FIRE HD. Works like a champ. Touch screen works great. Can't put it down because it's so much fun.
B00821OW8K|3.0|We recently purchased Falling Skies after watching the first episode during Amazon Prime free period with the Kindle Fire.  I have enjoyed the show greatly.  It is a lot like Walking Dead, but instead of Zombies and a dead world, we have an alien invasion.<br />Sadly, we stream to our Wii device, and every 3-5 minutes is pauses to load for 15-30 seconds.  This DOES NOT HAPPEN with Netflix.  We can watch 20 episodes of whatever in a row without a single stop for buffering.  We most likely will not order another Amazon Video for streaming since all it does is buffer.<br />Guess I'll just have to stick with Netflix since it is faster and has no buffering times and the video quality is the same.

B00DL47RQ2|4.0|All 45+ movies directed by Woody Allen start identically, first, with the black screen for few moments, and then white-on-black credits, placed with the perfect symmetry in the Windsor typeface, and set to jazz music. The empty black screen in the beginning is like Malevich's black square that can content anything behind it. Watching it for few seconds before the movie starts is for the Allen's fan the sweetest moment of anticipation the new work from the favorite filmmaker. Where will he take us this time? Following the fallen celestial being named Jasmine from the Mt. Olympus on Manhattan to the lowland of San Francisco Bay area, Woody Allen and Cate Blanchett have created the special treat for the movie lovers.<br /><br />I don't know what took Woody Allen and Cate Blanchett so long but finally the match that was meant to be blessed by the movie gods took place and produced one of the strongest ever Woody Allen's dramatic films with what could be the best single performance in his movie, and that tells a lot.<br /><br />Woody Allen and Cate Blanchet use the familiar setting of the great classical American play by Tennessee Williams \\"The street car named desire\\" but re-invented it by moving plot to the modern days of the post 2008 financial crisis and the collapse of the largest Ponzi scheme in the history of the USA. The film takes place in San Francisco and in flashbacks goes to the posh Manhattan apartment, trendy restaurants, five stars hotels, and Hamptons summer house where Blanchett's character, Jasmine Francis used to lead the life of the elegant socialite, the wife of the Wall Street financial wizard, Hal (Alec Baldwin effortlessly effective as a smooth-talking charming silver-tongued rascal who made his fortune by ruining millions of people with his ruthless machinations). \\"Blue Jasmine\\" is announced as a comedy but it is a very dark comedy or rather tragicomedy and it concerns two very different sisters, Jasmine (Blanchett) and Ginger (Sally Hawkins. Both adapted as the babies, Jasmine (one with the good genes) was determined, beautiful, smart, went to college, found a very rich husband and moved to the higher social step. Kind and simple Ginger had a construction worker husband, two children, a menial job, and one chance to make a better life for her family when she and her husband Augie won a lottery and made the trip to New York City to celebrate with Jasmine and Hal and to ask Hal about the best investment of 200K lottery money. Needless to say that after having invested in one of the Hal's schemes, Ginger and Augie never saw a penny of their money. Andrew Dice Clay, famous as a stand-up comedian, gave a moving performance as Augie which is not surprising at all. Looks like simply being in Allen's movie brings forward everything an actor is capable of. Blue Jasmine is not exception, and every actor gives memorable performance even in the small roles. Sally Hawkins as Ginger is admirable. Ginger's live has never been easy or glamorous but she accepts whatever good it has to offer, she does not expect much and she is able to keep her sanity, reason, and good spirits which can't be said about Jasmine.<br /><br />When Jasmine's life collapses along with the fall of her husband's financial empire, she loses everything including her grip to reality and is forced to turn to very person she never thought of while being on top of the world, her sister Ginger. Moving from NYC to SF, staying with her sister in a small \\"homey\\" apartment and trying to do something with herself, to move on with her life, to make sense of it, Jasmine in Blanchett's performance is a complex multifaceted and hard to forget person. She is selfish, delusional, weak, depressed, classy, charming, scared, confused, and feverish. She is visibly suffocating living the life she knows nothing about and she does not want to know about. She is ashamed of herself, of what she became, of how low she has fallen, while she believes that she is entitled to the finest things in life. There is obvious guilt she carries with her. She is truly a fish out of water. She tries to adjust to the real world but she has no skills for survival in it on her own. With one gesture, one look, one change of facial expression, Blanchet takes Jasmine from hopes to turmoil to despair, from glitz and glamour of the recent past to the uncertainty and fear of present, and watching her impetuous sudden transformations is heartbreaking. I've been Cate Blanchett's fan for many years and I treasure every role I've seen her in but in Woody Allen's \\"Blue Jasmine\\" she is more than superb or excellent. She is beyond any superlatives. There is no single false note in her performance. I did not want to feel sorry or sympathize with Jasmine. Comparing to Blanche Dubois with whom a lot of critics and viewers identify her, Jasmine was guilty of at least an act of deliberate cruelty which is unforgivable, and she knew it. But, differently from Blanche, by the time the movie starts, Jasmine is not on the verge but beyond a nervous breakdown and watching her trying to deal with it, helping herself with vodka martinis and Xanax while having delusions of superiority and fading hope of somehow be able to move on, to pull herself through, and bursting in the sudden agitated talking to herself on the streets, on the park benches, on the plain sit, makes a viewer to feel for her against their best instincts. You simply can't take your eyes off her for a second. This is a master class in acting, authenticity, and humanity by Cate Blanchett, the most talented actor (of both genders) of her generation in the best serious film by Woody Allen.<br /><br />\\"Blue Jasmine\\" is a beautiful movie to look at. San Francisco and NYC, two cities-antipodes look marvelous under the Javier Aguirresarobe's camera but the best visual treats come from seamless flashbacks that added so much to the story of paradise (with plenty of snakes lurking ) lost. Whatever flaws the film might have, like using some characters or their convenient appearances in the right time in the right places as merely plot devices, don't matter much in presence of greatness whose name is Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />But let's imagine for a second that the movie was as much about one woman's loss of her fairy tale life and about class differences in the modern society as it was about some of Woody Allen's own life experiences: his memory of being in the eye of public disgrace and scandal, his own son's refusal to have anything to do with his father, and his perception of the greatest disaster of all - being shut off from the only thing in life that matters to him, which is making movies. In that case, Allen's gave the face to his own nightmares, disasters, and regrets, and that is Jasmine's face in the final scene of his latest, dark and great film.<br /><br />4.5/5 or 9/10e finest things in life. There is obvious guilt she carries with her. She is truly a fish out of water. She tries to adjust to the real world but she has no skills for survival in it on her own.

0525478817|4.0|It's a good book. If you want a book that will make you fall in love with the characters and then rip your heart out by putting those characters through hell, The Fault in Our Stars is perfect for you. Yes, the characters are your typical unrealistic, hyper-verbose John Green Teenagers, but sometimes it's nice to read an eloquent and elegant book to escape from a terse and inelegant world. It's a quick read, it has as many laughs as tear-jerkers, and it's definitely worth your time.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Forever Girl has an interesting twist on the paranormal romance theme. A Wiccan of some talent, Sophia can cast spells but they often backfire an go wrong, causing an annoying static to become voices in her head and bring forth unwanted spirits. Through this she is trying to find out about her families history. She meets a man who may be able to answer her questions, but getting involved with him brings its own dangers, especially from the political body responsible for immortal creatures. This was an interesting read that has a little romance, humor and horror.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved the author's book, \\"Bird by Bird,\\" so was excited when I saw several readers on Facebook mentioning this book. I read through a few of the negative reviews (only after I read the book) and I honestly don't get where they could say the book wasn't researched well or that the actual orphan train isn't a big part of the book when that's what ties the characters together through eighty years. You can see all the research she did in the acknowledgments and it's obvious in the writing.<br /><br />The title also pertains to the 17 year old foster kid, Molly, in present day, who has been on an orphan train of her own sorts - being shipped from foster home to foster home experiencing a similar heartbreak to the 91 year old protagonist, Vivian.<br /><br />I favored Vivian's story (beginning in 1929) mostly because I was fascinated (devastated) that more than 200,000 kids were really shipped to the Midwest from the East Coast - and many of them immigrants. However, it's the coming together of these characters in present day and how the two help each other in unexpected ways that was the final big tearjerker for me.<br /><br />The author is a talented writer with a keen sense of place and character development. The book will stay with me forever.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a fun flick, with some top-quality actors. It's a pleasure to watch Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis act together in this movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is part of the fun.

B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Maybe it's just me ... so discount my opinion appropriately.  I think that as well done as the effects, CGI, and production are, the plot of this movie is confusing and difficult to follow.  I need to re-watch a few times to &#34;get it.&#34;  Still would recommend to the sci-fi lovers.  Fun and action packed ... but hard to follow.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A good book for all young adults and older to read. Very well done! History through the eyes of a young girl in Nazi Germany.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I didn't expect to like the series, but after the first episode I was hooked.  I'm still amazed at how well the actress played the different characters - even though I knew they were played by the same character, I didn't once feel like they were.  My only complaint is that this is supposed to take place in New York, but they didn't bother to obscure the Canadian license plates on the vehicles or put fake ones on while filming.  Plus the locale, although urban, didn't feel like New York - though I may have been tainted after noticing the license plates.<br /><br />Still, as someone who's suffered through Dr. Who and still enjoyed it, I'm willing to overlook the license plates.  I just pretend every time they say 'New York', they really said 'Toronto'.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I read this book in two sittings.  At 90 pages, this is the most succinct and practical book I've read on building trust and rapport quickly.  The book is focused on things you can do immediately to strike up open conversations and avoid those awkward interactions (the ones that you and your interlocutor can't wait to end...).<br /><br />I recognised many of the ideas from social psychology research published elsewhere, such as Richard Cialdini's classic, &#34;Influence&#34;.  Also present were some suggestions I'd seen in the The Charisma Myth (also a good book).  The former book is about a broad range of research on social/psychological traits, while the latter is about crafting and projecting a persona (power, integrity, warmth, etc.).<br /><br />This book is not about projecting oneself, or about research.  This book excels as a concise HOW-TO guide on applying those ideas towards getting important, truthful conversations started and then keeping them going.  It's definitely written from the perspective of an intelligence operative, which differentiates this title in a sea of books written by business &#34;leaders&#34; and social scientists.  It's practical and based on what the author has seen work &#34;in the field&#34;.  It's also broadly applicable to any kind of conversation (family, business, research, intelligence, etc) and the author does a good job of including a range of examples and exercises to demonstrate that.<br /><br />If your conversations are important, and/or you need to make sure they're productive, and/or you need to engage in discussions with lots of different people and aren't sure how to begin, this is an excellent place to start.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Totally into this book.  Thank you Colleen Hoover.  I don't have the words in my mind to give my appreciation for the opportunity to read this wonderful book.  Again, thank you.
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|I watched this move with the sound off because the acting was horrible. At times I was in awe at how bad a movie it was and wonder if it would get any better. NOOOOOO..... I'm a fan of Jason Moma and only finished the movie because of him. BTW he had the worst acting in the movie. Watch the original its way better in a cheesy 80's way which makes it great!

Love it! First you have some nice tunes - arrangements and then there is Scaggs' unique voice. In my current rotation for work travel music at this time. Besides you can't beat the price! Nice!

B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I have several note apps, but this is the one I use the most. Everything is organized into notebooks and you even have a place to keep notebooks that you want password protected. I got it as the free app of the day, but would have paid for it. There are so many things you can do with it, it lets you share with Evernote and your Dropbox account so you don't lose your info. I would like to be able to just swipe left or right to the next or previous pages within a notebook instead of the little arrow at the bottom, like reading a book in my kindle. Other than that everything it features is wonderful.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have wait and watch - what additional features that google will put into chromecast device? I did try using my windows laptop. It did work fine. I tried to connect Chromecast using Windows phone - not supported. This is similar to airplay from Apple. Good device by Google. Need seamless communication with various devices (non-android based).
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book was such an easy and fast read - I couldn't put it down!  So full of teenage angst and heart-swelling love.  If I was 15 and reading this I think it would have been the BEST BOOK EVER.  The older me was a bit too practical to truly believe some of the character development.  Glad to have read it but not sure I would pick it up again.

B00DJYJQ36|5.0|This is a theatrical review.<br /><br />This beautifully crafted film follows the earlier \\"Before Sunrise\\" (1995) and \\"Before Sunset\\" (2004) and like the second film in the series, 9 years have passed.  After a brief marriage and one child, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has married Celine (Julie Delpy), the original lovers who met briefly nearly 2 decades earlier.  They have twin girls about 6 and are vacationing in Greece, houseguests of a well-known writer.<br /><br />Jesse's earlier book about his brief romance with Celine has made him famous.  They now live in Paris which is problematic for Jesse because he rarely sees his teenage son who lives in America.  One of the persistently enjoyable aspects of this film and its predecessors is the wonderful writing.  As usual, the film is written by director Richard Linklater, Delpy and Hawke.  And as usual it all flows so naturally, you feel as if you are eavesdropping.<br /><br />Now married, we feel the couple maneuver through numerous landmines including career paths, domicile, child rearing, and finances as most couples do.  There are some uncomfortable moments to be sure, for the actors and the audience.  In one scene, they have an argument just before making love.  As the argument escalates, it continues for several minutes standing up, all while Celine remains bare chested.  This film is so well directed, written and acted it is hard to find fault, so I won't.  I don't know if this is the end of Jesse and Celine on film but I hope I'm around in 9 year to find out.

B000VD5I94|5.0|This is hands down one of my favorite cop movies of all time. The story is very political, the violence is HARD-R and ROBOCOP kicks a lot of a##!!! Original, violent, action-packed, and full of messages regarding our political system! A must see for action hero film buffs!
0316227706|5.0|I asked my husband if he wanted this because the few pictures I showed him had him in tears.  He responded, &#34;I don't need it, but my life will be richer for it.&#34;  After it arrived and he looked through it, his face was red and he was crying from laughing so hard.

B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I received my Pulse a couple of weeks ago and it was great when it was working. Don't get me wrong, the product helps you to gain awareness of your activities and how that impacts your health. Unfortunately the syncing function stopped working 3 days ago. I have contacted the manufacturer reporting the problem (and I have not yet heard back from them). I also read in the discussions forums that other people are having the same issue. I have followed the troubleshooting instructions provided by the manufacturer several times to no success. I am a Withings customer, I also own a WS-50 scale and the blood pressure monitor - they work great. I have decided to return my Pulse to Amazon and have asked for a replacement. I hope they figure out what the issue is... it would be a pity if such great product fails to deliver.

B00DYXKJII|1.0|I went diving with this filter in Tonga and after my first use of it, I found that the macro filter has no sort of mechanism to make sure it stays out of the way when I am trying to make wide angle shots. So on my next dive I completed took off the macro filter and just used the red filter. Well by the time I was at 7 meters the whole picture turned YELLOW!!! I emailed polar pro for an explanation but got no reply. So since I was stuck with this filter (which only works well between 3-7 meters I decided to only use it while free diving. Only problem is that after my 4th use of it the lens started to pop out of the frame and their must have been some issue with the glue! I am reporting this issue with the BBB once I return home and also have contacted my amazon and and my lawyer to make sure more are not defrauded like me. There acrylics filters were GREAT!!! Why did they not just stick with that?

B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book.  Would read another book by this author.  Fast, easy read.  Could not put it down.  Great plot twists---always made you feel like you were being let in on a friend's &#34;little dirty secret.&#34;  Great!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This film delivers on content, action, and story.  The story keeps a decent pace that doesn't leave the audience bored.  It chronicles actual events and fleshes out details fictitious or not.  If the movie feels long, that's because it is supposed to since it takes you from 9/11 all the way to the raid in Abbottabad.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Weaves together the victorian style of communicating with flowers and the ability of the human heart to heal.  Could not put it down.  One of my favorite books of all time.  I highly recommend it---for someone who loves gardening---or just loves a great story about a family coming together!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Joss Whedon's directing is superb, and the story gives just enough depth for each character to fill out without getting too caught up in backstory.  It's fun, fast-paced, and exciting!
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This movie was very interesting. Kept me guessing til the end. Would definitely watch again and again! Very good movie.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|One thing I like about this book is it didn't go into a multi-paragraph description on what kind of training the SEALS go through. I've read that stuff before and although it is truly interesting, I don't need to read it again. In my opinion, the book was well written in that even though you know how it ends, the author keeps you wanting more. No, it won't win any literary awards, but just to know how it really went down is enough.
B0002DKCMQ|4.0|I saw the rated version on HBO, and recorded it.  This movie has been adequately reviewed by others so I'll just say that it's a good one.  However, as far at the unrated version goes, I feel it is not as good as the theatrical version.  As far as I can see, about the only difference is an early scene where the girl's top is removed before the horny male character enters the hot tub.  That's fine, but it just doesn't work as well as the scene in the theatrical version.  In other words, if it didn't cost the same, unrated versions would generally be a rip off consisting of extra F-words and little else.  The special features a variable, but some are great, so check them out.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I've loved this book since before it was a book, and only a blog post.  It's fantastic, and so helpful for someone like me, who loves all things art but doesn't really know what to do with that.  Thanks, Austin :)

Very good movie from the inside out about how stripping is done; the pressure from the inside and pressure from the outside of people who don't really understand. Makes you stop and think twice about how to earn your living.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|Although this movie was a CGI fest lacked plot and character depth. I LOVE IT. Why? Because it is Spawn and the only real-life movie ever created based off the character. Was Clown (Violator) over the top YES! Was Martin Sheen bad YES! Michael Jai White emotionless YES! But hey its great fun and for a $5 blu-ray not too bad.
B00DFBVKCS|5.0|Just a word of thanks to Vince and Paul for a great country music album. If you wonder (Like I do) does anybody make any REAL country music anymore, take listen to this instant classic.<br />I have a universal theory about what killed country music:  Pop music died. Nature abhors a vacuum and country music filled the void left by the death of pop music.  The only problem is that it’s fairly good pop but, we now have awful country music. Maybe we can breathe some life into country with more records like this. Here's hope.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you havent followed the serial, start from season 1.  The seasons are stand alone, but to get the full effect and understanding of season 3 you need to see 1 and 2 first!
B002O1Z4H2|5.0|I thought the movie was very good. Good action and suspense, with a little comic relief as well. Can't wait to see the latest riddick movie!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This song is upbeat and contagious, making it great to listen to while getting ready for any time of day.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Every dad should watch this- and every family should watch it with him if possible. The world could be a better place then.
B00006674X|5.0|I'm an Elvis fan but I don't necessarily think all of his movies are great but I do really love this one. I don't know that Elvis and Mary Tyler Moore are the best match - the chemistry doesn't seem to really be there - but Elvis is really good in this movie and it has an important message to it. Plus Elvis rocks with Rubberneckin and a wonderful gospel song at the end - Let Us Pray. Nobody rocks a gospel song like Elvis!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Exciting!! Loved every minute.Great combination of Humour and action and drama. The special effects were seamless.And great job of casting.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Like a lot of my friends I wanted to kill the main characters, the writer, and the less than average intelligent person who raved about this book, yet this was probably the only book they picked up as an adult. Poorly written, and not believable in any way
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Best book ever! When it comes to romance Keira Cass is an amazing author and u should read every book in the selection series. I LOVED the fist book so much I finished in a day
B005OKTPKC|3.0|Subject matter interesting, characters and story not quite believable. A lot of time spent on characters you would prefer not to spend time with, and not enough on the positive.
B0025X4P24|2.0|did not like any of the songs, no upbeat songs very low keyed music from the 60's...Disappointed and would not recommend
B0054W4JQK|1.0|The concept is very good, and in the hands of a good writer I think this could have been a great book. I read this for book club, and that is the ony reason I finished it, to socialise with a great bunch of girls.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|I liked the first G.I. Joe better. I don't think this is a movie that we will be watching again.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|Thank you for beung so open about your career, what you have learned, and how we as woman can lean in and succeed in the game that is business. Sheryl tells very good stories, that you easily relate to, and doesn't apologise for the mistakes of the past, just demonstrates how they can guide you in the future. I have already joined a Lean in group of amazing woman in my home city, Perth western australia
B005HIREJK|5.0|Before I ordered this watch, I read all of the reviews. I am a collector of fine vintage watches (which I do not wear, they are on display). I also have a Seiko divers watch that I have had for many years, and it has been a great watch. I needed another good quality, dependable everyday watch. So I bought this model and I am extremely satisfied.<br /><br />Some thoughts on the various reviews:<br /><br />Regarding the reviews of the strap...i agree the strap was very stiff/hard. after about a week it seemed much more comfortable. I agree that it doesn't match the quality of the watch.<br /><br />Regarding &#34;Do Not Fall For The Photos&#34;...come on, you've got to be kidding me! This person must be part of the Yelp generation (whiners). The pictures of the watch on my monitor (24&#34;) were approximately 4 inches. I didn't expect the watch to be 4 inches in diameter. The description was crystal clear (get it?). it's clearly stated the case diameter is 40 millimeters. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to take a ruler (most have metric increments on them), lay it across another watch and get an idea of the size. that is exactly what i did, and i am not disappointed with its size.<br /><br />all things considered, i believe it is a good quality watch at a very good price. shipping was fast and it was packed very well. i would recommend this watch!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My little girl watches this movie over and over!!  I am very happy with this purchase. Not sure the older boys are so happy lol
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. It works very well. I have no complaints about it. The price is right too!! ;-)
B0027V6AL8|5.0|I wish I could rate this movie a 10 out of 5, but Amazon won't allow it. One of the best movies in existence, and it's not even close.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|You get to build the tree of life. Now that is kewl. I liked it. Good graphics. However when I got to the last two construction sites I was able to play the first two out of ten for one site then it wouldn't let me play. Being that I had enough materials I was able to finish building the tree of life without playing the last two sites.  That was in adventure mode.<br /><br />In tournament mode it's interesting. Your on a time mode . You have to knock out the color tiles and chained tiles. If there is no consistency in the screen play your energy goes down.  The only downfall with this one is that if you're on level seven and run out of energy you have to start all over from level one.<br /><br />The last one free play, is just that playing and killing time. This is good for the kids. They don't get aggravated and ask you for help...lol.
B0013GLE4Q|5.0|Under My Skin, being her second album, you can really see how she grew as an artist and how she began to expand her writing, wile maintaining her original style.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Simply amazing. I freaking love this game!! I recommend it totally to anyone looking for rgp!! Get this now!<br />The only con is that is repetitive a little but it's still addicting!!!!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|After hearing the first single &#34;Radioactive&#34; I liked the song and was curious to see what else Imagine Dragons would provide for us. Tiptoe is an amazing song and the rest of the album is just as good.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I have viewed this film some three times.  Everytime I see it, I get a more and more meaning!  The closest literary meaning is cross a between two stories both of which are different in the length of the narrative:  \\"The Lady or The Tiger\\" and \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\"  There is so much symbolism to this film/novel, that I think it could take a lifetime of study, to even begin to fully understand this wonderful work, if at all!  LIFE'S MEANING CAN ASSUME A MYRAID AND ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNTS OF DEFINITION!  NJMJr!
B000A2WNB2|4.0|I could not get this anywhere but here. The only problem is that you can't play it on an American made DVD player! I can however play it on my laptop.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|i just recieved my knife this morning and its incredibly sharp, I litterally shaved with it. i was slightly disapointed when i tested its tip and stabbed a 2x4.the tip dulled dramatically from what it had been, but its not bad and im still very impressed. when this weekend comes around itl be time to start testing it.<br /><br />Thank you for all your reviews everyone, you all helped me make my decision in buying this knife and im sure il be very pleased with its quality and durability.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really can't say enough about the Hunger Games trilogy.  This is the second in the trilogy of the Hunger Games.  Please if you read this series, read them in order:  Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mockingjay.  I don't think anybody will be disappointed.  I really hated to finish the series because I didn't want the story to come to an end.  Enjoy!
B008ALA6DW|3.0|The connection is fine and it's definitely better than not having internet at all in my dorm room. But it comes out a lot if you're not closely monitoring it. Very easy to drop a skype call or stop the middle of a video.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it & would recommend it not matter what age your are.  This is the last in the Hunger Games trilogy and it ended like I hoped it would, but I hated that it ended, I so enjoyed reading it.l
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is so much fun and I cant get enough I have no complaints whatsoever. you guys did a fantastic job putting this game together I apriciate it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me start out by saying, when I read this book I had no idea what this book was about.  Guess I had my head in the sand!  Anyway I overheard some young people talking about how good it was.  I understand there is a movie, which I have never seen either.  I have read the whole trilogy: Hunger Games, Catching Fire & Mockingjay.  I do not want to say too much because I don't want to give anything away, but I loved, loved this series.  Soon after I started reading the first book, I realized these were probably written for people in their teens & 20's.  I absolutely could not put any of these books down.  I was obsessed until I finished the last book (Mockingjay).  I highly recommend this series for any age group.  Yes, there is violence, but I would say it's rather like in the movie Avatar, a fantasy.  All that being said I am 76 years old and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series, but you must read the series, in order.  I hated to finish the series!
6305907145|4.0|Searchers:  love John Wayne but didn't like the violence<br />Mansfield Park:  love Jane Austen's works but didn't like the sex scene.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|K. Hosseini has a beautiful ability to draw his reader in so deeply to the story that you feel as if you are not just reading his story you are a part of his story.  The characters are so real I will keep them in my thoughts for many months to come. Starting with a sad loss of a parent that leads to choosing to separate a sister and her brother in order to offer a better life to one child sets this story in motion and forms the future for generation's that followed.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|awesome game it is really fun it can be really challenging sometimes although it can get boring when you play it for a long time
B0058VW36U|5.0|He said it is challenging and fun.  He said it is also non stop action and he won't ride in the car without his tablet!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a good game with an interesting story line. Some of these kind of games can be pretty childish, but this one had a deep enough story to keep me interested. The graphics are quite disturbing at times,so I would not really recommend this to pre teens
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I actually love this game! Is highly addictive and is so fun especially with the hunts for different things am so glad I got this :D
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|there needed to be more background given for those who don't read comics. the action scenes were good and there was a lot of humor
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|World War II Holocaust movie that is revealing in the ways of human dignity. Sad, uplifting, introspective, merciful, movie. Definitely worth viewing.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|for action flick again just a flick and not a movie.  Acting if that what you can call it was at a underpar, however tons of violence
B0034GK7DM|5.0|Fantastic job, by a fantastic singer, with a fantastic band. I have nothing bad to say about this cd or anything that Mr. Corbin does, because he is that good. Neither of his cds disappointed.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you are not watching this show, you ate missing out on some of the greatest television ever! Seriously it's all that you could ever want in a great program.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It's Scribblenauts! It's sadly, not the same as the PC version. Lots of filtered things now. Still fun though. :) Minor issues on SGT2-7.0 (block window appears sometimes blocking text), other than that, it works and is awesome. add all the memes back and it'd get 5 stars!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is entertaining and the plot is always interesting and engrossing.  I always hate to see the episode end.  Each character is great in their own right so when they switch focus on characters I'm annoyed but then I get involved in that character and their plights and it pulls me in every time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Easy to play, great for road trips!!! Keeps me entertained on my free time and since I am TV free  I have lots of time!!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Better than expected after reading the book.  I would recommend this title to those who have read the book.  Looking forward to the next movie.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Like brandy, Buddy Guy gets better and better with time. Excellent album, with great collaborators like Steve Tyler, Kid Rock and especially one of the greatest female singers - Beth Hart! Don't miss this incredible masterpiece of blues! Just buy it and you won't regret!
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Too hard for a young child to know what to do. Frustrating to try to teach child what to do ,when I didn't even even know what  to do.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Just a wonderful mix of different Mahjong game shapes. The story is a minor part of the game for me but it does add a bit of a different flavor. Great Mahjong games. Give it a whirl worth the money but nice it was free.
B005Y8KWNS|3.0|I've only used it once and only for work. It's okay once I figured out how to work it. That's the only complaint is that it doesn't come with a good explanation of the buttons.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|A good game with, gee I can't see that far into the future, levels. A typical matching game with various special effect gems to make it interesting. It would be nice if there were some instructions on what the different effects were and how to get them. As is, it's trial and error. Does make it interesting though.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have cognitive impairment from a brain injury and wanted a game to help increase memory and logical thinking. If you have played games like this, this one may seem relatively simple, but this was my first time and it really made me think ahead and use my memory. I was thoroughly entertained and look forward to getting to the higher levels. One con: wish it would offer the option of a hint to keep you going.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is amazing ! And guess what people,I got it for the free app of the day!!! You can do AMAZING things with this game. If I had to choose another on it would be animal hair salon... I can't really remember the name. But this is a lot better and u have 6 people to use without paying for anything!!!!actually .... you don't have to pay for anything !!!!!!! It is amazing I totally recommend this app. I have so much to say !LOL I have so much to say cause like I said best hair game ever if you are reading this ,everything I say on here is facts!!!! I am telling you . You have to get this app!!!!! !!!!! : )
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is a fresh take on solitaire.  Frustrating to try line up putts, but so entertaining!  I love it as much as Bubble Birds 3!!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill's voice, basic instrumental arrangements, great old songs:  PRICELESS!  This is a tribute to simpler, singer-emphasized music.  Nice change from the current emphasis on &#34;arena-style&#34; music; much more enjoyable to hear lyrics and the interpretation by Vince Gill and Paul Franklin.
B000FC10QG|5.0|This book takes a potentially mundane subject (mergers and acquisitions) and brings it to life in a thrilling, fast paced book that would be entertaining even if it wasn't packed with great business anecdotes. I bought this book because I'm an investor who wanted to get to know more about activist investing and mergers. Barbarians at the Gate did not disappoint. The book is pretty long, but you have no idea because it's that entertaining. The real-life characters of this book are numerous and the authors do a great job of putting you in their heads as the action unfolds. The sequence of events is terrific and you can feel the highs and lows that the characters experienced.<br /><br />The book also does a great job of teaching the subject of activist investing and mergers through the telling of the story. All in all, a terrific read that was not only entertaining but extremely informative.
B001NYVY8O|3.0|Most people slam Limp Bizkit as a rap metal band cusses way too much and they have no talent.They do cuss a lot,but that's not what music is about.Chocolate Starfish and the hot dog flavored water is just as hard rocking as significant other.Limp Bizkit is the only kind  of rap I like.Fred Durst really is creative.The song titles aren't,but Fred Durst really expresses his anger,sadness,and pain that life has brought him.The guitars are always catchy and pretty well played.If you liked Significant other,this album is basically part 2 of that album.Limp Bizkit is a cool rap rock band that most people are very critical of.Now,they do cuss a lot,but they are the best rap rock band ive ever heard in my life.Limp Bizkit also mixes with a mixer and it gives them a very unique sound that is alternative,rap,rock,and metal.Now,thats pretty cool in my book.This album is just as fun and catchy as Significant Other.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|A lot of action but the sound goes up and down.  Could use more background history at the start or film.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Kindle has a rather messy, non-intuitive file system--not the fault of ESFE, but rather the reason you need it.  This helps to find files to activate or delete them.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I was skeptical about whether or not I would like the show, but was pleasantly surprised.  Glad I watched it!
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Plan to watch this in a well-darkened room, and be prepared for lots of heavily costumed actors engaging in plenty of histrionics.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Really enjoying this adventure game.  Fun and challenging game.  A lot of twist and turns to the game.  Also a lot of hidden object games.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works well, can be easily customized to open centered on a particular location.  It agrees well with other radars on the Internet and TV, and can be easily zoomed and offset.  Some capability to rerun the last couple of hours, to see what direction storms are moving.  Future prediction is pretty useless, but that may just be a characteristic of New Mexico weather, which is notoriously fickle.
B006M7JCC2|2.0|First of all I must say that I was very interested in reading this book because I had seen an interview with Anita Moojani that really impressed me, and I wanted to find out more.<br /><br />The book lacked substance for me as I am not a Hay House disciple. I have read books published by Hay House that I've found way more interesting. I have no particular religious belief and read up on everything, as I find at the end of the day their are nuggets of wisdom in all perspectives. But half-way through this book, I was skimming through the rest for some nugget of wisdom that had not already been repeated dozens of time already in the first half.<br /><br />It was utterly boring, repetitive, and without any substance.<br /><br />My take-away from this book was that to really feel grounded in this earthly existence one must do exactly as you want... without feeling guilty about it, because then you have realized your purpose. Trying to do otherwise is what makes you miserable, and as in Anita's case, makes you sick almost to death.<br /><br />Her NDE was her epiphany. She needed to live her life without guilt. That was her purpose, the reason why she made the choice for life. For real? I couldnt help but think ... Wow, she needed to 'almost die' in order to grow up. It appeared she suffered from a conflict between Western values and Eastern culture, which she explained quite nicely. It made her guilty, so she got sick, almost died, during her NDE she had an epiphany that she did not have to feel guilty and should go back and live her life guilt free. Her purpose was to go back and tell the world this - it's all about the Bob Marley one love thing, the world of Aquarius, peace and love, not being afraid to realize your potential despite what your culture believes.<br /><br />As described in the book, she came from a very loving family. A perfect one as a matter of fact. Priviledged background; parents loved and supported her in all that she did; an adoring older brother; and a most devoted husband that she, culture forbid, chose herself. Kind of like the perfect fairy tale. But that evil witch of the West in that Western culture that did not fully accept her as one of their own in the elite Western school that she attended made her feel so bad about herself, and then later that evil witch of the East that made her feel worse because she chose her own husband. Poor thing, the guilt of it all almost killed her.<br /><br />That was the yarn, over and over and over again. It almost killed me with boredom.<br /><br />Unless you are an Hay House disciple strongly devoted to this sort of experience, you are wasting your time reading this book. Just go out and do whatever else you were meaning to do but didn't because you thought you might feel guilty about it. You would have then fulfilled your purpose in life.<br /><br />The interview was great, but the book boring in its repetition.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|Very funny And, even though there are some pictures And memes known from the internet, quite a few are new.<br /><br />The book, in general, is very good, written entirely in grumpy sense of humor, always manages to put a smile on my Face!<br /><br />Looking forward to Get the calendar as well! :)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best stories, I have read in a, very long time.  A father desperately trying to keep his family together, whole at all costs.  In the end ?!
1781162646|4.0|The murder mystery was somewhat secondary to me...I much enjoyed reading about Devon's summer of turning from a boy into a man.<br /><br />SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />I've got only one question...at the end of the book, Devon states that Fred Dean came to visit him and it wasn't about Lane although he thought it was.  What did this line mean?
B0034G4P94|5.0|I have to say I don't review many movies I see, and with Prime I watch a ton. But this movie had me engrossed from the beginning with its powerful performances and emotional acting. The excitement of the MMA fights was a terrific manifestation of the conflict running throughout the story and I was drawn in. I loved this movie and wish I'd seen it sooner!
B007PVHMCG|2.0|I sent this to my two grandchildren who love Minecraft expecting this to be a much favored toy based on other reviews.  The legos are just simply colored green and brown.  There is no special effects are pieces that mimic the experience the kids have when they play this game online.  They do enjoy legos, but from the description others provided, I really thought that the product would provide a hands-on experience of minecraft.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This book keeps you guessing until the very end as to what will happen to the invalid.  I loved the gradual coming-togther of the young, naive girl and the cynical, angry man whose life had been so cruelly affected.  It's a book that will make you think of the helplessness of a wheel-chair bound patient and all the well-meaning, but sometimes ill-advised carers around them.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Great fun to start with. I am at level 18 and a bit tired of buying pearls to make the reef grow. Some. Of the corals and plants take 6 to 10 pearls to finish.  You very rarely get pearls in the treasure chest and it may cost 6 pearls to open the chest and you may get more algae.  Also in order to get to level 19 you have to tap and tap on the algae and sand dollars a million times to get enough starfish to move on. That is very boring and you finally just stop game.  Where does the characters go until next level?  I will continue to play the game for a while longer because I feel like I have created a beautiful picture of gorgeous colors but game needs a lot of improvements to keep my interest to the end .  I agree with others about costing so much to purchase pearls.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|So far this has been pretty fun. This is one of the best drawing apps I have found. I wish they would add coloring pages.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Stills, Goldberg and Kenny Wayne, I felt that it would be magic but believe me I was floored at the interplay between the old and young guns. Goldberg and Stills kept setting them up and Kenny kept knocking them down.<br /><br />On this enjoyable debut, they throw down eight shades of the blues, with a sprinkling of a Neil Young classic, \\"Rocking in the Free World\\", Iggy Pop and the Stooges smash \\"Search And Destroy.\\" and a Muddy Waters cover for good measure.<br /><br />Great beer hall blues, rollicking piano and two great guitarists slashing back and forth. \\"Muddy Waters' buzzing \\"Honey Bee,\\" Elmore James' flirty \\"Talk to Me Baby)with Kenny on vocals and a few blues-tinged originals.\\"<br /><br />Kenny takes the lead on a saucy version of Big Maybelle's 1956 hit \\"That's a Pretty Good Love\\" and the Stills-fronted \\"Don't Want Lies,\\" follows, Oh so sweet.<br /><br />Goldberg, the classic Chicago Bluesman, (electric Flag) never misses a note and acts as the glue that holds fast this amazing trio.<br /><br />Credit is also due to the core provided by bassist Kevin McCormick  lately of Crosby, Stills and Nash and former Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble drummer Chris Layton.<br /><br />The Rides live up to the hype, not in a super-group kind of way, just three class acts paying homage to the days of old. Still's rough edge vocals shine, definitely 100% input by the veteran rocker.<br /><br />The young gun Kenny doesn't shy away from the legendary status of his bandmates, and the veteran duo aren't intimidated by the flash of the young blood. All three are dedicated to their craft and it definitely shows in the outcome.<br /><br />This is a top notch project, let's hope that this team \\"rides\\" the wave with many more future offerings.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|This was fun the first couple of hours but after that it's just repetitive. I would not have paid for it.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|love the cd. especially the track featuring Tech Nine. would definitely recommend to Five Finger Death Punch fans. five out of five
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. I love mahjong and this one is really good. It's very addictive which means it's a great game.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Very good cd,old school metal lives again. I am very happy with it and would highly reccmmend it to anyone who loves metal.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Very fun addicting game it makes you laugh when the answer is simple but you don't see it can get frustrating at times
B00AEBB9G4|5.0|If your into the darker side of comedy and wan't to see Charlize in a unique role this one's for you!
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is movie is darling!  Not only does my 3 year old love this movie, but as her parents, we do too!
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|This is great reading . It tells the story of man can destroy when he gets involved.  There is a lesson to learn but I am sure we will never get the message.  This book is worth reading. Get the movie it also is worth watching.
B0057F869U|4.0|Being a big fan of this time period and romantic movies, I found this very enjoyable. Watched twice. That says a lot for me.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|By any other author I would have loved this book, but from Hosseini I found it disappointing. Had it been published as a book of short stories it would have worked, but as a novel it left too many threads blowing in the wind. A good book but still disappointing from this author.
B006C45MRE|1.0|There was a lot of violence in this movie and is was confusing. Was it suppose to be a science fiction movie or a western. The plot was something from someone's nightmare.
1432794426|5.0|very informative book and a great read. Learned new things concerning MJ's finances and money...cleared up alot of the misinformation out there. The writer makes everything in the book understandable. Love chapters on the bodyugards and what it took when MJ wanted to go out with his children. I loved the book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So much fun to play! I wish there were more than 10 levels. I finished in a couple hours and wanted to keep playing.
1476734941|4.0|Has good receipes to follow on your 500 or 600 calorie days. Good book and I'm glad I ordered it. Liked the testimonies.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Felurian. Need I say more? I know some other reviewers have cried and screamed and raged about her, but what's one more, right?<br /><br />Let me be clear about something. I adored The Name of the Wind. I've read it several times, and I can confidently say that it is one of my all time favorite books. Just for good measure, after I bought The Wise Man's Fear, I held off reading it reread TNOTW just one more time so I can fully immerse myself in Wise Man's Fear -- fully expecting questions to be answered and itches to be scratched.<br /><br />But the excitement slowly faded. Oh, Kvothe is poor again. And he's playing his lute. And Denna is being mysterious and weird, as always, and the two keep skirting around each other. Ah, and innkeeper Kvothe is still depressed. Essentially a retelling of TNOTW, except it's not nearly as good because, erm, it's information we already know. And when some actually interesting stuff comes up? (The trial in Imre, anyone?) Kvothe doesn't want to talk about it. What he does want to do, though, is emphasize and reemphasize how poor he is, how lovely Denna is, and how great of a lutist and performer he is.<br /><br />Vintas was good though, and Ademre was fascinating. Actually, the moment Kvothe left the University, things started picking up and I was relieved the story was finally going somewhere.<br /><br />And then came Felurian. I was initially confused. I didn't know what this was. I couldn't understand why pages and pages needed to be devoted to this mythical sex fairy and Kvothe's juvenile lust. Even more confounding was how a 17-year-old Kvothe could wow the goddess (or whatever she was) of sex. I constantly skimmed ahead to see when this would end, utterly bewildered. Then came the anger, the frustration. At least the Felurian bit elicited SOME form of emotion out of me, because the rest of the book certainly did not.<br /><br />I've read these two books now that are equivalent in number of pages to about six books, yet I feel like the story has hardly progressed. Unlike TNOTW, I haven't touched TWMF since I finished reading it. Sequels often disappoint me, but not this much.<br /><br />I'm not usually this critical of books, but my standard and expectations for this one was waaay up there. But still, I give three stars, because Patrick Rothfuss is a phenomenal writer. This didn't change in The Wise Man's Fear. And for this and this alone, I will buy the third book.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|His best thus far.  The only probably with this movie is that if you have seen the Missions Impossible, everything Tom Cruise does seems to have a lot of resemblance.  This is the same, but I think better than most of his other movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The download was easy. The library is a little hard to access from one episode to the next.<br />Of course Walking Dead gets better and better.
B00BLF9FOK|2.0|Bad movie.  This really should be Arnold Schwarzenegger's last stand.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  In fact I'm getting rid of this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not a genera I read often but I enjoy the story and characters. Besides who doesn't love a little spice in their life?!
B005LAIHPE|3.0|I enjoyed this movie for a one time viewing.  It was hard to watch, but entertaining.  Have not watched it again and probably will not.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book what not what I expected at all. Several plot twists, very hard to put down and 'pay attention' to the kiddos. All I wanted to do was read the book.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The only thing I can say about this movie is that it's entertaining.  Has lots of dull moments, but most will probably like it because it is a James Bond movie.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I remember watching this movie years ago and found it recently in the Amazon Video and decided to watch it.  I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies but this movie goes way beyond that.  Brendan Fraser has a charisma that is hard to beat and this movie is a sad example of what the movie industry has lost in the way of quality, originality and over all movie making in the last 15 years.  This movie was one of the last great movies of the times and I fear that we will never see that again.  Blast From the Past is a movie everyone can watch and truly enjoy and is very intelligent for a romantic comedy.  I wish that Hollywood Producers and movie makers would find what they lost and if they don't know, maybe watching this movie would help them figure it out.  A timeless Movie for sure.
B008602KQI|3.0|It took me some time to figure the plot out on this movie. It has it's moments.  Some of my kids liked it some did not.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|This movie is a classic. I know it by heart, but the fact that they're still making full-screen dvds is shocking! Wait for widescreen & save yourself the irritation!
B008518MOW|3.0|I loved Men In Black I and II. But was disappointed with this one.  I forced myself to watch it in it's entirety, but was disappointed.
B0071U3KCW|5.0|Great musical to have in your collection - having it in blu ray is an added bonus! Very &#34;broadway&#34; - songs you are still singing for weeks afterward.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Great movie for the kids and some grownups to.  I enjoyed watching it with my grand kids. They though it was great.
B008469DGY|4.0|Just like the title states. I downloaded this while it was part of the free app a day program and have enjoyed it ever since. Easy to pick up and play.
B005LAII3U|4.0|Probably worth watching.  I viewed it once and found it a little hard to watch.  I don't believe it to be as good as the original.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|The only reason I give this 1/3 of a star is because it  let's u watch vids but it takes like an hour to load and then it starts u in HD the app sucks
B0083SBMBM|3.0|My kids enjoyed this movie.  It seems to be the new wave of entertainment that young people are craving.  It is not my type of viewing.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! Ready to begin the next book now! I will definitely be reading into the night!
B005LAIHGI|1.0|If you are wacky and like dumb movies, this is for you.  I bought this because I thought my son would like it.  Normally he thinks movies like this are funny.  Not this time.  Oh, well, my mistake.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Very simple to use it. Great to acquire TV series songs. Usually TV movies don't show their soundtracks on final credits.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Good movie to watch.  Story line leave a bit to be desired, but you will enjoy.  Lots of action that will keep you entertained.  You will enjoy it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We absolutely love this game!  The minions are so fun that our entire family wants to play.  It is a lot like Temple Run with minions.  We highly recommend it.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|My kids really loved this movie.  However, I found it to be corny and with not much substance.  The story line is wacked and totally unrealistic.
B0061US58C|2.0|I have no problem with filmmakers making whatever kind of entertainment they can dream up. What I don't appreciate is watching a G-rated film with my 3-year-old and having to explain the opening scene that is filled with guns! Not to mention the scene in which one car instructs another to kill someone. It's ultimately my fault for not doing the research, I know.<br /><br />As a side note, I think it's ironic that we have zero tolerance policies regarding gun play or mentions of guns in our public schools, yet the MPAA gives a film with blazing Gatling guns a &#34;G&#34; rating.
