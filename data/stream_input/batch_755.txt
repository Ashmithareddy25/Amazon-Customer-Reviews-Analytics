B000XA5K48|3.0|This movie was more entertaining than I expected. I HATE most typical action movies full of guns and explosions and all that stuff...my boyfriend bought this movie for \\"us\\" and I was already planning to stare blankly at the screen while planning my shopping list...but it was cool. Completely ridiculous and absurd and full of cheesy dialog, not the least bit realistic. Within minutes of the movie starting there's some drama (don't wanna give too much away) then this guy is delivering a baby while shooting a bunch of people who keep jumping out at them from all angles. It's like watching a video game, not a movie you could even take seriously...but it kept my eyes on the screen until the end when it just seems to drag on. My boyfriend- who loves REAL action movies- was very disappointed. The brothel and pretty hooker were very interesting, but the guy obsessed with carrots I just didn't get.
B0000029GA|5.0|I knew from when I first heard this album way back when, that is was classic material. Young Nasir was just a teenager and created a timeless album that will be continued to be talked about for decades to come. This album not only gave birth to Nas but also to the super underrated and extremely dope AZ. To rate this album below 5 stars is ridiculous and to rate it one star is absolutely insane. The one star reviewers must be retarded, smoking crack, as well as sniffing white out. This album helped to define what Hip Hop is.

B000002UJQ|1.0|I've tried to like Radiohead for a long time now. I've really tried. But I just can't, and it amazes me that they've pulled the wool over the eyes of the majority of the world. I think people like this band because other people have told them they should, not because they're actually a good band. This is the most bland muzak ever created. There's no skilled musicianship and no hooks, nothing to listen for, and they're fronted by a guy who couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag. I couldn't think of a more highly overrated band. Best band on the planet? These guys aren't even the best band in their own genre. Look to bands like Coldplay or Catherine Wheel for decent Brit Art Pop. Seriously, Radiohead fans, these guys have you all fooled!
B0000024K1|5.0|It Takes a nation of millions is one of my favorite albums of all time!!!!!!!!! The Rhyme animal, Flav, Griff and Terminator X go down in history as making one of the dopest, politically charged, Black pride, Hip Hop albums ever. This is another album that can't be rated any less than five stars. There isn't a weak track on this album or a weakness to be found anywhere on this album. Not only the album was dope but every video that was made especially the video for Black Steel in the hour of chaos were dope. Songs like Louder than a bomb are better than some current artists whole catalog. If you rated this one star, please get on your knees and choke your self!!!!!!
0792843584|3.0|Heaven's Gate was an attempt to create a great movie, a great western. Unfortunately, director Michael Cimino got so bogged down with the detail and minutiae of creating a classic piece of cinema that he forgot all about character development, story structure, and pacing. There really is no plot. The movie is basically a 3-hour set up for a 30-minute battle sequence that ends badly for every character. But the movie is a visual feast.<br /><br />The biggest problem, the most important problem, is that we are never made to care for these characters and that we don't know them. We are never to know why Christopher Walken's bounty hunter, Nate Champion, is conflicted with killing immigrants. Yes, we do know he loves the immigrant Ella Watson but that is simply for the sake of what passes for plot. There is a moment when Walken's character threatens to kill an immigrant kid. The kid asks why and tells Walken that he's just like one of them. This theme is not developed. We never know why Kris Kristofferson's character, Jim Averill, is already a weary, beaten down man. The immigrants, hundreds of them, are not introduced as individuals, but as a giant mob of anonymous victims of the equally anonymous rich bad landowners.<br /><br />The good things: The photography. The American West has never looked this beautiful, or mythic.  The panoramic views of the large cold lakes, the massive snow capped mountains, and shots of the immigrants walking across dust filled roads toward their realization of the American Dream (soon to turn American Nightmare) are very moving and touching. The attention to period detail is fantastic.  The music, using the instruments and sounds of that period, adds to the great mood of epic tragedy.<br /><br />Watch Heaven's Gate with an open mind and remind yourself that, sure, this is not perfect film, but at least Michael Cimino tried to make something that was cinematic and mature, a film that dealt with the American Dream and American history in such a dark, cynical way.

0812523369|5.0|One reviewer (Jane Stewart) thanked me for my input on the \\"revised\\" setting of P&P.  My reasoning came after my desire to have the setting be the end of the beautiful 18th Century - not the industrialized 19th.  Jane Austen wrote the book in 1796, and it was published 17 years later, but it was the SAME book, and she naturally wrote about her time period.  So I deducted 17 years from 1813, which equals 1796.  (Note: An astute reviewer on Amazon also pinpointed the timeframe of 1794-1796 with a French action that Jane Austen mentioned, related to P&P.)
B000XTCBWS|5.0|The Ring of the Nibelung was one of the two earliest pieces of music I ever heard; I remember a Met broadcast from when I was six (!). It has never left me and I remember the thrill of hearing \\"Das Rheingold\\" back in 1959, in the Solti recording, bringing back old memories and associations. Since then, I have heard and purchased the Solti, as well as hearing the taped Bayreuth Rings over WBAI from 1961 until they ceased the Bayreuth transmissions back in the Seventies. I aso own and treasure the 1960 Kempe Ring from Bayreuth, the Furtwaengler RAI from 1953 (great conducting, but poor orchestral playing and recording), the Krauss from 1953 Bayreuth (my first choice were it not for the one under review) and lastly and pershps most significantly, the 1955 Keilberth, under review here.<br />Readers will note that I had purchased the 4 operas separately when they were first released in 2007. Seeing the beautiful cover of the new integral set, I could not resist buying it. I plan to give the four separate albums to a friend. I think it makes good sense to package the Ring in a complete set, as one should own the whole cycle.<br />And what a performance this is! First of all, despite the real achievements of the studio Solti version, there is nothing like hearing the Ring in a live recording from Bayreuth. Every Bayreuth recording which I have eer heard has this thrilling tension and atmosphere which simply cannot be captured anywhere else. The balance between singers and orchestra is absolutely perfect, and on this recording, made in genuine and superbly natural stereo sound, it emerges in all its glory. Decca has created a sound with the orchestra in your lap and the singers above, onstage. I prefer this kind of concentrated, balanced sound to the kind of \\"spectacular\\" sonics of studio recordings, including the Solti.<br />As for the performances, as I said previously, I would never want to part with my other Rings, yet this one is clearly the winner. First of all, Joseph Keilberth, the most underrated conductor of my experience, brings a vigor AND subtlety to his interpretation that is in a league with Kempe and Krauss, to name other outstanding Bayreuth conductors. His sense of when to relax and when to tighten is unerring at every moment. As for the cast, they are all at their full glories. Hotter is THE Wotan of my experience, and shows it here. Neidlinger as Alberich is always superb, but has an extra bit of urgency and splendor that make him king of Alberich's. Likewise, Kuen's Mime has never sounded better and comes across as a real meanie, not some pitiable dwarf. Vinay and Browenstyn (sp?) as the twins Siegmund and Sieglinde are so ardent, you really empathize with their plight. Greindl as Hunding and Hagen especially has never sounded as polished and evil as here. Windgassen's Siegfried is for once really heroic,  yet tender and poetic. As for Varnay's Bruennhilde, she is the best on any set. I do not understand why she was so sorely unappreciated at the Met. Comparing her on the earlier Krauss set, she sounds even fresher on this latter performance! I have always ranked her as one of the top Bruennhildes, but here, she sweeps the field!<br />I therefore nominate this as the ESSENTIAL Ring.<br />Having just listened to the set, I'd like to add some details. First of all, Testament has trimmed the cost by omitting the libretti, although they can be easily downloaded; even better, though, would be to buy the Stewart Spencer version of the complete texts and very good English translation. Secondly, there is the matter of Act 2 of \\"Die Walkuere.\\" When I was growing up, it was fashionable to denigrate this act and especially Wotan's dialogue with Bruennhilde as overlong and repetitious. In reality, this act is the pivotal part of the whole cycle, as it shows Wotan's evolving perception of his own position and his awareness of his helplessness. Only the very greatest performances reveal this act as the supreme part of the opera, and this is perhaps the very best performence of them all. As I have said, conductor and cast at the very least equal the very best, and in some moments, surpass them. But with Hans Hotter's Wotan and Astrid Varnay's Bruennhilde, we have interpretations that are unequalled in my experience. And with repeated listening, I would add Windgassen's Siegfried and Greindl's Hagen to that list. What can one say? This has to be the required Ring. Hotter, Varnay, Windgassen, Greindl, Keilberth and Bayreuth RULE FOREVER!, and this is perhaps the very best performence of them all. As I have said, conductor and cast at the very least equal the very best, and in some moments, surpass them. But with Hans Hotter's Wotan and Astrid Varnay's Bruennhilde, we have interpretations that are unequalled in my experience.

B00005614M|2.0|... but I do like and own almost all of Miles Davis's albums.  I really don't care for \\"Birth of the Cool\\".  The sound quality is great, the musicianship is excellent but it feels clinical and cold.  Again, I am not an avid fan of jazz; I do not have the background or education of a jazz fan, but the reason I have such a deep Miles collection is that his music, by and far, is very moving.  Not this album.  Though technically proficient \\"Birth of the Cool\\" does not have a mood or \\"feel\\" to it that I associate with Miles Davis.  If you are not a big-time jazz fan per se I would not recommend this as a starting point for Miles Davis; save it for the experts!
B000Z7QOHG|5.0|Supernatural is an amazing show.  Yes, it's scary, but where it really succeeds is in its heart.  The show makes you care about the brothers and even the people they save.  Supernatural manages to be scary, funny, and touching, all at once.  It's an amazing accomplishment and an amazing show.
B00005JPLW|1.0|What is this all scenes of blood and violence, for whatever ideal it is. I could not continue watching this film, just stopped after about 30 minutes. Do not waste your money.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I will consider this movie to be too black and white and assume that people are like sheep or cattle. The movie had people behave in predictable ways like line up perfectly on a road when the impact took place in the ocean - in real life the small number of explorer type people will take advantage and then people some more people would take advantage of the opportunities - cars will take advantage of ditches, shoulders, even the opposite lanes. There would be walkers, bicycle, pretty much anything that can move and garbage and stuff would be everywhere. Even the police or the military would have a hard time trying to keep the line neat. Then there's the corny patriotism line of farmers - actually the farms often showed in the media is a rarity - there are not much profit or motivation for younger generations to stay on the farm.

B00004WG2F|5.0|Featuring incredible acting, Legends of the Fall is probably the most depressing film I've ever seen. Now, I personally think there is a difference between a sad movie, and a depressing one. A sad film usually features a sad ending, a character getting killed in the end, etc. A depressing movie, really gets you from the beginning and at every turn, there is something else to feel morose about. This is that type of film. Its long and spans a good length of time, but its a great journey. Like I mentioned, the acting is wonderful, from every single person. Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Julia Ormand, Anthony Quinn, all fabulous in this. Each character gets their own story and each one just seems melancholy. The cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is one of my favorites. It just adds to the already depressing mood. If you are in a good mood, watch this film and see how it affects you. I almost gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because its not really a perfect movie and a tad too long, but it achieves what it sets out to do so that is good enough for me, for this movie anyway.
0446401307|4.0|This is not Michael Connelly's best Harry Bosch novel, but it's also not his worst, by any stretch of the imagination. You can (sort of) tell that this story started out as something other than a book (it was a magazine serial) because of the length of the story. It's about a hundred pages shorter than Connelly's novels usually are. This just means that when things begin to unravel, and the plot begins to twist, it does so quickly.    Harry's called to investigate a murder. He's now working in Homicide again, out of downtown, and he has a new, green partner. The victim in this case is a doctor who has access to nuclear material that's used in cancer treatments. The doctor's been murdered and left at the Overlook in the Hollywood Hills, and Harry soon begins to question everything he's been told about the case, and everyone who's connected to it.    I liked this book, though it did seem a bit truncated and the ending developed rather quickly. I would recommend it, especially for someone going somewhere on a plane, something like that.
1878424602|5.0|Living in the stressful times that we live in today, it is crucial that we take a look at things we try to micromanage in our everyday lives and we do not realize there is such a bigger picture in life that we should examine closer instead.
B000005JA8|5.0|There are some great reviews for this cd, and I'm only throwing mine in to bring up the rating .. this is truly a 5-star, landmark album.    I won't go into a track-by-track - that's been done here by plenty of reviewers.  I bought this cd about a year ago.  When I first heard it, I didn't care for it at all.  I was equally put off on the second and third listens.  So - I thought I'd try something different.  I listened to this cd in my spare time, in chunks.  Sometimes while I was surfing the net, sometimes while going for a run (which I highly recommend - your brain chemistry is slightly different when running and this may help in \\"getting\\" this), sometime while driving, doing household chores, etc.    The key is to relax and let the music get into your head on it's own - on your own terms, without trying too hard.  Otherwise, you'll burn out and be one more person who gave up on this masterpiece.  I read a great Beefheart interview from 1970 where he was giving some music critic (who didn't \\"get\\" TMR) this exact advice - told him to put it on in the background while he was doing other stuff.    I know this all sounds like quite a bit of effort .. and quite frankly, it is!  But the payoff is worth it.  There is great music here, it's just different than what you may be used to.  Trust me, I'm a fan of everything from Led Zep to Iggy Pop to Roxy Music ... this music is worth the wait!    That's all I can really say about this particular album - nothing will prepare you for it because it really is a different approach.  Just dive in, put it on in your spare time and I promise you will \\"get it\\" .. and when you do, you'll be smiling .. this music is really addicting!  There is so much joy and creativity to be found here, if you just give it a chance.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Johan Hegg and AA are back with their sixth studio offering, and in my opinion, unquestionably their most polished work to date. Hegg is generally regarded as one of the best death metal vocalists out there... as one reviewer mentions, he is probably the only one whose vocals come across as intelligibly as clean vocals while sounding as kickass as any death vocalist.     AA focuses on Viking themes and can be better appreciated by anyone with an interest in Viking mythology. But anyone who appreciates good thrash or melodic death metal will not go wrong with this album. The guitaring, bass, and drumming are top quality and wicked fast on most songs. After hearing the heavy and blazing fast epic Cry of the Black Birds (arguably the best song of this awesome album) I was ready to change into some chain mail, grab my sword and shield, and go to war. Check out the Youtube video if you don't believe me! :)    Don't hesitate, get this album ASAP!
1594489505|5.0|Brilliantly written. Very good plot and storyline, all comes together in harmony. Very Moving, makes you understand the life of the characters as you were one of them.
B00009W8N2|5.0|For two reasons: 1) The album is damn good, and 2) The criticism it has been receiving is not its fault.    Orchid, Opeth's debut album, is not just \\"historically\\" relevant. Some of the songs in there are as good as any they have released. \\"Under the Weeping Moon\\" and \\"In The Mist She Was Standing\\" are as epic as any of Opeth's later releases. The twin guitars, acoustic intros and interludes, etc. in Orchid are still unquestionably Opeth. The \\"historical\\" relevance may apply in another sense: in Orchid, Opeth had many of the features that define \\"melodic death metal\\" (twin guitars melodies), and by releasing this in 1994, they were ahead of the the Gothenburg three (In Flames, Dark Tranq, At The Gates) considered as pioneers of the subgenre. All this, is however, irrelevant.    As with Opeth's albums, there is no filler song, but I like the two aforementioned songs, as well as Forest of October, The Twilight Is My Robe, and The Apostle In Triumph (Akerfeldt sure comes up with the most kickass song and album names!). Orchid, though not a concept album like MAYH or Still Life, still feature many 'Opethian' themes: Death/Depression (Forest of October), Satan (Apostle in Triumph, at least as far as I can understand).     The album does suffer from less-than-optimal production, and as other reviewers have noted, the bass and guitars could use a little more processing. However, in no way does that affect the quality of the music. I disagree with the comment that Peter Lindgren's guitar needs work... show me one riff or solo to support that statement!    Please don't go by the ratings; this is as good an Opeth album as any. Get it!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Having seen this movie with my son in dec 2007 he loved the movie for a 10 year old he found a web site that has most of the epsoides and he even found the movie on there so we watched it and it was great even good enough that we will buy the dvd when it comes out would of liked to seen it on the big screen though
0765357151|3.0|First, the writing is great.  Matheson writes clearly and lucidly, delivering stories that come across with almost brutal effect.  Most of the stories were written in the \\"golden age\\" of early sci-fi, and the tenor of the words shows that, but they still impact over the span of time.<br /><br />But the sheer pessimism of the writer made this a tough read.  The depressing look at human nature, the inevitability of a bad end; all of that made this a collection that I would not want to read again.  And I don't think I'll be looking for any of his other (copious) works.  There's only so much misery, even when (or, perhapse because it's) presented so well, I want to take.
B000003BDJ|5.0|This is some of the best rock and roll music ever made and it is all you need if you want to hear The Rolling Stones' greatest music.<br /><br />This is music made when they were a great band --and not filthy rich corporate shills that rock out for aging, middle class and yuppie baby boomer corporate drones; while sticking it to the people with absurdly high ticket prices, all for the glory of their lost youth and Budweiser or whoever the corporate god is to whom they pay tribute on that particular tour.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|One of the best recent films produced by German cinema.  A subtle and sensitive production.  I first saw the film in the cinema and was so impressed I bought the DVD.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is amazing, gritty, honest, and raw. You can't take your eyes off of him even when he's not speaking because he is so completely Daniel Plainview it's unreal.  Simply an amazing performance, and a thorough character study that leaves you investigating the character on your own in your mind when you are done with this film.  All the characters in this movie are well thought out and add much to the film even on a small scale for some.  Eli, HW, and Daniel Plainview will hold your attention solid for 2 hours plus. Worth the viewing 120%.  I don't know how Daniel Day Lewis can top himself in this, though somehow I think he will as he is who he is.The music in this film is amazing string arrangements for anyone interested in that type of music. Great soundtrack.   Beautiful, interesting period film.
B00005JPSM|3.0|Sometimes it is impossible to be objective about a movie, and other times, drawing comparisons is unavoidable. This film is a remake of one of the best movies I have ever seen, so right from the start, it is being measured against the high benchmark of [[ASIN:B00007ELFA Mostly Martha]].<br /><br />The story is definitely there, since it follows the original pretty faithfully, but I prefer the acting and pace of the earlier version. In a typical \\"Hollywood fashion\\" this movie runs at a considerably faster pace and shows us more vibrant characters, which is not necessarily a good thing. As others have pointed out, this is not a romantic comedy, but a drama, which has a pretty significant portion relating to the world of food, and a little bit of comedy.<br /><br />Bottom line is, the movie is OK; and if I had never seen the original, I would probably rate it a star higher; but even though I tried, I could not avoid the comparison. I would recommend those considering watching this movie and who tolerate films with a slightly slower pace, to go for \\"Mostly Martha\\" instead.
0525950079|1.0|I put this book down less than half-way through.  The characters and the language they use are absurd.  Follett may claim to have spent three years writing, but it doesn't show.     The characters are totally predictable. They use language that is inappropriate for their station.  The idea that a 14th Century illiterate monk, without one day of school to his credit, would use the words Follett puts in his mouth is just silly. The book is not worth the time needed to read it!
0802130208|1.0|The reviews of this book are overwhelmingly positive, but I found it to be a tedious read and a big waste of time. It could have been great, but alas, it fell short  1. Not funny: admittedly, the occasional pompous diatribe against the world by Ignatius coaxed a smirk or two. The rest is sophomoric stereotyping and scatological humor (and it is not even good - \\"Family Guy\\" fart jokes are much better).  2. Not a captivating story: the characters are one-dimensional, the plot is chaotic and the situations are so fundamentally repetitive, it could bore you to death. The secondary storylines just fizzle out unresolved after awkwardly converging where the \\"climax\\" of the book supposedly is. The real turning point of the story is in the last 5 pages - and happens a little deus ex machina, because 300 pages are not enough to develop the story organically. The book needed some serious editing, which apparently did not take place since the author committed suicide before it even went to a publisher.  3. Not visionary - A one-sided message is delivered by one-dimensional characters. Maybe I just don't get the message, but you will probably be more enlightened by, e.g. Nietzsche, Sartre or for that matter - \\"Fight Club.\\" Better entertainment, too...
1904233023|5.0|Ender's Game is part action, and part meditation on the nature of enmity and loyalty.  It presents complex thoughts in simple, compelling language, and readers won't find a single confusing passage.  That may be its greatest attribute.      I found the childrens' military genius a bit unrealistic, but for many other reasons, they were the most substantive characters I've encountered in years.  The main characters are neither \\"good\\" nor \\"evil.\\" The plot is somewhat simple, but underlain with complex philosophies, and it has a chilling but appropriate ending twist.  Even the extraordinary events in the book felt (often heartbreakingly) real.      Although the children are more intelligent as most of us will be as adults, they show many relatable qualities like homesickness, pride, love, and paranoia.  Read this book, and the author will bury them in your heart...with a blunt tool and no anesthesia...and you'll like it.
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|Took me a few listens to fully get into the new sound simple plan has going on for this c.d but im really starting to love it and honestly i think its thier best album yet so i would at least advise to give this a listen. 8 )

0143038419|1.0|I prefer to give this book a negative number of stars. How did it ever get published? The author is shallow, immature for her years, self-absorbed and deserves to be pitied in her quest for love & happiness. The book reads like her personal travel guide for lonely hearts club members. I could not finish this book. It was a waste of time. Penquin Publishing lowered the bar for this one.
B0000X61UU|5.0|Never did I expect to find such an awesome workout video, WOW!!! I don't know where to start cuz I love it so much. First of all it is so beautiful to watch, the different backgrounds used & the music, Cindy is lovely and so graceful. Ur watching her do the movements without anyone else there but here guru Radu on the side, you hardly see him but he does instruct the through out the video. This DVD is really a challenge cuz I was sore for days after but I still wanna go back and do more. I love working out with Cindy cuz it really feels like it's just you and her. I've bought other videos with celebrities, Cher and Kathy Ireland those are just annoying. This is the real stuff and moves I haven't even seen before on any video. I'm really satisfied I got this DVD!!
B000NA28HU|2.0|When I heard that this movie was coming out I was really happy. I thought that it might be neat to see the book come to life on the screen but it seems more like the screen killed it. The dramatic moments from the book seemed like they had been torn out all together. In the book we were able to get close to the characters and see a little more of their human side. That is not the case with this movie. People die but we don't care. Battles are pretty boring and the enemies just don't reach the level of dangerous. There was hardly any adventure at all. All in all I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't waste my money. Turn of the TV and read the book.
B000P0J024|5.0|The Traveling Wilburys put out this incredibly awesome two CD/one DVD set; and it wows me whenever I listen to it. The quality of the sound couldn't be better; and the DVD footage and music videos are excellent and fun to watch over and over again.<br /><br />This is one outstanding band. George Harrison wanted his own band and that's what he got. The group members include none other than Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty--along with, of course, George Harrison. Jeff Lynne and all the others who worked on this project are incredibly talented, too. I could never get tired of this music.<br /><br />The first CD opens with \\"Handle With Care.\\" \\"Handle With Care\\" features Roy Orbison singing the verses and they all come in on the chorus for an effect that blows me away! \\"Handle With Care\\" is a beautiful rock ballad that makes a strong start for this album. \\"Last Night\\" has a great arrangement for guitar and percussion; and they sing and play this to perfection! There's just a slight touch of a country twist to \\"Last Night\\" that really enhances the beauty of this number. \\"Congratulations\\" is a torchy rock ballad as they lament the loss of their women. \\"Congratulations\\" has great vocals by Bob Dylan and again the whole group joins in on the chorus for a great effect! \\"End Of The Line\\" has Tom Petty singing his best and it all works very well. Great guitar, percussion--and that's some melody, too! There are two bonus tracks including \\"Maxine\\" which has a Beatles type of flavor to it; \\"Maxine\\" should have been released earlier than this but it's still better late than never!<br /><br />The second CD continues the great music. \\"Inside Out\\" has a great beat and Bob Dylan with the other men on chorus all perform this flawlessly. \\"Inside Out\\" rocks well and I really like this tune. \\"If You Belonged To Me\\" is another ballad with a slight country twist to this rock tune; and I love it! \\"Where Were You Last Night?\\" has a Beatles type of musical arrangement and they sing this without a superfluous note! The modulations between major and minor keys work to make \\"Where Were You Last Night?\\" a very solid hit for this band.

0393330435|3.0|A quick read, but no depth and little insight.  Here is a guy who was at the heart of the personal computer revolution, yet the story he tells is very small.  The book is written as though the intended audience is fifth graders, and, given the author's love of kids, maybe it is.  I finished the book feeling like I learned more about Wozniak's childhood than any other part of his life.  There were glimpses of Apple, glimpses of Steve Jobs, glimpses of Wozniak's personal life, hints at lessons learned, but the end result is unsatisfying.
1582701709|1.0|A friend leant me this book with the best of intentions. It contains some of the stupidest and most unsubstantiated claims about human thoughts I've ever read.<br /><br />Yes it's true that many people go around in a negative mindset, which is unhealthy. We should all aspire to lead a positive thought-life (though this seems to require more effort in some folks than in others). Some modern psychotherapists would even claim that the connection between positive thoughts and general wellbeing is a recent discovery. Sorry folks, it's old news! Indeed it's been known for millennia (ref Philippians 4:8 written circa AD 61). As a general rule, our lives will move broadly in the direction of our most dominant thoughts. So yes, if you're struggling with an illness then focussing on the recovery rather than the condition will \\"set the tone\\" for your subconscious mind. No-one is disputing that.<br /><br />Why this book loses all its credibility is the candour with which the author dismisses all other forces in the universe. For example, she would have her readers fantasise that you can ingest a large number of calories and remain slim merely by \\"thinking\\". Duh. Hello? With respect, this is balderdash! A calorie is an amount of energy required to heat a substance to a particular temperature. If you eat three mince pies you'll ingest about 1,000 calories. You can't eat 3 mince pies and ingest only 200 calories merely by \\"thinking\\". Get real!<br /><br />The Secret is probably helpful material for anyone who lives in a fantasy world. Otherwise, save your money.

B000EGEVZK|5.0|I got the first disc from Netflix over a week ago and I've been playing it over and over, particularly the absolutely awesome set at the Rainbow in London.  It finally sunk in that I should go ahead and just buy it, which I'm going to do when I'm done with this review, otherwise I'll never see another movie from Netflix since I don't want to send this back.  I've never seen recorded concert footage that affected me this strongly.  This is as good as it gets.  (And I think it converted my son into a Ramones fan.)  Gods, I wish I'd seen them live.

B000JLQSWE|5.0|\\"Vulture Culture\\" was The Alan Parsons Project's (APP) 8th album.  It came out originally early in 1985, and on the heels of \\"Eye in the Sky\\" and \\"Ammonia Avenue\\", a couple of pop-heavier APP discs.  In brief, this is one of APP's most mellow albums.  The main theme seems to be about the \\"me-first\\", and \\"what's in it for me\\" attitudes that are so common these days.<br /><br />If you are an APP fan who prefers APP's progressive rock offerings, e.g., \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", \\"I Robot\\", and \\"Stereotomy\\", then this disc will probably not be one of your favorites.  If, on the other hand, you favor APP's mellower side, e.g., \\"Eye in the Sky\\", \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\", and \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" then you will almost certainly enjoy this disc.<br /><br />While I do enjoy APP's progressive rock offerings, I've always favored their mellower side even more, and \\"Vulture Culture\\" is therefore one of my favorite APP albums.<br /><br />The closest APP gets to rock on this disc is the opening track, \\"Let's Talk About Me\\", and it doesn't rock that hard.<br /><br />This is a pop-driven effort, as evidenced by the following tracks: \\"Separate Lives\\" (OK to Good), \\"Sooner or Later\\" (Good), \\"Vulture Culture\\" (Good), and \\"Somebody Out There\\" (Good).<br /><br />What makes this a top-notch album for me, however, are the mellow tracks \\"Days are Numbers\\" (absolutely tops) and \\"Same Old Sun\\" (great), and the excellent instrumental \\"Hawkeye.\\"<br /><br />In short, there's not a stinker in the whole list!  And, consequently, I think that you will enjoy listening to the entire album.<br /><br />To sum up, this ablum is a great mellow APP offering, a stance they moved away from in their 9th album \\"Stereotomy\\", which was much harder-driving.<br /><br />5 stars from this 30+ year APP listener...
0802130208|5.0|The power of this unquestionably brilliant literary work is the fusion of highbrow intellect with strategically incisive lowbrow absurdity. For that alone, the author has not only climbed Everest but staked his flag firmly at the peak. This flawless interweaving of the two \\"forces\\" (intellect and absurdity) forms one seamless garment of devastating comedy--with wit, in its truest and noblest sense, being the operative mechanism.    The book's protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is simultaneously repulsive and yet utterly beloved, for those who possess the means to perceive the undertones and deft brushstrokes of tragicomedy in which Toole cloaked his hero. He is astute and yet inane. He is virtuous and yet insane. And that's just the beginning. All that is required to truly revel in this gem-of-a-book is a genuine possession and/or grasp of...wit! It thrills me that this offering continues, by its very nature and existence, to actively separate the geniuses from the \\"dunces\\" of the titular \\"confederacy.\\"         Ignatius J. Reilly is a slob to end all slobs. An overeducated sociopath living in near-squalor in early 1960s New Orleans, he observes the world through a dual lens of disdain and absolute fascination. This causes his \\"worldview\\" to be both spot-on and irrevocably skewed. There are key passages in this novel that point (with subtle but bracing measures of sadness and poignance) to certain traumatic events in Ignatius's formative years that have set him upon his current course of bluster and bilious obsession. Again, herein lies part of the glory of this work--an effortless fusion of truth and psychosis, via comedy. You despise Ignatius, yet you feel a curious sympathy for his plight...and the palpable melancholy that underlies his grandiosity.       Ignatius's mother, Irene, is a confused, erratic, down-at-heel woman just past middle-age, torn between love for her behemoth son and her own sense that true contentment (which she's never had or perhaps deserved)is slipping away from her. She lives with her son as if not quite aware that she's housing a radioactive alien from another planet. The jaw-dropping rapport between the two is now the stuff of literary legend. When Fate (or \\"Fortuna\\") leads them from a drunken automobile mishap into a whirling cyclone of constant misadventure, the stage is set for an indictment of modernity the likes of which no other author of the past 100 years could possibly have crafted.        The characters and denizens in this tour-de-farce are spun-out for the reader like Cleopatra being rolled from the interior of a carpet at the feet of Caesar. The reader is indeed \\"king\\" here, for the reader is instantly made sovereign \\"viewer\\" of a world that includes everything ~and~ the kitchen sink. We have Burma Jones, a jaded, near-vagrant, but visionary black janitor forced to work under the tyrannical rule of one Lana Lee: cold-hearted, scheming proprietress of a seedy Bourbon Street strip-club called \\"The Night of Joy.\\" There's Darlene, the good-hearted B-girl whose idea of stardom and self-improvement is moving from the stool to the stripping-pole (with pet in tow). There's Gus Levy, reasonable, rational playboy and put-upon owner of a dilapidated pants-factory and his wife, a terminally bored harridan whose questionable \\"interests\\" sow hilarious chaos and oppression upon everyone remotely connected with her life (except for her \\"true love\\"--her sexually stimulating exercise \\"board\\").     There's Patrolman Mancuso, a dimwitted member of the police force who must prove his mettle or suffer humiliating consequences at every turn. There's Mancuso's aunt, Santa Battaglia, a froggy-voiced old bawd who appoints herself matchmaker, bowling coach, and all-around Svengali to the dizzy Irene Reilly and her sinking fortunes. There's the inimitable Miss Trixie, an octogenarian accountant at Levy Pants who is too senile and exhausted to do anything except wander aimlessly (\\"as if tacking into a gale\\") towardinterference and the vague hope for Easter hams and the paradise of \\"retirement.\\" Of course, there is Myrna Minkoff, the \\"minx,\\" the nymphomaniac beatnik who is both Ignatius' nemesis and, ostensibly, his secret love.    The manner in which all of these characters somehow manage to collide or affect each other toward eventual ruin and/or redemption is delineated in a mastercraft of plot, sub-plots, and brilliant \\"asides\\" approaching pure sorcery. Toole's work is never anything less than rib-crunching, knee-slapping, brain-freakingly hilarious on a multitude of levels. Every line of madcap dialogue, every gesture, every plot device, every motif, every \\"prop\\" is flawless. To reiterate, the comedy comes at you from the stratosphere, from the gutter, from the mundane, and everything in-between. The sheer cohesion of all these levels is the key that makes it not only a superior work in a lofty sense, but eminently readable in an almost base, common way. Pure magic. The coup de grace is that the \\"dunces\\" of Reilly's (and Toole's) world don't \\"get it,\\" and they're (still) apparently not meant to. Not allowed to. Oh, the irony!       'A Confederacy of Dunces' is a must-have for any intelligent, genuinely witty reader, and that kind of reader always and obviously has room for the savoring of comedy. The book is as magnificent (if not quite as classic) in its own way as Cervantes' 'Don Quixote.' If you're one of The Chosen, don't read it in public. You'll be mistaken for a hysterical menace (as you're rolling on the floor, on the subway, perhaps) and they'll cart you off to Charity Hospital.

There is, in fact, music on this disc and it will, indeed, play in players designed for the playback of redbook standard discs.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|What do you do when following your heart and passions bumps up against the every day pressures of making a living and conforming to an exterior standard?  \\"If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.\\"  This dialogue is repeatedly listenable, terse and dry, like the scenery.  The film follows western men Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) over two decades of their relationship.  Both men are great actors and use their faces and bodies to paint the range of emotions associated with the paradoxical pleasure and pain of love and attraction, with all its glorious moments and terrible imperfections.<br /><br />The western Rockies (from Alberta through Wyoming) form the landscape for much of the film.  I love this country and the filmmaker respected its beauty and austerity.  The Tetons penetrate upward through the crust of the earth like fingers, skyward.  It's a land in which you can find time to think, where nature paints the skies with wind and cloud.  The film affords the thoughtful viewer reflective moments.<br /><br />A couple of things seemed a little silly to me.  \\"Let's indicate it's the '70s by giving the boys identicle sideburns!\\"  And Twist wasn't entirely authentic as a rodeo cowboy, but he was fair.  On the plus side, some of the nuances of eye contact and body language as people - in an instant - try to sort each other out on the basics were expertly filmed.  I also loved the way the filmmakers made the connection between the touch and smell of physical artifacts as a token of a person who isn't present and very deeply missed.<br /><br />I didn't end up seeing this until after the passing of the Heath Ledger, and it's an extra sadness that this film now - in addition to everything else it does well - serves as a memorial to his great talent.  His portrayal of Ennis, a decent Wyoming ranchhand who settles into a dutiful dullness and only comes out of it into incandesence when his friend Jack comes around, is simply wonderful.  Also painfully wonderful is Michelle William's performance as Ennis' wife, Alma, a good woman who for a time submits to a relationship that's less than what she'd hoped for.  Her resignation is one of the saddest aspects of this film.  In many ways, the mantle of that suffering was picked up by Ennis' daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara) as the film develops.<br /><br />And the music...  The lush guitar fills the film with an aural soundscape complementary to the visual. The orchestrated version of the main theme resonated with me in such a glorious and sad way, as though experiencing a orange and purple sunset one knows might be one's last.<br /><br />This is not a film that glorfies what Jack and Ennis had.  And I have no idea how anyone could come away from this film demonizing the characters either.helle William's performance as Ennis' wife, Alma, a good woman who for a time submits to a relationship that's less than what she'd hoped for.

1582701709|3.0|If you get the basic message of the book (focusing on your good thoughts, and understanding their effects on your emotions), and apply it, with action on your part, then the secret will work for you.    If you get the wrong idea: that you just have to imagine good things and expect them to happen without doing anything, then there's a better change if you just buy a lottery ticket and wait for results...    I believe that the concept of positive thinking coupled with the pursuit (through effort) of what you truly desire is a golden advice we have all had since the beginning of our civilizations, but there's nothing magical nor mystical about it.     The only problem I see in the book is that this historical lesson has been transformed by the author into a materialistic and new agey-magical-thinking that may be wrongly interpreted by many readers.     The truth is that you can achieve what you intensely desire, but there's not \\"mysterious universe stuff\\" involved. The results come from turning that desire into action, by sacrifice, courage, perseverance and REAL effort. However, this advice is nothing new. The book just does a beautiful job turning this old advice into something more \\"digestible\\" for the century, sugar-coated with a new age package, so more people buy it. It doesn' mean it is bad, but the problem may arise when people act wrongly on the concept. Just have common sense, take the positive stuff, and discard the extra non-sense junk.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|I had all sorts of expectations regarding this album, all of them leaning toward the negative end of the spectrum.  However when I finally listened to the CD I came away with the opinion that it is better than the first record. It is certainly more even overall.     I guess from my point of view \\"Back to bedlam\\" had four strong tracks ( the first four) then tapered away sharply.  This new one is great from 1st to last with no duds.  The best track for me is the last one, \\"I can't hear the music\\" but they all have good, strong melodies and lyrically it is an improvement over the debut.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|This being a Ridley Scott movie, I was worried about the length, I was afraid it would drag, I mean the extended version is three hours, but much to my pleasant surprise, it never drags.  Denzel Washington is fantastic as ever, he exudes power and he is very believeable as this nefarious Harlem capitalist.  Crowe was very good as well, he can do just about any role and he is as good as Washington in this, if not better.  I had wished Scott had included more one on one moments with Crowe and Washington, it was sort of like the movie, Heat, with Pacino and De Niro having like ten minutes together in a three hour movie.  I was pleased to see that Ruby Dee got any Academy Award nomination for her role in this, she was great; it reminded me of her heartbreaking role in Jungle Fever.  The extended version gives a slightly longer ending; it provides for some more screen time between Crowe and Washington, but frankly it feels added on, like it was an afterthought.  This is a powerful movie, based on real events and it resonates.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Let me say that I'm a huge fan of the comic book as well as the series with the late Bill Bixby. When I heard this was going to be made into a motion picture, I was ecstatic and being that I was working in a movie theater at that time, I decided to check it out. As you all know, this movie has the same premise as the comic book: Bruce Banner gets bombarded with gamma radiation in accident and turns into an uncontrollable beast that only comes out when he's angered. The problem is that the comic book as well as the series is more exciting then this movie! The special effects are not bad an they make the modern version of Hulk look mean and menacing but the movie lacks excitement. The dialogue is dry and the movie seems to drag on for the 2 hours too long. When the action scenes arrive they are pathetic and the most annoying thing is the Brady Bunch windowsill scenes that they use for the action scenes all over the movie! This is easily one of the worst comic book to movie adaptations ever made. I'll always remember the good times I had with the comic book as well as the series but this visual tranquilizer is bad enough to make you turn green and smash it to bits and pieces!
B000WCCUZO|5.0|i totally disagree with the first guy to rate this album. sorry you spent your money man. the album's intense. if you're on the fence, find a way to demo a track or two for yourself. personally, mothership, enter shikari, sorry youre not a winner, ok time for plan b, labyrinth, and adieu all deserve a listen regardless of where youre at with your tastes in music. its a good cd to listen to from start to finish just hanging out, and its great for ripping around in your car to the more hardcore tracks with a bunch of friends. i cant wait for these guys to make a name for themselves here in the states. the bottom line: if youre even thinking the slightest bit about picking the album up, go for it. get it used if you prefer. i do. you wont be disappointed. peace.
0307341550|3.0|Gillian Flynn needs another review like we need 12 more seasons of American Idol, but I thought I should to make it an even 110 reviews (for now). So MANY reviews, in and of itself should say something about the power of this novel. Yes, I think the fact that the protagonist is a \\"cutter\\" is part of the brewhaha (my spelling), but there's a lot more going on here. Flynn has a keen eye and if I can borrow from a college professor who borrowed it himself, a \\"rapier whit.\\" This novel is about the weirdest sorts of codependency, as well as child and self abuse. The plot, for me, was less important than Flynn's observations about things like the types of bars in small towns, the types of men who inhabit them, and the ladies of leisure who live in Wind Gap. The words Camille Preaker has carved into her body are manifestations of her guilt that almost literally cry out at dramatic turn in the novel. On the surface, yes, this is a thriller that, at times, moves a little too slowly. However, at a deepr level it's a novel about shame, guilt, priviledge, codependency, addiction, and the need to be loved. Some of these are pretty common themes, but Flynn has added new twists that make this novel stand out from much of the muck that get published today. I thought this first novel was unique and compelling. I look forward to more from Gillian Flynn.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|Somehow, Dream Theater never ceases to amaze me. They've reivented progressive rock since mid-to-late 80s and they are capable to keep on writing extraordinary music and keeping their musicianship intact.    Mixed reviews about their music are very common, and that's what makes them more interesting. Some metalheads dislike their proggier (and sometimes pop) vein, and proggers are not often keen on their metal side. Dream Theater is not the kind of band to please everyone... they do what they want and no one does it like them.    Every new Dream Theater album is a whole experience for the listener. Whatever you thought of a past album, you don't know what will come in the next one. When they released \\"Constant Motion\\" as a single I understood they are going to continue exploring their heaviest side. Then I saw the \\"Dark Eternal Night\\" video at YouTube and I found that piece so  heavy and yet so virtuosistic that I couldn't wait to have the album in my hands.    The result: another awesome piece of music. The epic, the symphonic, the experimental, the mellow and the heavy are all blended together in Systematic Chaos.    1.- In The Presence Of Enemies Part 1: What a starter! First thing that comes to mind is the Liquid Tension Experiment revisited, until James' voice appears. Many fans keep on harassing him, but I've always had him as a great singer, and this album proves it again. He signs in a more comfortable fashion, not so extremely high. The piece ends and you stay in suspense... obviously you need part 2.    2.- Forsaken: A piece a little more \\"modern\\", if such term can be used. The piano and strings from Jordan give a great atmosphere to the vampiresque lyrics.    3.- Constant Motion: Yes, it does sound like Metallica, because Dream Theater never hide their influences. However, Metallica can only dream of playing this heavy nowadays. Although is very much of a guitar driven song, the keyboard solo by Jordan does good for headbanging.    4.- The Dark Eternal Night: One of Dream Theater's heaviest and most chaotic (hence the album title) songs ever. Every one of the musicians show what they're capable of in terms of speed. They outgrew themselves on the heavy side with this one, just check the background for the guitar solo, it's as heavy as any Symphony X track.    5.- Repentance: It's time to bring things down a bit. Continuing the saga that started with \\"The Glass Prison\\", \\"Repentance\\" explores a mellower side. The ending, although a bit long, serves for very nice evocative feelings. Masterly!    6.- Prophets Of War: A recent influence for DT has been Muse, one of the most interesting bands nowadays. They already explored this influence with \\"Never Enough\\", from Octavarium (2005), and now they take it one step forward with this track, which also features some powerful backing vocals, provided by Mike, John Petrucci and a group of fans.    7.- The Ministry Of Lost Souls: The strings on this one are quite epic. It's a slow song untill the middle typically expected instrumental part, where both Jordan and John Petrucci make their instruments smoke with amazing solos. The final guitar melody is simply beautiful.    8.- In The Presence Of Enemies Part 2: John Myung starts this track with a Roger Waters kind of riff, playing octaves. This piece ends the album in a great prog-epic fashion, where Jordan even plays a Moog that sends chills down your spine.    Whatever anyone can write here, there's nothing like hearing for yourself. This special edition comes with a DVD where you can see the band recording the album. I assure you it will make you like it even more!    The dream keeps on coming true.
0679721037|4.0|Journalist John Hersey's non-fiction account of the atomic bomb blast on Hiroshima, Japan, was originally published in the August 31, 1946 edition of The New Yorker magazine, before becoming a best-selling book.  In four chapters, Hersey covers a year in the life of six people--five natural-born Japanese and one German national--who survived the American attack on their beloved city.  Chapter One, A Noiseless Flash, begins with the detonation of the bomb, \\"At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, Japanese time\\" and ends moments later, shortly before the city catches on fire.  The principal witnesses to the destruction are introduced: Miss Toshiko Susaki, \\"a clerk\\"; Masakazu Fujii, a doctor who works in a private hospital;  Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a widow with three children; Dr. Terufumi Susaki (unrelated to the clerk), who is on the staff of the Red Cross Hospital; Reverend  Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a Methodist; and Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a Jesuit priest of Germany, which was an ally to Japan in World War II.<br /><br /> The book begins without any setup other than the time, place, and central--real-life--characters.  The background to the conflict is conspicuously absent, as are facts regarding political, military or geographical concerns surrounding WWII.  Hersey assumes the reader has lived through the war, is current on all the pertinent details of the air- and ground-battle, so he wastes no printed space on the world leaders, generals, or military brigades in favor of devoting all of his energy to the civilians.  In particular, the innocent victims of the end-game move by American president Harry Truman are who most concern the writer, and the book gathers their personal, eyes-on-the-ground experiences into a compelling narrative that encompasses not only six people, but an entire city.<br /><br /> Each eyewitness has a distinct personality, a specific lifestyle before the blast, and a horrific story to tell of its aftermath.  In the three chapters following the introductory chapter, their six individual odysseys for survival and understanding converge and overlap.  The interlacing narrative structure gives the reader a full perspective of the days and months after the atomic attack on Hiroshima, with six varying viewpoints organized into one fluid tale.<br /><br /> Hersey takes the reader through the city's \\"clouded air...giving off a thick, dreadful miasma\\" primarily through the subjective lens of those who saw it first-hand, but he doesn't limit his reporting to that narrow scope.  He also offers many objectively reported facts and provides a larger perspective on the situation throughout the book, revealing details that the denizens of the devastated city were never privvy to, but which expand the reader's understanding of their closed narrative.  When the reader learns that, directly following the atomic blast, sixty-five of a hundred and fifty doctors died instantly, and that the majority of the remaining M.D.s were wounded, the story takes on a heightened sense of dread that would be missing without that information.  The plight of the survivors becomes even more grim for the reader at this point, and the drama of their personal journeys becomes more immediate and emotionally wrenching.<br /><br /> The narrative voice of the author is extremely matter-of-fact, without any \\"commenting\\" on the actions or thoughts of the six people, nor any subjective commentary on those responsible for the dropping of a bomb that killed over a hundred thousand Japanese and injured thirty-seven thousand more.  He lets the experiences of those who were there speak for themselves, and despite the occasional contextual bit of information, Hersey depends solely on their testimonies to tell the story.<br /><br /> The details are often graphic, with physical descriptions of burned and bloody corpses, vomiting children, maimed and ravaged survivors, as well as drowned and bloated dead.  The tone has a sombernessthroughout, with a sense of compassion for those who suffered this ordeal felt within the narrative.

B000DZIGDU|3.0|The production team had a great idea with this film, but in the end they didn't quite succeed.  In my view, the goal of this film was to create a war film that lies somewhere in between the antiwar documdramas like `Born on the 4th of July' and the gung-ho type stories such as `Saving Private Ryan' or even earlier war movies (like John Wayne films).  The image of military service and the reality are two very different things.  Some find that they take to the military life quite easily, but for others, it is tedious and unfulfilling.  It is this last aspect of military service that is presented in this film.  We follow the main character through basic training, through scout sniper school and into the desert as part of Operation Desert Shield after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Several mind numbing months later, they are ready to go to war, march into Kuwait, and the war is over before it started without anyone having fired a single shot in anger.  Everyone is left with the feeling that their perseverance was, in the end, a complete waste of time and energy.<br /><br />This movie is obviously based on the book by the same name.  I've never read the book, but I've been told that there are important differences.  The drill sergeant at the beginning of the film who physically abuses the recruits is subsequently discharged.  This important detail is left out of the film and really changes the impression.  The whole basic training scene is poorly (and unfairly) done in my opinion.  Doesn't hold a candle to R. Lee Ermey's performance in `Full Metal Jacket', and in any case, they should have balanced it out somewhat by showing the transformation in the Marines after the Crucible.  One thing emphasized in the book that isn't as fully developed in the film (but really is the key point) is the notion that many (although not all) young Marines want to leave the service as quickly as possible.  Some enjoy their military service, but for many (most?), it is really a mind numbing duty that they want to put behind them as quickly as possible.  I think this is particularly true for someone with a reasonably active intellect.  That being said that, I wonder if Swofford (the author of the book and main character in the movie) actually regrets enlisting?  I wonder if he asks himself how he would feel today if he didn't enlist?<br /><br />In the end, I think that the idea of creating a nuanced film that described the mind numbing boredom of much of military service was a good idea, but this film really didn't deliver the goods.  Throughout history, young men have been making foolish, ill informed decisions.  Military service is clearly vital to our national interest.  Many will go into the military and have a good experience, many won't have a good experience.  That's pretty much like everything in life.  There are no guarantees.  Some will die pointlessly, others gallantly in the `Good War`, whatever that is.  There is a certain pride, however, in being able to say you stuck it out, didn't quit, and that nobody can take that away from you.  It is this last point that Jarhead totally misses in my view.<br /><br />One last note, there is almost no `action' in this film, so if you are looking for a shoot-em' up type of film, you'll have no interest in this.at they want to put behind them as quickly as possible.

0872863107|4.0|While Allen Ginsberg's three-part, long poem \\"Howl\\" is borne of a particular moment in American history --- the Joseph McCarthy congressional witch hunts; the cold war with Russia (which includes, to a degree, the Korean War); social and racial unrest --- it is still possible to read and appreciate the work without the context of the time.  The staccato beats of the stanzas, the raw and potent language, as well as the cross-country travels in the poem are all worth exploring in detail outside of the realm of Ginsberg's cultural experience.  With powerful imagery, specific American locales, and references to John Milton, William Blake, Neal Cassady and the Bible, the 1956 poem ushered in not only the age of Beat poetry, but a lasting piece of fury, compassion and madness.<br /><br />The opening line, \\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness\\" sets in motion a seemingly endless list of unnamed, but mostly male, people whom the narrator apparently knew who lost their sanity in the streets, subways, back alleys and bars of America.  Written as a single, run-on sentence, the rhythm scheme is structured as mini-tales, each passage of a new, mind-blowing experience beginning simply with \\"who,\\" connecting back to that first line of the poem.  The sense of dislocation within familiar terrain is the theme repeated throughout, with places in the heartland like Laredo, Texas and Arkansas as sinister and terrifying as Chicago and New York City.  The people of the narrator's generation come from and travel to all points on the U.S. map, but share the common states of sorrow and confusion, unable to feel grounded within landscapes that no longer hold the same security and dependency that they once did.  When the \\"angelheaded hipsters [...] / [...] bare their brains to Heaven under the El\\" and \\"[drink] turpentine in Paradise Alley,\\" the America that once made sense is transformed into a jumble of seedy and depressed places where screaming at God, poisoning oneself, and having meaningless s*x for an almighty, capitalistic dollar is the current norm.<br /><br />Time, space, eternity, the universe and Plato are invoked throughout the narrator's journey across America, allowing Ginsberg to delve into the big questions asked by man, albeit without attempting to directly answer any of them.  He is ambitious in his reachings, detailing the concerns and experiences of an entire generation, his only judgments coming in the form of labeling the various acts performed as the actions of an insane group of people.  He then follows the list of his generation's misdeeds with a section devoted to Moloch, invoking the biblical Canaanite who also shows himself in poems by Coleridge and Milton.  The third and final section addresses Carl Solomon, a real-life friend to Ginsberg, to whom the poem is dedicated.  It continues the societal course of madness to its logical conclusion, with Solomon in a Rockland, N.Y. mental hospital receiving treatment for the destruction of his, the best, mind.ving meaningless s*x for an almighty, capitalistic dollar is the current norm.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|They redid the subtitles, which changes our interpretation of what is happening, but it's still one of the greatest films ever made. The booklet and additional disk are informative. A good start for any Akira Kurosawa fan. Start here and work your way through the rest. The west influenced him, and he influences us. Great viewing.
0393039765|4.0|Why you Should/Shouldn't Buy this book.    The book is a fast and easy read, but a little chaotic at times.    I'm quite certain this was done to give the reader an authentic 'feel' for whats going on inside the narrators head.    Which it does...    But I HIGHLY recommend watching the movie first if you haven't already.  It does surprising justice to the book, and lays things out in a much more smooth and linear way.    Most of the memorable lines and quotes from the book are included in the movie, and both start off almost exactly the same, only beginning to differ the closer you get to the end.    If you hate the movie, skip the book.  You'll probably hate the book even more.    If you like the movie, you might enjoy the book, but probably won't miss much if you pass on it.    If you love the movie, I suggest checking it out for the few extra tidbits and alternate scenarios that didn't make it into the movie.    ---------------------------  *Review of book itself*  = Possible Spoilers=    Fight club is a great book in that it explores some of the darker sides of society and psychology that most people tend to ignore, or flatly refuse to acknowledge.    This forces the reader to think about and examine various concepts about themselves and situations in their lives that may otherwise have gone unnoticed.    Many examples of this 'forced self reflection' can be found multiple times throughout the book.    Such as in the \\"Human Sacrifice\\" and \\"Near Life Experience\\" scenarios.    However, like anything taken to far, the book clearly demonstrates the consequences of what can happen when any idea, even good ones, are taken to a extreme or cult level. Ultimately reversing any positive affect the prior may have had. Even to the point of working against the goal which it initially set out to achieve.
B000VS6QTK|4.0|I think someone mentioned it, that the concert was filmed back in 1991, so the actual video seems a little dated, the audio to me was pretty good as well, but again it was recorded back in 1991.  But still a good buy for Bluray, I personally knew what I was getting into, but I still opted to get it on Blueray rather than regular DVD.
1401207529|5.0|I LOVE this book.  It is a great summary of the early career of the dark knight and a fantastic way for anyone who loves Batman to learn more about him.  It's especially great for anyone who wants to learn more, but doesn't feel like tracking down and buying the early issues.  The art inside is really good, but doesn't overshadow the writing.  Seriously, get this book.  You will not regret it.
B000NA2776|4.0|For those of us who found our muse in the 80s, much of this album will sound eerily familiar.  Whether that's a good or bad thing is up for debate.  In the layers of visuals, we see Yellow Submarine.  In the familiar hooks of the songs we hear the Gibbs, Freddy, John and Paul, maybe a little Benny and Bjorn, Bowie, and Sir Elton.  But I have to admit his execution is no less than masterful.  I really enjoy this album.  I think Mika may have what it takes to fill the void left by the passing of the greats.  His vocals are good and will only get stronger over the nex 5-10 years.  He's a true song smith who I believe will also grow into his own original form -- he's already there in some ways.  Here's hoping he can stay focused on the art as his popularity swells.  Welcome Mika.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|This is one of my very favorite films of the last few years, and its   virtues are detailed thoroughly in the reviews below. Because it is a favorite, I bought this expanded edition although I already owned the DVD.  If you're considering buying a second version, I'll offer the opinion that it's not absolutely necessary. The promised \\"full-length documentary\\" is less compelling than it sounds, consisting of long interviews with some of the people involved in the actual case.    These extras add nothing to the enjoyment of the film and are a poor substitute for the books written about the case.     If you own the film already, you could live without this version.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I watched this movie last night and I absolutely loved it.  First of all, it's an ambitious form of sci-fi that not very many people make anymore.  But, more than that, I consider this movie a horror movie.  It was very scary, in a suspenseful way.  For most of the film, it manages to be a horror movie without any type of monster or villian, which is almost unique.  The pace is quick, and not a lot of time is given for explanations or explicit character development.  I thought this was a strength.  It's rare to see an action film or disaster movie or what-have-you where the characters actually act like they are in peril and are trying to save the world/themselves.  They don't take time for long chats or flirting or jokes, and I loved that.  The acting was brilliant and the directing gorgeous.      I have some issues with the last third of the movie.  It takes a bit of a turn and the ending was so fast-paced as to be confusing, but ultimately I still loved it.  I talked about it until I went to bed last night, and I'm still thinking about it.  When I was done watching it, I literally felt like I had just gotten off a rollercoaster, that's how tense it was.
B000006045|5.0|This is further proof that electronic music has the human element, that it's true music, and no ignoramus has the right to call all electronic music lifeless and unemotional (rap counts, Depeche Mode counts, Nine Inch Nails counts, etc).  Maybe those people have a lack of rhythm.  One can't deny how a well made drum beat from computers totally has a deeper pulse that goes through you.  Oh well, truly those who know the joys of how rhythm work revel in it's majesty, while the others will wallow with their tortured losers screaming nonsense ______ into a microphone.  Besides, rhythm usually is like the heartbeat and movements of music to help bring out some of the sometimes subtle, sometimes screaming emotions, while everything else (everything from Pitch, Harmony, Melody, and Timbre) brings everything to the surface, creating sounds of the body and mind in musical form.  Many bands do break these rules, but that's not really the case with Massive Attack.<br /><br />When used correctly, electronics will bring out the soul.  It's merely<br />another instrument.  Saxophones are made out of hollowed brass.  Gongs are sheet metal melded into a circle.  Electric Guitars are nothing but circuits and ELECTRONICS.  Only when used correctly can electronics become musical. Stairway To Heaven's solo, a solo most people swear it makes them weep, was played on an ELECTRIC GUITAR MADE OUT OF ELECTRONICS! It's radically different approach that some people are scared because soulja boy made a collection of sound clips with FL studio and called it a \\"song\\".  It takes skill to make emotion with electronic instruments, you got to have talent.  Cleary those who say they can make any type of electronic music in 10 seconds are lying.  Machine's may have no life, but electronic instruments aren't merely machines, their musical instruments made solely from electronics.  No instruments have life, and when the material to make the instrument is made in something else or just sitting there, it has no life.  Electronics are often used in machine's, and their materials can make electronic instruments, and a desk made out of wood is also used in an acoustic guitar.  Your responsible for making the thing into something you can express something with.<br /><br />If Massive Attack's beats are lifeless to you, you can't say the vocals are lifeless.  Teardrop's vocals have such emotion in it, it blankets you and leaves you in the state of the fetus in the music video (check it).  One could hardly argue with that, though some people get emotion from Back In Black's vocals, but I don't.  So were all on the same boat.  Just think of that before you automatically dismiss them.<br /><br />This album is dark.  Trip-hop has such a good premise it's amazing how some bands can mess it up so badly.  Massive Attack, being the premire Trip-Hop group, were the best (Haven't heard Portished yet, though).  On their third album, Massive Attack completely took a 180 and created darker music.  It still hasn't lost anything, although this album isn't as great as Blue Lines.  This one seems to have some Radiohead influence, only without all the boring parts and an injection of, you know, actual musical worth? There's not really much to say in the music, actually.  It still will most likely invoke something in you.  Great cd, nothing much else to say.<br /><br />So if you are an actual fan of music, then I reccomend Massive Attack.Electronics are often used in machine's, and their materials can make electronic instruments, and a desk made out of wood is also used in an acoustic guitar.

B00129XQ0O|5.0|I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'll keep it short and down to the facts. This set contains all of Hellhammer's demos. 29 songs in all, re-mastered from original master copies by Tom Gabriel and Martin Eric Ain. They also dove into their personal archives to supply photo's and never before seen art work.    There are three versions of this, a triple LP edition, and a Deluxe 2 CD edition. Both feature a lavish booklet and a poster. There is also a bare-bones low priced version as well. I have the Deluxe 2 CD version, ordered directly from the manufacturer, it arrived on 2-19. It is full of rare never before seen pictures, reproductions of the original cassette tape covers, and a brief excerpt from the forthcoming book \\"Only Death is Real - The Illustrated History of Hellhammer and early Celtic Frost\\"    When Hallhammer released it's only official album \\"Apocalyptic Raids\\" the band had already been broken up, that album was regarded as one of the heaviest albums at the time. These songs show the progression of the band and how they would mature into Celtic Frost.    This is a good listen to hear the beginning of what would eventually become doom metal, thrash metal, black metal and death metal.
B000GB775E|4.0|In fact, the only thing original in this movie is that the lead actress (Lohan) starts off with luck, then gets bad luck after kissing some stranger (Pine) at a mascarade party and then kissing him later on (shedding bad luck) to kiss again and get it.<br /><br />Weird, I know. But more or less, that's the premise of this been-there-done-that-but-still-cute tale...<br /><br />Lindsay does decent acting once again, but it's not her best. Mean Girls and especially Freaky Friday were her highlights.<br /><br />Lindsay and Pine have great, great chemistry but Katie \\"gets in the way\\" at first. Later, things are realized and \\"fine\\" again.<br /><br />Like I said a many movie clich&eacute;s roll, punch after punch, but the heart of the movie is still realized.<br /><br />Do the lead actor and actress end up together? YOU figure that one out!<br /><br />Positives:<br />You more or less stay glued, regardless of some of the bad and overused clich&eacute;s popping up.<br />Great chemistry between the two leads.<br />Acting is decent.<br />Music is OK, but a bit too predictable.<br />Band's music is OK too but one song when they rehearse REALLY sticks out well.<br />What Lindsay's character thinks of Katie at first is HILARIOUS! :)<br />The real Katie rocks. \m/<br />Nice length.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Clich&eacute;, clich&eacute;, clich&eacute;!<br />Very predictable sometimes.<br />There's nothing new here.<br />Ending was as predictable as the movie.<br /><br />3.7 stars.

What happened to everybody who had flocked to Lord Asriel's banner? What was the decision that Lyra was supposed to make? What happened, what happened???? I could go on all night, I'm glad I wasn't the only one left in a lurch. Philip Pullman, you should be ashamed to ruin what should have been a been a historic series in line with LOR.
B000YENUIQ|5.0|Combine wonderful actors with a world-class director and the result is a great little thriller that is surprisingly tense in a slow-moving sort of way.  I found myself constantly hoping that things were not quite as they seemed. Watched in HD and was very pleased with the quality.
B00005QHV5|3.0|A word of caution to newcomers who may think they are missing out on a great musical experience: you aren't. Gunter Wand's recording career is almost entirely due, so far as I can tell, to the influential Gramophone magazine, which began to hype him in the 80s as a past master of the great Austro-German musical tradition. From the beginning their adulation was lost on me. What I kept hearing in Wand's Beethoven, Schubert, Mozart, and Bruckner was dutiful Kapellmeister-ish conducting that rarely went beyond the pleasant and respectful. That's certainly true in this box set of Beethoven symphonies with his home orchestra, the North German RSO in Hamburg. It's one thing to possess the genial warmth of a Bruno Walter; it's quite another to play Beethoven with a soft marshmallow center.<br /><br />The playing isn't world class. This is one of several good radio orchestras maintained by the German government. To my ears, the musicians on this occasion play like pensioners. There's no real spark of commitment or passion. They know Beethoven inside out, as does their conductor, so they serve it up as part of a healthy diet. One hears the same approach in the Beethoven recordings of Jochum, Krips, Schmidt-Isserstedt, Schuricht, and other more obscure traditionalists.  Wand's readings are so undistinguished that I won't detail my criticisms. One is already cruising for a bruising to cross swords with the Wand clique. But if you want reliably safe yet musical renditions of the most familiar symphonic music in existence, this set suffices.<br /><br />P.S. 2010  -- The comments thread that follows tis review is fun to read, since the bruising I predicted brought out several combatants.  What's Amazon without a dose of recreational abuse?

B000001ESF|5.0|Even after all these years and the many albums that followed this one, \\"2112\\" remains my all time favorite Rush album.  Yes, it is pretentious, yes some of the lyrics are silly, yes the sci fi concept is a bit corny.......but I still love it!  The 20 minute title track remains one of my all time Rush compositions.  I can't help but play air drums during the \\"Overture / Temples Of Syrinx\\" section of the piece.  In fact this is the album where Neal Peart's percussion really came to the forefront of the band.  Alex Liefson guitar and Geddy Lee's bass are at the top of their game as well.  The second half of the album is composed of shorter songs, but I like all of them too.  The best is probably \\"Something For Nothing\\", with \\"Twilight Zone\\" being the only possible filler material here.  For me this album is a classic and I still crank it up when I pop it in my CD player.

B0000669JL|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this amazing anthology, although it was over 25 years ago, I recall that night like it was yesterday.  I was about 15 years old, and up to that time, I had never heard music like this before.  My buddy played this record for a group of us and immediately I was completely absorbed and elated.  The very next day, the first thing I did was race down to the record store to purchase this album.  I then made it a point to play \\"Legend\\" to everyone I knew - fans of hard rock, punkers, New Wavers, classic rock fans, jazz, classical, -  they all loved the sweet, serene sounds of Robert Nesta Marley (a.k.a. Bob) and really, how can any fan of music not?<br /><br />\\"Don't worry... about a thing... cause every little thing, is going be alright...\\"<br /><br />Sure, this compilation of hits is just a small sample of this legend's work.  There are so many great recordings of his that I would highly recommend, but if you are new to Bob, this is the best place to start in my opinion.  He is a legend, there is absolutely no doubt about it.  Bob Marley is the greatest of the greats (i.e. Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, Bunny Wailer, Toots and the Maytals, Desmond Dekker, Burning Spear, etc...).  He is to Reggae music, what the Beatles and Elvis were to Rock 'n' Roll, what Aretha Franklin is to Soul, what Louis Armstrong was to Jazz, what Run DMC and Public Enemy were to Rap, what Black Sabbath was to Metal, the Clash to punk, etc... etc...<br /><br />As most of my friends know, I have become addicted to Jazz music over the past 5 years, but I still love Mr. Marley and I own just about every album of his.  While \\"Legend\\" may not be my favorite, this recording will always hold a special place in my heart.  This is where it all began for me and as I stated earlier, if you are new to Bob, then this is the place to start.  It's impossible for me to even fathom how anyone can not appreciate just how truly amazing this legendary great was.  His music could put a smile on anyone's face no matter what kind of sour mood their in or how much angst they are suppressing.  Sure to satisfy your soul!<br /><br />Enjoy!!!o matter what kind of sour mood their in or how much angst they are suppressing.  Sure to satisfy your soul!      Enjoy!!!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I got this new for only about 120 dollars + shipping so 130, but wow. Love this show, love the characters and actors, the show never gets old and it's one of those shows that you can always come back to the episodes and they are still just as good if not better than the first time you saw them. There is nothing like not watching Friends in like, forever and then watching the first season. It brings back memories. I love the setting and the theme! It is my favorite show, it's even better than Will&Grace which is probably the funniest show I've seen. So worth the money. You won't regret it!
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman may have labored under the title, \\"amateur historian,\\" but her work \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a must-read classic for ivory tower academics as well as casual fans of the Middle Ages alike.  She may not have written for the professors of the world, but her insight and writing ability set her apart from so many \\"professional\\" historians.    \\"ADM\\" focuses on the 14th century, which had so many trials and tribulations (such as the Black Plague, the Hundred Years' War, and papal schisms, to name a couple) that one wonders how anyone survived.  Tuchman uses the life of Enguerrand de Coucy (a French nobleman who married the daughter of England's King Edward III, who brought victory in France to the English) to frame her story, but she leaves no stone unturned as she tells the stories of high-and-low-born alike.    This is one of those rare history books that one can read for pleasure as well as edification.  Copiously researched, \\"ADM\\" still never loses its narrative power as Tuchman moves from event to event.  Far too often, the Middle Ages seem as distant as the Bronze Age, but Tuchman brings the 14th century to life as few historians ever have.  She conveys the feeling of desperation the peasantry felt during the times when the mercenaries ran rampant among them as well as the various troubles that weighed down the heads of so many nobles, priests, and warlords.      Without belaboring the point, Tuchman conveys the harsh realities of a world where the religious and secular leaders are engaged in a ruthless power struggle.  Always willing to be charitable and to find goodness where it (all too rarely) could be found, Tuchman's history is balanced yet critical.      Yes, this is a rave review.  Discount it if your wish, but I have drunk the Kool-Aid.  I strongly urge you to get this book and do the same.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Deep Impact  DVD<br /><br />Robert Duvall and Tea Leoni in a movie about a comet on a collision path with the Earth.  An ambitious reporter is investigating what she thinks is a Washington sex scandal when she accidently discovers that E.L.E. is not a girl's name.  A comet is coming to earth and it's not going to stay for supper.<br /><br />The most outstanding line IMHO in this movie is \\"I know you're a reporter, but you used to be a human being.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended for Science Fiction fans and fans of Robert Duvall and Tea Leoni.<br /><br />Gunner  February, 2008
B000BGH22W|3.0|Let me start by saying I sympathize with Patrick Doyle. Yes, a Harry Potter composer is a great gig but you have to follow three soundtracks by John Williams. Doyle has a quite respectable pedigree of smallish British films to his credit, BUT this ain't \\"Sense and Sensibility\\". You have to bring it up a notch. Unfortunately, like the film itself, the soundtrack feels to episodic; as though there are pieces missing.    Goblet starts off promising: \\"The Story Continues\\" is an excitingly dramatic  opener that deftly weaves in \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" and hints at Elfman-esque grandeur. Similarly, \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" and \\"Foreign Visitors Arrive\\" are solid tunes but from there the album devolves into atmospheric music in search of a film to accompany. Several of the songs ARE pretty in a pensive way, but its just too little.
B000AARKW6|3.0|I ate this movie for breakfast twice!!  The men were very exciting, especially the John McEnroe who played a good lawyer!!  I was scared and not sure about what was happening many times (warns: There is some dying in the first beginning and at the last part), but lucky for Al Parchino to be there!!  He made me feel safe during the movie even though he was wearing a leather jacket (like the Fonz)!!!  I was confused by him also because his eyes were looking like the owl from the cartoon - wide and scaring!!  Also, he talks like no man on the earth, and made me wonder if his Cardlito was maybe from another planet.  I think, if you are o.k. with the trickyness, that the learning of the story is that CardLeto is really from another planet, and just wants to get home with the girl.  For that he should win many statues - being the big-looking alien with the language is not easy!!!  I hold back only two stars because there was no spaceship near the end when he was talking in space - too bad!!!!
B00020HEG6|4.0|If nothing else, John Williams MUST give producers the most music for their buck. He seems to cram more notes in his incidental music than many composers put in their whole soundtracks. That being said, his soundtrack to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ranks as the best of the five movies thus far. (I'll confine my criticism of the other soundtracks to their respective pages.) Listening to the soundtracks back-to-back you can get a real feel of how eloquent POA is.    Williams starts off with the familiar Hedwig's theme (\\"Lumos!\\"), the familiar theme to all the movies. \\"Aunt Marge's Waltz,\\" though, takes us into unfamiliar territory. The Rossini-esque, darkly whimsical tune-- complete with discordant penultimate chord--conveys immediately that the movie will treading into dark waters soon. And yet we'll have fun getting there. Its the type of song you could not imagine Chris Columbus putting in the first two movies, but with the fresh direction of Alfonso Cuaron , you almost expect it.    \\"The Knight Bus,\\" a big band free for all, leads into the other darkly whimsical track \\"Double Trouble\\" (lyrics by Shakespeare). The rest of the music varies the usual Williams' brilliance from the soaring (\\"Buckbeak's Theme\\"), to the urgent (\\"Quidditch, Third Year\\"), to the heart-rendering (\\"The Patronus Light\\"). Along the way he adds koto drums, the aforementioned big band, and a touch of the Baroque to the proceedings. All in all a great collection from the master and the best of the series.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I've had this CD for several months now and am still happily listening.  No matter how often I hear it, it never fails to lift my mood, entices me to sing along, tap my hands and feet, shake my booty and grin like an idiot.    My teens, who are into rock and grindcore, absolutely love and dance with me in the car when I play the album.      The Fratellis transcend all ages and music taste.  Enjoy.
1577314808|3.0|I admit that I too began this book and could not seem to get inspired and stopped reading after the first few chapters.  A year later however, I approached the book again after studying other authors who teach about the importance of being in the \\"Present\\".  I did finish the book, however it was grueling and I found myself falling asleep while reading, which is an odd thing considering I was reading a book on how to remain \\"Present\\".<br /><br />I do believe the profound messages of the importance of being in the now could have been delivered in a much more exciting and comprehensible format, however I also believe that Eckhart Tolle has his own style of teaching that draws in his own style of students.  He promotes the ideas of consciousness which are essential in an ever sleeping world.<br /><br />I have found in my own practice of Energy Healing and Life Coaching through Rapid Eye Technology, that it is important to meet your audience at gradient in order to make any profound transformational difference in their life.  I don't believe this was achieved in \\"The Power of NOW\\", at any rate, it is not for a beginner.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Like the other Pixar offerings, everything about this film is beautifully constructed, including the characters, the voices, the backgrounds, the music (which won Randy Newman his first Oscar), and not least of all the story.  Pixar spends a lot of time and energy developing deep, textured stories that work on many levels.  Look just beneath the surface, and there might be a message lurking:    Although they're a weird looking bunch, the monsters all have oddly ordinary names, like Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan (\\"Sully\\"). They live in houses, go to work each day, and worry about romantic relationships and energy shortages.  Except for outward appearances, they're a lot like us.      To deal with the energy problem, they invade the private territory of small, dark-haired people who don't speak the language (human children), popping out of their closets, intimidating and scaring the \\"energy\\" out of them in the form of screams.  The monsters are taught that children are toxic, and any contact must be avoided at all costs.  Even a child's sock brought back into the Monster world is enough to trigger a full-scale governmental SWAT team decontamination.    Impatient with the low efficiency of the scare technology, Sully's evil arch-rival, Randall, builds a machine to forcibly suck the scream-energy right from the unwilling mouths of the children. In searching for test subjects, he inadvertently lets the human child, Boo, into the Monster world.      Sully's gradual change of heart towards Boo forms the emotional hook of the story, underscored by Randy Newman's remarkable music.  Sully pays a high price for learning to care about Boo.  His friendship with Mike is tested.  He is banished from his own land.        It doesn't take an advanced degree in geo-politics to draw some obvious inferences about what's going on here, but politics never gets in the way of the story.  The chemistry between Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) is a big part of the success of the movie, but the imaginative design and spectacular animation doesn't hurt, either.  The final action sequence is amazing.      The DVDs are full of amusing and informative behind-the-scenes footage.  Both wide-screen and full-screen versions of the film are included in the package.    All of Pixar's films are top-notch, but I think this one is at the top of the heap, bringing together a terrific story, great characters, and spectacular animation.  Five stars doesn't do it justice.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Amazing!!!! That´s all that I´m going to say... You need to see it for yourself...

0571153100|3.0|No spoilers    I'm not too sure if this novel is worthy of the magnificent reviews it is getting here on Amazon, but I'll just tell you my two cents on the matter.    The Remains of the Day is quite simply the story of self-analyzing/questioning butler Mr. Stevens as he takes a rare journey from the noble house for which he has served impeccably for decades. What I did like about this story is the journey of a man--despite being in his later years in life--finally  recognizing, understanding, and accepting the emotions capable within him. All his life he has measured his worthiness on his butlery skills, and all of a sudden he finds himself questioning that maybe there is more to himself that he otherwise was cognizant of. If you can appreciate that, then this book is worth the read.    On the other hand, I think the reason why I didn't jump out of my seat for this book is because of the incredible amount of hype surrounding it. Aside from being lauded on Amazon, it has won several literary awards as well. I must be in the minority here because this is a good novel, not a great novel. I feel like Stevens could have gone so much further into himself that what Ishiguro did, and at the end I felt almost let down by the whole venture.    I guess the bottom line would be if the first part of this review appealed to you at all, then go ahead and read it (it's only 245 small pages so you'll be finished in no time even if you find you're not into it). If you're looking for a more engrossing novel concerning the a journey of self-recognition and appreciation, this would not be it.
B000U618C8|4.0|I'm a little late jumping on the Jose Gonzales boat, but just wanted to express how much I enjoyed \\"In Our Nature.\\" Beautiful lyrics, hypnotic guitar -- the perfect soundtrack for a winter day. The Massive Attack cover was a pleasant surprise. \\"Teardrop\\" has always been one of my favorite songs, and his translation was lovely. Not too over the top, just simple and clean.    If I had one gripe, it would be that the songs sound a little repetitive after awhile. I enjoyed the variety offered by \\"Down the line,\\" and found myself craving a little more of that beat after a few of the slower melodies.    Overall, an excellent addition to my music collection. Gonzales is ridiculously talented, and I can't wait to see what he creates next.
0141439688|5.0|Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.<br /><br />Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\"  Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.<br /><br />While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.<br /><br />Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface?

B000Z27HLS|5.0|Finally!  We have a great adaptation for this story.<br /><br />I read this story years ago and I didn't understand it the first time around. Seriously, I just didn't get it. Then I read somewhere that she is mocking (in a fan way) the novels of the time. That made the story make a little more sense. Then, last year, when my husband went to the UK on business he brought me back a book that Jane Austen had read and liked well enough called Emmeline by Charlotte Smith. After I read Emmeline, I really understood Northanger Abbey. If someone is not fainting every page then it is not a good chapter.<br /><br />So having the overly dramatic Emmeline under my belt I reread Northanger Abbey, understood it, and loved it. I still wasn't sure if they would be able to translate it well to the screen. I was a little nervous.<br /><br />But after watching this, I think I can say that they used their 90 minutes very well. They only changed a few things from the book so it is very faithful to the original narrative and some of the changes actually help you understand the storyline better such as the introduction of Elinor's 'friend' earlier on in the tale.<br /><br />The only thing that I think they could have shown differently is the trip to Woodston and the last page of the book which tells what Catherine's actual claim to inheritance is. They also could have given a little more information about the deceit of John Thorpe as it intertwined with the story of General Tilney.<br /><br />I loved the actors who play Henry Tilney and Catherine Morland. They give their characters the perfect mix. I am definitely looking forward to seeing this movie again.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|I loved it.It was great.A movie showing how strong love can be and how it can last forever.A must see.
B00003CWNR|5.0|This is an excellent movie which highlights Michael Cane, Toby Mcguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo and Erykah Badu's acting skills. The cast is multicultured, colorful and seasoned. It highlights the question of abortion and adoption and what is missing in the lives of orphans: LOVE. I read the novel and bought the movie. All the book can't be in the movie, but the director did a great job of merging 2 minor characters to keep the main story flowing along. This move is one that you will add to your collection. I recommend it strongly.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I had one of these for about three months.  It worked ok initially as long as I was careful not to let all the detritus fall out of the container.  That happened a couple times -- very annoying.    The real lame part of this product is the battery, which is absolutely terrible.  There are very stringent charging requirements and even if you follow those to the letter, the battery still wears out.  I think I used mine all of a dozen times.  The whole unit went in the trash today when I discovered the battery to be dead beyond repair and that the replacements are $10.  No thanks.  I'll stick with my Dyson, even if it is bigger and heavier...  Hey, at least it works.

B000Y7U98W|5.0|I really love this movie. If you don't know, it takes place on a space ship on a mission to restart the failing nuclear powerplant that gives us life with a huge nuclear bomb. But, amazingly, that's never really the point. It's one of those great sci-fi movies that isn't itself about being in space *coughstartrekcough*. The claustrophobia of the environment, the extreme stress of being part of mission of this nature, all of that is almost palpable. It asks the question of how would one act when pushed to the limits of isolation and with the weight of all humanity on one's back.<br /><br />I also liked the change in pace near the end of the movie. It breaks things up a little, of which I'm a fan. I'll also say that every single actor brings something special to the table. Every one. That doesn't happen very often. Truly a small but amazing cast. I'm surprised that it never got the wide advertisement and release that it deserved in theaters.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is really high quality, as well. Highly recommended.
B00005JKNC|5.0|This story is absolutely beautiful... no \\"if's\\", \\"and's\\", or \\"but's\\" about it!  The cast was perfect and the story brought tears and laughter throughout the whole of it, truly touching my heart.  Ironically enough, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" had a very similar reception by the people of that day. It took a good 30 years before it caught on to the masses, and all through a fluke of nature. With this movie being so similar in the Frank Capra feel and experience, I wonder if 30 years from now, this gem might have a similar windfall. Only thing I know for sure is that no movie, cast or crew deserves it more!

B000009QO6|5.0|Over the years, I've owned so many copies of this one that it's hard to keep track but I got my first copy when I was just thirteen.  It stayed in my discman all through Junior High and High School and till this day, with the exception of maybe \\"Lucifuge\\", I don't think I've ever listented to another album more.  It also opened my eyes and got me into all different types of rock and metal.      There was something magic going on with those first two Danzig albums that he's never managed to regain.  The production by Rick Rubin was perfect for the material.  Glenn's voice was in peak form.  The lineup has never been better. I can't even imagine what it must have been like to have heard this album in 1988 for the first time, when the charts were dominated by glam and pop metal.  That may have something to do with why this one didn't get the attention it deserved until '93.      So twenty years later, it's still very much a masterpiece and it only seems to have gotten better with time.

B00104W8T6|4.0|In these days when great music often means complex, electronic music, it's nice to know there are people out there writing simple songs, picking up a guitar and producing something special. The innocent, but urgent songs that make up this soundtrack compliment the pace and subtlety of the film perfectly. I'm old enough to have bought the Kinks back in the '60s, but this - with Buddy Holly and Mott the Hoople - kind of anchor the soundtrack. I have never heard of Kimya Dawson, who is responsible for seven of the songs, but she certainly knows how to write addictive music. What's the result? Nineteen very pleasant, easy going tracks which together add up to something special.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This DVD is similar to the book that the Former Vice President Al Gore wrote and everybody should watch it. His presention of his facts regarding the global warming is a very convicing. And I think humans should start thinking about the issue.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Worth it for the finale alone.  Sets the stage for what has been, so far, an incredible season 4.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I stumbled across Porcupine Tree's music a couple of years ago and have loved every minute of the journey ever since.  I saw them play live last year and while nothing can take the place of being there in person, Arriving Somewhere is a resounding \\"next best thing.\\"  There's a great variety of songs across several different eras/albums and the mix and camera work is outstanding.  Some may not be a fan of the visual effects that go from color to black and white, and from clear to grainy, but these effects are just another winning touch that makes this DVD so memorable.  I grew up as a huge Rush fan, and while I wouldn't compare Rush's music to PT's music, the Tree has had the same effect on me that Rush did--I absolutely can't stop listening to and appreciating the music.  Other artists now pale in comparison to Porcupine Tree.  If you're a fan of great rock music and want to see an impressive band at its best, get this DVD.  You won't regret it.
0553381687|5.0|When I was given this book for a birthday present, I immediately thought I would never read it because it was HUGE!  After a couple of months, I decided to give it a go and see how far I could make it, and I'm now almost done with Book 3.<br /><br />The reason I stayed with it was Mr. Martin's incredible characters, and his amazing skill at setting the stage with lots of conflict needing resolution.  There are so many authors out there who neglect to spend time fleshing out their character's demons and introducing the reader to the world where all the action takes place.  Stories need more than just rapid fire dialog and frantic action to be truly enjoyable, and Mr. Martin definitely does not fail in this regard.<br /><br />Give it a chance and you'll find yourself rooting for several characters, mourning some, and despising the rest.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|The Swivel Sweeper is a great product, but you have to take care of it.  This is my second purchase in less than a year.  It was my mistake that caused the first one to go bad, though.  I overcharged the battery, because I just forgot to unplug the charger, or take the battery out.  I was going to buy just a new battery, but they are almost as much as a whole new unit, so I opted for the whole unit.  It's OK though, because now I have the old one for spare parts.  It works great. It goes under beds, and the coffee table, and around corners...really does everything it says on TV.

B000002MG1|5.0|This album highlights some of the best achievements in REM's musical career. This is probably their most consistent work, with most of the songs standing out. They have released a large number albums in the past few decades and there had been times when the music didn't reach the level one would expect from a band like them and judging by the standards they set. However, this album is one of REM's best (if not the best) and is an essential pick for any fan of rock. Here's a sampler:  * Drive - The opening track. Great song. Slow and somber, it sets the tone for the rest of the album.  * Everybody Hurts - One of the most popular tracks from the album. Sometimes it sounds a little whiny to me, but still a very good song.  * Man On the Moon - Another very popular song, and deservedly so. Clever, funny lyrics meet good, catchy tunes. A tribute to Andy Kaufman. If you have watched the movie 'Man On the Moon', you will definitely relate better with the song.  * Nightswimming - The masterpiece. Chris Martin of Coldplay rates this as the best rock song ever. Well, it's surely among the best. Not a doubt about that. It underlines poetic brilliance and great melody, and has a mysterious air surrounding it. And it couldn't have been sung better than in Michael Stipe's trademark vaoice. This is a timeless creation.  * Find The River - Another gem. One of the best songs you will hear and that will make you wonder why it isn't that popular or famous. Once again, amazing lyrics and melody, this song takes you on a soul trip. The perfect closing track for an outstanding album.    Quite frankly, it's the last two tracks ('Nightswimming' and 'Find the River') that elevates this album from excellent to the level of a classic. In summary, this is one of the defining albums in the history of alternative rock. You can't live without it if you are into alternative music.
B000WMEAKC|3.0|I bought this CD after hearing a couple of songs on the show Gossip Girl.  Both of those songs are great, but I'm not crazy about the whole album.  The songs I like have a different sound compared to the rest of the album - very similar to a Justin Timberlake album.
1577314808|4.0|Although I am certainly quite fond of this text, I am unfortunately hesitant to offer it a 5-star rating, simply because I felt rather uninspired by the work, but that was likely due to my own impossible-to-meet expectations. Tolle presents to the reader a spiritual philosophy that is applicable to daily life - it requires no miraculous effort or \\"spiritual exercises\\" that are so often touted, but rather surrender to life as it is. He connects with the reader throughout and offers a format that is easy to follow and enhances the individual's comprehension of its content. The book, as many have said, will change your life -- if you allow it to.
B000M341QE|5.0|Trust -- and its flip side, betrayal.  Personal, professional, familial.  Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of double-dealing, double-crossing, deceit and dishonesty, mixed in with an inordinate number of head-shot executions, in the seamy Boston underworld.<br /><br />What does the movie ultimately say about trust?  First, that there's not a whole lot of it for either cops or robbers, but second, that not all trust is misplaced, and honesty will at least be vindicated, even if it can never be fully compensated.<br /><br />But forget the movie's theme for a second.  Picture this plot: a determined, Donny Brasco-type mole inside an Irish gangster's criminal empire, combined with an equally determined dirty cop trying to find him.  Cat and mouse action, generous helpings of violence, a semi-demi-plausible love triangle, lots of coke and Chinese gangsters all make appearances in a surprisingly coherent and entertaining mix.  Great action and performances abound with the all-star cast as well.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|If you like Dr Who, you'll like Torchwood.  Slick premise, slightly futuristic yet recognizable settings, interesting characters and Captain Jack is funny and cool - the kind of guy who doesn't take himself (or the job) all that seriously.  Relationships between team members are realistic and the interplay is fascinating.
006135323X|3.0|The goal of \\"Predictably Irrational\\" is to help readers fundamentally rethink what makes them (and others tick), help them learn how to avoid some of our repetitive errors.  Works for me - .<br /><br />Most people don't know what they want until they see it in context - everything is relative. Given three choices, most will take the middle one. High-priced menu entrees boost revenue, even if nobody buys them - by creating an expensive dish, the restaurant can lure customers into buying the second most expensive choice (possibly engineered to provide higher profit margins).<br /><br />Relativity effect: Williams-Sonoma bread machine for $275 had few sales, After introducing a larger version priced 50% higher, sales jumped for the original model.<br /><br />The problem, however, is that it deals with minor issues that Toyota, G.E., Wal-Mart, etc. pricing personnel probably knew upon birth or have no use for.  Examples include:  \\"The more we have, the more we want - the only cure is to break the cycle (eg. trade in your Porsche Boxer for a Toyota Prius.\\"  A $7 discount on a $25 pen has more influence than the same discount on a $450 suit.  \\"Free\\" sometimes makes us act overenthusiastic vs. a near-free offering.<br /><br />I'd suggest something from marketing or economics on pricing instead.
B00005JPSM|4.0|This movie, although probably considered silly by many, is at least a movie that you would feel confortable watching around kids. It is both humorous and sad in spots. It is difficult to portray all of the workings of a restaurant, family and love story in 104 minutes, but it did a likeable job. The acting isn't anything great, but it is entertaining and at least it isn't filled with the type of language most movie producers feel are necessary. A welcome treat!
0060594896|5.0|As he did with Chicken Soup for the Soul, Canfield does it again with an easy to read book that takes you to the next level from mediocrity to success.  Before you change your life, you must change your thinking, and Canfield helps you to do that.  I especially like the way he intersperses humor throughout the book to illustrates his points, even using cartoons at times.  I definitely enjoyed this book, and you will, too.
B00030590I|5.0|Three different assassins, three different colors, three different points of view and three diffent and amazing duels! Does it get any better than that? Breathtaking cinematography and ballet-like fight scenes are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie. My 80-year-old mother (who hates subtitles and can't hear very well any more) loved this movie. Just when you think you understand what's happened, another point of view surfaces and you're back to square one. I love a movie where I don't see the ending coming. Historically correct? Probably not. But damn fine entertainment and isn't that what movies are about?
031237593X|5.0|Rather than a novel of Richard III, this book was the tragedy of Richard III.  I thought the writing was incredible and engrossing. Part one was a little slow, but necessary to paint the whole picture of Richard.   Overall it was a book that was well worth the time and attention.  I absolutely loved it.  The mystery of the princes in the tower combined with the circumstances surrounding Richard's death and his short reign as King, made this book one that will haunt me for a long time.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|Ok, you have to keep in mind that this kind of music is not going to be for everybody. It is very different, and in my mind, it is an acquired taste. You're not going to hear it on the radio, or on MTV, because it is music as an art form. It is not adulterated by commercialism due to the monetary interests of a record company's desire to attract that \\"younger\\" brainless audience so they can cash in and run happily to the bank. This is ARTWORK.<br /><br />With that in mind, Epica is simple an amazing band. I was disappointed for a very long time because I thought that good music had died back in the mid 90's. It took me a while to come across it again, but I found it! Yay! Their music is well orchestrated, and Simone Simons voice is incredibly beautiful. I find myself listening to this album whenever I am feeling frustrated or bummed out, because the music really helps to remember that regardless the darkness that comes around from time to time, life is truly beautiful. That is what music is supposed to do, and this is why Epica is an incredibly talented band. They create beautiful works of art.

B000Z27HLS|4.0|The two leads were terrific-- very believeable and charming!  I especially liked that this director actually took the time to show Cathy Moreland's return trip as it depicted how very dangerous it was for a single, gentile girl to undertake alone, especially at night!  It suceesfully translated the full force of General Tilney's anger at sopposedly being hoodwinked!  I also enjoyed the performance of Carrie Mulligan as Isabella.  The only thing that really annoyed me was that the voice-over at the end, made up a different epilogue. The voice over could have just as easily explained that Henry and Cathy had to wait for Gen. Tilney's acceptance as well as her parent's blessing, to get married-- which they eventually received after Tilney's sister married well and is able to persuade her father to sanction Henry's marriage. Other than that, I wholeheartedly endorse this film.  It was a delight! And Northanger Abbey isn't even in the Top 5 of my favorites of Jane Austen's 6 novels!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is my favorite Jane Austen novel; I've long since stopped trying to figure out why.  I just accept that I often feel like Anne Elliot, and have been often treated like her by family members (\\"Ask Anne for advice?  Why?\\").  It's also the most profound of her books, with themes of lost love and disappointment mixed in with the haunting images of Lyme.  This movie (a superb DVD transfer) simply astonishes on every level.  The acting is superb down to the smallest role (Mrs. Smith's nurse is a hoot!).  Amanda Root captures Anne's intelligence and lost bloom without ever begging our sympathy; she's too accomplished and intelligent a creature to enlist simple bathos.  Her transformation is so subtle, from sad soon-to-be spinster to woman in love, and yet so complete that she literally seems to come alive right before our eyes.  Ciaran Hinds is a very likeable Captain Wentworth, a true man's man but with enough sensitivity to love his male friends and not shrink from saying so--a true sign of masculine strength and security.  Sir Walter is a vain, abrasive fellow, but in the hands of Corin Redgrave remains watchable and funny; Fiona Shaw is a marvel in her few scenes as Sophie Croft, Wentworth's sister, and it's always a treat to see Judy Cornwell away from the low class frump she played so well on \\"Keeping Up Appearances\\".  Great, spare music and gorgeous cinematography complement director Roger Michell's sure hand--he never steps wrong in this splendid adaptation. Though 1995's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is a classic also, with Emma Thompson's \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" not far behind, this one stands a bit taller than the others, like Anne Elliot herself.
0439813786|5.0|This is both an incredible visual and literary journey.  I thought it was an incredible book and so did my son.  The illustrations are absolutely amazing and the story is captivating. This is a book the whole family can enjoy and treasure for years to come.

032147404X|5.0|Using my hubby's Amazon account (sorry dear) I have to voice the following:    I am in agreement about the TACK SHARP - that REALLY annoyed me.  I like Kelby's humorous conversational writing style, but there were two major \\"GOTCHA\\" attempts within the first two chapters of the book.    Keep up with the humor Scott, but, please stop patting yourself on the back over fooling the reader.  This type of stuff makes your reader lose faith in you, and also makes your reader feel like an utter moron and not want to believe anything you write.  It's almost like we're gun-shy, waiting for you, at any moment to say \\"HA! JUST KIDDING!\\" from that point on.    You are an amazing talent, and a WONDERFUL teacher.  Please don't degrade your skills and gifts with these misleading and semi-insulting attempts at humor.  Thrill us with your cornball puns and silliness, but dump the out-and-out false leads.    OK, off my soapbox.  I didn't see the need for this book.  Waiting for a kid to finish Karate practice, I went to the local B&N and got a coffee.  I picked up this book, and began reading.  I bought it so I could continue reading, and purchased book 2 as well.    Ya done good Mr. Kelby.  There was many things here I didn't know, and some were embarrassingly simple - I felt ashamed that I did NOT know them.  Lo and behold, I read the steps to sharp images.  Tripod - check, cable release - check.  Mirror lockup - yeah, uh, it's a custom function I've never used... uh ok, someday.    Last night, we had a lunar eclipse.  I raced home 1/2 through, grabbed my camera, 500mm f/4, tripod, shutter release, and off I went to a PERFECT viewing spot (nice and DARK).  Setting up, I remembered \\"Oh yeah... Kelby's mirror lockup... hmmm, yeah, lemme try that\\".  OMGOSH!    I was thrilled with some of my exposures - the moon was beautifully sharp (admittedly I did shoot a few before I remembered his advice...)    OK Scott, I am officially un-mad at you for your poor choice of humor (but don't startit up again!).   Here's a sample of an image using mirror lockup:   [...]    YES, this was worth every penny - so much so that I've recommended it to six different photographers in the two weeks I've owned it, and they've found it very useful as well.
0321525655|5.0|I will give 6 stars if I could. I am frustrated many a time reading books which are scored 5 stars in customer review. As compared to ordinary \\"5 stars\\" books, this one deserve 6 stars! Anyone who is serious about presentation should get one. I brought several copies as gift to my best friends as well.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it was a neat little story. I think it cost to much on the kindle, but I enjoyed reading it.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Completely captivating and amazing. When I saw the movie I knew nothing about it and I am glad otherwise the plot would have been ruined. So, I won't say anything about the plot.<br /><br />This is a movie that enfolds little by little as the viewer, and the characters, begin to learn what is going on. I simply can't express how much I loved this movie. It was very well done, the story was captivating and the actors' performances were engaging, completely believable and simply superb.<br /><br />The film is very well edited, the camera angles used were essential to getting to know the characters. Everything in this film is amazing. It is one engaging film, from beginning to end.<br /><br />The DVD has very few Special Features. But, be sure to watch the deleted scenes. They are preceded by an interview with the director explaining why each of them was cut out of the film.
6305897786|5.0|Johnny Depp brings real acting ability to this movie. He makes for a really interesting character - Is he just a scholar who handles rare books or something more?

B000YPUF9W|5.0|this has been a great series
B000X418UE|5.0|If there is a better action movie to come from the nineties than \\"The Rock\\", I've never seen it.  A perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama make this a film everyone should see.  Fantastic performances by Sean Connery, Ed Harris, and yes, Nicholas Cage, make this a movie you can watch over and over again, and the upgrade to Blu-ray is even better than the Criterion Collection version I have of this film.  I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of the Bruckheimer/Bay tandem, but you should see it even if you don't like Michael Bay, because this is a much deeper film than many of his others.
0517147688|5.0|[[ASIN:0517147688 Jane Austen: The Complete Novels, Deluxe Edition (Library of Literary Classics)]]<br />This is a beautiful book. Since it contains all the novels it is a handful but nicely bound with a leather cover and edge gilded pages. Since it is a weighty volume it has to be well made to stay together. I am half way through the book and it still looks like new. An incredible  bargain at this price.
1400082773|5.0|I could not put this eloquently written life and family story down; it is a wonderful book revealing keen powers of observation, expression, maturity, self-knowledge and a worldliness that comes of wide travel and exposure.  I hope that many take the time to read it, and that more of the lessons in its message can be applied to our national life.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I absolutely adore this mini-series! The filming of it was impeccable and so was the acting. Richard Armitage plays the character of John Thornton immensely well, he certainly knows how to glare, let alone make you fall in love with him!!! I just wish that there was someway to get the soundtrack to this because the music was beautiful as well!!!
0143113100|5.0|Excellent book.  This is a must read to learn about how the brain works and the myth that the brain cannot change after childhood.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I got this for Christmas and I watched a couple episodes each night until I finished the season.  I found myself recalling exactly what was going to happen in each scene and getting a crush on Jordan Catalono all over again.  I was worried I would think this show was childish now since its been over ten years since I was in highschool, but it took me back to when I watched it on TV and I related with Angela and the cast once again.  If you loved the show back then, you'll definitely love watching it again.  I only wish it had stayed on for more seasons :(

The pretty lady in the garden whom Kay sneaks periodic views of on his computer; the one who never got his bouquet of flowers.     But what happens at the end of this film? \\"Junior\\" zaps him and he is now with her. The love of his life! And that folks, will be the only thing he will ever remember after his awakening from a so-called \\"coma.\\"    So what does all this bug chasing, inter-galactic \\"keggers\\", assassinated  Arkelian princes and other worries ultimately amount to? Nothing! 'Cause no one involved ever remembers! \\"The only reason no one is afraid is because they don't know about it!\\" Kay exclaims to Will Smith (aka Junior). Us, nor anyone else for that matter.    Nevertheless this is an extremely entertaining and fast paced film that belies its maybe unintentional love interest. The action and comedy is non stop and both Smith and D'Onofrio (The Bug) are outstanding in their rolls. You won't want to stop to get some popcorn.     Don't miss this one. But just remember, it's only a love story.
0553383663|4.0|This book was pretty awesome and I couldn't put it down.  Those guys are geniuses and it sounds like everyone they hire is a genius as well.  They had a brain surgeon design their network.  Now who would have thought to do that?  How do you keep your employees from going offsite to have long lunches?  You bring in a gourmet chef and provide free meals!  Google was developed at a time when there were already big name search engines.  It just goes to show that you can build a better mousetrap.

B000001FM2|5.0|I first heard the Dixie Dregs in 1982 with the Industry Standard album (also 1982).  At the time I was really impressed with their virtuoso musicianship and eventually went on to explore other albums including Night of the living Dregs (1979) and the superb live album Bring em' Back Alive (1992).  What surprises me is how What If (1978) (nearly) passed me by; it certainly presents the band firing on all cylinders.  Better late than never I suppose.<br /><br />The lineup on What If includes master guitarist Steve Morse (electric guitar, guitar synthesizer, classical guitar), the smoking Andy West (Alembic and fretless basses); Rod Morgenstein (drums and percussion); Mark Parrish (piano, organ, electric piano, and synthesizers), and Allen Sloan (violin).  To say these guys are top notch musicians is an understatement.  There is some unbelievably complex ensemble work and the breakneck tempos that the band employs are mindblowing.  On the other hand, these guys were capable of delicate and sensitive playing as well.  In short, these are the hallmarks of excellent musicians.<br /><br />The eight tracks on this instrumental album range in length from 2:03 to 7:47 and present a mixture of Kansas-influenced progressive rock, Mahavishnu Orchestra-influenced jazz rock fusion, hard rock, classical, and country. In fact, these guys seemed to bridge the gap between bands such as Kansas and Return to Forever/Mahavishnu Orchestra.  The styles that dominate the album include the prog and jazz rock played at a neck snapping velocity - the interplay between Morse and Allen is simply unbelievable.  At the other end of the musical style spectrum is the wild country hoedown (also played at a breakneck tempo) Gina Lola Breakdown, which is a lot of fun and features virtuoso guitar and violin playing.  Although I love the wild playing on the album, my favorite pieces include the slower, mellower tracks such as the title track, Night Meets Light and the impressive classical piece Little Kids, which features a duo comprised of Steve on classical guitar and Allen on violin.  There really is a lot to absorb on this album and it is all just fantastic.<br /><br />Although this version of the album has not been remastered, the sound quality is actually fairly crisp, although there might not be as much bottom end as I would like.  There are no liner notes to speak of.  Then again, I got this copy for 89 cents so I am not complaining too loudly.  For those of you that are interested, a remastered version is available [[ASIN:B0000064TT What If]].<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent album by an exceptionally talented band.  What If is very highly recommended along with Night of the Living Dregs.ures a duo comprised of Steve on classical guitar and Allen on violin.

Morbius and his daughter are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair. Ariel is a spirit. Robby the Robot is a man-made servant. Caliban's evil does not match that of Monsters of the Id.

0765318741|3.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is not a novel, but rather a short novella that, due to the recent release of the film, has been advertised in this edition as 300-page novel. The synopsis on the back of the book describes the story \\"I Am Legend\\" and nothing more. After you complete about 150-pages of the novel, you realize \\"I Am Legend\\" is over and the rest of the book is a compilation of short stories. Unfortunately, most of these stories suck. \\"I Am Legend\\" is good, about a man named Robert Neville who is the last man on Earth. By day, he goes and gets supplies from empty stores and by night he fights off the vampires that surround his house. Than he discovers a young woman and realizes that maybe there is hope for humanity. The story inspired Stephen King, reportedly, more than any other book. \\"I Am Legend\\" is no masterpiece, but it's short and entertaining enough. The next story \\"Buried Talents\\" is short, but rather pointless and not too interesting. \\"The Nearly Departed\\" is about three pages and is terrific. The next 4 or 5 stories are rather tedious (especially the dreadful \\"Dance of the Dead\\" and overly long \\"Mad House\\"). In fact, this collection doesn't pick up until the final story \\"Person to Person\\" which is (almost better) than \\"I Am Legend.\\" You know, this book is cheap...But is it really worth buying? I don't think so. I think you're better off hitting up a local library or something. It's decent, but hardly a masterpiece.<br /><br />I Am Legend: B<br />Buried Talents: C<br />The Nearly Departed: B-<br />Dance of the Dead: F<br />Mad House: D<br /><br />ALL THE OTHER STORIES, EXCLUDING \\"PERSON TO PERSON\\": D<br /><br />Person to Person: B+
B000E97Y6A|4.0|Set in the 1930s, Kong again climbs the Empire State Building. Naomi Watts is Ann Darrow. This Kong suffers from an excess of mayhem once the adventurers arrive on Skull Island. The bug scenes are annoying, and it would have been enough for Kong to vanquish two tyrannosaurs instead of three. A consolation is that Naomi does not scream as much as Fay Wray. She develops an affection for the beast. Watts is beautiful and slides into the role naturally. The natives are more sinister than those in the original. The remake is thrilling if you can hang in for 3 hours and 7 minutes.
B0000042H4|3.0|Solti's Ring cycle is certainly one of the great achievements in the history of recorded music.  The story behind the first studio Ring is now legendary... how a young producer named John Culshaw undertook the most ambitious recording project in history to create his vision for the ultimate Ring cycle.  Boasting an all-star cast and utilizing the best available technology to its fullest potential, the final result was a Ring for the ages... or so was the general consensus.  But as time wore on and new cycles by Bohm, Karajan, and (most recently) Keilberth have become available, this set's flaws become all too obvious.    Listening to any of these Solti/Culshaw operas, one immediately has to adjust for a musical barrage of exaggerated climaxes, hyped up dynamics, and (sometimes silly) sound effects.  The result being that these great works come across as sounding too much like a typical Hollywood blockbuster. Admittedly the sound quality is often outstanding, but balances often seem ill-chosen with performers frequently on the verge of being overwhelmed by the orchestral soundscape. (Windgassen in particular is treated without much sympathy from either conductor or producer.)  In addition, Solti's obsession with rhythmic precision and excessive punctuation often seem to shortchange the more lyrical aspects of the score.  Revisiting Furtwangler on EMI or Karajan on DG as a point of comparison, one can hear how Solti prefers to deliver a sock to the solar plexus rather than gently tug at the heart strings.  This ultra-theatrical approach is impressive at first, but all those in-your-face climaxes quickly grow wearisome and come to seem unnatural.  Even worse, Solti's aggressive tempos sometimes have the opposite effect by arbitrarily slowing to a crawl and thereby robbing a particular scene of its forward momentum.  For example, check out the Forging Scene in Siegfried- perhaps the most boring on disc.  But more to the point, Solti and Culshaw's approach tends to givethese operas a rather episodic feel... more like a collection of highlights than a continuous work.    Ultimately, the litmus test for any great Ring cycle is whether it holds up well upon repeated hearings.  Unfortunately, whenever I now (try to) listen to one of these operas and once again find myself having to cope with Solti's aggressive tempos, his crude way of building climaxes, and the utter lack of subtlety, it almost always feels more like a chore than a pleasure.      I wonder how many of its devoted fans can still survive listening through the whole cycle...
B0000542D2|4.0|The first Beatles song I heard was \\"From Me To You.\\" I thought they were black. By October, 1963, I knew something was going on around this British group. In January, 1964, I saw a clip on the Jack Paar show. It was unbelievable! The Beatles were going wild! Girls were screaming and throwing jelly beans! It was their sound! It was the long hair! I started growing my hair that night. Beatle records flowed into America. The Beatles revived the rock 'n' roll of the late 1950s. John Lennon sang Chuck Berry. Paul McCartney sang Little Richard. They took it to the next level. They wrote their own songs, incredible songs! When cousin Larry and I saw \\"A Hard Days Night,\\" the theater was packed with teenage girls. They screamed for 90 minutes! We could not hear a word of dialogue. It did not matter. This was Beatlemania, and there would never be anything like it again! You Can't Do That was cut from the film. John Lennon's jealousy and possessiveness were too potent for the young audience. The Beatles made great records. Each album was a development with Lennon leading the way. After the split, Lennon joined the peace movement. He was gunned down on the street in New York City in December, 1980, by a deranged fan named Mark David Chapman. He was finishing his first album in five years, an album which showed his domestic side.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great series and it comes in a very unique case. Highly recommend it.
6302508878|5.0|Most classic movie of all. Movie maker Robert Armstrong hires Fay Wray to be his star. They sail to Skull Island in Indonesia where evolution has gone awry. Dinosaurs roam, and a gigantic ape rules. Natives have built a wall to contain King Kong. They capture Wray and offer her as a sacrifice. Armstrong and his crew rescue her and transport Kong to Manhattan's Great White Way as a headliner. He breaks loose and terrorizes yet another island. He climbs the Empire State Building with Wray and is riddled with bullets from planes. He falls to his death. King Kong is a film which touches modern consciousness. It shows man clashing with the nature of which he is a part. There are interracial overtones. Armstrong declares, &quot;It was beauty killed the beast.&quot; Fay Wray lived with the film and finally accepted it as a classic.
0736063684|4.0|This is an excelent book to have in mind and not only on your book shelf,i strongly recommend it for those who really intersted in bodybuilding. But the only thing that i didn't enjoy is that it doesnt tell you the muscle that does most of the work for an excercise. For instance in bench press, it highlights all the chest muscle and doesnt specify the middle one.
B00008972S|4.0|Gangs clash in New York, new immigrants versus old immigrants. Natalie Wood is miscast as an Hispanic. Natalie was a mediocre actress but managed to endear herself. Her real name was Natasha Gurdin. Her parents came from Russia. This movie is an American Romeo and Juliet. \\"Tonight\\" is its best song. We feel the anticipation. Cousin Larry and I saw it in November, 1962. President Kennedy was due in Louisville, and I suggested we stay over to catch a glimpse. He came riding down 4th Street perched atop the back of a Convertible, waving to the crowd. That kind of accessibility cost him a year later when he was assassinated in Dallas. I will always link Kennedy with West Side Story.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum runs more rapidly than your player can handle. I expected smoke to vent out from the back of my television as Jason Bourne tears around the planet trying to discover his true identity.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass is turning out be an exceptional director. Can he do anything wrong? Matt Damon seems to pop up in a few films now again but he is firmly on the right ground when it comes to his Bourne character, and its worth waiting for. When it comes to summer movies, Bourne has its rightful place, and yes, after all these years, Bond does have a challenge on the table.<br /><br />There is lots of high-tech on display; detective work that would take Kojak weeks to solve is done in a few seconds, sleeper cell agents and assets suddenly spring to life and this time even manage to get the better of Bourne in several high intensity sequences, including Bourne leaping from the roof and smashing through a window before exploding into one of the best hand to hand combat action sequences enough to have ever Bruce Less fan rewinding that sequence over and over again. This is great action with a great story through and through. Don't miss it. Movies where made for films like this.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|Truly the best soundtrack of 2007, this is even better than dario's Marianelli pride and prejudice.<br />favorite track: Elegy for Dunkirk

0143038583|5.0|Incredible! A must read for all..even those not involved in the food and wine business. Gives you the facts and leaves it to you to make your own decisions about what you put into your body..
1569242739|5.0|Isa and Terry have a made a delightful book! It is a straightforward and simple cookbook that's incredibly versatile. Their hard work and dedication to putting out a good product practically jumps off the pages and not to mention those pictures! I'd recommend this book to anyone vegan or not. All the cupcakes have a wonderful flavor that can be equaled (and possibly exceed) their non vegan counterparts.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Outstanding and probing tale of space exploration and its psychological and philosophical dimensions.  If you were a high achieving scientist or astronaut and in space for close to two years, you would be a little tense also. Excellent audio commentaries (especially the physicist).  Highly recommended.

B0010ZR160|4.0|Ben Affleck's directorial debut surprised just about everyone by actually being quite good, although given his source material (the fine thriller by Dennis Lehane) and his suerplative cast its almost impossible to see how much damage he even could have done had his direction been terrible. (It's actually terrific, and he has a fine painterly sense of composition.) The film is concerned with the abduction of a four year-old girl from her drugged-out mother (Amy Ryan) in Dorchester, the poverty-stricken working class suburb right adjacent to the South End of Boston; Lehane's two young detectives/lovers, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angela Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) are hired by the girl's aunt (Amy Madigan) to find her. The story involves not only a careful look at what is best for our children but what it means to be a grown-up and make responsible ethical decisions; Lehane shows great intelligence as a moral thinker which he couples very well to his exciting skills as a storyteller. The screenplay, also by Ben Affleck (with Aaron Stockard) is not quite at the level of everything else in the film and betrays some novices' errors: the characters call each other by their first names too often in the opening scenes, for example, and a key sequence at an abandoned quarry during the night is not executed very clearly in narrative terms. And the relationship between the two detectives seems greatly underwritten. But you couldn't do much better than this cast: Amy Ryan has garnered the most praise for her thoroughly believable monster of a mother, but the rest of the cast--Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman (here allowed to be more multidimensional than he is in his usual saintly roles), and particularly Amy Madigan--are just as remarkable.
B00009W0U4|1.0|There are enough negative reviews here to warn anyone. Yet when reading through them, I somehow missed the gist of what this film offers and was swayed by the artsy, oh-so-shocking and profound admiration of the Mapplethorpe worshiping crowd. Stay away. This film offers the most unrelenting view of the decayed side of humanity since, well, I don't know since what.<br /><br />The swirling camera will induce nausea. The pounding and irritating soundtrack will oppress and annoy. But the content of this film, where life's grimmest losers with nothing interesting to say say it, will unfortunately remain long in the mind. Why would anyone subject themselves to watching such a lurid and grotesque tale? And what is it with Monica Bellucci and violent beatings?<br /><br />There are no good people here, just vicious and selfish and self-absorbed and deceitful and vain animals who have no currency but sex and violence. That's why we spend ten minutes watching the rape of a woman and at least three watching someone get his head bashed in, complete with nice crunching sounds, in a ninety minute film. There is nothing else. No one in this slimefest has a thought other than \\"What can I get and how can I get it?\\"<br /><br />Why people choose to live such lives I cannot imagine. (And I write that knowing they would say the same about me.) But why I, or anyone, would want to visit this place, I can even less understand. A foul and nasty look at a world where filth and nastiness are all there is. Thank goodness we can choose to live elsewhere.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I love this series. And what a great plot! A passenger jet crashes on an island in the middle of the Pacific. There are survivors. They must all learn to live together to survive. They are not alone on the island. Some mysterious forces loom all around them. Some miracles happen: a paralyzed person suddenly walks (John Locke). Desmond gains the ability to see the future. Rose had cancer and now is in remission. Jin was sterile and now is not. The sperm count of the men on the island is way above normal. There are others; other humans are on the island. Some have crashed on the island; some have come on their own free will. What is the significance of the numbers? What is going on? What is going on?    Indeed, what is going on? We are told towards the end of this season that the outside world has stopped searching for them, presuming them all dead. In fact, their airplane was found off the coast of Indonesia undersea. So are they dead? Are they spirits? Does the world know of the existence of the island? Who are the others?     Season 3 finally tells us who the Others are, but there are still many unanswered questions.     The following is a spoiler so stop reading if you have not seen the show yet: Season 3 ends with them being rescued, but with Jack wanting to return to the island. He flies every week across the Pacific hoping his jet will crash, and return him to the island. Why? We'll have to wait for Season 4. The writers actually took a big risk with such an ending. Season four will either live up to our expectations, or will not. Apparently, it was announced that there are three more Seasons, so the show will end with Season six.    I truly liked the character of Juliet, and I think her and Jack make a perfect match. I just hope the writers don't kill her off like they do with all new characters they introduce. For example, the survivors of the tail section were all killed-off except one. Nikki and Paulo were also killed-off. In fact, having them buried alivewas quite eerie.    Why do the writers kill-off characters? Is it to make the story more realistic and captivating? This is not necessary the case. In this Season Mr. Eko was killed reportedly because he was hated by all his fellow cast members and he hated them all in return. Nikki and Paulo were killed-off because the fans of Lost hated them. The human element does change the storyline!    This is a captivating Season, and I have been a fan since Season 1. Every time questions are answered new ones appear. The acting is superb, and the characters very believable. This is a first rate show, and you can't get any better. There is not one episode I did not enjoy. You never feel like the writers just lost grip of the storyline and threw in an episode as filler. You will find yourself won over by the cast and the plot.    On a funny note, one reviewer writes, \\"Why is Hurley still fat? Two years of being stranded on an island should work wonders for obesity unless one of the revelations is that there is an invisible McDonald's there.\\" One reviewer answers back, \\"They haven't been on the island for two years when Season 3 ends; it's only been about 90 days. Plus, Hurley has an eating disorder that he feeds with private stashes of Dharma Initiative candy bars, peanut butter, and other high fat/high calorie snacks.\\"
0374105235|4.0|\\"A Long Way Gone\\" is an amazing story that puts you in the shoes of a boy solider. He starts out with a normal life, but when rebels attack he ends up on the run, being separated from his family. Throughout the story, he runs and escapes, but commits to being a solider to avenge the group that killed his family. Hooked on drugs to not be as tired or alarmed by the blood and bodies, he starts to become addicted to violence. Finally sent to rehab, he struggles to recover, and get back to ordinary life. In the end, he finds relatives and ends up with his Uncle's family and speaks to the UN about the conditions in his country.   As reading isn't a favorite hobby of mine, the book seemed somewhat long. But as the story had very interesting points, those kept me reading. Ishmael Beah really does a good job describing the setting of the wars he suffered through.Some parts when he was describing the horrible scenery, I couldn't believe something that bad was possible, and had to read the section over and over to let it sink in. It was a good book to show that not everywhere is as peaceful as the U.S.. I would recommend it in a heartbeat.

B000SUKPKM|4.0|It's not the best idea to get to know a band by way of a greatest hits album. It's the Cliff Notes approach to music, worthy only to the degree that it leads to deeper immersion.<br /><br />My son gave me this CD for Christmas. Prior to this, I knew the Goo Goo Dolls mostly via the preternaturally beautiful  `Better Days'. But I'm beginning to get it.<br /><br />They could have chosen no better tune from their repertoire to introduce the album than `Let Love In'. The driving drums, the brooding but persuasive lead vocals, the trademark harmonization that you only really penetrate on a fifth hearing or so, they're all present and accounted for in this first track. A guy wants to hear more.<br /><br />The Dolls oblige with `Dizzy', a very different, edgy, unleashed kind of sound employed as a paean to rough love, after which they work their way through a number of sturdy pieces before settling on the `Feel the Silence'. This tune leans towards the more balladesque end of the GGD continuum, yet with a punch energy that is altogether convincing. The lyrics wax evocative and mildly drunk with well-spoken pathos, an almost creedal statement of Complicated Love:<br /><br />You lie awake at night<br />With blue eyes that never cry<br />All you remember now<br />Is what you feel<br /><br />The truth remains<br />In midnight conversations<br />I asked for this moment<br />But you turned away<br /><br />Sad like a lonely child<br />Broken the day you're born<br />I held the light to you<br />But I was so vain<br /><br />And you remain<br />A promise unfulfilled<br />I ask you for more<br />But you push me away<br /><br />And if we feel the silence<br />Holding this all inside<br />Everything means more now than<br />Words could explain<br /><br />And if we feel the silence<br />Holding this all inside us<br />Looking for something more to say<br />I don't know where I'm going<br />Only know where I been<br />But you move through my soul like a hurricane wind<br />We've been so lost for so long<br />I don't know how to get back again<br />And we're drowning in the water<br />That flows under this bridge<br />When you're fighting the current<br />You forget how to live<br />And I wanted to reach you but I don't know where to begin<br />And you remain<br />A promise unfulfilled until today<br /><br />And if we feel the silence<br />Holding this all inside<br />Everything means more now than<br />Words could explain<br />And if we feel the silence<br />Leaving this all behind us<br />When it's gone what will you say<br /><br />How do we hold on<br />How do we hold on<br />How do we hold on<br />How do we hold on<br />How do we hold on<br /><br />You lie awake at night<br />With blue eyes that never cry<br /><br />Could there be a more complete and provocative juxtaposition of two hits than this melancholy ode followed by the battered-but-still-alive hope of the band's finest hit. That would be `Better Days', whose melody any Goo Goo Dolls fan is probably already humming:<br /><br />And you ask me what I want this year<br />And I try to make this kind and clear<br />Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days<br />Cuz I don't need boxes wrapped in strings<br />And desire and love and empty things<br />Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days<br /><br />So take these words<br />And sing out loud<br />Cuz everyone is forgiven now<br />Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again<br /><br />And it's someplace simple where we could live<br />And something only you can give<br />And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive<br />And the one poor child that saved this world<br />And there's 10 million more who probably could<br />If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them<br /><br />So take these words<br />And sing out loud<br />Cuz everyone is forgiven now<br />Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again<br /><br />I wish everyone was loved tonight<br />And somehow stop this endless fight<br />Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days<br /><br />So take these words<br />And sing out loud<br />Cuz everyone is forgiven now<br />Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again<br />Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again<br /><br />After hearing these anthemic pieces a reviewer's quota of times, this greatest hits album has done its job: I'll be listening to more of the Dolls.
B0011NVC98|3.0|I'm an English teacher. And I really want to like this movie. I have a blu-ray player, and when it comes out on blu-ray, I will probably get it, because I'm sure it will look awesome on my tv.    I'm sure that after watching it several times more, it will grow on me, and I will like it more than I did when I was in the theater. But when I saw it in the movies, I was disappointed, because it is a creation based on the Beowulf story, but not a definitive Beowulf tale. He lies, he cheats, and he feels guilty for the rest of his life.     Hamlet was a successful tragic hero. This Beowulf is a hero-turned unsuccessful tragedy. It's supposed to be a heroic tale, not a tragic one.    Hollywood Beowulf: I'm surprised at Zemeckis. I can't show it to my students, so I can't help but be disappointed. What we can do, however, is watch it and get excited about how fun it is to eat food, drink alcohol, and get naked with somebody you love!
B000002U8G|5.0|If you were going to buy just one Pink Floyd CD, you'd have to go with Dark Side of the Moon, simply because it's one of the most unique and undeniably great rock albums ever made.  But if you are going to buy another, Meddle is the one to get.  It's the band's finest *musical* effort in which the lyrics, pioneering aural effects, and musicianship balance each other without one or two dominating the way they do on all the other albums.  Ticking clocks and beating hearts, perfectly suited as they are to DSOTM, aren't music.  And the increasingly sardonic lyrics in their subsequent albums became more famous - and overbearing - than the tunes.      Meddle, as other reviewers have pointed out, lay at the turning point of Pink Floyd's musical development.  They shook off the excessive avant-garde noises from the Syd Barrett era but kept the sense of experimentation, disciplining their electronic toys to stay within conventional musical formats.  There are shades of the earlier space rock (the opening track, \\"One of These Days\\", ties into Ummagumma's \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\" with the same musical buildup and single lyric near the end).  And the \\"Echoes\\" suite at the end hints at the album-length explorations so astonishingly perfected on Dark Side of the Moon.    Everything on Meddle is music, with thoughtful (and playful) lyrics, and the occasional sonic effect that sets the mood of the pieces without overwhelming the song itself.  So buy this album to hear what Pink Floyd could do when they realized just how talented a band they actually were and didn't (yet) have to try and live up to a masterpiece.

The mysterious 12th Century Medieval story of a criminal incident that took place in the woods--Bandit Tajomaru's(Toshiro Mifune) alleged rape of Masako (Machiko Kyo) and murder of her Samurai Husband (Masayuki Mori), as witnessed (in flashbacks) by four individuals.  Those four individuals are The Bandit, The Woman, The Dead Man through a medium's testimony, and A Woodcutter (Takeshi Shimura)    This is Akira Kurosawa's greatest cinematic masterpiece about the nature of truth.

B00001X591|4.0|I find this to be a very good performance--were I able I'd give it 4 and a half stars.  Those who like a good, tasteful period performance should be quite satisfied.  That said, this reviewer often prefers a bit of extra verve, without going overboard as some young groups do these days.  Rachel Barton's La Stravaganza is the finest example in this regard.  This disc, however, does not have that added punch.  Another reviewer attributes this to Albinoni himself, but that is absurd.  It seems rather that Hogwood & Co. were going for a solid, 'historically accurate' performance where the composer 'speaks for himself.'  They approach this ideal as well as one arguably can, but at the same time perhaps so does Barton.<br /><br />The accoustic is very good, if somewhat sparse.  The ensemble is set slightly to the background of the soloist, which thereby stands out just a bit too much.  It does allow for nice languishing on the oboe melodies, however, which may be precisely the point.<br /><br />There are moments of great beauty, as one should expect of old Tomaso, on this album.  Yet the cost remains a bit high.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Casey Affleck is having a great year in the movies, what with his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for \\"[[ASIN:B0010DR4BO The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]\\" and his stellar performance in \\"Gone Baby Gone.\\"  I think Affleck would have been a shoe-in for the Oscar for the former role (it really is the lead part in the film, much more so than Brad Pitt's Jesse James), if he were not up against Javier Bardem's performance in \\"[[ASIN:B00118T63C No Country for Old Men]],\\" but arguable what he does in the latter film is of more importance for his career because two points define a line segment.  Casey Affleck can do more than broadly drawn character comedy and here is the proof.<br /><br />It does not take long watching \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" to be reminded of \\"[[ASIN:B0001ZX0OW Mystic River]],\\" another crime thriller set in Boston, which is not surprising since both novels were written by Dennis Lehane.  The key difference is that \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is the fourth of (to date) five novels by Lehane about the private investigator team of Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan).  Their area of specialization is tracking down missing people, which is to say deadbeat dads and the like.  So when they are approached by Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel (Titus Welliver), about helping in the investigation regarding their missing niece, Amanda, the two PIs feel they are in over their head.  But a little girl from the neighborhood is missing, and they want to do what they can to help.  After all, Bea thinks a couple of locals can get do a better job of digging around Dorchester for answers.  It does not take long for them to find out this is not going to be an easy case.<br /><br />This is especially true because Amanda's mother, Helene McCready (the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan), turns out to have been a pathetic figure long before her daughter disappeared.  When Kenzie and Gennaro find out what her particular package of problems happens to be, they start looking at the case in a whole new light, trying to make sense of it all in time to save the little girl.  No more need be said about the plot and if this is not enough to persuade you to check out the film then notice that the supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, and John Ashton.  Anytime Freeman or Harris make a movie I am inclined to check it out when it is released on DVD, so having both of them in the film is a really good sign that this one might be something special.<br /><br />I really liked this movie (a lot more than last year's Best Picture winner \\"[[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]]\\"), although I wonder if I had an advantage during the opening act because I already knew that Casey Affleck act having seen his other big movie of 2008.  If you keep thinking about the bratty kid from \\"[[ASIN:6305216088 Good Will Hunting]]\\" and lesser fare then it might take you a while to accept Affleck carrying the heavy load, although Monaghan, his character's \\"better half,\\" is providing ample support along the way.  Because older brother Ben both directed the film and co-wrote the script with Aaron Stockard, there is a tendency to think that the first-time director is looking out for his little brother.  But to be fair, this movie works because the Afflecks have a high regard for the Boston in which they grew up, and they are just being true to their neighborhood.  You do not need to listen to the commentary track by the director and his co-writer to know this is the case, because there is ample evidence on the screen.  I suppose there is no particular motivations for the Afflecks to do another one of novels in this series for the big screen, but it would be nice given how well they did on this one.to be, they start looking at the case in a whole new light, trying to make sense of it all in time to save the little girl.

B00005JKGK|5.0|I am in love with the beauty of this film. I love seeing the relationships between each mother and daughter. How the mothers tried so hard to make their daughters a certain way, to have a better life, and the daughters reacting negatively to it. I love see all the stories, even though a lot are heartwrenching. It's well acted and the musical score is beautiful. A warm, tearjerking movie.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Murder. Cannibalism. Death. Obsession. Revenge. Blood. Goth makeup. And lots of razors -- \\"at last, my arm is complete again!\\" Sweeney Todd exults.<br /><br />Somehow it doesn't come as a shock to me that Tim Burton adapted Stephen Sondheim's musical \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- or that he somehow spun it into something so delicious. That dark, grotesque, hilariously melodramatic story is perfectly suited to Burton's style, and Johnny Depp is absolutely stunning as the titular bloody barber.<br /><br />The malignant Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) lusts after the wife of Benjamin Barker (Depp), so he convicts Barker of a crime he didn't commit, and enfolds his family into his evil hands.<br /><br />But fifteen years later, the Barker returns to London and sets up a barber shop over Mrs. Lovett's ghastly meat pie store. Of course, he's enraged when he learns that his wife was raped and since poisoned herself, and that his daughter is the ward of the lecherous Judge. Enraged and maddened, Barker renames himself \\"Sweeney Todd\\" and vows revenge.<br /><br />And he finds that he LOVES using his razors for a far bloodier task than shaving. With the help of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) -- who finds a thrifty use for those bodies -- Todd cuts a bloody swathe through all who have wronged him. And when his daughter is punished for refusing to marry the cruel Judge, Sweeney closes in to get his revenge at last.<br /><br />There's always been a gothic look to Burton's movies, and he's always dabbled in very twisted, macabre storylines. And he really tops himself with \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" -- London is painted in black, white and grey, right down to the ghoulish faces of the characters, and their bleak little dens of horror. And songs -- lots of magnificently horrible songs.<br /><br />But Burton pretty obviously adores the combination of gory grotesquerie and very, very sick humour (\\"They don't commit sins of the flesh, so it's pretty fresh\\"). And he doesn't try to make Sweeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully. While we sympathize with Sweeney's losses, and the horrors that have changed him into the Demon Barber, you just can't pass over scenes where they sing, \\"It's man devouring man, my dear!\\" \\"Then who are we to deny it in here?\\"<br /><br />There are some moments that relieve this gory gothic parade -- there's a sweet love story between Sweeney's daughter and a young sailor. And the plot becomes progressively darker toward the end (yes, it CAN get worse), when the plot throws us some shocking new twists, resulting in a Grecian-tragedy finale soaked in even more gore.<br /><br />Oh yes, there's blood. Tons of it. It spurts like Monty Python's bloodier sketches, which ends up being more hilarious than yucky -- as is the casual introduction of cannibal meat pies. And there are some spectacularly gross moments, like a finger found in one of the pies.<br /><br />Burton uses some of his favorite actors in this one, particularly Depp and Bonham-Carter. Depp is THE perfect ideal Sweeney Todd -- his creepy eyes, pallid face and still, almost seductive manner are perfect for the maddened murderous barber. He goes through the movie slashing his razors at the world, and injects a real creepiness into scenes like Sweeney cooing at his \\"friends.\\"<br /><br />While she's only a passable singer, Bonham-Carter is eerily wholehearted as Todd's equally amoral partner-in-crime, who is quite happy to assist him.... and make tastier pies in the process. Rickman is wonderfully loathsome as the Judge, and Sacha Baron Cohen has a small but priceless role as Pirello, a huckster acquaintance of Todd's who starts causing trouble. He really steals his scenes.<br /><br />Most directors would have prettified, sanitized and defanged the grotesque \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\" but Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revel in the gore and madness. Astoundingly great.Sweeney or Mrs. Lovett palatable, thankfully.

1843104954|5.0|I bought this book to learn more about my daughter who has been diagnosed with Asperger´s. I must say that this book is about her life. What I have allready learned through the years when coping with her special way of thinking is really explaned in this book. I would advise anyone who comes in contact with a person with Aperger´s, whether a child or adult to read and learn. It will help the `Aspie`, for you will be able to communicate on the right level. It prevents misunderstandings in communication and you will have a much better relationship. Be it in family or other relationships such as school or work.
1569242739|5.0|I have used many vegan books for baking and this is the best! I have made the carrot cake, chocolate and red velvet so far and they were all delish. I have served them for my daughter's birthday and preschool class which requires them to be dairy, egg and nut free for the kids with allergies. They all loved them, as does the teacher and all the parents. I've made the vegan cream cheese frosting - delicious! and the vegan buttercream - also wonderful. As far as I can tell, these recipes are fool proof - they were obviously extensively tested. I did get an oven thermometer as recommended since I have an old oven, there was a 25 degree difference, FYI. Another note - I sub all the AP flour for a mix of spelt and kamut as we do not eat white flour - they still come out perfectly, I just reduce the cooking time by about 2 minutes so that they are not dry.  ** After reading the other reviews, I felt compelled to add a few notes:  1. even though the introduction is extensive, you can skip all that information and still make awesome cupcakes.  2. The only things that I use to make these are two bowls, one large, one medium, a spatula or large spoon, measuring cups, measuring spoons, a cupcake pan (which I usually just spray with non-stick/flour), the oven, and the ingredients.  3. regarding ingredients - almost everyone has flour, oil, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, baking soda and baking powder. At least, if you bake, you do. The other flavor cupcakes (like green tea) require specialized ingredients, but they are specialized cupcakes, so that's to be expected. With the exception of ganache, most of the frostings require either Earth Balance, vegan shortening or better than cream cheese - something along those lines... but most vegans who bake have these things around anyway. Some of the extracts require a special trip to the store, but usually you can just add more vanilla, unless it's an integral flavor (like orange in orange - chocolate cupcakes).  4. Regarding the \\"health\\" of the recipes... they are cupcakes. If you want something *totally* healthy, then you need a muffin cookbook, not a cupcake book. You could certainly make substitutions for the oil and reduce the sugar... but they are meant to be cupcakes :)  5. EVERYONE who has eaten one of these cupcakes has loved it, and that includes my carnivore sister who didn't have ANY idea that they were free of eggs and dairy.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|This is definitely David Gilmour's best solo album, I LOVE that song \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" and the other songs are great, too! Definitely worth getting if you love David Gilmour's voice and guitar-playing. He really did wonderfully on this album!
B000W1V5OC|5.0|Seriously, anyone who comes to this page knows nightwish is awesome. This is one of their best DVD's imo. i have End of innocence as well, but this one is about the music. Wonderful performances, pretty good cinematography...and...awesome outfits/hair. They really get into this performance and push the envelope. When the indian comes on stage, it sounds really awesome as well. BUY THIS :P
0385504209|4.0|I wanted to become the final person on the planet to read this book since September 2005 when it became the source of a spirited discussion between fellow Gulf Coast volunteers about Christianity and history.  Then, when the movie came out, I made a pact with my friend Kelly that we would read both read it, then go to the movie and talk about it.<br /><br />First off - yes, it's a page-turner. Kelly described it as \\"like crack (not that I've tried crack),\\" and stayed up to the wee hours on workdays unable to put it down.  I read it 40 pages at a time, which is roughly 20 pages more than I can usually read in one sitting.<br /><br />The history behind it - well, it's probably shaky.  I would tend to side with the book against all its Christian detractors, but that probably says more about my disdain for fundamentalist zealots than my belief in the book's claims. I think most people's beef is with the epigraph he includes, which basically says that while the plot is fiction the historical basis is true. This is itself a little arrogant, being as Brown didn't even know much about the Priory of Sion or Opus Dei before the year or two of research he did for this book. Personally, I put this on the same level with the Coen Brothers' assertion at the beginning of Fargo that it was a true story - a plot device to ellicit reader trust and empathy for the characters.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.<br /><br />Whatever it was, it worked for me.  I bit Brown's historical revisionism hook, line and sinker (a little foreshadowing for my next review), mainly because he is a master plot architect.  In terms of twists and revelations, he knows when to hold 'em and he knows when to fold 'em.<br />I think maybe the greatest reason for all the flak from the church about The Da Vinci Code comes down to the fact that the book is an excellent piece of creative myth-making, and the church don't need no new myths - the old ones have done them just fine so far.  Stephen Pinker in The Language Instinct repeats the old adage that language is just dialect with an army; I would say the same comparison could be made between religion and myth. Every religion starts as myth, hardens with time and statute into doctrine, then claims itself as truth, beyond doubt or question.  The Da Vinci Code, if nothing else, is one big meaty question, wrapped in a brain-candy plot.<br /><br />About the movie - IT SUCKS. Big time. It forgets the big question in favor of rushing through the major plot points, and ends up more a summary than an adaptation.  I actually took a call outside the theater halfway through the movie, balanced my checkbook, and could tell exactly what was about to happen in the movie when I returned a half-hour later. It does take the liberty of changing the ending, a silly choice that I was left wondering why, and not in a good way.epeats the old adage that language is just dialect with an army; I would say the same comparison could be made between religion and myth.

B00009NHC5|5.0|THE definitive thriller of the late 60'S, this movie is timeless, because its theme is timeless. Arkin plays the  role of an old style villain, using any and alll means to win back a drug filled doll. He partners with Crenna and the ubiquitous Weston, using murder first, intimidation second, then 2 more murders of his devious cohorts,  before taking on Hepburn, superlatively playing a blind woman. Hepburn uses every trick in the book, trying to keep her antagonists from finding the doll, which her boy scout husband Zimbalist had had slipped into his possession on a trip to Montreal.This reviewer remembers the lights in the theater being gradually lowered to accentuate the shocking final scenes.One wonders why anyone at any age,with a decent heart,would not be brought back to this classic today, tomorrow, anytime.
B00104W8T6|5.0|These unique songs were obviously very carefully chosen for this soundtrack fit the movie \\"Juno\\" exactly right. There are no over-achievers on this soundtrack. There is no \\"background\\" music. With one minor exception, every song is a song you will want to listen to and explore the lyrics. While there exists a general sense of amateur production to most of the music, it is refreshing, honest, simple and effective in lyric and composition.  I've been listening to it non-stop since I've purchased it and recommended it to everyone from my 60 year old parents to my 24 year old brother and everyone in between.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Finch won a well deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Howard Beall, a highly disturbed news anchorman, whom the network uses to increase its ratings.Holden, his supposed best friend, has too many problems of his own to urge Finch to receive the psychiatric help he needs. Chief among Holden's problems is Dunaway, a power hungry runaway train who's been directly responsible for his firing. Nevertheless, Holden has an affair going with her, a relationship that has no rational sense. Then, we have Duvall in his prime, convincingly portraying a man who's just staged a coup d'etat. All goes reasonably well until Beall's ratings begin to drop. Enter corporate chair Arthur Jensen, giving Beall one of Hollywood's great all time lambastings. When ratings continue to drop, it's Dunaway who indirectly delivers the bad news. This movie will always stand up because its main themes of money, power, and sex are timeless. It's about time you saw it.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|i seen this on tv and i loved it i had to buy i liked all who were in the movie and i liked the first one too
B000N6TX22|5.0|I was really impressed with this movie. Great story, great scripting, excellent execution, and terrific editing. This is a 5 star film that anyone will love. The score is amazing too. My only complaint is that if you're expecting to see Julianne Moore play a big role in the movie, she doesn't.<br /><br />Love it. Buy it if you haven't.
B000I5X81K|3.0|I thought Josh's first two CDs were fantastic.  While not terrible, this one was definitely a step down.  His voice is as beautiful as ever, but most of the songs didn't work for me.  Neither did some of the stylistic choices.  The inclusion of Ladysmith Black Mambazo as a background chorus, for instance.  Not that their singing is bad, but it isn't a good stylistic mesh with this type of music.  This is particularly evident in \\"Weeping.\\"  When the chorus suddenly jumps in two thirds of the way through, it feels so random and out of place it's almost silly.  It works a little better in \\"Lullabye,\\" but even then it feels a bit heavy-handed and intrusive.  It's as if the CD's producers no longer trust Josh's voice and music to stand on its own, they have to dress it up somehow.  Personally, I thought these songs would have been better without the extra singers and stylistic frills.    Other songs (\\"You Are Loved,\\" \\"In Her Eyes\\") are competently written, yet feel somehow lifeless, as if they're just going through the motions.  To be fair, I guess they're no more cliched than some of his earlier songs, but those earlier songs had some indefinable quality that made them come to life, made them the kind of songs you could listen to over and over without getting bored.  I still listen to his first two CDs, but I have a feeling I won't be listening to \\"Awake\\" very much in the future.    I will still buy any future CDs that Josh Groban makes, and his voice is always a pleasure, but this one was just an average listen for me.
B000RF7XZI|5.0|Incredible movie from start to finish. Cate is one of those actresses that I'd watch read the phone book. I thought they lessened Geoffrey Rush's character a bit in this film but I loved it nevertheless. I give it 5 stars and I think you will too!
B00104W8T6|5.0|I got this cd after I saw the movie, which I thought was great.  I love them both!  It was a gift for Valentine's Day, how appropriate.<br /><br />The songs make you feel good and they make me smile.  The lyrics are goofy and it is just great music that makes you feel great.<br /><br />I am definitely telling all my friends to get it.  My favorite song: Expectations by Belle and Sebastian, with Cat Power's cover of Sea of Love in a close 2nd!
B00005K3NY|5.0|One of David Cronenberg's finest mashes of science fiction and pure horror, Scanners remains one of his most frightening and original films to date.  Stephen Lack plays Cameron, a homeless vagrant who can hear other people's thoughts in his head.  Soon enough, he is captured by mad scientist Dr. Ruth (The Prisoner's Patrick McGoohan) and learns that he is a \\"scanner\\": a human with vast, telekinetic powers that are literally mind blowing.  When an even more powerful scanner (Michael Ironside) unhatches a plot for worldwide domination, Cameron goes hot on his trail, which leads to an inevitable, bloody showdown.  Though not all elements of Scanners have aged particularly well, the film still holds up nicely almost thirty years later, and the special effects do for the most part as well, with the infamous \\"exploding head\\" scene ranking among one of the best effects sequences of the era and genre.  Even though there were a whole series of vastly inferior sequels and spin-offs, David Cronenbergs' original Scanners is a masterpiece from one of the most brilliant minds to ever grace the science fiction and horror genres.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|An unbelievable and exceptionally well computer animated Christmas story that is destined to be a classic. Highly recommended.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again and couldn't decide what I liked so much about it.  In many ways the movie could be called sick if seen through the eyes of someone who views it at face value.  However, on closer inspection, the movie is a fantastic satire on yuppies and 80's life in general.  Along with this, I believe that this could be the greatest movie in Bale's career.  He gives a perfect portrayal of Patrick Bateman in the movie.  His detached uncaring attitude is perfect and now I can't think of Patrick Batemen without seeing Christian Bale.
0790731940|5.0|Mel Gibson, Jody Foster and James Garner do justice to this old classic. Highly entertaining and can be watched several times.
B000UX6THK|1.0|Twin Peaks is one of my favorite all time series. However, skip the Gold Box Edition if you actually want to own the whole series. My set is defective as it's missing a multitude of scenes. After some research I've learned that others have had the same issue with this box set.     Some of the missing scenes are:      - Albert and Truman coming to blows  - Cooper's first vision involving the giant, and his near death experience after being shot  - Audrey evading her father at One-Eyed Jack's with a mask  - Donna's encounter with the mysterious old woman and her grandson on her first Meals on Wheels outing  - Donna's initial encounter with Harold right after her encounter with the old woman  - Donna's discovery that the old woman and her grandson don't seem to exist      These are just the scenes that have been missing so far - who knows what else is missing? I feel completely ripped off.     The only thing good about this edition is that it contains the pilot. However, I would MUCH rather actually have all of the full episodes. I basically paid $80 for part of the show. Do yourself a favor and just buy seasons 1 and 2 separately.      ***UPDATE: I contacted the manufacturer and they were very helpful. They replaced the discs that were defective pretty quickly. Very nice to know that the company does actually back its product.***
B000ATQYT2|5.0|One of the most entertaining performances of the Christmas Carol. Michael caine does an exceptional acting job and the muppets add an interesting and enjoyable twist to the story. A must for anyone who has a Christmas movie collection.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I would have given this movie 5 stars and I really like Casey Affleck, but we couldn't understand him since he mumbles (effective in \\"Assassination of Jesse James\\" but not here).  Hopefully he will improve on his diction as he goes on, because he has a great face and is a good actor.
B00005JNX0|5.0|A classic and enjoyable animated movie that you can watch several times without seeing to be repetitious. Great graphics.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The Boss has captured the essence of today's society in \\"magically\\" woven lyrics that should have captured Album of the Year at the Grammy's.  \\"Your own worse enemy has come to town\\" speaks loud and clear about the lies and devastation caused by the Bush adminstration.  I highly recommend this CD and advice you to listen closely to the words.  All the songs are typical Bruce quality - amazing! Buy it, buy it now.
0789723107|3.0|A nicely crafted book-like this one-that falls apart with no overuse is like a nice piece of clothing that won't stand the first wash. And we are not taking about cheap clothing here. But anyway, let's focus on what matters most: the content. I was expecting more from the book, but overall I don't feel disappointed. I wouldn't call the book simplistic because it heavily relies on common sense. After all, you don't have to go very far on the web to find sites where common sense seems to be the least used of all senses. The chapter on usability testing was particularly useful to me. And although nothing in the book was particularly striking or illuminating, I felt it made a positive contribution to my knowledge on the subject.

B0010ZR160|4.0|Well done adaptation of Lehane's novel.  As somebody born and raised in Dorchester (in a neighborhood full of beautiful Victorians) I have to wonder what people must be thimking about Boston.  Between this and Mystic River and the Departed I am wondering if I should move.  Anywho, Afflecks (both) do a fine job here and Ryan really is great.  My biggest lingering question about GBG is: why does Ed Harris look so much like Burt Reynolds here?
B000R5N1MC|4.0|The plastic case of this product looks interesting but it is made of cheap chinese plastic and it has no place in my DVD bookshelf. The movie discs are HD DVD with super quality, some extra discs are in standard DVD resolution and can be played anywhere. Haven't had time to look at all the extra material but it sure looks I am going to dedicate a whole weekend which I don't mind. I will not review the movie as you can find many reviews either on the previous releases or IMDB, but I will talk about the new whole product.<br /><br />Movie content: Great, except I am not sure I want to watch all versions in one sitting.<br /><br />Packaging briefcase: cheap and useless<br /><br />Briefcase contents: scale vehicle, plastic unicorn and plastic thingy with moving frame are all useless. My scale vehicle doesn't even run smoothly as one tire seems to be stuck. The unicorn is a nice souvenir but the plastic paint was not even well applied. I would have prefered some instructions on how to make a paper origami unicorn myself (if it is possible at all). The moving frame is such a cheap souvenir from a technique that has been around for decades, I wish they could have had brighter ideas for souvenirs. The pictures on the folder are ok, I am not sure I will look at them often. I guess these are just toys for a little kid but even he will not understand the movie so they might have no meaning for him.<br /><br />The only thing I am worried about is that HD might be losing the battle. I play my discs on my Toshiba X205 Notebook and I have no problem, in fact the quality is like nothing else I've seen, but the Blue Ray vs HD battle seems to be dissapointing for consumers. Will I have and HD player around in five years from now to keep watching this great HD-DVDs?
B00000BKDX|5.0|I loved this live concert and owned the VHS for many years. The added bonus of the documentary makes the value all the better. I also like the video style of the live concert better than the more recent concerts. Steve Harris likes rapid camera changes, but I prefer a less frantic production.     Who am I kidding...I love everything that Maiden puts out!

Gilbert puts alot of thought and emotion into her writing.  Some people didn't like that she focused on herself so much.  That was the point!!!  For her to find herself and figure out who she was since she had lost herself in the relationship she was in.  She had to relearn how to be by herself again.  This book is one of the best books I have read so far.  You should read this book and decide for yourself.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Tim Burton: Hollywood's undisputed champion of gothic horror.<br />Sweeney Todd: a psycho barber and famous purveyor of dodgy pies.<br />Hmmmm... what took you so long?<br /><br />It was screamingly obvious what a gorgeous team they would make. Rarely have we seen a film director so perfectly matched to a musical. And the black magic begins when Johnny Depp's white-faced Sweeney steals up the Thames at the dead of night. As the boat slips under a spooky London Bridge it becomes quite clear that Burton was put on earth to shoot this glorious melodrama.<br /><br />The film unfolds like the Grimmest of fairy tales. Depp's bitter Sweeney returns to London after 15 years of hurt. His painful story emerges in hollow songs with haunting off-key melodies. He wears his grievances like armour. His plan to murder the men who condemned him to a penal colony in order to rape his wife hinges around the dismal apartment above Mrs Lovett's ailing pie shop. The atmosphere is vintage Hammer Studios. The gleaming monochrome shots of cobbled streets are drained of color. Effectively overwrought and excellent, Sweeney Todd is a movie of bombastic, impossible camera moves and rhapsodic yuckiness. Burton can't resist filling the screen with scuttling vermin or surges of splatterific violence.<br /><br />Depp's Sweeney is a fiery-eyed, razor-brandishing cadaver with a mad Pagliacci glare. Bonham Carter is comparably corpse-like--a matched composition in bird-nest hairdo, death-pallor complexion, and heavily shadowed eyes. The musical chemistry between Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's genial cockney pie shop mistress is terrific. Sondheim approved the casting, and, surprisingly, Depp has a pleasing, if untrained, tenor. Alongside Bonham Carter's sweetly tentative voice, the numbers are inventively staged. Especially the cannibal waltz \\"A Little Priest\\" and the grotesquely wistful \\"By the Sea\\". Lovett's unreciprocated passion for Sweeney is the heart of the film and her bright idea of stuffing Sweeney's clients into meat pies seems almost perfectly sensible under the circumstances.<br /><br />The film's pace is a surprise. Burton has pruned Sondheim's arias to fit the tempo of a real thriller -- brilliant editing - and the villains are far less stocky. Yes, the ghoulishly attractive couple is supported by a suitable gang of gargoyles; Sacha Baron Cohen delivers a priceless cameo as a jealous unisex rival with plans to blackmail Sweeney. Alan Rickman is a sinister pleasure as Judge Turpin. And Timothy Spall is equally effective as his ultra-violent slithery enforcer, Beadle Bamford.<br /><br />Burton has never been one to spare the gore. The sound of skulls cracking open when Sweeney tosses his victims head first into the basement is not for the faint-of-heart. The director's knack of finding comedy in these ghastly scenes is tested to the limit. And the haunting final shot of the film, the details of which we must keep to ourselves so not to spoil the plot, is a masterful shot, painterly in its composition of framing, detail, and color.<br /><br />There is so much that can be said about Sweeney Todd, but we must insist that you stop reading and simply experience this wonderous film for yourself. A mad serial killer, a helpful, adoring woman, a vile judge, and a barber's chair - all elements that combine to form much more than this simple review can encapsulate. It is masterful cinema, art and entertainment, vision and sound combined for a truly riveting experience.at pies seems almost perfectly sensible under the circumstances.

B00005JPTK|3.0|It's hard to believe that the same geniuses who made the incredible \\"empty NYC\\" special effects for this movie could also make the cheesy and unbelievable reindeer, lions and zombies.  When Will Smith first enters the dark building and we have a first glimpse of the zombies, no CGI seems to have been applied and they are truly terrorizing. By the later sequences when they climb walls, destroy ceilings, etc. they reminded me of the equally unmemorable \\"I Robot\\" effects.  Still plenty to like in this movie which for me, unfortunately, will always be remmembered as a missed chance.
B00102F5WK|4.0|**** 2007. Directed by Gavin Hood. The C.I.A. secretly brings a suspect into a North African prison where he's tortured. Meanwhile, the suspect's wife tries to find help among politicians. This is the kind of movie nobody wants to see because it asks questions no one wants to hear. So be one of those who are assuming.

0143038419|5.0|This was our Feb book club selection that was mostly well received by the ladies and engaged some interesting questions.  Elizabeth's voice rings through each page with sincerity of each sensation as she braves the storms of who she really is, to discover she is loved.  This is a wonderful journey; she realizes and expresses human emotions like a poet.  And through her search we discover our own mechanisms for inquiry and pursuit of peace maybe such as the sitting and breathing; our library book club surprisingly came round to discussion on meeting God and meditation.  Indeed, we can attribute Liz's consistent meditation to maintaining her incredible strength of being; what courage to look so closely at oneself and then tell all.   It was also fun to travel to Italy, India and Indonesia without leaving my living room and then to discuss over Joan's homemade biscotti- yum!
6305428050|5.0|I saw this movie a while ago and enjoyed it, as my daughter was a babysitter and I could so picture something funny as this could happen to her. Great movie for kids and if you are an adult you can enjoy it as a cute adventure, think when you were younger, could you picture this happening to you.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This collection of all 4 Alien movies is a must have for all Sygourney Weaver fans and scifi fans. Growing up Lt. Ellen Ripley became my female hero of all times and she still is. Many would say that the third and fourth movie weren't that great but Sygourney Weaver still delivered a wonderful performance. Besides, this set have two versions of each movie, so people can watch the different versions and revisit their opinion. In any case, thanks to the great Amazon price, you are getting a great deal plus a bonus disc with A Documentary called Alien Evolution, a Q&A with Ridley Scott, DVD-ROM material and much more. The movies are in both English and Spanish and subtittled in both English and Spanish as well. I really recommend this quadrilogy.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|If you're in the mood for some sexy science-fiction, look no further. \\"Torchwood\\" is one of the most imaginative series in recent memory and deserves much more exposure than it has received here in the United States.    Captain Jack Harkness is the head of a paranormal investigations group called Torchwood. Based in Cardiff, Wales, Torchwood acts outside the law and is beyond the jurisdiction of the police. Serving as mankind's line of defense against the paranormal -- be it ghosts, aliens, or technology run amok -- they've got their hands full when Cardiff policewoman Gwen Cooper discovers the group resurrecting a dead man in order to question him about his (otherworldly) killer.    Eventually joining the group, Cooper slowly comes to realize that being a part of such a secretive agency has its drawbacks -- especially the fact that she has to hide her job from her boyfriend, Rhys.    Joining her are Toshiko Sato, a computer expert, as well as fellow agent Owen Harper and \\"support man\\" Ianto Jones. They're an interesting and rather complicated bunch, each bringing their own personal demons to the table.     Part of the brilliance of \\"Torchwood\\" is that we the audience care as much about the characters as we do the plights they face. Considering they face everything from killer fairies, country-dwelling cannibals and even rips in the fabric of time that threaten to destroy the world, that's really saying something!    Of course, one couldn't review \\"Torchwood\\" without mentioning its charismatic lead, John Barrowman. Truly an actor's actor, he delivers fine performances as Jack Harkness, blending the perfect mix of bravado and vulnerability, making him more than just an action-hero or a dashing  prime-time star.     While some of the episodes are of the \\"monster-of-the-week\\" variety (one of the series' few weaknesses) we begin to build some continuity towards the end. There are too many standout episodes to name -- an uncommon trait in most American television. Sexy,scary and often quite riveting,  I'm at my wits end now that season two has begun and I *do not* receive BBC America.    Needless to say, the BBC has outdone themselves in terms of quality. Presented in the 1.85 aspect ratio and enhanced for wide-screen displays, the picture quality is excellent. Audio is equally as good, and there are so many extras that are you'll be playing these discs long after you finish watching all twelve episodes.    So for those of you haven't seen this show, what are you waiting for? \\"Torchwood\\" is one of the finest series since \\"The X-Files\\" or \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\". Highly recommended!
006135323X|5.0|While more upbeat and not as alarmist or politically/culturally-inclined as Alan Bloom's 1988 bestseller Closing Of The American Mind, John Raulston Saul's 1993 bestseller Voltaire's Bastards or Susan Jacoby's just-published The Age Of American Reason, Ariely's Predictably Irrational makes similar nods by pointing out that people are consistently irrational. He argues that in many cases where we expect to act rationally, we act irrationally, but our irrationality is governed by a system of principles, thereby making it easy to predict (examples: why does a headache not go away after taking a one-cent aspirin, but disappears if the aspirin costs fifty cents? Why does recalling the Ten Commandments reduce people's tendency to lie? Why, after doing careful and extensive research on which car to buy, a random meeting with someone who had an awful experience with that car changes your decision?).    Very interesting and eye-opening.
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|Loved it!  This action hero is by far my favorite and I hope they do another one.
006135323X|5.0|Once in a great while you come across a book that truly enlightens! A book that helps you to better understand yourself and the others in a \\"Gee whiz, I can't believe I didn't see this before when it was all right in front of my eyes!\\" Dan Ariely's, Predictably Irrational is just such a book!    We all believe that our knowledge and experience guides us to make logical and \\"rational\\" choices based on the value we place on various options. Do I buy A or B? Should I be honest or cheat? Should I keep my options open or focus on one thing? Life is a daily stream of cost-benefit analyses.    But, what if our understanding of value is abitrary? What if our understanding of value can be manipulated? Surely, intelligent people (ourselves included, of course) cannot fall victim to arbitrary or manipulated notions of value. Guess what? Ariely lays bare our often skewed understanding of value and the irrational decisions that arise from basing decisions on such skewed information.    Be warned, once you open the book and start reading, you won't be able to put it down! And, Ariely doesn't leave you with some dry understanding of behavioral economics -- no! Like that sinful dessert, where you eat the whole thing when you only meant to take a bite, Predicatably Irrational offers bite-after-bite of enlightening and dare I say \\"entertaining\\" insights into human behavior. Even better, Ariely leaves your mind racing with practicle ideas on how to overcome our irrational tendencies with an eye on improving the human condition.    Another reviewer mentioned that Ariely is a person you'd love to have at your dinner party -- so true! Having met him on one of the first stops of his book tour in the DC area, his ideas not-only challenge you to rethink your understanding of value, but point you forward on how you can make life better!

B000002UAC|4.0|This music is a treasure of songs that don't receive a lot of attention. I still remember hearing these for the first time, though my mind still expects the tracking from the original US \\"Meet the Beatles\\" release. The enthusiasm and energy on some of these songs reflects how happy they were to have finally made it to the studio after years of playing clubs. Their growth through the years is not foreshadowed here, but the rock and roll is pure fun. I will always love this music and the music that followed.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I walked in and out of the living room while my husband and youngest daughter watched Miss Potter. Animated bunnies and other creatures frolicked across the page and the movie seemed to move along slowly, so, I didn't expect to love it when I actually sat down to watch it.<br /><br />Instead I was surprised. The cover hints of a great quirky romance. The romance is understated and tragic, but sweet nonetheless. The inexperienced Mr. Warne and Miss Potter fumbled through endearingly. The bigger focus of the film was Beatrix herself. I don't know how I feel about the animated characters that she created in her mind. Part of me is creeped out, but part of me fully understands eccentricities.<br /><br />The history and customs, the simplicity and society add to the movie. The tragedy sadly unfolds in a time where bad news often arrived too late. This is so foreign to me since anyone I need to talk to can be reached within just a few hours if not minutes so the timing situation added an extra measure of poignancy for me.<br /><br />This would be a great film for older elementary age girls who get caught up in the fairy tale of Prince Charming since Beatrix follows her heart, hones her talent and leaves behind a world that was better for her presence in it. There is very little \\"action\\" and those who can't stand languid films won't be able to sit comfortably through it. History lovers and families looking for family friendly films should find much to like.
0375842381|5.0|Great book. A very enjoyable read. Fresh Ideas. Any Fantasy lover will find it amazing. If you liked Lord of the Rings or Eragon then this is definetely a must read.
0307386864|5.0|Ah, what girl doesn't want Mr. Darcy to marry them? I have to admit, as and avid Austen fan, I'm a bit obsessed with this one. One cannot come upon better characters than the beautiful and witty (way to be a smart girl!) Elizabeth Bennet, and the tall, brooding, but devilishly handsome (not to mention exceptionally rich) Mr. Darcy. And of course, what better way to start off a romance than with two characters who hate eachother? And Austen does it complete justice--for we all know that they can't stay disgusted for long! However, did we ever expect Lizzy to actually refuse a man who has ten thousand pounds a year? Heck yes! And that's why we love her. I've never come across an author better able to create stunning characters than Miss Jane Austen herself. She's timeless. I highly recommend this book to every person who comes across it. Pride and Prejudice merits the title of MY FAVORITE piece of literature ever written!
B0000640S1|5.0|Theatrical Release: 1982  Original story: David Morrell  Director: Ted Kotcheff  Star: Sylvester Stallone  Sequels: \\"Rambo, First Blood Part II\\" (1985), \\"Rambo III\\" (1988) and \\"Rambo\\" (2008)    I had forgotten how great \\"First Blood\\" is and why it ranks up there with my all-time favorite films. This is easy to forget when you consider the two cartooney sequels, which made a caricature of the Rambo character. I haven't seen the recent \\"Rambo\\" yet, so I can't say if this third sequel successfully returned to the superior quality of the original film.    99% of those reading this know the PLOT: John Rambo (Stallone), a Vietnam vet, drifts into a small town in the Northwest looking for a combat buddy, only to discover he died recently of agent orange. The local police chief tries to run him out of town because he doesn't want drifters around. Ultimately he unjustly arrests the vet and his men abuse him, wherein Rambo has bad flashbacks of Vietnam and goes psycho. He escapes into the mountainous forests, with the police and the national guard on his trail. They don't understand that Rambo is an ex-Green Beret killing machine, a virtual one-man-army. In his fury he comes close to destroying the entire village.    There are only two other main characters: Brian Dennehy as the police chief and Richard Crenna as the Colonel who commanded Rambo in Vietnam. Both are perfect in their roles, especially Dennehy.     This is a \\"guy film\\" in the truest sense as there are no female characters and therefore no romantic interests. A full 55 minutes of its 90 minute runtime (not including credits) is action-oriented. I usually only like such films if they're done right, that is, if the filmmakers keep the story within the realm of plausibility and if there's depth and seriousness to the characters and story. \\"First Blood\\" has both. Yeah, one could nitpick and say this or that wasn't very realistic, but the story is presented in such a way that the viewer can't help but buy into it. Take, for instance, the scene where Rambo jumps from a cliff and lands in the trees. The tree branches naturally cushion his fall and he survives (barely). This same scene is in the original novel. It works in the sense that the viewer accepts it as remotely plausible. In the film (as opposed to the book) Rambo is presented in such a sympathetic way that the viewer can't help but root for him from beginning to end; hence, when he is successful at his numerous amazing feats we yell \\"Yay!!\\" rather than mumble \\"That could never happen.\\"    Rambo is silent throughout most of the picture until the very end where he potently screams out in angst, \\"Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job parking cars!!\\" Although Stallone barely gets through the initial scene where he talks to his Combat buddy's mother (or wife), his performance is absolutely killer throughout the rest of the flick.    Physically speaking, Stallone is in perfect form here. He's no where near as bulky as he appears in the sequels. In fact, he's kind of skinny. His waist is obviously only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his shoulders and arms are certainly impressive. In any case, one good byproduct of seeing this film is that it will encourage guys to get in shape!     Despite the film's reputation for violence, there's only one verified death on camera -- a bastage cop, and it was his own fault. Later in the story we see Rambo run a police car off the road. There's an explosion and the car flips over, but if you watch the crash closely it's very possible (even likely) that all the people in the car survived. This is in contrast to the novel wherein Rambo kills well over 200 people, including people that don't deserve his wrath.      The film was filmed in Golden Ears Provincial Park and nearby Hope, British Columbia, and these locations are truly breathtaking -- dreary and drizzly, but incredibly scenic nevertheless.I encourage buyers to purchase the DVD that features the commentary by David Morrell, who wrote the original novel. This commentary is on the \\"Special Edition\\" with the red cover. I usually don't like commentaries, thinking they're a waste of time, but Morrell's commentary here is brilliant and chalk full of important info. He addresses the differences between the novel and the film, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the three-act structure of films, how \\"First Blood\\" set many precedents in the film industry, and much more. I hope they paid Morrell well for his services because he speaks for almost every second of the 90-minutes and delivers a wealth of information.    Morrell makes one mistake in his commentary. He states that only four characters successfully went from prose to film (with the implication of multiple films): Tarzan, Sherlock Holmes, James Bond and Rambo (not including comic book characters like Superman or Spiderman). Oh yeah? What about Conan the Barbarian? What about Harry Potter? (Granted he may have given the commentary before the success of the Potter films).    Morrell reflects on how his hero has become an international icon. He'll hear \\"Rambo\\" brought up while watching TV or reading and it just blows his mind that he's the one who actually created this character. He tells the story of a friend of his who was hiking somewhere deep in Indonesia, hundreds of miles away from civilization, where he came across a meadow with a tree in it. The tree had a sign on it with one word: \\"Rambo.\\" Amazing! This was testimony that his popular hero had made an impact on people from the farthest reaches of the planet.    One last thing about the film: The ending is truly superb. [SPOILER ALERT!] The original filmed ending showed Rambo dying after his final confrontation with Col. Troutman. Rambo also dies in the novel, but it works there because he deserves to die after his mad murderous rampage. Yet such an ending fails in the filmed version because it's a huge let down to the viewer who's been sympathetically rooting for the antihero the entire picture. The ending the filmmakers ultimately decided to go with shows Troutman and some policemen escorting Rambo away. The final still is moving as the song \\"It's a Long Road\\" potently plays over the credits.          FINAL ANALYSIS: Don't let the two cartooney sequels prevent you from viewing and appreciating \\"First Blood.\\" It's a masterpiece in the action/adventure genre.

0525950079|5.0|The beginning of this book was more difficult to get into than Pillars.  There were just too many characters thrown at me right away.  I didn't get a chance to learn individual personalities until further into the book.  After that period I was deeply involved with the characters and loved to pick up this book.  It has the same ups and downs as Pillars and the big conflict throughout the book is the plaque.  I again learned a lot about the period and the life of peasants, merchants, noblemen, and monks and nuns.  I really enjoyed seeing how the plaque changed the style of medical care from a religious focus to more of a practical style of care.  I hated that the book had to end, but wasn't happy with the ending.  It just fizzled out like the author had to finish before the book got too long.  The big secret that started the book really wasn't much of a secret and there wasn't a surprise finding like I expected throughout the whole book.  The story did not come full circle like it did in Pillars.  I still give it a 5 because of how drawn in I was by the story, but I would love to see the ending rewritten to make this anywhere near the book that Pillars was.

0380778556|5.0|REBECCA!!!! That name is forever tainted now, labled as creepy because of this book. OH! I love this style, the gothic mood and sway of this novel was incredible! I also find it amazing that an author can so completely wrap the reader in the thread of her story, that we nearly forget that we don't even ever learn the main character's name! Miraculous! This story had me rivited, pages turning at a record speed. The characters, Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca, Maxim, Mrs. Danvers, they all are so well developed I was sorry when the story ended. SO GOTHIC, so watch out. The whether is unavoidably stormy all the time. But it's worth it all the way. For all you brit-lit lovers, a MUST read!

I gave Dear John by Nicholas Sparks a 5 out od 5 because it is one of the most intellegent books I have ever read. Most people don't like romances because the are cheesy and unbeleiveable. Dear John is so real. The book even takes place during a real time period 9/11/01. Dear John is an amazing book and Nicholas Sparks is a very talented writer in times in the book I even cried.

6305907145|4.0|I had no trouble enjoying MANSFIELD PARK because I had no comparison to make to the novel, which I never read. I saw nothing about it that made me think it was catering to 1999's sensibilities, despite the use of a scene where someone is caught in flagrante with another. Aside from that indiscretion, the dialog seemed like authentic Austen to me and the whole affair has been expertly photographed in England, of course, on lush locales that are breathtakingly gorgeous to look at. The swirling camera swerves often from the interior of a room to the vast horizons outside with the greatest of ease.<br /><br />And, of course, the British cast cannot be praised highly enough. All of them perform to the manor born in the appropriate style. FRANCES O'CONNOR (who closely resembles a young Jennifer Jones) is Fanny Price, the poor girl sent to live with rich relatives at Mansfield Park, who becomes an elegant young woman and a writer. (Sounds suspiciously like the author herself inserting her character on this role).<br /><br />And JONNY LEE MILLER is Edmund Bertram, a young man obviously smitten with her from the start. It takes the entire running time of the film for the young lovers to discover they always did love each other, but along the way we're treated to some interesting episodes of British class distinction amid the manners and mores of a bygone era, including some sharp bits of humor.<br /><br />Interesting that after essaying this quiet, unassuming role, Jonny Lee Miller would next take on the fight against a vampire in Dracula 2000. So much for British dexterity and range.<br /><br />Summing up: Some admirers of the novel seem to be put off by this one, but I have to admit I enjoyed it, even if I did find Fanny's inconsistent feelings about her suitor,Henry, and her inability to make up her mind, rather frustrating at times.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B000PE8DXM|5.0|We found this garage in a toy store. My 2 1/2 year old son already had a fisher price little people garage, so I tried to steer him away from this one. He had a gift certificate, and this was the toy he picked, out of an entire store full of options. I finally gave in and let him purchase it, and I'm very glad we did. He plays with it all the time, and I can see it will last him for many years, where he has outgrown the little people one. This is a well made, beautiful wooden toy. Yes, the ramps keep coming off, but otherwise it's great. The little man that comes with it is really cute, and the little car is adorable, too. We have added other plan city toys, and they're all well made, durable toys. they are also a perfect scale for hot wheels or matchbox cars. I highly recommend this toy for any child who likes cars.

I would reccomend The Giver to anyone with a reasonable sized vocabulary and knows how to read.  A child younger than fourth grade may not understand some concepts in the plot of The Giver, but any other age level no matter how old should understand and connect to the book's meaning.  Lois Lowry did such an excceptional job writing The Giver, that even if the reader does not like science fiction, this book would be an exception.  The Giver is almost so fictional, that the story has has a quality of being real life.  THe Giver gives messages to its readers through significant characters, a constant reminder of the importance of relationships, and the importance of love in our lives. The Giver is my favorite book so far in my life.  I have read hundereds of books by all types of authors, and various genres of books, but The Giver filled my heart and mind with positive thoughts and feelings.  I can always count on The Giver to put a smile on my face or bring tears to my eyes.  I would rate The Giver as a five-star novel, abd worth every star plus more for the superb quality of the material within the cover of the book.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This movie was a cute story with a good overall message. As many Pixar movies this does not fail to impress. Great family classic. The technology of the Blu-ray disc allows the textures and detail to stand out the way the creators intend. I will not buy another animated movie on anything less than blu-ray
B000MNP2KI|4.0|There appear to have been at least three of these Casino Royale movies.<br />The first Bond movie was in 1954, a year after the book was published.<br />The David Niven comic spoof version was a nothing.<br />This current version is a \\"modern rewrite\\" for the terrorist age.<br />There seem to be something enduring about the British spy<br />in all his makes and colors : more like a classic car than<br />a movie?!<br />This one bond is special because it is the only real romance/ true love<br />in a bond film. That's one reason people love to hate the Niven version.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This is simply the best submarine film.  And for fans of Das Boot, this uncut version does some good.  Lets you really think about how it was during those times and how it was inside these submarines.  A good film should do that.  A good film should let you get lost in the story and the period of that time.<br /><br />This uncut version of nearly 5 hours is a treat, and it goes by so fast that the only thing you notice while immersed into the storyline is that you have to get up to change the DVD's in the player.<br /><br />After it is all done you start to wonder when are the movie people going to remake their movies in-dept and longer for the DVD's?  But then you realize that it works for THIS film because it's so good, and it may or may not work for other films.
0810993139|4.0|The book, Diary of A Wimpy Kid was a great book of sarcasm. It was a little cartoon story. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend this book for a 8 to 10 year old. Just because it is a little immiture for a 13 and 14 year old. The book had just some words thatIdid not find funny. The book was a great book andIcant wait to read the next.
0143038419|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend but before I could buy it, another friend brought it to a coffee date. I knew I was meant to read it at the point. What a journey to take with the author. I couldn't put it down. I devoured the book quickly and wanted more. As the author's life unfolds, she tells what led her to these places and gives us the gift of taking us along. It's a personal story with richness of heart. She is so open; naked, if you will, on the page. I truly enjoyed it and am looking forward to sharing her next journey with her.
B000002KIK|5.0|I don't care what the fools say, this is a good, nay, a great album.  Yes indeed, it is different from the heavier, darker Sabbath we commonly associate with the band, but it is still intrinsically worthy, and I'm glad I have it in my collection.  In fact, I listen to this one most of all.  My favorite track is \\"Hard Road\\"  I don't know why, but whenever I listen to it, I feel like I'm in a beer stale bar drinking my favorite IPA and feeling low and dark.  In fact, I'm listening to it now as I write this review.  \\"Over To You\\" gives me the same feeling.  I also totally love \\"Johnny Blade\\" and \\"Never Say Die\\"...I say to  you disbelievers...NEVER SAY DIE!  Sabbath Rules, even this \\"incarnation\\" of a different and changed Sabbath is worthy of your time and your mind.  Have a few IPAs and really listen to these songs.  Music is art and art is a sacrifice.  Listen deeply and Never Say Die!!!
1400079179|4.0|An esteemed curator of the Louvre is found is found dead. Clues and tantalizing hints are everywhere. Will historian Robert Langdon solve the murder and save an ancient organization's secret in time? This is the plot of the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. The Da Vinci Code is a phenomenal novel that has a great mystery/drama sense that chnged my views about many places, facts, and historical figures. More specifically, it has a number of random facts, more true facts that I think I have seen in a fictional book in my entire life. Secondly, this book holds a lot of interesting information about Da Vinci both good and bad. Another influence involved in feading this book is the change of view on geography. Many areas/landmarks that were talked about in the book modified my specific views about them. As for audiences, I don't think that many people would dislike this book, except for those who don't like a thorough. I would recommend this book to all audiences, except the younger ones. More specifically, this book would appeal to those who love fact and fiction jumbled together. This book definately has plenty of that. Other appreciative audiences might include mystery and intrigue enjoyers. Also, readers of books by Agatha Christie can surely say that they'll enjoy this book. The Da Vinci Code has the same amount of hidden mystery and intrigue. I can surely say that I enjoyed it. Regarding the four star rating that I gave earlier, I am sure that judging by the positive review, many people would think that I would give a higher rating. The one thing that I did not enjoy about this book was the ending. I considered it inconclusive and flat. Besides that, I consider The Da Vinci Code an excellent and worthwhile read.<br /><br />  Reviewed by: Mr.M
1594489505|4.0|Beautifully written, with vivid detail. The characters practically come alive. It will keep you up late, a real page turner. I kept thinking...o.k. one more chapter before I doze off. Excellent story about life in Afganistan and what women have to endure to obtain simple pleasures that we take for granted. Some really sad parts with a satisfying ending.

We watched 2 episodes a night since and if we didn't have to get up early for work I think we'd sit and watch all 12 in one sitting... it's that compelling. This show makes you seriously think. It's consuming and entertaining with unpredictable twists and turns and stories within stories. It's one of the most brilliantly written story lines I've seen in years. I cannot wait til season two becomes available on iTunes. We've only got 2 epi's left. We'll be jonesin for more...
B000HT2PIE|5.0|Scorpia is a very creative book and Anthony Horowitz did a wonderful job writing it! It was an amazing book becasue of the great details on the characters, the suspense, and the different happenings in every chapter. I give this a book a 5 star rating and this book is in the action genre. I think the best age group for this book is about 10 to 17. Alex Rider, the thirteen year old spy, is thrown when hearing that his father was an assassin and worked for Scorpia with Yassen Gregorovich, but was what Yassen told him the real truth?
B0000669JL|2.0|I received my Bob Marley CD in the mail yesterday. When I opened the perfectly intact box to remove the CD I was very shocked to find that the CD case was completely broken in half!  I was expecting to find the CD broken as well, although it wasn't.  Being that the box was in perfect condition, the damage to the CD case had to have been caused before it was shipped.  I am a huge collector of music & keep all my CD's in there original cases so I am very dissapointed that this CD arrived with the plastic case in pieces!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This album is great! Back to the basics of metal with a bit of some 80's type of singing. The Way Of the Fist, White Knuckles, and Death Before Dishonor are metal the way metal is supposed to be done. Great job and I hope to see more from FFDP!
B00000IMTG|4.0|Great live album. Bought it on vinyl when it came out. Still love it today. Clever intro and solid all the way through. Blackmore's guitar playing is at it's best. The subtle stuff is brilliant. So is the fire demonstrated on Mistreated for example. Cozy powell is...well...Cozy Powell...Slammin'!! Dio's vocals are powerful. Guy's been in 3 different bands that have achieved incredible success...nuff said. Forget the picky things mentioned in some of the reviews and listen to this record. Really listen to it. It never gets old.
B000X1R4S2|4.0|This epic horror novel tells the story of seven teenagers who encounter a horror that lives in the sewers of their hometown, Derry, Maine. They fight this demon in 1958 and again as adults as they try to kill it, but can they? This book is a horrifically gripping book that features good writing,construction, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. This is truly one of Stephen Kings best books in my opinion. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars and anyone who enjoys horror or sci-fi books would enjoy this epic novel.

B0001WTVUW|4.0|I rather enjoy this movie. I first saw it on a TV rerun sometime in tha late 80's. I have both good and bad things to say about it...    First...The bad.. Yes, the special effects were old, but I felt the portrayal of a nuclear exchange was done well for it's time. I remember reading somewhere that if you are out in the open during the initial flash, one would receive a lethal dose of gamma ray radiation, but I'm willing to give the filmmakers leeway for the sake of the story.    I agree with another review that the characters could have been more developed, and I would have liked to have the political circumstances elaborated on. What did the USSR use as an excuse to close off Berlin and invade West Germany? I do remember that the US had increased their troop presence in Europe and the USSR wasn't happy. I think the whole point was that it could be something that escelates from a normal political exchange between the two Superpowers. I still would have preferred more elaboration.    There were also news clips in the background of \\"East German Defection\\" from the military. It made it seem like the Soviet forces were surrendering, which was either an attempt to provide the \\"fog of war\\" or an uncorrected script line in the editing.    I also didn't feel that the timeline for \\"leaving the cellar\\" was realistic. I can't see how the fallout would dissipate that quickly in such a massive exchange. When I read a government report dated in the 1970's on the environmental impact of a nuclear war, I recall a timeline of months, rather than days.    Now...the good:    The tension as the characters attempt to continue with daily life while keeping a watchful eye on the developments in Europe was done well. The panic as the War Alerts went out was well portrayed. I could imagine myself trying to decide what needed to be done and kicking myself for not being ready ahead of time. I do wonder, however, why everyone in the grocery store is actually waiting in line to pay. I would have expected more widespread looting.     Ok, I never thought about where the horses came from, but I'll give the writers and producers some leeway again for the sake of the story. The whole point of the movie is that any exchange would have horrific consequences.     I like to recall the book, Warday, which was written in 1984. It is about a limited nuclear exchange between the USSR and USA. In this book, it takes place in 1988 and is caused by the deployment of SDI. When I care to read Warday (which is a book I highly recommend if you're not bored easily..there's not much action) I usually watch The Day After just before, because I feel it better portrays the 1988 scenario...    I think it's worth watching. I wish the DVD had more extras on it, but I doubt that the filmmakers were thinking that far ahead...\\"hey, let's keep those deleted scenes for the DVD..\\" \\"What's a DVD?\\" \\"It'a like a Laserdisc, only smaller...\\"
B000T05R8Q|5.0|I know...I know...\\"but Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall is the greatest!\\". WRONG!<br /><br />Will all due respect to these great albums Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd is the TRUE Floyd!<br /><br />This album (and their previous singles) defines psychedelia with their wonderful, whimsical lyrics and music.<br /><br />From the beginning...\\"Astronomy Domine\\" leads you to the center of the universe while \\"Chapter 24\\" (taken from the I Ching) makes a very positive statement that makes you believe that your place in the world is a good one as long as you believe..\\"action brings good fortune\\" as Syd would sing.<br /><br />The last song \\"Bike\\" is a wonderful, catchy ditty that is on some other P.F. compilations like Relics for example.<br /><br />In conclusion,<br /><br />If you are a Pink Floyd fan and you don't have this album pick it up and I hope you'll enjoy it.
0345451325|5.0|Halo: Fall of Reach is an encouraging book by Erik Nylund that brings out the character in people, especially the Hako gamer fans. It's a science fiction book about a boy who gets sent to a new facility for spartans. Spartans are highly developed soldiers who have the highest rank a soldier can have. It really encourages bravery, trust and, well, the whole storyline itself. this book definatly deserves a four and a half out of five stars but I cant do that so I gave it a five. I recomend this book to any young adult who likes the Halo games.

B000VWYJ86|3.0|I enjoyed the first two episodes in the Bourne movie saga and so was disappointed with this third (and presumably final) episode.  The clarity of the audio was very bad and one needed sub-titles to learn what was going on.  I expected a lot of car chases and jumping off buildings but there was hardly a gap between stunts so that the action lost credibility and I lost interest after 30 minutes into the movie.  I was unable to access a menu which was another frustration.
B0011WMHRK|5.0|Can's 1971 release, \\"Tago Mago,\\" is nothing less than a watershed moment in the world of early progressive rock. Surrounding the emergence of Can was a highly sophisticated rock evolution. With the likes of King Crimson pushing performance boundaries into substantially more complex territory and Pink Floyd exploring the outer realms of space, it would be logically difficult to emerge as something truly unique during the rise of progressive rock in the early seventies. Ironically, Can made originality look effortless. With complexity rapidly becoming the focus of rock, Can pushed against the grain, delving into a far more primal brand of avant-garde modern minimalism, with magnificent success. \\"Tago Mago\\" is truly years ahead of its time.<br /><br />\\"Tago Mago\\" was originally released as a two disc LP, therefore clocking in at around 70 minutes rather than 45 minute standard LP time. The contrast between each disk is exceedingly stark, showing two distinct sides of this anomalous entity. The first half of this disk (\\"Paperhouse\\"- \\"Halleluhwah\\") is very \\"jammy.\\" The songs are largely made up of repetitive percussive cycles and various bits of improvisation. While the songs largely pulse forward at a non-transitive rhythm, there is much more going on than would seem possible within each track. \\"Paperhouse\\" starts off relatively slow, and eventually loops into an expansive jam session, containing some delightful guitar work from Michael Karoli. \\"Paperhouse\\" ends with an intense let-out of energy that Jaki Liebezeit has masterfully brewing through his increasingly aggressive percussive cycles. \\"Mushroomhead\\" then begins. This is the shortest and most instantly accessible song on the album, consisting of what seems to be an electronic drum beat and Damo Suzuki's disconnected murmuring; a song, to these ears, reminiscent of today's Radiohead. \\"Oh Yeah\\" begins an explosion sound bite and what sounds like Suzuki's vocals being played backwards. \\"Oh Yeah\\" eventually evolves into a jam with an almost \\"folky\\" feel to it. \\"Halleluhwah\\" begins like something right off of Miles Davis' electric-jazz-fusion apex, \\"Live-Evil.\\" A funk beat dominates the entire song, that expands into an amazing variety of atmospheres and colorful, textural explorations in its' 18 minute entirety. The song seems to slowly succumb to insanity as it progresses, but never quite loses its' steam. After \\"Halleluhwah,\\" Tago Mago completely loses touch with reality, delving into some seriously avant-garde territory, previously explored by the likes of modern composers Stockhausen and Varse, which serves as a perfect contrast to the minimalist nature of the first half of the album. Can continue to delve in a perpetual nightmare of psychedelic hysteria until the album closes.<br /><br />Everything in \\"Tago Mago\\" is sharp, angular and uneasily tense, while somehow able to slowly expand into the listeners inner conscious. The performance is delightfully tight, in its own choppy manner, even as \\"Tago Mago\\" moves into obscure and highly illogical territory. You can never really guess where \\"Tago Mago\\" will take you, even after multiple listens. There is almost a conscious equilibrium throughout this albums entirety, matching every moment of melodic bliss with haphazardly primitive intensity. Such a staggering amount of cohesive variety has never been as accurately put to mainstream music than in this krautrock classic.<br /><br />Though \\"Tago Mago\\" is unquestionably a landmark statement in rock music, it is certainly not for the average listener. This album is a \\"grower\\" in every sense of the word. Even amongst fans of prog-rock, you would be hard pressed to find a listener who can honestly say that they enjoyed \\"Tago Mago\\" upon first listen. Everything about this album is sharp, intense, and unsetting, even in its' most accessible moments, revealing almost none of its' dark secrets without intense patience from the listener. If I were pressed to find a single adjective to most accurately describe \\"Tago Mago,\\" it would undoubtedly be \\"subtle.\\" \\"Tago Mago\\" demands unwavering attention, vivid imagination, and tolerance for the quintessential avant-garde. There is, undoubtedly, nothing more painful to the average listener than the constant barrage of violent percussion cycles that \\"Tago Mago\\" offers, or the a-melodic, audio-hallucinations featured throughout the last half of the disk. Of course, when \\"Tago Mago\\" finds its way to the appreciative ears of the music fanatic, it eventually becomes a permanent favorite.<br /><br />Akin to any truly innovative musical composition, even the most thorough of descriptions fall despairingly short of personifying the actual experience. I can only appeal to the adventurous listener's curiosity by resulting in using the utterly clich&eacute;, but never more appropriate statement: \\"You have to hear it to believe it.\\"e \\"Tago Mago,\\" it would undoubtedly be \\"subtle.\\" \\"Tago Mago\\" demands unwavering attention, vivid imagination, and tolerance for the quintessential avant-garde.

B0009MAP90|3.0|This album includes 11 traditional blues and folk tunes and only 2 originals. Of the original songs I consider \\"Song To Woody\\" to be the better effort. It's a ode to not only Woody Guthrie but also other musical influences such as Leadbelly and Cisco. It is still far from his best songwriting but a good place to start. On the other hand I really don't care for \\"Talkin' New York\\". It's a satirical stab at his early struggles in the New York folk scene. But the truth is that Dylan was able to sign a major label record deal within a couple years while many of his talented musical peers continued to perform, some for decades, in relative obscurity. So to me this song is a whiny expression of Dylan's large and hypersensitive ego. I should also mention that Dylan is my favorite musical artist of the last 50 years. But he, like all of us, is only human. So it's best to be aware of his flaws and not fall into mindless \\"hero worship\\".    As for his covers of traditional songs I find it to be a mixed bag. The young Dylan clearly had tremendous energy and many of these songs are raved up versions with Dylan practically snarling some of the lyrics. Remember that Dylan had discovered Elvis and Buddy Holly before he got into folk music and the signs that he would someday \\"go electric\\" are evident even on this first album. I enjoyed \\"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\\" and a few others. But I hate how he turned the beautiful Scottish folk ballad \\"Pretty Peggy-O\\" into a weak effort at humor and parody. Pretty much all of these traditional songs are great classics. But I would encourage listeners to seek out the original artists, such as Rev.Gary Davis, or at least versions more faithful to the source material such as those by Doc Watson.    Of course, it is also interesting to hear them done by Dylan and Dylan completists will want to add this to their collection. Fortunately, Dylan would later find his true voice as rock's greatest songwriter and go on to make some of the best musicof the latter half of the 20th century. This, after all, was only the beginning.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|Ever since Moulin Rouge re-energized the then malignant musical genre, we have just been assaulted by a slew of hit Broadway Musicals turned big screen show stoppers, from the highs (Chicago) to the lows (The Producers). And while Dreamgirls was very well done, it really just buckled under its own pressure and did not live up to my expectations. But for 2007, musicals hit an all time high when not one, not two, but three well done films were released. In the Summer, we were treated to the feel good Hairspray. In the Fall, we then experienced the fantasy that was Across the Universe. And finally, they toped of the year with an all time high with Sweeney Todd- The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, one of the best musical adaptations in recent years.<br /><br />For those familiar with the Broadway play, we are shown the story of the vengeful Benjamin Parker, who for fifteen years has been paying for a crime he did not commit, wrongfully accused by the wicked Judge Tulpin. Now, he has returned to London, with a new name and a thirst for vengence. Aided by his former landlady Mrs. Lovett, he cuts a bloody path across 19th century London in his ulitmate quest for revenge against those who have wronged him.<br /><br />First off, Tim Burton could not have been a better choice to bring this tale to the big screen. Already one of the biggest directors out right now and a sheer genious of quirky, dark films, there really was no other contender that could have done the job he did. Here, he brings his best work since Ed Wood. The atmosphere, the costumes, the settings, everything just not only screams Burton but also keeps the vision of Stephen Sondheim alive and well. And usually i'm not a person who squirms easily but some of the throat slashings really did just make me shiver slightly in my seat, something I do not experience a lot even with some of the goriest or scariest horror films, so bravo to Burton for letting the blood fly (and believe me, there is a lot).<br /><br />Now, at first I was a bit apprehensive about Johnny Depp playing Sweeney Todd, cause until then I had no idea he could sing. But luckily, my fears were put to rest as soon as he stepped on screen. As Sweeney, he glowers, he sings, he kils, just once again submerging himself into yet another unique character. Helena Bonham Carter also proves her own as Todd's acomplice, delivering comic wit at just the right time and holding her own on the screen next to Depp and as for Alan Rickman, he just completly took me by surprise. To see the guy most people know as Professor Snape just being up there and singing is just a bit of a shock but he definently pulled it off. And for those who groan over the singing, I mean come on! These are not professional Broadway singers people! So its expected they wouldn't be on par with those who originally played the cast.<br /><br />I was very dissapointed that this film did not get the realy recognition by the Academy as it should have, especially for Best Picture and Director. But then again, this was a pretty tough year, full of a lot of great films, so the fact it sort of got lost in the shuffle to the likes of heavy hitters like No Country For Old Men or There Will Be Blood. But at least Depp got his just reward with a Best Actor nod.<br /><br />Definently one of the best films of 2007, Sweeney Todd is a must see for moviegoers but if you are not a fan for musicals, this will most likely not be your taste of film. However, if your a fan or loved the Broadway play, the film will surely not dissapoint.prehensive about Johnny Depp playing Sweeney Todd, cause until then I had no idea he could sing.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|Featuring Joe Strummer on rhythm guitar and vocals, Mick Jones on guitar (with some vocals), Paul Simenon on bass (contributing vocals), and Topper Headon on drums and percussion, this group played well and played raw.  Lyrics were tough and there was always a rough edge that worked well. This is possibly their best work and one of the classic rock and punk works of the past three decades.<br /><br />The CD begins with a rousing anthem from The Clash--\\"London Calling.\\" The song begins with an almost menacing tone, as Strummer sings:<br /><br />\\"London calling to the faraway towns<br />Now that war is declared--And battle come down.\\"<br /><br />There is a mocking reference to \\"phony Beatlemania [biting] the dust.\\" A great punk song, but also a great rock and roll piece. You Tube has a terrific clip of The Clash singing this, with some nice visuals involved, starting off with the clock.  Take a look!<br /><br />Then, \\"Spanish Bombs.\\" I mention this because it is not often that one hears a song about the Spanish Civil War, an event from the 1930s. The beat is supported well by the rhythm section and there is a nice forward momentum to this song. Joe Strummer's voice produces a nice punk rock sound.<br /><br />\\"Working for the Clampdown.\\"  The rhythm section starts this song off well.  Guitars growl. Strummer sings lines such as the following:<br /><br />\\"The judge said five to ten, but I said double that again,<br />I'm not working for the clampdown<br />No man born with a soul<br />Can be working for the clampdown.\\"<br /><br />Then there is the menacing \\"The Guns of Brixton.\\" Raw instrumental work, supporting lines such as:<br /><br />\\"When they kick in your front door<br />How you gonna come?<br />With your hands on your head<br />Or your trigger on your gun.\\"<br /><br />An angry song on an angry album.  But, despite that, this CD works well.  The Clash had the anger and rawness of The Sex Pistols, but were better musicians and created a more compelling sound.<br /><br />There are many other good songs, such as \\"Rudie Can't Fail,\\" \\"Revolution Rock,\\"  \\"Wrong `em Boyo,\\" \\"Lover's Rock,\\" and so on.  But the CD closes out with an interesting piece--\\"Train in Vain.\\"<br /><br />\\"Train in Vain\\" is an infectious and captivating song, incongruous in juxtaposition to \\"The Guns of Brixton.\\"  The guitar work is simple but effective; the rhythm section does its job well.<br /><br />Any way you cut it. This is a 5-star work.  This may be the pinnacle of The Clash's career (and they had some other awfully good albums), before the creative differences between Strummer and Jones blew the band apart. But what a run they had before their time ended!ver's Rock,\\" and so on.

B0000CFW87|4.0|Great songs and beautiful music....his voice is full of passion and magic...classic style...It would be even better if it had more selection of English songs in this CD...Can't understand the lyrics of many songs, but I do love his voice and the wonderful music.
B000S9UA94|5.0|After the first few times though this CD I felt pretty much the same way as the person who gave it 1 star...boring.     I couldn't have been more wrong, this one needs to grow on you.  At this point I feel this is his best work perhaps in his career...that's a big statement!  Give it a chance, it truly is beautiful.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I missed all of Beatles era almost completely, because of I was not even born yet. In my time: PF, LZ, UH, DP and ... were my heroes.  I had a Beatles album when I was a kid, but it never rang a bell for me. It sounded to me like a school band.  After watching a movie, for the first time in my entire live I was moved to buy an Audio CD with the songs. Thanks for these new young voices, modern and alternative interpretation - I actually was able to truly enjoy timeless Beatles songs for the first time in my live.  Beatles fans may still think there is nothing better than Beatles themselves. The songs are great, but original Beatles recordings are dated. Fortunately there are other options now. I think more young people would enjoy Beatles song when every song is matched near perfect with an artist capable to make the best of it. I think this movie and this CD is the best so far. My kids love it.
B000HEYVOU|5.0|I cannot say enough good things.  My children love it.  My childrens' spanish class loves it.  My childrens' preschool class loved it -- and that made ME a very popular mom on the day it was my turn to read them a story.  The children want to hear it again and again.  My very young children learned to read the words after memorizing the book.  It is that good.  I don't get tired of reading it with the SHRIEKS of laughter I earn!
B0012SVF3A|4.0|Director Luc Besson ([[ASIN:0767802519 The Professional]] and [[ASIN:0800195175 The Fifth Element]]) is a person who is more impressed by artists who recreate their dreams than those who try to relay some specific message. So I think to truly enjoy this little gem of a film, you need to step back a bit and see the forest rather than concentrate too closely on the trees.<br /><br />The setting is Paris, France and the choice to shoot it in black & white is perfect. The beginning of this fairy tale starts out like some twisted version of Frank Capra's [[ASIN:B00062J00S It's a Wonderful Life]]. Andr&eacute; (played by Jamel Debbouze) is a Jimmy Stewart that's clearly several rungs lower on the moral ladder. Like George Bailey, Andr&eacute;'s own plan of suicide is thwarted by instead instinctually saving the life of an undercover angel who jumps off the same bridge before Andr&eacute; has a chance to.<br /><br />And so we meet Angel-A or as she says Angela (Rie Rasmussen - who was Brian De Palma's Veronica in [[ASIN:B0000897EA Femme Fatale]]). Rasmussen is perfect as the vampy angel and brings a delicious human element back to these creatures that have been elevated in status to virtual infallibility in recent portrayals. This angel smokes like a chimney and wears a tiny black dress that accentuates her mile-high runway model legs.<br /><br />The world that Andr&eacute; created through all his lying, cheating, and scams gone bad, is closing in on him fast. Angela has her work cut out for her. Before she can get Andr&eacute; out of his jam and safely away from the loan sharks, Angela needs to get Andr&eacute; to think differently about himself--a rebirth of sorts.<br /><br />One thing I've learned from seeing this and Luc Besson's other films is that he has an uncanny knack of combining unique visuals and oddball romantic pairings into really enjoyable films.

Two years after second world war came Roswell saucer, transistor, Dead Sea Schrolls, and independence to India. United Nations Human Rights Declaration came in 1948.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|Russell Crowe proves once again that he is one of the most versatile and chameleon-like actors working these days, this time in a role as a cop trying to bring down a drug kingpin.  Denzel Washington gives a nuanced performance as Frank Lucas, who ran a tremendous drug operation in the 1970s that spanned two continents.      Director Ridley Scott handles the complex and lengthy tale well, with excellent production values, appropriate music, and a nicely executed ending that gives us a bit more info on the two main characters even after we read subtitles about what became of them.      And once again, Crowe is dissed by the Academy, which could have nominated this film instead of Juno or Atonement.   But what else is new?
B0001Z52RU|1.0|As I watch this film I just keep saying, \\"Oh, man, what horribly disturbing thing is going to happen next??\\"<br />If this thought thrills you, then give this flick five stars, by all means.<br /><br />I really don't know what to make of The Butterfly Effect except that its few interesting concepts (and they are very few) are completely drowned out by a deeply disturbing and manipulative series of events which are supposed to be a story.<br /><br />This is a nasty film. I don't say things like that often, and I don't use words lightly.<br /><br />This movie just smacks you in the face time after time with insulting nonsense. Throughout the entire film I feel extremely uncomfortable. And not in the good way that you enjoy from a film. Maybe that's what they were looking to do when they made this thing, make people uncomfortable. No, thanks. If someone finds this stuff fun or enjoyable, then there is a problem with the person emotionally or psychologically.<br /><br />Child pornography, drug abuse, cruelty to animals, and unspeakable graphic violence from kids are all things that lurk in our deepest nightmares (or on the six o'clock news broadcasts). But here they are, presented for your approval as entertainment. Not my idea of a good night at the movies.<br /><br />I would feel differently if this film really raised some worthwhile issues, or had a truly riveting story to tell, or contained fascinating and richly drawn characters, or painted an emotionally satisfying picture. It does none of these things.<br /><br />Each fantastic and twisted scenario presented gets worse and worse. This is really just an exercise in sensational shock value. 'How can we freak the audience out for a couple of hours', this film seems to ask. And even when the film seems to be going in a positive direction it is all too brief and too late for all the negative crap it has already spewed at its audience.<br /><br />People who love this film should reexamine why they do. It may be just for cheap and easy thrills. This movie flirts with science fiction and aims to be high psychological drama. It fails, big time. People say \\"Wow, this film really blew my mind\\". Fine. Yes, it's all very freaky and disturbing stuff. But does that equal a good film? No. There are other psychological films that succeed way beyond this junk, movies that are thought provoking, entertaining, and fascinating, that don't pander to the lowest or go for cheap jolts. I would advise people to avoid this movie unless they enjoy staring at awful car wrecks for long periods of time.<br /><br />The worst part for me is that this could have been a really fascinating and interesting film (rather than a stupid shock ride), because it plays with such intriguing concepts and ideas: time travel and altering the past to change the future. Handled differently, The Butterfly Effect could've been a good film instead of a huge, ugly disappointment.nce fiction and aims to be high psychological drama. It fails, big time.

B000EJ9MTW|2.0|Having missed out on the 70's I suppose I am not qualified to write a review on Wolfmother.  Everyone I know seems to like this band but I must admit, I don't get it.  Sure, I'm in to Black Sabbath and absolutely LOVE Led Zeppelin... but Wolfmother resembles these bands only superficially.    However there's one important difference - songwriting.  Given, only a handful of bands a generation can write a \\"Stairway\\" or a \\"Paranoid\\".  But is it too much to ask for one song with a memorable (I won't even ask for an original) guitar riff?    One thing I notice is that everyone who digs these guys feels compelled to relate to me the story of how the band came together, and in my opinion that is their best selling point.  I need more from a band than a good bio though.  For a good synopsis of the problem with Woflmother, check out the Mike Patton YouTube video where he can't even continue the interview because the band is chugging away uninspiredly in the background.    These guys are the more recent equivalent of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies (anyone remember them?).  Good for what they are, but what they are is a derivative fad band with one trick up their sleeve.  That these guys are the new, hot thing in rock music is yet another indication that rock & roll's days are numbered.
0767812166|5.0|Starman is one of my favorite movies and Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors. What more can be said. Both of them together in a heart jerker. I love it and am so pleased to have my own copy. I even have it on VHS.
B00104W8T6|4.0|I saw the movie and loved it, also loved the soudtrack, so bought it. I think you will either love the music or hate it.  I have some friends who can't stand it, and some, like me who sing along. You know the words after playing it a couple of times.  I could do without the political references, with which I do not agree, and also the profanity on some songs, but hey, it's a soundtrack and they are relevant.
B000TKW3E2|2.0|Terribly disappointed in the soundtrack.  Haven't seen the movie, so I'm approaching it from a different level.  Compared with other original soundtracks (I'm a collector), this just wasn't up to the beauty I hoped it would be.  Not one I'd sit and listen to for hours and hours.  You might like it if you use it to relive the movie, but from a non-viewer's standpoint, it just wasn't a moving experience and, therefore, can't recommend it.
B000VBP38C|5.0|A joy to watch over and over.  The picture is so clear and beautiful.  The story is timeless.  Amazing!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Loved this cd.   I was worried that it would be a bunch of junk remixes.   But I was not dissapointed at all.   Even my father who passed down his love of the Beatles to me was impressed.   A must buy if you love the Beatles.
1594489505|5.0|My heart breaks for the women in these countries.  I've been counting my blessings for living in this great country we call the United States of America.  I know this was fiction, but the author must know first hand what life is like for women in Afghanistan otherwise he could not have been so precise.  The history of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, etc. is riddled with wars and violence against humanity, but mostly women.  A great read and it leaves you with a prayer for hope.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|If You see this movie , you should also read \\"The Politcally Incorredt Guide to Global Warming and Evironmrntalism\\" by CHRISTOPHER C. HORNER.    Not as flashy, and boring to read, but if you can get through it, the real truth about \\"global warming\\" will come to light.      Point by point, Mr. Gores theory is completely disproven.  You will be shocked as I was.
B000UFAURI|1.0|I really wanted to like this album.  I was reluctant to give it 1 star, because people who give an album one star usually haven't even listened to it and just hate the artist.  But in my opinion the CD deserves one star.  I have been a FF fan since their first album.  Foo Fighters, the Colour and the Shape and One by One were all solid.  I didn't like in Your Honor at all, but everyone makes a bad CD at some point.  I've listened to Echoes, Silence a number of times through, and I came to the conclusion that it's boring, uninspiring, generic music.  The band really sounds along the lines of Everclear or even Matchbox 20.  To me, that just isn't worth listening to.  Lyrics like \\"running through hell, Heaven can wait\\" sound like they were written by Jessica Simpson.  Calling someone a pretender and then saying \\"I'll never surrender\\" because it conveniently rhymes... They can do better than that, right??
B0002SG1OY|5.0|I know this isn't a spaghetti western but this Sanctuary version of \\"Arthur\\" is definitely worth more than the readily available Reprise version that's been around for years.     Having owned both copies I can tell you first hand that this version has a much clearer and richer sound. Not only is the mix louder but the bass is deeper and above all it doesn't sound muddy like the older reprise version. On top of all that, you get great bonus tracks like \\"Plastic Man\\" , \\"King Kong\\", two great songs that were meant to be on a Dave Davies solo album (This Man He Weeps Tonight, Mindless Child Of Motherhood) and some mono mixes of some album cuts.    OK, enough of the technical stuff, this album alone is a classic but then you get some great bonus tracks as well. This in my opinion is the Kinks best album, don't get me wrong I also love Village Green Preservation Society but this album has more kick to it. It features all members on top of their game. Ray is at his absolute best with his writing and voice, \\"Shangri La\\" is an under appreciated gem of his. Dave gets to kick his guitar on to high gear and his song \\"Brainwashed\\" is one of many highlights on this album. Mick Avory displays great drumming all throughout but for me his highlight has to be on \\"She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina\\" and John Dalton makes his full time debut on the bass playing a melodic bass line that McCartney would love on \\"Victoria\\".      As you've probably read before this album had the bad fortune of being compared to Tommy at the time of it's release but what people didn't know was that this album was recorded before Tommy.     I could go on and on about this album but I'd only be stopping you from getting it sooner.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|This release really sounded as great as previously advised. Some might say, undoubtfully, that  this is the ultimate TSRTS release and I'd be glad to agree with them. An once in a lifetime gift for the die-hard ones!!    Cheers!!
B000CNFC76|4.0|A great movie I saw on cable and was ready to buy to watch again when I went to the US Open site and saw that Ouimet did win the playoff but not by a hanging put on 18. Why can't Hollywood believe that we appreciate reality and don't need a phony finale. They are just like the club members who offered his 10-year-old caddie (really) money for him to change caddies...if that was real!

0340209178|5.0|Thoroughly researched, as are all of Clavell's works, Shogun takes you on a non-stop cultural and political roller-coaster ride. I read this novel in 3 days - with work interrupting - over 15 years ago. It has never left me. The Portuguese have been guarding the trade route to Japan. Profits are high. Politics are dangerous, both within the European community that has the sudden influx of the wreaked sailors from an English vessel, and the Japanese court and its Samurai warriors and generals - and their ladies. Advancement and power are paired with honor and death. Torture is not so much a tool as an advocation. Deception might just be honorable.      If you enjoy intrigue, an insider's indepth view of the workings of power in a culture both unlike and like our own, powerful relationships of all kinds (based on power, on gender, and on both), and exciting historical fiction of the highest caliber, then you don't want to miss this one. King Rat and Tai-pai follow, but this is the best of the three.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I was never a big Bruce Springsteen fan although I know of his music back in the 80's. However, when I heard his song Girls In Their Summer Clothes, I had to check him out. I previewed the song and his video and decided to get his album. Now that I have listened to all the tracks on Magic, I have been coverted to a Bruce fan. The songs are great, the lyrics well written, the sounds, rhythms and structure of his songs are pure Springsteen at his best. A definate must for any fan and a definate please try it to anyone that is not.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was very upset when I watched the final episode of this series today, because I knew there was no more.  Truthfully, I think it is a series that you may have to let grow on you.  If you start out feeling uncertain or even slightly bored, like I did, just know that each episode is better than the last.  The last disc was outstanding and it's unfortunate that those episodes were never aired.<br /><br />In the end, I found everything about this series to be appealing.  It's a complete package: likeable characters, interesting sets, witty and meaningful dialogue, unique storylines, and a great balance of action, drama, and humor.  Also, the fact that Firefly mixed in a western theme was surprisingly fun and fit very well with the other themes of the series.<br /><br />Great stuff and most definitely NOT overrated.  Firefly is the real deal.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I saw this on PBS and had to have it!  I have seen other renditions of Jane Austen's Persuasion, but this by far is the best one.  Wonderful screenplay, great job by all actors, outstanding costume and set design, and beautiful music.  Casting Rupert Penry-Jones as Capt. Wentworth was a good move, but I have to give kudos to Julia Davis as Anne's sister Mary.  She is awesome!  Passionate, honorable and romantic story.  I've watched it about twenty times!
0525950079|5.0|Pillars of the Earth was one of the best books ever written - bar none- in the genre of historical fiction. A close second/third are Herman Wouk's epic WW2 tales, Winds of War and War & Remebrance. What \\"Pillars\\" offered us was a a chance to become embedded in a society that we could heretofore only imagine, and become so completely embedded that we could taste the ale and feel the scratchy straw we slept on each night in the cold damp halls of our Lord & Master. We were transported back to the 12th century and became connected forever with Tom Builder & the other souls of Kingsbridge. Ken Follett has not let us down with the sequel, World Without End. We're transported 200 years into the future and the same richness in historical fiction we experienced in \\"Pillars\\" is ours to enjoy all over again with Tom Builder's descendants. Don't wait another minute to pick up this 1,000 page epic and dive right in. You'll enjoy the swim. I recently finished a new book by a debut author, which I believe comes up to Follet's and Wouk's standards, [[ASIN:1590131363 Night of Flames: A Novel of World War II]], by Douglas W. Jacobson treats WW2 Poland & Belgium in the same convincing way that Follett treats 14th century England. Great writers are all around us. It's exciting!!
0679411585|5.0|Joe and General Moore narrate a precisely written, no frills account of the first major action between two excellent commanders and their superbly trained troops.  The work does not describe battle as glamorous or noble; it recounts the horror, the pain, chaos, acts of courage, and of sacrifice that is part and parcel of the fog of battle. Utterly straight forward with no holds barred. If you want confirmation of my review please read General Moore's AAR (after action report).  You find the matter of fact narrative and analysis of the battle in General Moore's report. I consider it an honor to know Joe personally and consider him one of the most acute correspondents and journalists of this century. Essential reading for anyone hoping to make sense of the Vietnam War.    Jim Payne
0143035711|5.0|Bob Mason wrote a very eloquent, very eye-opening account of his Vietnam tour as a helicopter pilot.     Having just lost my older brother, who was also a helicopter (slick) pilot in 67-68 with the D Troop 1/10 Cav (Shamrocks) and A Co., 4th Avn Bn (Black Jack), I found just how much he sugar-coated the \\"war stories\\"  he told myself and our siblings when we were pre-teens/teens. After reading Chickenhawk, it's a miracle that Bob Mason (and my brother) ever made it home at all. It seems that if this war didn't get you physically, it sure got you mentally and emotionally - making you pay one way or another.      From a woman's point of view, I recommend this book to every woman who ever had a son, brother, uncle or husband in Vietnam.  This is what our Vietnam heroes went through for US ... somehow, a mere \\"thank you\\" will never be enough.    Welcome home, Bob. Thanks for all you gave up for us.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I love this movie and am eagerly anticipating the blu-ray release. Will Smith's acting in this movie is very convincing, you will be moved. The next-gen zombies, as I like to call them, bring back excitement to zombie movies, which I'm not a big fan of, but this isn't any typical zombie movie. The ideas in the movie are original, I think it's neat the way, like in The Pursuit Of Happyness, he has one of his children in the movie. If you don't like the ending, then you truly don't understand the whole point of the movie, watch it again, and again, and again, like I am going to. I hope this review helps.

B000002IGP|4.0|While this album is not perfect, it is nonetheless a quintessential hair metal album for those who are in love with '80s nostalgia. While it's not fair to call this album a \\"hit and miss\\" album, there's really only one identifiable hit on this album (\\"Round & Round\\"), but it's not the only good song. The other \\"hits\\" were simply singles that failed to chart, or crack anywhere successful on the pop charts.    Songs like \\"I'm Insane,\\" and \\"Round & Round,\\" and \\"She Wants Money\\" pepper this album with '80s sleaze, debauchery, and simply great guitar work by Warren DeMartini and Robbin Crosby. Stephen Pearcy is forgettable as a singer and frontman. Simply imagine a singer trying to be Vince Neil (Motley Crue) and Kevin DuBrow (Quiet Riot) at once, but neither at the same time. The rhythm is the typical '80s backing. Echoed drums with the always complimented \\"driving\\" basslines, if you can ever hear them.    The only real treat from these music videos off the album is that comedian legend Milton Berle is in almost all of them. I must confess, Berle is more entertaining in HIS transvestism than Ratt's, who tries very hard to upstage him in their feminine behaviors, or Pearcy's mannerisms that are just so distinctly '80s, it makes me almost sick to watch. The band is more entertaining than the frontman. Which is bad criticism, but fair and honest nonetheless. Bruce Dickinson jumps around on stage, with his David Lee Roth-esque acrobatics, Ozzy would pour water over fans, Rob Halford and Peter Gabriel both rode bikes of some kind, while Halford would seem to sign, while Gabriel would dress in crazy costumes. Stephen Pearcy just seems to stand there, bending his knees at the beat in the \\"Round & Round\\" video. Even Elvis Pressley was more entertaining 35 years earlier on the Ed Sullivan Show shaking his hips.    Some songs, such as \\"Wanted Man\\" are just, if anything, too '80s, too forgettable, too boring, tired, and too over the top. Don't believe me? Watch the music video forthis song. It takes place in the old West with Ratt, a notorious gun-slinging gang fighting yet another infamous gang. It's truly pathetic upon retrospect to see Ratt facing off and attempting to look tough with their glossed hair (that I'm surprised doesn't combust in the heat because of all the hairspray) and lipstick with earrings... Hell, the cover just gives it away. Anything with Tawny Kitaen in it/on it/around it/on top of it/under it (who was dating Robbin Crosby at the time) has its own seal of '80s authenticity.    Overall, one does not need to be a Ratt fan to purchase this album to like it. However, one does need to be a hair metal fan to enjoy it. Those of you who's tastes are Metallica to Pantera up, avoid this album.
0553208845|5.0|I've been teaching this book to classes for about a decade, and if one of the marks of truly great literature is that it generates discussions - then this is most assuredly one of the greatest of books.  Some students find it too challenging, of course.  They decide to ignore Siddhartha's final vision altogether.  This is one way to deal with the problem of being asked to think about life in a wholly new fashion, and rather than it being a 'fault' in the book it is evidence of the book's desire to give readers a push in a new and somewhat unnerving direction.  For Siddhartha's vision is of a world in which 'I' and 'you' dissolve - and this can be perceived by some 19 and 20 year olds as extremely threatening.<br /><br />Any book that can shake up students in this age bracket is worth its weight in gold.

While the children are planning how to spend their unearned wealth, Phelan's lawyers are quietly enacting and preparing to enforce the terms of the new will that the children know nothing of.  Part of fulfilling Phelan's last wishes entails a trip to one of the remotest corners of the world, Brazil's Pantanal.  A recovering alcoholic and lawyer, Nate O'Reilly is selected for this mission.  At the same time, Phelan's children find out that new will leaves them out and they begin plotting a will challenge.  A successful defense depends on the results of Nate O'Reilly's trip.    This book reads, as do many of Mr. Grisham's works, like a movie script.  Fast pace, quick dialog and lots of cliffhangers.  If you're like me, you'll breeze through this book in a few short days.  Don't, however, expect any great insight.  You may also be surprised at the relatively scant time spent in the courtroom in this book.  While we do get a few scenes of snappy high-priced lawyering, most of the time we're mired deep in a swamp.  The change of scenery and reduced obsession with elite attorneys, in my opinion, makes this book better than most of Mr. Grisham's works.  Others may find the Grisham name on this book tortiously deceptive.

0805079831|5.0|Do not fail to read Naomi Klein's book, The Shock Doctrine\\", the clearest, best documented explanation of America's long standing,  vicious foreign policy yet written.  Other books on this sad attack by the US on developing nations note the obvious that unfettered free market economics ala the late Milton Friedman produces disastrous conditions for the masses where tried and can only be put in place under dictatorships which use brutal repression.  What are the 3 main prescriptions of the Friedman technique:  Privatization, deregulation, and cutbacks in social welfare spending, a triple play which clearly on the record does not produce real democracy, in fact, as history proves  the results are exactly the opposite.<br /><br />However, Klein's investigative reporting is the best on America's empire building activities which I have read so far.<br /><br />The US government, the IMF and rich multinationals installed what she calls \\"shock capitalism\\" everywhere a crisis could be found or created in these countries.  Examples include Chile, Russia under Yeltsin, and many other hapless countries which were caught in this largely US spun spider web. Klein tells how the greedy corporate elites here, the same ones who have bought and now control our government,  are well along in the process of doing it to us in the USA!  Examples: Importing cheap, often illegal labor well beyond any need, failing to secure our borders and ports, trying to ram a truck route from Mexico to the Canadian border, cutting government help to the poor, fixing the tax laws to benefit the wealthiest Americans,  exporting our manufacturing jobs to cheap labor countries, ignoring constitutionally guaranteed rights under the guise of guarding us against terrorism, and trying to steal public assets via privatization, are all designed to bring untold riches to the elites and crush the spirit of the Middle and working classes which have made this democracy great.<br /><br />The belief that unfettered capitalism brings real democracy which Milton Friedman sold long ago to US policy makers in both parties and the corporate elites which support them did not prove true in the multiple cases where is was tried. Ramming it into numerous developing countries on the wings of various crises (e.g. craftily planned engineered shocks like the Iraq War) allowed US firms and elite insiders in the countries where it was tried to steal public assets and destroy the laws and institutions of many governments.  Horrifying stuff, Folks.<br /><br />Frankly, neither Clinton or Obama will bring this situation to a halt,  but at least Obama is not blatantly in the pocket of the hard right neo conservatives who have led the stealing here and abroad, while Mrs. Clinton surely must have known about this situation while serving as First Lady. We must be deeply indebted to Klein for bringing the case against what she dubs \\"corporatism\\" to light and hopefully to help initiate its decline.mocracy which Milton Friedman sold long ago to US policy makers in both parties and the corporate elites which support them did not prove true in the multiple cases where is was tried.

B00001SIES|4.0|I've been listening to Muse for a few months, and I'm amazed by how good they are. \\"Showbiz,\\" their first album, doesn't quite show how amazing they are, but it's still a great album. First off, I would have given this 4 1/2 stars if I could. The album starts off with two really good songs, \\"sunburn and \\"muscle museum.\\" What I love about Muse is that every album has a different feel to it. In this album the songs aren't quite polished as much as they are in their other albums. However, the songs have a cool, epic and raw feel to them.  The best songs in the album are \\"sunburn\\", \\"muscle museum\\", \\"falling down\\", \\"showbiz\\", \\"unintended\\", and \\"uno\\".
B0008ENICU|5.0|I would! What can be said about \\"The Women\\" that hasn't already been said?

I'd rather have the itch!\\"<br />\\"He's a Borgia! An absolute Borgia!\\"<br />\\"It's wrong - shockingly wrong!\\"<br /><br />I guess there are a couple things here and there which could be better - for one thing, this was the age when nobody could write for children. And that \\"little Hanes brat\\" moaning \\"Mother darling... Daddy dearest\\" really needs to be put out of her misery.<br /><br />Paulette Goddard's timing is often clunky, and she has trouble with that Hollywood-American-British accent, but really, everyone else is spot on.

B000P12LWY|3.0|... but it's still fun.<br /><br />I've seen so many documentaries and dramas on this fascinating time... and this was a sexy, revisionist version.<br /><br />I did feel like I was learning something about daily life or this figure or that - but they fiddled with the truth so much that I didn't trust what I was 'learning!' I was sent to the Internet on more than one occasion and found that some of the artistic licenses were huge. Henry's sister didn't even marry the king of Portugal, let alone smother him with a pillow and bed down with Henry's best friend!<br /><br />Another odd thing was the gay subplot - two relatively minor characters suddenly start cruising each other and then get all romantic. Of course they didn't have sex scenes, just those slumbering post-sex scenes, while the straight couples were tearing at each other's codpieces and bodices! Then one of them died and the other decided he was into girls, so the whole premise turned out to be another gratuitous stunt.<br /><br />Having said all this, it's quite fun - just look at it as a well-acted costume drama, but don't look to it as a history lesson!

It is based on the novel [[ASIN:1585470805 The Searchers]], which I have not read.<br /><br />It , also , stars Ward Bond as a feisty preacher and head of the local Rangers.  A couple of side comments.<br /><br />First, they should have paid attention to the dog.<br /><br />  Second, do you really think the Indians were stupid enough to identify their chiefs with that elaborate headdress?  The last army I can think of that did that ( identify their leaders ) was the British in the American Revolutionary War and they learned not to do that around American Sharpshooters<br /><br />Third, did you know that Texas hated the Indians so bad that they killed or drove out every last one of them?  There are no Indian Reservations in Texas.<br /><br />I thought I was in Love with Nartalie Wood when I was growing up.  Ain't she special?<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of the Classic western, John Wayne , and  Natalie wood.<br /><br />Gunner  February 2,008
B000YENUIG|5.0|Director David Cronenberg brings a full measure of brutality, gritty mob drama, contrasts and contradictions, and adult themes to his opus Eastern Promises.  Although the plot itself is modest and not-too-original, the acting, direction, script, and dark look of the film are all so superb that it is a must see for any serious cinema-goer who isn't too squeamish.<br /><br />The plot centers on Viggo Mortensen, who plays 'the driver' for London Russian mob boss Armin Mueller-Stahl.  Viggo also babysits Stahl's screw-up son, played by Victor Cassell.  All three men deliver such unbelievably credible and subtle performances that Naomi Watts, also a fine acting talent, sometimes seems a little out of her depth.<br /><br />Mortensen rises through the underworld while Watts, a midwife, tracks down an entwined mystery of an abandoned baby.<br /><br />The superb acting is enhanced by a subtle and stellar screenplay and visuals that often contrast light and shadow, devout religious tattoos and brutal tattoo-wearers, family and business, violence and compassion. These contrasts and an 'inside the mob' plot ala Donnie Brasco, are what really make this film a 5-star watch.<br /><br />Downsides are inevitable in a realistic look at a brutal way of life so expect some truly graphic sequences and some predictability.  But Promises has few other weak spots.<br /><br />(Reviewer's chops:  Orthodox, Spent much time in Russia and London, Russian-speaker.)
0920668372|1.0|As someone with a lot of experience with children's literature (I'm a children's librarian), I can confidently say that this is NOT a children's book.  This is a book is for overly-sentimental, super-sappy mothers.  If my mother had read this to me, I would have suggested therapy.  If she had wept while reading this to me, I would have attempted emancipation and had her certified at the state mental facility.  It would frighten any child to think that their unstable, co-dependent parent might sneak into their bedroom through a window(after the child is grown)  to snuggle with them.    Not only is this book poorly written and too sentimental, but the illustrations are lacking and the relationship between the mother and son makes my stomach bile rise.    I believe that people who love and defend this book so vehemently should invest in some sort of therapy to save their children from a lifetime of complexes and personality defects brought about by their parents' unhealthy emotional attachment.

B000002GB9|3.0|I bought this album when it first came out due to \\"Come sail Away\\" and I played the first side over and over and became a Styx fan.  Then I subsequently purchased their other albums throughout the years and later on their CDs.  I now have every album/CD of their's since the Grand Illusion.  I know many Styx fans and \\"experts\\" think this is their best work but I just don't get it.  It is good but I still like Cornerstone, Paradise Theatre, Edge of the century and Cyclorama better.  First of all there are really only 7 songs on the disc.  The first four are very good and Come Sail Away and Fooling Yourself I consider great songs but Castle Walls, Man in the Wilderness and Miss America (Okay, I am not a JY fan) just don't do it for me.  This would be in top for best \\"half albums\\" but not for full albums.  All in all though they were and still are a great band and I love their music and can't wait for another new disc.
B00007LTIB|5.0|After many (mostly critics) criticised Yes for their \\"indulgence\\" on Tales from Topographic Oceans, they said they were going to tighten things up on their next album.  They didn't.  They made a Tales from Topographic Oceans Jr. album called Relayer, and it's another great album from one of the top 3 prog rock groups of all time.  There are only 3 tracks on the whole thing (one side long song and two 9 minute pieces on the other side, like Close to the Edge), and they all deserve to be included in the realm of classic Yes albums.  The Gates of Delirium is, along with Going for the One's Awaken, one of Yes's greatest and most underrated epic songs.  It's really a torrent of anger, melody, beauty (especially during the \\"Soon\\" part, which was edited as a single) and greatness.  But the next song is the most intense, blistering song Yes ever recorded.  Sound Chaser is just wild, employing techincal mastery and is probably the most free jazz song influenced Yes ever recorded.  I can listen to it over and over again, and the unblinking tension never ceases to amaze me.  To Be Over is almost a respite against the chaos of the first two songs, but it's quite beautiful and soothing, like Yes songs like Wonderous Stories and Time and a Word.  The musicianship here is exemplary, some of the best that Yes ever did.  Yes took a mini hiatus after this album, coming back with Going for the One in 1978, one of their better albums.  This is one of my favorite Yes albums, along with Topographic Oceans and The Yes Album.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I am glad American movie makers have desided to make this film. This is a great way to show to American people at least a bit of what is widely known in Ukrain and Russia and is deeply respected. The use of an actor like Elijah Wood would help all those 13 year old girls get a hold of this movie and discover something a lot more meaningful then obsession over Frodo's character...<br /><br />Two things that gave me joy as I watched this movie was the realistic, Russian-Ukranian humoristic aproach, and the story as it unfolded.<br /><br />Simmular story happened to my great-grandfather as well. He went to America during WW2 and when came back to get his wife, was killed for \\"betraying\\" his country.<br /><br />Also, just so you know, the word they used for Jew was a Russian slogan that still means a Jew and IS NOT a descriminative word, just a slogan people are used to...<br /><br />Also, for those who claim some scenes humanly unrealistic, well, when my grandma came to America, first thing she asked when arrived in 1998 was \\"Is the war really over?\\". For many of us it could be a surprise that she asked that, but in reality, all that she went through everything that my grandma and others have gone through made her who she was until her death and images of war never vanished...<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B0000B1648|5.0|'Arthur' was part of a failed attempted at producing a television program with a rock soundtrack, the failure being that there was no show when all was said and done. Ray Davies most definitley held up his end and produced yet another stellar introspective work to follow up on his 'Village Green' project of the previous year. 'Arthur' had much more commercial success than the previous record, despite the fact that the plug was pulled on the show. I see 'Arthur' as the antithesis of 'Village Green' where it bemoans the decline of life in Britain where as the latter celebrated it. 'Arthur' contains some of the best Kinks songs of the era including leadoff thumper \\"Victoria\\", the title track, and the immortal \\"Shangri-la\\". \\"Mr. Churchill Says\\", \\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\" , and \\"Some Mother's Son\\" ridicule the futility of war and Britain's particpation in WW's I and II. \\"Australia\\" revisits the feel of exile and symbolizes the saga of Davies' sister Rosie and her emmigration to that far off land, which is also one of the few real psychedlic songs the Kinks ever did (the ending is anyway). \\"Princess Marina\\" and \\"Nothing to Say\\" are very humerous and highlight the struggles of working class Britons, much like \\"Shangri-la\\". A once great nation was falling back into recession and with any society, not everyone flourished during the \\"good times\\". Arthur and his family seem to represent that type of family and that is what Ray Davies always did best in his songscapes. 'Arthur' shouldn't be compared to 'Tommy', the other rock opera of 1969, because it is based in reality and history which I guess was too much for some people to deal with.

B00005JPAO|5.0|Let me say at the outset that I know nothing of and have no technical observations about Blue-Ray vs HD/DVD blah, blah, blah..(hey, I didn't even see this at the movies...I saw it on TV!!)<br /><br />I do, however, know that Helen Mirren ranks right up there with the best of'em i.e., Bette, Maggie, Judi, Vanessa, etc.  I have been a die-hard fan of Ms Mirren since the creation of Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennyson in \\"Prime Suspect.\\"  The range of this actress is quite simply incredible.  She can do no wrong and here she is simply superb.<br /><br />As \\"The Queen\\" Helen indeed fleshes out a royal most of the world knows very little about and therefore has made all sorts of unfounded assumptions about as well.  This also takes place during a very taxing time in anyone's life, much less a family so public as this.  Hellen manages to make Queen Elizabeth quite human, trying in the midst of the turmoil surrounding the death of Princess Diana to deal with the situation as best as she knows how.  She reacts like a woman who has pledged her life to her country first, then as a mother, and then as a grandmother.  Her impatience with Princess Diana recounts any mother-in-law's impatience with her ex-daughter-in-law; the added variable of this being the royal family of England makes it all the more complicated.  Before seeing this, I, like I imagine a lot of us, also thought the Queen was entirely too disconnected.  But things are not always as they seem.  Of course some of the Queen's actions are questionable and maybe some of her behavior may not be excused, but at least this presentation endeavors to at least submit motives behind those actions.<br /><br />The film moves quickly, is actually quite witty, the writing is top-notch with Helen's performance, of course, being the driving force.  A most poignant scene is her reaction to seeing the elk?, deer\\", (whatever) in the woods before it is eventually hunted down for sport.  It is a classic example of stopping to smell the roses in the midst of a most intense human drama.<br /><br />To say I highly recommend is a masterpiece of understatment.  Excellent movie!of a most intense human drama.    To say I highly recommend is a masterpiece of understatment.  Excellent movie!

0141439688|5.0|When Jane Austen finished \\"Persuasion\\" in 1816, she was already suffering from the effects of the disease that would kill her the following year.  \\"Persuasion\\" is rather shorter than its precessors such as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  It is however the polished work of a mature author, and easily holds its own with her other finished novels.<br /><br />As the story opens, Sir Walter Elliot, a vain and foppish baronet facing bankruptcy, is persuaded to rent his home and move his family to Bath in order to economize on expenses.  The middle daughter, Anne, unmarried and ignored by her family, is shocked to learn that the prospective renters are an Admiral Croft and his wife, whose brother is one Frederick Wentworth.  Eight years earlier, Wentworth, then a young naval officer lacking wealth and status, had wooed Anne, who was persuaded by her mentor, Lady Russell, to reject his suit on the grounds of his lack of prospects. The kind-hearted but much put-upon Anne is left behind by her family to close up the house and to take care of her hypochondriac married younger sister Mary, who lives nearby.<br /><br />While visiting with Mary and her husband Charles Musgrave, Anne encounters the now Captain Wentworth, wealthy with prize money and looking for a potential wife among Charles' two sisters.  Wentworth is distant and correct with Anne.  When Wentworth proposes a visit to the seaside village of Lyme Regis, Anne is included in the group.  While there, Wentworth appears to settle on Louisa Musgrave, only to have Louisa be seriously injured in an accident.  The practical Anne takes charge in the crisis, causing Wentworth to take renewed notice of her.<br /><br />Anne ends up in Bath, where her family pursues a meaningless round of social calls.  A handsome and long-missing cousin materializes to reconcile with the Elliots and to pay court to Anne.  The long-suffering Anne must balance his suspicious attentions with the unclear intentions of Wentworth, who follows Anne to Bath.<br /><br />Anne still loves Wentworth, but hardly dares to hope that he will pass up younger and more attractive women to renew his relationship with her.  The inarticulate Wentworth finally finds his voice in a note to Anne, giving her another chance to make the right choice.<br /><br />In this final novel, Anne wrestles with a dilemma common to Austen heroines, whether to marry for love or money and security.  The younger Anne was persuaded not to marry for love because Wentworth lacked the money and prospects to give her the security of her station in life.  In revisiting that choice, Anne concludes that the advice was correct under the circumstances but proven wrong by subsequent events.  Anne believes in marrying for love; the further implication of her internal argument is that she and Wentworth should have waited for each other while he acquired the financial security necessary for their successful life together.<br /><br />\\"Persuasion\\" is a well-written and moving story, filled with the usual well-developed characters and often biting social commentary of a Jane Austen novel.

817224164X|3.0|Mein Kampf is an interesting and powerful book to be sure. The book is not solely about the Jews, but I am writing my review in reference to Hitler's assertions therein, mostly because I am extremely disturbed by the content of many of the previous reviews. Hitler was a powerful figure, and obviously powerful still.     I was patently shocked how many reviewers were taken in by Hitler's ongoing method of argument.  Throughout the book, he makes his  points by randomly refering to various notions, texts and occurences to prove his own inaccurate points.  Because he stipulates various references, he manages to appear educated and convincing. This is particluarly true the case in Hitler's discussion of the Jews where he randomly refers to Jewish ideals and texts for his own end. What I found most interesting was precisly how little Hitler understood Judaism (although one uneducated reviewer asserts the oppposite), a faith, a philosophy, and ethnicity but not a race. What I found most alarming about many of the reviews was that people, even after all that has happened, bought into his various lines of reasoning on so many subjects, even those outside Judaism.  His assertions, particularly about the Talmud, are are vague and highly misconstrued.  Judaism is a philosphical religion, an as such is open to ongoing debate at all times even in the 21st century.  I was floored by one reviewer who uses Hitler's own tactics to his make outlandish statments about the work of Talmud and Maimonedes, a topic on which he has no keen undertanding.     For sure, Hitler is right about the Talmud in one respect: it is about life today, this moment and how to live it respectfully and well (although Hitler interprets this as a defect). While Christianity  focuses on resurrection, Judaism focuses on the now, for tomorrow is uncertain and may not exist; for Jews, the afterlife, at best, is a shadowy thing.     The fact of the matter remains that Judaism is the only religion in which God accepts ALL people so long as they are good; Judaism does not define goodness by Jewishness, but by goodness itself; belief in Judaism is not required. You do not have to be one of \\"The Chosen,\\" a term which Hitler throws around in incite his readers, to be worthy.  (To be \\"Chosen\\" in Judaism actually means that you are one who has accepted the burden 613, often contradictory, laws.  Those who are not \\"Chosen\\" must only accept 7, very easy and innately human laws of behavior.)    Mein Kampf is an important book and is hard to rate because it's can't be subject to \\"good\\" or \\"bad;\\" it stands outside such clear distinctions. It simply IS.  While reading Mein Kampf I can only suggest that you read critically and take his assertions on all subjects with a grain of salt. It is arduous, self-serving and covertly incomplete.  If you are at all interested in Hitler mind, this book is an obvious go to.  It has people repeating and thus validating his injustices even now.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|It's sort of a shame that the reviews for the five disk BluRay release of Blade Runner are mixed in with the reviews of previous releases.  The Final Cut is breathtaking in both audio and video quality.  All of the well known 20th century video \\"glitches\\" have been cleaned up with 21st centuty technology. But, if you still like the previous Director's Cut, or the original theatrical version, you have all that too.  And the price can't be beat.<br />Sure, the story line of the movie could have been a little cleaner and tighter - even some of the people closely involved in the making of the movie admit that, but, while the movie is running, it's hard to take your eyes away from the screen. Just think, not even the people who saw the original theatrical screening of this movie were treated to such clarity - such visual and audio depth.<br />My recommendation - make some popcorn, fire up the big scren, dim the lights, and curl up with someone you love.  Movie watching doesn't get much better than this.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I bought this dvd to share with my 6 yr old son. I played the dvd and it immediately captured my son. After the movie was over the first thing he asked was \\"can we watch again daddy\\". I love this movie and so dose my son. The other day he was outside running around the house I opened up the window and said \\"run Forrest run\\" He started laughing and said \\"good one dad good one\\". Buy this movie!!!!!

B0000AMRJC|5.0|This movie is so great it still inspires the smallest of drug dealers as it did in the eighties when it came out.  But when all is said and done these people need to watch the sad ending of this movie.   I absoultely love this special addition and the bonus features.  I love to hear that the comic relief was actually put on film on purpose.  The acting is magnificant.  Al Pacino knocked himself out.  I remember watching the Oscars that year and was amazed he did not win.  This is one of the best acting performances ever.  It beats out his acting in Scent of A Woman.  I think now people can look back on his performance and see that it truly was great.  I am glad the movie was released in this way and given the accolades that it truly deserves.

006135323X|5.0|Dan Ariely is an extremely smart researcher with some very well thought out papers published in decision-making and marketing. He seems to have an uncanny ability to come up with unconventional ways to test his ideas in the laboratory. I have enjoyed reading his academic paper over the years and was looking forward to this book. It is an excellent summary of some wonderful research he has done over the last decade or so. It is also a great introduction to decision-making research. The one thing I would fault this book is that at times it seems to jump from one topic to another without a seemingly coherent string that weaves the different chapters together. Each chapter is an entertaining read in itself. Having said that, the idea that we are not rational in predicatble ways which is the title of the book could be thought of as a good summary of the book. A great read and enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed Blink by Malcolm Gladwell and Stumbling on Happiness by Dan Gilbert.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Like almost everyone else in the universe, the 1939 movie, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", evokes fond memories from my childhood.  Because this movie is one of the most beloved films of all time, I would never have believed that anyone would have the audacity to create a sequel, but somebody did.  Released in 1985, \\"Return to Oz\\" continues the story of Dorothy Gale (played perfectly by Fairuza Balk in her cinematic debut) after her return from the land over the rainbow.<br /><br />Since sequels rarely match the quality of the originals, I probably wouldn't have wanted to see this movie if not for the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon.  My curiosity was piqued, so I rented the movie and watched it last night.  All I can say is, \\"Wow\\".<br /><br />The story begins six months after Dorothy taps the heels of her Ruby Slippers and returns to Kansas.  She tells Auntie Em and Uncle Henry all about her trip to Oz.  Of course, being the average skeptical adults, the relatives don't believe her, especially since Dorothy lost the Ruby Slippers during her return voyage and has no proof that her stories are real.<br /><br />Concerned about her mental health, Dorothy's well-meaning relatives borrow money to send Dorothy to the clinic of Dr. Worley, who has recently discovered a miraculous new medical treatment - electroshock therapy.  Dr. Worley convinces Auntie Em that a round of cranial electrical currents will solve Dorothy's delusions, so Auntie leaves Dorothy in Dr. Worley's care.  Luckily for Dorothy, a mysterious girl arrives just in time to help her escape the clinic and, through a series of events, Dorothy ends up back in Oz.<br /><br />Dorothy finds that Oz has changed since she was last there.  The Munchkin village is gone and the Yellow Brick Road is in tatters.  She finds the Emerald City in ruins and all of its inhabitants turned to stone.  The city is under control of \\"The Wheelers\\", nightmarish creatures with wheels in place of hands and feet.  Dorothy escapes from them with the help of a mechanical man, Tik-Tok, but soon falls into the clutches of the evil Princess Mombi.  This part of the movie may disturb small children because Mombi has a huge walk-in closet which contains an assortment of heads.  Yes, heads.  Mombi changes her head like other people change shoes and wears different heads depending on her mood.  (She has quite a collection which she has gathered from people who probably weren't too thrilled to part with them.)<br /><br />Dorothy discovers that the destruction of Oz was caused by the Nome King, who has also captured the Scarecrow.  She escapes from Mombi with the help of several new friends and they travel to the Nome King's mountain to free the Scarecrow and restore Oz to its former glory.<br /><br />The script for \\"Return to Oz\\" is based on two of the original L. Frank Baum books: \\"Ozma of Oz\\" and \\"The Marvelous Land of Oz\\".  It's been a while since I've read any of the Oz books, but this movie seems more faithful to what I remember of the mood and tone of the books than \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".<br /><br />Three things that I really liked about this movie are:<br /><br />1) The characters don't suddenly burst into song.  As much as I liked the music in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", it's nice to watch an Oz movie where the story takes precedence over the choreography.<br /><br />2) This movie is edgier and darker than the first one.  The Wheelers are on the verge of insanity and are truly frightening (at least until Tik-Tok beats them silly).  Mombi is also pretty darn scary.  The movie also includes the Deadly Desert, where contact with the sand will kill any living creature.  We see that happen, too.<br /><br />3) 1980s animatronics and claymation bring several well-know Oz characters to life.  This wouldn't have been possible in 1939.  In addition to Tik-Tok, we meet the Nome King and his minions, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump, a creature with the head of a moose, a sofa for a body, and palm leaves for wings.  Asimpressive as CGI (computer-generated-imagery) is in today's movies, there's a realism about human actors interacting with physical characters that just can't be duplicated using a blue screen.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Return to Oz\\".  I suggest that you come in with no expectations that this movie is an extension of the original.  \\"Return to Oz\\" stands on its own and there's a lot to enjoy here.  However, I suggest caution if showing this to young children - they may have nightmares in which the Wheelers and a headless Mombi are coming to get them.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br />Michael Mihalik is the author of [[ASIN:0978545702 Debt is Slavery: and 9 Other Things I Wish My Dad Had Taught Me About Money]].

0452289963|5.0|This book shows how obsessed we humans are with the never ending flood of thoughts running through our minds.  We must realize that we are more than these thoughts which are motivated by our never satisfied egos.  To achieve happiness we must take the power away from our egos who keep us living in the past and scared of the future.  How is this achieved?  Simply living in the present and living in a state of awareness.  I think everyone who struggles with staying in the present like those that constantly worry or have much anxiety should read this book.  Actually I think everyone should read this book for it is a new way of living that has the potential to change the face of the world.

0452289963|1.0|This is not a tickle-your-ears, politically correct review. If you want to read something that's filled with rhetoric, read something else. If you want the truth, then look no further than this review. For practical reasons, I have to confine my discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which I have something new to say.<br /><br />All Eckhart Tolle wants is to publish blatantly juvenile rhetoric as \\"education\\" for children to learn in school. Eckhart's apologists probably don't realize that because it's not mentioned in the funny papers or in the movies. Nevertheless, he claims that human life is expendable. Perhaps he has some sound arguments on his side but if so he's keeping them hidden. I'd say it's far more likely that it's unfortunate that Eckhart has no real education. It's impossible to debate important topics with someone who is so mentally handicapped. I hope I haven't bored you by writing an entire review about Eckhart Tolle. Still, this was the best way to explain to you that Eckhart's goals coalesce with those of abominable, scornful Machiavellians.
0143038419|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book. It is a fast and easy read, and had my laughing out loud many times. The narration feels like your best friend who always cracks you up. Elizabeth's physical and spiritual journeys are equally fascinating, and she had me in tears many times in empathy with the heartbreak she suffered, and the way her eyes were opened by stepping outside of her life. This book inspired me to make changes in MY life, and not live in fear or self-loathing. I just want to give the writer the biggest hug!!!
B0011NVCO8|1.0|It's true! The movie fails on all levels; Slow-paced and devoid of any meaningful continuity, it fails to encourage any concern on the part of the viewer for any of the characters. I hoped they would all die! Russel Crowe, in his inimitable style, mumbles throughout the entire movie with the exception of two lines.  The hacked-up plot proves that Ridley Scott enjoys toying with the viewers mind instead of trying to create a comprehensible storyline. Maybe he hopes the viewer will think him to have a superior intellect.

B0000CABBW|5.0|The Whale Rider is fundamentally a beautiful and sad rendition of what happens to men and women when their culture is overcome by a more complex and expanding new culture. What makes this film special is the certainty of the love among all the generations in the community and family, even when individuals are making bad mistakes in how they treat each other. No matter these mistakes, the deep love remains and somehow enriches everyone's lives.    There is a feminist message in the story, but not a bitter, 'men are the enemy' one. There is also a message of how destructive the decline of a traditional culture is to men, how it degrades them and leaves them struggling to maintain honor and decency. All of this is easily accessible to children and adults, and reinforced with magnificent Maori carvings and symbols.    The actors are so exceptional that they do not seem at any time to be actors. You expect that like neighbors they will come knock on your door for tea or coffee, or just to take a walk on the beautiful and yet often gray and cold beaches. You care what happens to these people who seem so real.    This is an international story, a common human story intermigled with the lives of whales in a spiritual and practical way. The resolution of the film is a bit too optimistic and sweet, and contrary to what is likely to happen. Still one hopes it will end that way. In reality, of course, the traditional culture will continue to be overwhelmed because it has not grown and developed, locked to the main islands of New Zealand and not wishing to engage the world any longer. And yet, the carving of the Whale Rider, and the inspiring art work of the canoe, bear testimony that once a very enterprising, adventurous and brave society set out across the uncharted ocean, like cosmonauts across the waters of space, and colonized new lands. The spirit was once there. It will need more than the little girl named after the first Whale Rider to fan its fires for another time. This film makes you wish it would light a fire against the watery fog of the ocean and bring Maoris back to the front lines of growth.

B00003CX5P|1.0|I was one of the thousands of fans who stood in line on opening night, having waited for 16 years for another Star Wars film. I can still recall the optimistic mood and loud chatter of the crowd as we waited, and then finally filed into the theatre. I can also recall the loud remarks of disappointment within the theatre as the movie ended, followed by near silence and murmurs of disappointment as we all filed out.    This film was one of the most anticipated releases of ALL TIME. It can also be considered one of the greatest disappointments of all time. It's probably the only film ever to have achieved HUGE box office profits while actually being HATED by the majority of viewers who paid to see it. The huge box office gross was basically GUARANTEED, and does not represent HAPPY VIEWERS.    I could go into all the details as to why this film basically destroyed everything that the original TWO, and a portion of the third, had accomplished.... but then, if you're an original Star Wars fan, you already know exactly what I would write.    To sum up;    One of the most hated and disappointing films in history, that also just happens to be a huge commercial success, for no other reason than 16 years of built-up anticipation. If they had offered a \\"money back, satisfaction guarantee\\", I imagine the true box office figures would have been a few thousand dollars profit :)    I would also imagine that most people who purchase this film on DVD only do so to complete their collection. Then probably half of them regret the decision.      JM
B00026WU7I|5.0|It has been said by many that alot of masterpieces are born from a deeper need within the artist. That emotional and difficult trials give a boost to creativity - elevating the true essence and meaning of existence into a universal realm that everyone in life can understand on some level. With this selection, Bob Dylan does just that. He draws back the curtain and lets you see into his soul. And, it is just not his soul, but the soul of everyman. There we find the need and aspirations for love, the frustration over disappointments, the failure to connect, missed opportunities and, eventually, the need to move on.<br /><br />Never before, nor since, has Dylan ever sounded so vulnerable, so confessional, and I believe this is just part of the reason why this selection is so monumental - and considered one of his best. He uses all the elements on this recording, the force of wind, the heart on fire, an earthly passion, and teardrops of rain to examine who he is and, for that matter, who we all are.<br /><br />Written during a time when he was seperated from his wife, the songs here reflect the maturity of this new experience. This was a spurt growth in his genius as opposed to his former material. Dylan's 60's output revolved around thoughts, creeds, observations about life and those around him. But this time out, he looks at himself through that magnifying glass. The ability to step outside yourself, look honestly, and report the truth is a huge leap. You must be willing to accept the consequences, and Dylan has never balked in the quest for finding truth.<br />This is why Dylan is Dylan.<br /><br />Dylan's ability to convey folktales has never been better. His \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\" reveals a man who parts with his love and, after living his life on the pinwheel of circumstance, has never lost the \\"blues\\" from that seperation and needs to reconnect. The line \\"we always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view\\" is a recurring theme throughout. The magikal underpinnings of chance meeting in \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" give rise to the question of whether our feelings are real or misplaced. Emotions of the heart don't have to make sense. They just are. Pay attention to his line \\"he felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train\\". And, sure enough, he makes that line hit you just like that freight train. Brilliant.<br />  The beautiful sway of \\"You're a Big Girl Now\\" ironically shows Dylan's desperation and hurt with lyrics like \\"I'm going out of my mind, with a pain that stops and starts, like a corkscrew to my heart, ever since we've been apart\\". You can actually feel this emotion as he sings it. That's how good he is.<br /><br />\\"Idiot Wind\\" is my favorite here. I will say I prefer the slower tempo and less accompaniment of the mostly acoustic version heard on \\"The Bootleg Series Vol II\\" (different lyrics-more colour), however, this version is more than formidable. What is he saying here? That they are both complicit with the death of love. That the failure to connect is not the fault of one or the other. They both pay homage to that idiot wind of words that are never really heard. Some of the best lyrics he has ever written are within this song. \\"people see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act, their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts\\", \\"there's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door\\", \\"what's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top - you're on the bottom\\", \\"the priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned\\",\\"I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which seperated you from me\\".  The bitterness, the recrimination, the uncharted waters of mournful emotion have never been so blatantly revealed. The acerbic tongue of Dylan is back - but it's different as well.<br /><br />Moving forward, things lighten up a bit and Dylan gives us the sprightly \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\". The point is made -but with much less stress. \\"Meet Me in the Morning\\" again harkens back to Dylan's musical strength. A bluesy, acoustic number that conveys his loneliness. And, just a note here, it is amazing to see the range of emotions in this work. He can be so angry and bitter in some songs, yet like a long lost puppy dog in others. This is real life people. This really is how it is.<br /><br />Dylan's storytelling reachs new heights with \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" and, while I always found this song to be tedious and repetitious, I never really listened to the lyrics. It is an interesting tale set, I believe in an old western saloon. The jack of hearts (Dylan) has a purpose and so do others. But his presence is a catalyst for all sorts of events that take place. Jealousy, craving, theft, double-crossing, murder are all added into the mix. But it's Dylan's ability to create visions within your mind which remain true to form.<br /><br />The next three tunes, in my mind, are some of the lovliest Dylan has ever penned. \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\", \\"Shelter from the Storm\\" and \\"Buckets of Rain\\" show a man resigned to his fate and wanting to leave with a delicate and hauntingly beautiful memory of his love. Regrets, yes. But he moves on with a tenderness to restore his lost faith. After all, \\"Life is sad, life is a bust, All ya can do is do what you must\\". And, with that, Dylan closes his masterpiece.<br /><br />Every year I have seen this album move further and further up on the rankings of the all-time greatest. And, to think that the reviews were not that great upon it's release. No matter, as all wise Seers know (and you know too), time is the great equalizer. I think we all have learned, by now, to never write off a talent like Mr. Dylan. He is a treasure, a one and only. (We share those traits). ;) And nothing he does is one dimensional.<br /><br />This is one of his greatest achievements and positively DEMANDS to be put in any considerable pop-folk-archive. Anyone who has done the fire walk of love needs to hear this. Take my word for it. I would not lead you down some desolation road you know!<br /><br />Appreciation for reading my review -- your own, Metamorpho ;)ightly \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\".

B000K7VHQE|2.0|I share the views of all the disappointed viewers, but not that this is unrealistic or depressing.  The trouble is it's too much like real life - most of us have dysfunctional families, embarrassing moments, thwarted dreams, bad diets (at times) etc etc.  I don't get paying to see 2 hours of people simply demonstrating moments we've all lived, when we go on and try to make life more than just those awful memories.  It gets 2 stars 1) because I think I have had a pretty great life, so this just picks up on the bad bits but I'm not going to give even the bad bits of my life only 1 star and 2) because the embarrassing dance at the end was unexpectedly  hilarious (but the whole film I kept thinking What is the grandfather teaching her, why isn't one of her parents checking?!).  I am Australian, I am supposed to be proud of anything with Australians in it, and I really admire Toni Collette, but I really do not get why most of you are willing to pay to see this and then rave about it - hey, send me the cost of the DVD and I guarantee I can probably send you a postcard far more entertaining than this film!
B00005JPTK|3.0|It's too bad one of my favorite movies of all time has features that I can't use because I don't own a PC.

A commentary track for this quiet movie should have been a must too.
0307388840|3.0|Somehow, even though I thought the characters (especially Briony) were well crafted, and the writing was skilled, it was almost more than I could do to finish part one. It was filled with lengthy descriptions and tiresome English snobbery (our house is less than five hundred years old -- oh the shame!!).<br /><br />I had very high hopes for Robbie and Cecilia to tear apart this stuffy backdrop with their passion, especially when Robbie broke out the infamous c-word, but the sex scene was extremely disappointing; bogged down by detail and totally without abandon. I was especially angered by Robbie's reserve. I thought this should have been an opening to throw off self-consciousness, but it wasn't, and because of that I didn't believe in their bond the way I wanted to. I believed that they loved each other, but I didn't *feel* it. Therefore there was no chance of liking the book no matter how good the writing was (and it *was* good).<br /><br />Maybe this was intentional? We learn later (spoiler alert...?) that viewpoints other than Briony's are still her creation -- her own novelization of her greatest regret. That being the case I'm not sure where to shift the blame. Briony for not \\"getting\\" Robbie? Or McEwan for thinking this WAS a passionate love scene?<br /><br />I also did not like the way the plot was structured. Briony sees something and misunderstands. Then she sees something else and misunderstands, then she sees something ELSE and misunderstands... Did she have to see so many things just so that later, when she was writing about it, she would know they happened? I got bored, and furthermore, Briony's fictionalization would have been richer if she'd imagined more of Cecilia and Robbie together, not just elaborated on the tidbits she did see.<br /><br />Still, I was glad I kept going. The war, both from Robbie's POV and from Briony's, was spectacularly visceral and immediate. I felt like I and the characters were all being shaken awake. Briony's introduction to wounded soldiers is some of the best writing I've seen recently. I'm not unhappy I read this book, but i wouldn't be surprised if I enjoyed this author's other books more.the best writing I've seen recently.

6304698690|5.0|This is a wonderful version of this classic book brought to life.  In my opinion the variations don't detract from the timelessness.  I loved the time-lapse photography of the blossoming garden, the abundant critters, and the relationships of the children.  The story itself is very moving, and Mary blossoms beautifully with the garden.  The symbolism is subtle with a good example at the end of the white lily in the pond, mirrored by the white horse in the field, followed by an even more distant shot of the countryside with the flower represented by the manor.  If you look closely, you can see \\"the whole world is a garden...\\"
B00019GG1M|5.0|The good or the bad?<br /><br />This CD has both. I think that most of my favorite Evanescence songs are here (good) as well as a few on their more varied, less-liked sophomore effort. But at the same time, the riffs, while a bit heavier for a POP band, get repetitive by the 5th song (bad), leaving out the 4th completely because it has no heaviness whatsoever. I actually used to hate that about My Immortal (track 4) but considering that I just bought the import version \\"used\\" but brand new and still in plastic, I can appreciate it for I have what's NOT on the U.S. version - My Immortal the rockier version (band version)(the closer) (good!). So both being present is definitely a good thing!<br /><br />But back to the album as a whole. It's good and bad. The lyrics barely vary (bad) and Amy seems to drown in her own pain song after song (bad). But the people that I think this album has mainly attracted in the past and will in the future are:<br /><br />Down and out (emotionally/spiritually) Christian teens and pop-rock fans in general or the ones that are looking for something a tad heavier than usual. If you're just plain down and out then you may like them too. And if you like an occasional riff run, then you will find that here.<br /><br />The people who LOVE to hate this are probably the people that constantly hear that Evanescence is the greatest rock or metal band EVER. I agree with them because this isn't metal at all (good). And to say that they are the best band, well, that's just plain opinion! ^_^<br /><br />The riffs are probably what's so deceiving (bad). They may seem metal-ish, which in my limited knowledge of true metal is true. However, Amy herself is NOT a metal artist. She's probably a fan of it as well as rock tunes but her voice is pretty, and kinda powerful when it wants to be instead of rough, masculine and predictable. Not to say that females can't make a metal band, and not to say that all metal bands have predictable lead vocalists, and that's all that it takes, but 99% of the time that's all I hear..<br /><br />I think it would take heavier riffs, and usually they're faster and the voice is angry instead of melancholy and such.<br /><br />Lately, her voice has been more opera-like which to me (and many others) is hit or miss. It works on Lithium in spades but doesn't work all the time.<br /><br />HOWEVER, her emotions are more emo to me than anything. Correct me if you think this is a stretch cause I don't!<br /><br />If I turn it to Music Choice's Metal (uncensored) station I hear what I don't and have never ever liked really; angry men SCREAMING and GROANING over heavy riffs. THIS, to ME, is actual Metal. Is it not? That's why I can't stand any real metal of ANY kind!; Arise and Ruin, Vision Of Disorder, Pantera, Meshuggah's Bleed (what is he saying through all that scream? o_o), The Ocean's Hadean (more repetitive than anything on this album by far) or any of those bands have never ever appealed to me and for good reason. I'm a pop fan! I also like to u n d e r s t a n d what the artist or band is saying usually. Sure, mindless fun in the form of a pop song with a hip hop beat or a rap song is there once in a while, but like I said, I like my music with meaning and I like to be able to find that meaning somewhat easily with next to no effort.<br /><br />And that's what brings me back to this album. Although I have criticized it, I actually like it more than I'm leading on I suppose. It's just I know what it's not. In fact, I'd say that this band (Evanescence) is pure pop-rock. Nothing more and certainly nothing less.<br /><br />But that's another argument that everyone and their mother has an opinion on. To be honest, my first of two Creative mp3 players (what my mp3 players have all been) first labeled The Open Door ('06) Goth-Rock. Did I believe it at the time?<br /><br />Yes. But that's cause I knew no better. To this day I don't think I've ever heard anything that falls right into the Goth-Rockdefinition but I highly, HIGHLY doubt this is that also!<br /><br />OK. Song by song rating. I think we've run through long enough on what Evanescence is (and mostly isn't).<br /><br />1. Going Under - The intro to the CD. It's a lot harder than a lot of pop-rock I tend to hear these days and that's good. The opening riff is extremely uncomplicated yet it does it's job quite well. This was their 2nd single. According to Wikipedia this song is about the emotional and physical abuse Lee dealt with in a previous relationship. Much sadder now that I know what the lyrics are totally based on. Must've broken her in two...<br /><br />Also fun to sing and actually dance in the shower to. >_> 5.5/5<br /><br />2. Bring Me To Life - first single, doesn't bring much new to the table but it's truth is what held ground. relate-able lyrics about being half yourself without a love. a true love. same riffs you've come to expect thus far, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. you can hate me for doing so, but i love this song. still. it came out April 22nd, 2003 and even on February 22nd, 2008, it stands as strong as ever. stronger even! 5/5<br /><br />3. Everybody's Fool - I love the message in this song. I knew it had some reference to pop stars by watching the awesome video which gave us insight in 2003/2004. But looking at Wiki, I see that it's a bit deeper; Amy saw her sister glamorizing pop stars such as Christina Aguilera and was pissed. She wrote this song in retaliation for her disgust for what she's now become. Sure, her music may be harder, but a pop star, she is.<br /><br />Now that I've said that, it's contradicting, but humans on a whole are contradicting so it takes nothing away from the song. In fact, she may not have hate for Christina or Britney directly, but that lifestyle; the way they WANT you portrayed when you come out is probably fuming to her. 5.5/5<br /><br />4. My Immortal - Their most famous ballad, hands down, MTV-wise and probably otherwise. To me, it's for very good reason: it's soft, as portrayed through the video and the album version but the only (big) difference is the ending; on the main album version, it stays soft, but in the video and on track 12 here, right before the end, the softness breaks, and the bass guitar is once again brought out. It was the perfect time to do so, and sends you skyrocketing emotionally. A bittersweet tale.<br /><br />I *LOVE* the end of the video when she holds her head between folded arms, like a child, as if all is doomed because of a love gone wrong. Their best video still. Single 4 (from this album) and Single 2 from the sophomore effort are close. 5.25/5 (6/5 for the video, not included on this disc)<br /><br />5. Haunted - A song that starts off with a brief, lite and lovely hip-hop beat. It gets harder though, featuring bass guitar done by Francesco DiCosmo too, who's done all the guitar work thus far, and the brief solo run, mid-song, he does is catchy.<br /><br />The lyrics don't go anywhere new really, until Amy pleads, \\"raping me.\\" and you're like What?! Yes, she really says that! The beginning is my favorite part. 4.5/5.<br /><br />6. Tourniquet - A tale of suicide believe it or not. You must look some of these things up to actually \\"get\\" it. I thought this was just about a lost soul (human), praying to be redeemed, and bettered.<br /><br />That turns out half-true, and the rest is that the person HAS committed suicide, asking, as they lay dying \\"Am I too lost...to be saved? Am...I...too...lost?\\" finally, meeting with death...<br /><br />Didn't like it the first time I heard it in '04 after Christmas (bought it for my buddy Ebony who LOVED it, and was only disappointed that the band version of My Immortal (track 12) was missing on the original) because I was so not into any thought, religious then. I was just sick of it and this song reminded me of that.<br /><br />But now I see that it's deeper than I thought. And for that it gets props. 4.5/5<br /><br />7. Imaginary - \\"In my field of paper flowers, ... \\"I lie in myself for hours\\", etc, etc. A relate-able mid-tempo. If you're numb and can barely feel anymore, then this song is for you. Repetitive riffs, but what's important is that it's relate-able. 4/5<br /><br />8. Taking Over Me - Not too bad at all. It doesn't step out of the predictable zone, but I do like the lyrics, \\"Who can decide what they dream? And dream I do.\\" Not much more to say. It's got the pretty vocal, it's got the bass guitar but not much new is here. 3.5/5<br /><br />9. Hello - This was the first song that I heard mentioned on a review or two about their second album, that I had not known at all. Everyone was praising it saying that Amy was unable to channel anything as good as this heartbreaking ballad after the debut. So I checked it out Summer '07.<br /><br />I wasn't let down one bit. In fact, I was all the more enchanted. This song has no metal fabrications whatsoever. It just is. It's real and raw. Very heart-wrenching. I'll just say it's about her now dead-for-years sister and the reality that she's left behind; next to nothing for Amy to see or hold onto but pain, loneliness and true emptiness...here, she reminisces and reveals what she's felt since her absence, but on The Open Door ('06), a track Like You which is similar in vein, spouts how Amy wants to be just like her little sister; DEAD.<br /><br />The ending to Hello is truly mesmerizing; the way she holds the note, then goes lower and lower in key is UN-forgettable and won't let go. BEST track by them I've ever heard between both albums, and popular for very good reason. 6/5<br /><br />10. My Last Breath - This song could have been gold. The been-there-done-that sound of the bass really, really sounds good here. No complaints in that regard. But the arrangement doesn't totally do it for me. But after the bridge, the bass kicks back into the chorus and I love it. 4/5<br /><br />11. Whisper - Not bad vocal-wise till her voice goes up and then up at the end, a few times then it's a bit iffy. Not off-key but almost like it wants to. But the problem here is the lyrics. She's pretty much said this all in another song. And the chants in the background towards the end are kinda cool yet kinda weird. Not scary, just kinda weird. (: 4.25<br /><br />12. My Immortal (Band Version/Video Version) - Just Like the first describes it, it's like the first but gets hard at the end, stirring emotions. A touching, slow ballad. 5.5/5<br /><br />Cover Art: B+ -- Very pretty in a pale kinda way.<br />Inside Art: B -- Not much to work with but the little symbols on page 1 and two, and at the end are cool. The one page where the band is is awesome too. Amy just lies there, waiting...<br />Songwriting: C -- Can become repetitive and tiresome, but it's usually relate-able to the down-and-trotted.<br />Vocals: C++ Soaring at best, enchanting when she's restraining.<br />Vocal Emotion: C++ -- Better than the vocals I suppose. Could be wrong.<br />Production: B- -- Predictable metal-ish riffs with the power of the bass guitar are only so varied (meh) yet the occasional hip-hop pop feel comes through your speaker also (good). The calm ballads (Track 4, 9 and 12) are the only ones that have minimal to no noisy production and I prefer those overall.<br />Length: B- (Wish it were at least 13 tracks...)<br /><br />4.791666666667<br /><br />4.79 stars.<br /><br />Overall: A<br /><br />In the end I must say that Amy has talent; her songwriting, though limited to 2-3 subjects is not too bad and the arrangements for some of these tunes are enchanting.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you know the real back story to some of these songs, it's Moody who should get most of the praise. Sure, Amy brings it to life but without Moody, this album would never be! My Immortal is about his grandfather that passed, and not about just any relationship. The song takes different shape once you know that! However, we all know songs are something different to us all so, meh. :P<br /><br />Leave comments as you feel. This is all my opinion. I know that I don't necessarily know enough about what metal really is to actually try and review something that may or may not be. I actually wrote this, ran through it a couple of times to make corrections and posted it. After an hour or less, I took it down because I KNOW it's full of contradictions. Now, it's back up and I don't care. I just wanna get my word out! :)<br /><br />Edit: I'm starting to see the similarities to how heavy some of the riffs that Evanescence displays in their songs, especially on their sophomore effort, are, and comparing them to the songs that I hear on the \\"Metal\\" station. Not that different. Like I said, it's just the voice and emotion display that's different. If someone could clear up why Evanescence is just a pop band \\"trying to be metal\\" that would be nice. I think they're pop/rock personally. But I don't think they're that far from metal (RIFF-WISE). Clue me in, in a manner that teaches instead of scolds and I will be elated.that it's relate-able. 4/5    8. Taking Over Me - Not too bad at all.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|Yes, the movie is different from the book. The book was great. The movie as a lot of fun and stands on it's own seperate from the book. Also, the author of the book assisted with the movie.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|This movie far exceeded my expectations as I had heard it compared to The princess bride which I personally feel got a little confusing with the flashing from reading the story to seeing it.  While I had liked that movie, this movie I love as the story tells itself so gracefully.    Stardust is a delightful fairytale full of adventure, romance, humor, and some violent death scenes not suited for children. The scenery is beautiful...both the real and the special effects. The character development was perfect as knowledge was shown over time and as characters grew.     As one that loves fairytales, this is designed to be a classic and perfect for a home library.  Having it in hd dvd just makes it more visually appealing as the quality is as beautiful as the story.  Each of the characters makes the story what it is but I appreciated that the cast did a great job of bringing each character to life. Whether you like prince, princess, witch, pirate, etc. there is something for everyone as each character has a quest to fulfill often in competition with each other.
0393061310|2.0|Not bad, but not real impressive.  There is some real good work in there, but his \\"start\\" at 11K BC is a little silly.  I've seen actually professional historians do the same kind of work with footnotes and all by simply starting a mere 500 years ago, Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of Great Powers.  Like many politically correct people, he indulges in reverse racism that seems to down \\"whitey\\", but actually ends up slapping down the \\"coloreds\\".      He gets the second star because at least he doesn't get into that \\"BCE\\" garbage.
1400095204|5.0|This was a wonderfully told story that provides the other side of the story that we here all too often in the news. It personalizes the revolutions and refugee camps. The story follows characters from all walks of life and manages to show their connections in everyday life in Nigeria. This connection continues but changes as revolution takes place.  This story manages to reveal so many sides to the story that you could probably discuss it for days. Upon completion of this book, I happened to pick up a magazine that showed a young boy soldier involved in the Darfur mess. I found myself staring at the picture because it connected me to a character in this book. I'll never look at these news stories the same way again. I highly recommend this book but be warned of some disturbing content. Even the graphic parts are beautifully written though.

B0006IINSW|3.0|I don't know whats going on with some of these UK bands. They seem to start out with such promise and maybe greatness, then all of the sudden they become derivative and tired. This has happened to Radiohead and now Pineapple Thief. I am not saying they are a bad band but they haven't carved out anything new. They definetly are not a prog band. I really don't know who decided to tag them that. I feel they have become whiny and irritating and don't even rock like they did on the first two records.

B000UPSKO8|4.0|Marco Armiliato makes an example of how an orchestra needs to sound to support the singers and to be a solist itself. Magnificent.  Tezier and Garanca are in increasing form of singing, nevertheless are perhaps little moveless. The XXI century singers needs to be more agile at stage, in opera and concert.  Netrebko and Vargas are in frenetical race with their respective colleagues to be considered the prima donna and the primo tenore.  Netrebko is radiant, with a singing plein of virtuosism, of color, of power.  Vargas is technically great. The voice proyection, his phrasing, and his control makes a loving lirical model.  It is a concert to enjoy.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|some true idiots on here, ashame. This band should be HUGE! They are far better than anything in the pop, r&b, country or especially the god awful rap scene. This was easily one of the top 5 albums of 2007 of any genre, each song kicks a$$ to hell with the people who are trashing it they know nothing. This is a 5 star album!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Gergiev gives us an outstanding music, with love and anguish in amazing form.   Fleming is in wonderful form, perhaps overacting sometimes but giving a marvelous innocent girl.  Hvorostovsky is in his role... no doubt is his best. Without problems of appearence and diction can't think someone better... if is possible.  And Vargas... awesome. No matter his latin presence... his singing was perfectly. After the \\"Kuda, kuda, kuda vi udalilis...\\" is sad and a pity that Lensky is going to die and with him this liric sound and nearly perfect technique.  For the traditional performance lovers the production was the only doubt... the empty walls were the thing that make this performance not the best ever.

031237593X|5.0|Autumn 1459. A seven year-old boy gets lost in the forest. His easy-going eldest brother has had better things to do than watch over him, that is to say seducing a pretty servant girl. After a prolonged search the lad is found, having bravely fought his fear, and despite being afraid of punishment he doesn't even think of informing against his sibling. A fiercely loyal and earnest boy, he is the youngest of his family, small, dark and intense and very different from his three tall and fair brothers. He is Richard Plantagenet, who, as King Richard III, will go down in history as the epitome of evil.    The reader wonders what happened to turn this earnest child into a murderous usurper. Murderer he wasn't, claims Sharon Penman. Believable and compelling, the story of the four sons of Richard, Duke of York unfolds with all the relentlessness and inescapability of a Greek tragedy.     \\"The Sunne in Splendour\\" is a magnificent book. Intimate family scenes alternate with bloody battles, scenarios of betrayal and murder are followed by tender love scenes. A host of unforgettable characters populates it. There is the lovable Edmund, the first of the four Plantagenet princes to die; proud foolish Warwick and his tragic brother John Neville; the icily beautiful Elizabeth Woodville, Edward's queen; Bishop Morton, the snake in the grass; sweet-natured Elizabeth of York and Richard's dignified mother Cecily. All of them are complex, and stay with the reader for a long time.    Ms. Penman does not make the mistake to present Richard. Although far from being the monster More and Shakespeare described, her Richard is shown partly responsible for his nephews' fate. In her version he does not order their killing, of course, but he does not realise that by his taking the throne the children become pawns in other people's power games and pay for his thoughtlessness with their lives. Ms. Penman's explanation of the princes' disappearance and Richard's strange silence is as good and plausible as others. Her Richard is brave and loyal, but he can also be aloof and stubborn to the point of inflexibility. He can display subtle irony, but also biting wit, and is capable of considerable aggression, yet lacks the ultimate ruthlessness to secure his power. Reflecting upon his decision makes him admit his guilt - that he yielded to the temptation the Crown of England represented - and for the last months of his life he fells bitter remorse. Ms. Penman describes his depressed state of mind with such chilling accuracy, that his mother's fear for his immortal soul is almost tangible and very painful, and the ending leaves the reader bereaved as though he had lost a loved one.     The drama that was Richard's life and the way it is elucidated here makes one wonder why it hasn't been filmed yet. There is a cinematographic quality to many of Ms. Penman's scenarios; look for instance at the council meeting leading to Lord Hasting's execution, or at solitary young Richard riding in blazing sunshine towards Warwick's army camp to win Clarence back - these just beg to be filmed! Certainly, the ending is tragic and would leave the audience aching, but a skilled screenwriter may find a solution. A similar problem has been handled very well in \\"Braveheart\\".    Wherein now lies Richard's attraction? The Tudors, commonly associated with the beginning of the Modern Age, superficially appear more interesting as opposed to the Plantagenets who seem to symbolise the superstitions-ridden, unenlightened Middle Ages. Richard was born on the brink of the Modern Age and grew up in a world that witnessed the death throes of the medieval system of values, and yet, at a time when all conventional notions of loyalty and feudal allegiance had become a sham, there survived in him a core of chivalrous conduct that is very appealing, apparent for example in his just administration of the North and his legislation as King - supporting the weak as demanded by the knightly code of conduct. He seems a man born too late, and trying to adhere to such a strict code of behaviour needs must clash with the attitudes of more opportunistic characters who felt more at ease in this era of change.    Richard's physical courage, praised even by his detractors, originates in his chivalrous ideals, and his last ferocious charge down Ambion Hill to challenge Henry Tudor to single combat  evokes heroic tales of earlier centuries, and indeed his decision to die a King rather than to flee was mentioned in a contemporary ballad.     Close to the end Richard's niece and nephews mourn their uncle's death and discuss their future, still hoping for fair treatment; future judicial murders and the destruction of Richard's reputation are only mentioned in the epilogue. However, learning about their fate is chilling. On the road to glorious Elizabeth I the Plantagenet blood seeped away as Henry VII and Henry VIII got rid of all potential heirs of the old dynasty.     To a modern observer this policy of merciless extermination appears depressingly modern. For all the beauty, progress and enlightenment the Renaissance brought, the Modern Age was setting out on a road that would lead to the atrocities of the 20th century. Gradually, dynastic wars were replaced by ideological ones, with ever more terror wrought on the common, civilian people who were included in the ideological and/or religious struggles. Already the atrocities of the Thirty Years' War and Cromwell's campaigns in Ireland, not unlike today's ethnical cleansing, loom in the future, premonitory of the final triumphs of secular humanism in the 20th century.     Richard Plantagenet died at thirty-two, his promising reign cut short by rebellion and treason. Ms. Penman brings him gloriously back to life for us, to be seen in a benevolent light at last. It is painful for the reader to lose him again, but the great achievement of this book is to show that there was nobility in Richard's cause as well as in his failure.
B000000XCA|4.0|Bayou Country was the first huge break through for CCR. Technically they only had on single that was popular, but two of their very best songs appear on this collection. Every group has a break through album and this is theirs.  Proud Mary is of course one of the top R&R songs ever recorded and has been covered by numerous artists including Tina Turner.  This album also had Born on the Bayou, which to this day is my favorite CCR song of all times.  This is one of the classic albums of R&R and belongs in any library.
B000WEH74G|5.0|Although classified as a \\"samurai movie\\", Kenji Mizoguchi's brooding take on the tale of the forty-seven warriors who choose to commit hara-kiri rather than succumb to the disgrace of losing their clan title is anything but all-action. Although instructed by the military to make an aggressive warlike film, the master director opts for an awe-inspiring display of pure cinema, replete with classy, ultra-long takes and an air of slow-burning doom probably unmatched in cinema history.<br /><br />It is indeed the way the story is filmed that is most breathtaking. Never has a film so perfectly paired up its thematic concerns with the style in which these themes are presented. The scenes in the film are rarely under five minutes each, with the camera relentlessly prowling around via tracking and boom shots. Furthermore, it says so much about its director that the long spaces between cuts are not obvious because of their unobtrusive nature. Instead, we are drawn into the story of the honourable ronin, who inhabit a world totally different from out own. Japanese audiences in 1941 found the film a little too different from their own world, as reflected in the poor performance at the box office.<br /><br />The film forms part of a trilogy of totalitarian films about sacrifice, along with Eisenstein's \\"Alenander Nevsky (1938) and the Nazi film \\"Kolberg\\" (1945): but in reality the \\"47 Ronin\\" is head and shoulders above both of these. Indeed, \\"47 Ronin\\" is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema, and awaits rediscovery.<br /><br />DVD notes: Not a great transfer on this Korean DVD, but the film is in its intact (three hours forty-one minutes) form, and has full English subtitles.

B0002BO05S|4.0|A ponderous retelling of the life of Christ with Swedish actor Max von Sydow in the role of Jesus. Swedish Jesus is hard to accept. Even von Sydow admitted difficulty. He comes off as a spaced-out caricature. Maybe a man who never sinned has to be this way. I have wondered why it was no sin when Jesus angrily drove the moneychangers from the temple with a whip. The cast is a \\"Who's Who in Hollywood,\\" and the fun part is to pick out famous people. John Wayne is the Roman Centurion at the cross. \\"Truly, this man was the Son of God.\\" This film ushered out the era of big budget Bible pictures.
B0010ZR160|5.0|I am surprised by Casey Affleck's performance in this movie. What a great acting! He delivers the role of a young detective with amazing conviction. He is shown as a young man named Patrick living in some Boston hood with his girlfriend (who is also his partner as detective). He looks younger than his age and isn't too big physically (so people don't take him seriously at first), but has enough courage, toughness and wisdom that is required by his job. Inspite of living in an environment riddled with problems, hostility, drug abuse etc, he has maintained high moral values. And it is this morality and its ambiguity that the movie focuses on. When a little girl in the neighborhood goes missing, Patrick is asked by the girl's aunt to look for her. What follows next is a great combination of suspense, crime and drama, with quite a few clever twists in the plot. When the movie ends, you are left thinking about the fine line that sometimes separates the right and the wrong.     The direction is top-notch and so is the script, and Ben Affleck deserves the credit. When I started watching the movie, I had no idea it will be this good, especially having seen Ben Affleck in some pointless movies. But as it turns out, he is much more talented behind the camera than in front of it. Among the actors, as I mentioned earlier, Casey Affleck is a revelation. Amy Ryan, playing the little girl's irresponsible and drug addict mother, is excellent in her role. However I feel that Morgan Freeman is wasted and didn't have a lot to do in this movie. The background score is beautiful. As many people are saying, it's one of the best movies of 2007. They are right. Watch it by any means.

0452289963|2.0|It seems to me that it's easier for people to call sin, EGO, rather than what it is ..sin ~ you know stuff like selfishness, self centeredness etc. which is the cause of all sorts of horrible stuff going on in the world, that stuff has always been referred to as sin for as long as I know,  but Mr. Tolle calls it EGO and everyone goes AH HA..Oh...that must be what it is...so, now can I ask what do we do with all this EGO we just realized that we had/have....pretend like we didn't know any better or just trudge forward with all the guilt of how we've behaved and believed???  I think this book comes up short in the end.
B0011HOEY4|1.0|I have been to movies for 67 years and once worked as a sound man for a R&R band. One absolute is...you never never allow the band to overwhelm the vocals. This movie does exactly that. The backround noise overwhelms the actors dialog to the point that it is impossible to understand. For the first 20 minutes it is almost impossible to figure out who the bad guys are. I have a rule..if a movie doesn't hook me in the first 20 minutes.. it goes into the trash can...this movie is in my trash can..good riddance!!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Contrary to the other reviews here I did found the plot very interesting (hey, if you want an accurate history lesson, get a documentary from the History Channel). As a movie whose primary goal is to entertain, this film achieves its goal. Of course the sets, costumes and overal visuals are the main course and you just can't help feel awe by the grandeur and exquisitive lavishness of the look of this film. To me the plot worked very well: mixing the political schemes with Elizabeth's attraction to Raileigh (no, is NOT a romance as incorrectly pointed by others; Elizabeth do seems very attracted to this man, but you get it all from her facial expressions, not her words, since, very in character, she will not utter the word \\"love\\" toward a common subject, even though it is very obvious). The last thirty minutes of the film with the spanish Armada approaching to bring doom and destruction to both Elizabeth and England is the kind of action sequence we need to see more in movies today: epic and satisfying in terms of the storyline. Cate Blanchet deserves an Oscar for her performance here. Once again she took the role of Elizabeth I and made it her own. By the way all the performances in this film are great. I highly recommend this movie. I plan to watch it again!
1596680296|5.0|My own knitting experience has, until this point, been limited to scarves, hats, shawls and (in 1976) a couple of sweaters - I've not had the nerve or the inclination to knit socks.  With this book as a guide, however, I think I'm ready to make the plunge: Ann Budd gives detailed guidance on each step  and provides instruction on how to make sure the sock you make fits its intended victim - I mean, recipient.  Once you're comfortable with the basic sock, the book also contains a number of additional patterns to help you spread hand knit socks among all your friends and relations.
B000FC2KQA|5.0|I'm not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about.  This edition has a complete Table of Contents which not only allows you to navigate to each individual play, but also to each act and then each individual scene.<br /><br />This is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a KINDLE Shakespeare collection.  Every other version I've tried has been a terrible waste of money and I wonder how long it's going to be before Amazon starts acting responsibly and deleting the worthless e-text versions of this and other collections or offering trial samples of every book listed so people will stop being ripped off.<br /><br />The only improvement I could see is for the table of contents and the individual listings to be justified on the right side of the screen next to the Kindle cursor, but the spacing is wide enough between lines that this is really just quibbling.  I would like to see every Kindle book with this simple modification.
0783230370|5.0|What a hoot.  I love Arnie in comedies, and when he teams up with Danny Devito it's a sure win.  Then, to have Emma Thompson in the mix!    Don't know how I missed seeing this one in the theaters, but I'm glad I bought it for home. Gave my sons a whole new view of the Governator.
0571202284|5.0|The Animator's Survival Kit is one of the most useful resources for anyone interested in animation. As a textbook it is easily referenced, and it is also clear and interesting enough to read from cover to cover. I was a computer animator until I picked up this book. It took me from the most basic hand drawn exercises until I was able to hand animate just about anything. I strongly recommend this text.
B00004STDN|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie.  I rock climb, and I love Stallone movies, but I gotta know if anyone else thought the overuse of the F-word got obnoxious. For the first thirty minutes or so I was like, \\"OK whatever, the word does sound pretty hard core I guess.\\"  An hour later when they were still throwing it around like tomatoes at the La Tomatina festival, I wanted to turn it off and didn't for the sake of seeing how it ended.  The action is GREAT!  My only complaint is with the F-bombs.  Oh, and the pitiful acting done by the \\"Third Rock from the Sun\\" guy.  I liked him too. Man.  That was really poor casting.
0783225849|5.0|Anthony Perkins always feared that he would be typecast because of the popularity of this film. His filmography reads like an actor who did just about everything. Drama, horror, sci-fi, western, thriller, comedy, there wasn't much that he hadn't done. For most people, however, he will be forever known for his role as Norman Bates in \\"Psycho\\".    The film really needs no introduction, as it has been in the public domain for almost fifty years. This is for the small minority who, for some reason, have not seen it yet.    The film is essentially about an almost painfully repressed young man who runs a dilapidated motel just off a deserted highway. A woman stops at the Bates Motel one dark, rainy night, and makes an impression on Norman, the young man who runs it. Unfortunately, Norman's Mother does not approve of ANY woman who would come between her and her son.  A number of murders take place, and a relative of the woman comes to see for herself what may have happened to her sister. The woman's boyfriend is also curious as to what may have happened, as well.  As things turn out, Poor Norman is implicated, and the rest is history.    The real story behind \\"Psycho\\" comes from a novel written by Robert Bloch, who in turn, got inspiration from the story of Ed Gein, a man who not only killed people in his small Wisconsin town, but made household items from the skin and bones of his victims. There was also talk of his being a cannibal, as well. He was in the final stages of completing a full body suit, made from the skin of a number of his victims, when he was caught (this also served as the inspiration for the character of \\"Buffalo Bill\\" in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"). He died in an insane asylum in 1984.    \\"Psycho\\" is the most popular and beloved of all of Alfred Hitchcock's films. In it's day, it shocked a great many people. It serves as a model of how to make a horror film, and has also served as an inspiration for Gus Van Sant to lens a remake (which was an absolute bombat the Box Office). There have been studies (I'm not kidding) of how Hitchcock filmed \\"Psycho\\", from camera angles, to cutting (editing), to lighting and panning the camera for a certain effect.  If you happen to be reading this, and have NOT seen this film, boy, are you in for a treat! If you HAVE already seen it, may I entreat you to see it again, as Classics such as this one never get old!!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I saw the real thing a couple of years ago, and this DVD is a trip down memory lane.  We saw the show from the 4th row center.  It was a spectical to behold.  The DVD is the show - from start to finish.  Of course it doesn't do the show justice, but I enjoyed the DVD none the less.<br /><br />The special features are great.  One of the features shows you the entire show from a back stage perspective (starting from when Celine kisses her boy goodbye at home all the way until she returns home after the show.  I really enjoyed it.  Another of the features is a salute to the fans.  It kind of sucked, but it doesn't take away from the other positives.<br /><br />This DVD is very much worth the $16 I paid for it.  The show in Vegas was very much worth the $600 I paid for it.
6301978587|5.0|Some would call it shmaltzy and self-serving...okay, so what? Suspend disbelief that a middle-aged Babs could pull it off as a young philosophy student. I went to see this film with friends when it was first released, and, by the end, as everyone else left the theater, we stayed to see every last credit (a must for the final dedication to her father over the sweeping score), knowing we'd be back, which we were multiple times.     Described then, as I recall, not as a \\"musical\\", but as \\"a film with music\\", this film works on every level. Passion, drama, humor, absolute captivation. The character portrayals are sincere and obviously well-researched for the culture. Amy Irving has never looked so glowing and feminine. Mandy Pantikin is so handsome and masculine, his character maintains the emphasis of the patriarchy of the culture. The gorgeous cinematography alone is worth the viewing. The musical score weaves throughout the picture so gracefully, I cannot imagine the story without it. And Barbra as Yentl/Anchel...rarely does a character command such a sense of the audience rooting for her to succeed in every scene and connect with her so intimately. For all of us out here who have ever lived our lives in secret so as \\"not to be discovered\\", this character is a hero, for bravely pursuing her voice in this world. (\\"For too many mornings the curtains were drawn; it's time they were open to welcome the dawn...\\").  The closing scene of Yentl crossing the ocean on the steamer with all the huddled immigrants, proclaiming her sense of self (\\"Papa--WATCH ME FLY!!!\\") is one of my all time favorite cinematic moments...if this doesn't move you, nothing will...    Like the other reviewers, I await the release of this film on DVD...til then, any version of this classic is worth having in your collection.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|This is just a great edition for the Vangelis fan, i was very pleased with the new third cd, it's relaxing and brings you in the right mood, a must for every Vangelis fan!
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book.  I have been ready fictional romance for a while now and the cover of this book caught my eye.  I was very glad that I picked it up.  I could really empathize with the author.  I couldn't put it down.  Great read!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I adored this new adaptation of the book of Jane Austen.<br />The history is pretty and we have wonderful interpretations.<br />I saw this film innumerable times and each moment I feel the magic of this romance.
0316166685|4.0|This book starts out so magnificantly that I thought I'd found the book of my dreams. And then, it started to lag, almost to the point where I started to skim. This is a very good book, highly original but very hard to get through. Maybe because it's so \\"out there\\" you have to believe in heaven, the author's heaven as she believes it. But overall I would recommend it strictly on originality.
0143038419|1.0|If you want to spend the money to get an interesting inside view of a pilgrimage to India, then go ahead and get this book. If you are looking for    much else related to love, eating or prayer look elsewhere. This is one womans fairly narcissistic spiritual autobiography which does little to entertain and less to inspire. Check out Kathleen Norris or Barbara Kingsolver if you want spiritual memoirs worth reading.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Across The Universe, to me, was one of the best movies that I have seen.  The music of the Beatles was incorporated into the movie seamlessly and the singers where wonderful.  I normally don't like covers of old songs like the Beatles, but the cast was brilliant.  Each song was sung with passion by each actor. I loved the CD set and play it quite often. I even bought a copy for a friend. I highly recommend this CD set to anyone who lived during the 60's, like I did. If you like the CD you would love the Movie!    Tony
B0002E5O9G|5.0|A truly magnificent recording of \\"Les Miserables\\" from the Albert Hall in London, UK,  I would recommend this CD to anybody.  This live recording deserves a place in everybodys library.    John Winter
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is a great movie that has absolutely no bad language or nudity or even any violence at all.  It won't happen very often that I will give a movie like this a high rating, but this one deserves it.  Everyone, no matter how old you are or where you are from, can relate to the characters in this movie.  Also, another thing I've noticed about this movie is that people either love it or they hate it.  I can remember the first time I watched it.  I think we replayed several scenes multiple times due to how funny they were.  Some of the things that Napoleon does are so incredibly stupid that they are hilarious.  Napoleon and his older brother Kip are loners who don't have many if any friends.  Napoleon is a high school student trying to fit in while Kip stays at home and carries out an odd relationship with an internet chat partner whom he has never met.  Eventually they both find love but what's funny is the road they take to get there.  The music in this movie even made me laugh.  As stupid and corny as this movie is, it still delivers the goods when it comes to being a comedy.  Great movie.
0765350386|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and it's been a while since I've read a fantasy novel that drew me in so quickly. Sanderson has created a very compelling world and the magic system is interesting in its own right. Overall, he created some great characters, made me care what happened to them and told a great story. I'm excited about reading other books written by the author.
B000002UAU|5.0|When you listen to Sgt. Pepper for the first time your listening to not just the Beatles but a Generation growing up.  The music industry changed the day this album was released. When I first listened to this album I didn't know whether to love it or hate it.  It was not the Beatles I was use to listening to.  About the third playing I \\"got it.\\"  I wore my first copy out in about a week.  My advice, listen to this cd deeply. There is so much going on. If you listen to Beatle albums just before they did Sgt. Pep you could hear something brewing.  Rubber Soul and Revolver are pointing us to the explosion of awareness that was about to happen.  If you don't know who George Martin is take the time to find out.  It was his genius that made this album revered among all music lovers.  Cuts from this album have been covered by every genre of music on the earth.  And when you get this album put your headphones on relax and float upstream.
0321544080|5.0|If you want a book to reinvigorate your enthusiasm for photography this is it. My wife and I travelled with Joe through Ireland with the American Photo Mentor Series a few years ago. Every page brought a smile to my face, because he is in person exactly the person who shows up on the pages of this book. Every page has a gem of photographic wisdom and a great photo and story. My favorite gem of wisdom: Joe's awareness of the value of autofocus after three pints of Guiness. You will enjoy this book whether or not you have ever met Joe and if you have a chance to go to one of his workshops (He teaches at the Santa Fe Photograpic Workshops), I would encourage you to enjoy him in person.
0385335989|5.0|This is a great book and a wonderful continuation. It is book 4 in the series. I couldn't wait to read more about Jamie, Claire, Roger and Brianna. This book answers a lot of questions from the previous ones and has a lot of nice suprises!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This version of Persuasion is one of the best productions of Jane Austen's work.  The actors are well played and very talented.  Amanda Root is well suited in the role of Anne and is very definitive in her protrayal of the character.  The humour is fully in the characters and captured in the time of proper manners and etiquette.  Beautiful story of second chances and forgiveness.
B0001US62I|5.0|An Eye For An Eye         In the 1987 film, Angel Heart, director Alan Parker elaborately relays to his audience the underlying theme that a person, despite his or her best attempt, cannot cheat and prosper in life.  Utilizing a vast array of symbolism, cultural ideology, and clever subterfuge, Parker portrays the unsuccessful attempt of his main character, Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke), to 'have his cake and eat it too' by cheating both God and Satan.           In \\"Angel Heart\\", the old adage that 'cheaters never prosper' comes to life on the screen in a horrifying manner, as the destruction of both self and others unfolds in a most hell-like fashion.  Seemingly, Parker is telling his audience to not be deceived...that nobody, despite his or her best attempt, can cheat and prosper in life.         I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Angel Heart\\".  I give it a five-star thumbs up.  I bought this DVD from Amazon.com for the purpose of writing a college level essay on symbology in films.  It turned out to be an excellent choice.  I highly recommend the film, but caution parents to use discretion.  There is a bit of filthy language, some gore, and a sexual scene that I feel should not be viewed by children under age 18.  Use discretion, but enjoy.  The symbology is unsurpassed.    --Allan Whitney--
B000P0J024|5.0|What a great album.  They still sound current and awesome.  What a magical group!  Oh to have been a fly on the wall when they started riffing.  If they had been together long enough, (and alive) they may have been able to compete with the Beatles and Beach Boys for their originality and impact.
0143038419|4.0|I think this book is very thought provoking.  Everyone who wants to start down a spiritual path this is a great read.  This Author helps share her journey from where so many of us start and she ends up in a good place.  If you are from a strong Christian background or belief system this book will not be as enlightning as you may hope for.  All in all the author is a great writer and does keep your attention.  This is a popular book for a reason and it is helping many people to find a better path for themselves.  So that in itself is a great start!
B000WGZGNS|4.0|I've never been a Beyonce fan. I hear her music from time to time and bob my head or do a little dance, but I've never been one to purchase her music, let alone go see her perform. I never doubted her ability to entertain---let's face it, she was BORN to do this! But after hearing so many people exclaim how awesome this concert was, I just had to check it out.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. She keeps it moving throughout. The production is stellar. From her band, to her dancers, to her on stage, she keeps your eyes locked and glued anticipating what will happen next. One thing I loved about this is how she highlighted her musicians, allowing them their moments to display their talents while she dressed or  changed or took a break, whatever. She gave props to the big band behind her. Also, with the backup singers and the dancers, she allowed them their moment to shine---the focus, surprisingly, was taken 'away' from Beyonce for awhile. She incorporated songs from other artists into her works and revamped/remixed her songs.<br /><br />Overall, it was an absolute solid production, much better I think (at least more energetic and LIVE! than her Dangerously in Love tour).<br /><br />The only thing I missed from this piece was special features. The DVD offers you the ability to 'remix' the various songs, streaming them through your computer or television for 'listening' sake, but it didn't have any behind-the-scenes footage as did her first tour. I think fans would love more to be able to see Beyonce, not only in her element on stage, but behind the curtain. How does she prepare? What all is involved in this production that wasn't in the first?<br /><br />She is truly an awesome performer and while I didn't think B'Day was all that great compared to her previous work and works with Destiny's Child, she manages to incorporate the best of her sophomore release intermixed with selections from DIL and Destiny's Child's catalog of work. I can only imagine what theme her next production will take on. Four stars for The Beyonce Experience! Next time, if they include special features, I'll give it five!. Four stars for The Beyonce Experience! Next time, if they include special features, I'll give it five!
1400032717|3.0|I've been interested in reading this book for awhile so when I found out that I had to read it for class I was relieved thinking that I would enjoy 'school reading'. At first, I was confused thinking that the author had autism himself. But without having to look it up, I noticed in the writing that the author was writing as if he was autistic.   Although some of Christopher's behaviors are true to the description of autism, such as everything needing to have an order and being very specific in what people say. However, if you pay close attention you can find contradictions within pages of each other. I've read that Haddon has had experience working with people with autism, but that does not mean that he knows how an autistic mind works 100% of the time.  Regardless, I did enjoy the book and thought it was funny and portrayed a person with autism relatively well. I just would have enjoyed it better if it was actually written by a person with autism.
B000W02TDE|5.0|He is a dream come true!  He is young, hot and he sings the standards with a new twist that even young crowds love MB.  We have seen him in several concerts and he is entertaining as well as melts your heart with his voice and appearance!    We have all of his albums and doubles because he is just a dream come true!  You can mention Frank S. and the others he reminds people of but he is a category himself Michael Buble!
B0002IQOZA|1.0|but sounding more like \\"I can do better (worse) than Mariah Carey\\".  Like no old classic Christmas song (that I enjoy thouroughly) goes to extremes like this.  On the bright side however, my hometown's Christmas station, I would somtimes hear \\"This Christmas\\" which sounds like the most decent sounding one (cause there is no harsh screeching).    The best covers on \\"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire\\"  1.  Nat King Cole - A timeless classic, play it every Christmas!  2.  Al Jarreau   3.  Gloria Estefan  4.  Luther Vandross    .  .  .  Dead Last. Christina Aguilera - what's up with the screeching!    I wish these now-a-day pop stars who sing Christmas songs sing it with their heart, as opposed to just doing it for just the money.  Christmas is a time for giving and celebrating Jesus's birth, not showing off.
0618918248|3.0|Atheist Michael Ruse says it best in his review (well, as best as he can allow, for an atheist). While acknowledging that Dawkins is a \\"brilliant science writer\\", he goes on to lament:<br /><br />\\"It is not that the atheists are having a field day because of the brilliance and novelty of their thinking. Frankly - and I speak here as a nonbeliever myself, pretty atheistic about Christianity and skeptical about all theological claims - the material being churned out is second rate. And that is a euphemism for \\"downright awful.\\" [. . .] It is simply that it (and the other works, some of which I have gone after elsewhere) is not very good. For a start, Dawkins is brazen in his ignorance of philosophy and theology (not to mention the history of science). [. . .] Dawkins misunderstands the place of the proofs, but this is nothing to his treatment of the proofs themselves. This is a man truly out of his depth.\\"<br /><br />From the other reviews here, I gather that Dawkins is not the only one out of his depth.<br /><br />Update: I've been asked to provide more detail on the intellectual gaffes found therein. I shall do so in parts, since it's rather tedious - like being asked to review a treatise on philosophy by Alfred E. Neuman. But I can see that many here are not as well-informed on science, history and philosophy as some other atheists, such as Michael Ruse or Antony Flew, so here goes.<br /><br />In this first chapter, Dawkins takes great pains to claim Einstein as an atheist, quoting his statements where he denies believing in a personal God, saying that to him \\"God\\" means the laws that govern the universe.<br /><br />Already we can see that Dawkins is not the objective seeker led by the facts. Einstein, you see, took great pains to make clear that he was not an atheist or a positivist. \\"I'm not an atheist, and I don't think I can call myself a pantheist.\\"<br /><br />He goes on: \\"The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God.\\"<br /><br />On Jesus, he says \\"I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.\\" However, he did not believe in immortality.<br /><br />Now, Dawkins must have known this after he googled \\"einstein god atheist\\", but he chose to leave it out - \\"need to know\\", I suppose. Why? To give the impression that Einstein shared the same \\"religious\\" view as himself - \\"God\\" as another name for physical law. But to Einstein, \\"The child knows someone must have written those books.\\" If Einstein were alive today, he would say what he said to Prince Hubertus: \\"What really makes me angry is that [atheists] quote me for support of their views.\\" While he did not believe God was personal, his God manifests \\"in the laws of the universe as a spirit vastly superior to that of man ...\\"<br /><br />The skeptic, at this point, would ask: Why did Dawkins feel compelled to present a misleading view of Einstein's God? It is because everyone is in awe of Einstein, including Dawkins. If the reader had to choose between the views of Einstein and Dawkins, they would put down this book. So Dawkins, having no moral compass (despite his protestations to the contrary), sees no problem in misrepresenting Einstein and deceiving his readers.<br /><br />But Einstein is not alone. Max Planck, father of the quantum hypothesis: \\"Religion and natural science are fighting a joint battle ... against skepticism and against dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition ... 'On to God!'\\" Paul Dirac: \\"God is a mathematician of a very high order ...\\" And even Darwin: \\"I deserve to be called a Theist.\\"<br /><br />That's enough for now.
B00005JPSM|1.0|You can watch this movie, or you can watch the original (Mostly Martha). Sure, its in German. Yeah, you'll have to read subtitles. But I'd rather do that the watch this pathetic, American remake. This movie is a true example of why some movies should not be remade. Enjoy the original and pitch this one in the garbage.

0688163173|2.0|Teddy Daniels, and his partner Chuck Aule, are U.S. Marshalls assigned to look for a mental patient that has disappeared on Shutter Island, the location of a high security mental hospital that is funded by the U.S. Government where they seem to be conducting strange and secret psychological experiments.  But things seem amiss from the very beginning.  The inhabitants of the island seem limitedly cooperative and seem more intent on keeping their secrets than helping to find the missing patient.  Teddy's investigation leads him to patients that provide veiled warnings for his safety and he begins to think that all is not what it seems.  He must decide who he can trust and what is truly going on behind the walls of the hospital on the mysterious island.<br /><br />This book just never really goes anywhere.  There are some interesting twists and turns, but the writing that takes you to them is so bland and slow that by the time the twist reveals itself the reader no longer cares.  And the big reveal at the end is predictable long before it comes.  There is some effort to keep the reader guessing even after the last page, but that serves to be more annoying than suspenseful.  A disappointing read.

Here she lives at an ashram studing the arts of yoga and meditation.  Here she learns to pray and truly find a spiritual connection to her God.  She comes to understand the importance of channeling a person's individual spirituality and being able to tap into that as a source of strength.  Finally, the travels end in Indionesia.  She discovers a very unique culture and perspective on humanity.  She also learns how to love people again without loving those that will only hurt her.  She balances what is good for her with what she used to be fatally attracted to so that she can move forward with interpersonal relationships.    This memoir from one woman is the story of many.  There is something in this book for everyone.  Whether you are currently searching or have previously searched for something missing in your life, you will find solace in the author's search and strength in what she discovered.  She proves that everyone can take their lives into their own hands and make it what they want it to be.
0143038419|4.0|The book is a fun ride. I don't think it would much matter what Gilbert was writing about, it's her style that is engaging and entertaining. Gilbert is able to laugh at herself and it is fun to laugh with her.  Living is not a logical sequence and she's not always logical.  But she does exude the best of feminine attributes - she's bright, she's witty, she's attractive, she's able to go with the flow and capable of making the best of what comes her way. The whole story seems a bit too good to be true; especially the ending seems a bit concocted - but that's ok.  It wasn't meant to be a self-help book.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is what HD was made for!   If you haven't seen \\"Planet Earth\\" on an HD TV, you are really missing something.  I keep saying as I watch the series:  \\"How did they film this\\"...every scene is something new and exciting.  Not to be missed!
0399245030|5.0|This book is near perfect.  So close that I can't even think as to how it's not.  A smart, sweet story of friendship that is a go-to for me as a read-aloud.    The premise is that a boy opens his door to find a penguin.  He works to find out whether the penguin is lost, and to where should he be returned.  Ultimately boy and penguin travel to the South pole.  Boy leaves penguin on ice floe only to realize that the penguin was not lost, he was just lonely.  Boy and penguin are reunited, leaving them and the reader happily ever after.     Much like Mo Willems, Oliver Jeffers invokes great emotion with simple drawings.  A clever story paired with these illustrations makes for a must for anyone looking to entertain the 4-8 crowd.
B00139W3NE|3.0|Ok I admit the good part of the review is for the star power and the great scenery.  Both are exceptional.    If you want to enjoy this movie  thoroughly  do not have read the book recently go in ignorant off it.  Otherwise  you're going to notice all the things unfaithful to the book.   Like that it is totally out of order,  That Mrs Coultran tells Lyra who her parents are  (in fact King of the gyptians  told her) and that the bear battle comes before the rescue of the kids.  Then the abbrupt end  which is supposed to lead straight into book 2 with a horriable betrayel.    The whole movie could have been  vastly improved  by adding an hour to get  their facts straight and explain things properly like why ones Deamons must never be touched by others.   Or that  the 2 battles Iorke  had to fight  where  so abrupt (as a friend put it  I have to win this fight, I WON)   and the importance of their armor.  Both way to short  and didn't give us enough time to learn &  love Iork for all his crustiness he dfevoted loved lyra. Lee  and  the witches are  supposed to be major  players in this and it's more like short cameos.   Yes in time I'll still get this movie but I  would've  improved it.  I  doubt the sequels will end up on the screen at all but please do read all 3 books Philip Pullman himself is a master storyteller  and I could happily say this series may even outshine Harry potter.
0151013047|5.0|I started this book last night and just finished it.  This is one of those books you just DON'T WANT to put down.  The story calls you back when the book is not in your hand.  It was eloquently written and the subject matter was so thought provoking.  Every choice we make impacts not only ourselves, but those close to us and even those we do not know.  The ripple effect of this story is fascinating.  It's obviously early in the year, but I think this book will remain at the top of my reads this year!!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|\\"Once\\" is such a lovely film... We finally sat down to watch it and, like so many others, were enchanted by the odd, intangible chemistry between the two lead actors, and by its fascinating glimpse into the creative process.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film's presentation of how music is made, and how creative people collaborate, there are a couple of other films that come to mind that capture some of the same vibe. One is a bit silly, teh other is more profound:<br /><br />\\"Music And Lyrics,\\" with Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, is the silly one. I really liked even though it's so fluffy -- but the scenes where they collaborate on the songs are key to their characters and their relationship, much like similar scenes in \\"Once.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tribalistas\\" - this DVD documentary of the making of the \\"Tribalistas\\" is utterly thrilling.  The film features Brazilian pop stars Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes and shows them recording an album from start to finish. If you liked the creative scenes in \\"Once,\\" and wished there were more of that in the film, then track the Tribalistas video down -- it's one of the purest documents of musicmaking and creativity I've ever seen. Truly amazing.  Anyway, that's my two bits.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide to Brazilian Music)
B00104W8T6|5.0|The wonderfully eclectic choices for the Juno soundtrack were so spot-on, that I have no quibbles whatsoever. They are achingly youthful; the Kimya Dawson-Antsy Pants tracks are suburb split-level duplex rec-room raw. Excellent and fresh as flowers. The opening notes(recognizeble to all 56 year-old men)of Mott The Hopple was a cunning choice as was The Velvet Underground. The album has a stunning range of styles-Sonic Youth, Cat Power, Mateo Messina, The Moldy Peaches, Barry Polisar(who kicks the whole thing off), Belle  & Sebatian, even the fun-loving Kinks and Buddy Holly  show up(How cool is that!),but it is the playfulness of the lyrics that tie everything into a cohesive collection. Also, the placement of the Kimya Dawson and Antsy Pants tracks provide continuity. The perfect ending duet of the two leads, Michael Cera and Ellen Page, of the movie was a nice  final touch. Even Ebert liked it.
B0009X7664|5.0|I don't know why Harper Lee stopped writing after To Kill A Mockingbird. This two disc DVD edition is worth every penny. The film is a classic starring Oscar Winner, Gregory Peck, in the character that became his signature role. The supporting cast is equally stellar with the children, Jem and Scout. We hear about how the children on the set were invited to the Peck home to spend the weekends. The cast included Ruth White as Mrs. Dubose which her part was cut short in the film than in the book. I have collected a lot of Ruth White memorabilia. She spent four hours in make-up each day. Alice Ghostley plays a neighbor and mother. Mary Badham who played Scout never really became a household name but she does not regret doing the film one bit. Scout is immortalized by her performance as a tough but sensitive young girl. The two disc set features tributes to Gregory Peck from his daughter, Celia Peck, as well as his Oscar winning speech and the AFI tribute to him.
0321544080|3.0|After much self-serving hype from Scott Kelby this was a disappointing read. I didn't get any of the \\"tricks of the trade\\" that were promised to give me a wow. there was name dropping along the way, but few of the tricks made sense to me. I'm sure that if you could ask questions about Joe's explanations of how he got the shot it would be a wow. Even showing where his assistant stood with lights would help. His placement of softboxes and reflectors, lenses used and exposures are all missing from many of the photos. Maybe this is really a nice book just for the pictures, but it isn't the secrets book that was promoted.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never even heard of Firefly or Serenity until I saw it recommended in my Blockbuster at home list (read: Marketing failure). The movie was fantastic, the best sci-fi movie I had seen in long time. Since then I have seen the series and it is really quite good.    With all the fecal waste matter that passes for entertainment on network TV, I have to wonder how FOX let a gem like this slip by. The Sci-Fi channel should have picked this up instead of pro wrestling.
B000M4RGA6|5.0|I have only seen 1 Will Ferrel role I didnt like. This I think may be his best since Zoolander, Elf, Old school... This is a classy sweet and funny movie. A nice ORIGINAL romantic comedy is always a breath of fresh air.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Lost is a great show and this Blu-ray complete season is a definite must-have for Lost fans.    The video is sharp and colors pop and the island looks so beautiful.  The extras are a great collection as well.  Especially watching Terry O'Quinn actually throw knives.    If you are a Lost fan get this set.
0767836286|5.0|Although I rented this movie a while back, I still rememeber most of   the \\"action\\". You see, there was once a song, and a line from that song  says, \\"paranoia strikes deep, into your life it will creep.\\"  Well, the   Jeff Bridges character (who teaches terrorism at the local college) starts  wondering about his neighbors. Tim Robbins just happens to be that neighbor. nuff said?   First half of movie drags, but it sets up the second half nicely.  Second half, keep an eye on your neighbor. But, the ending is what is   most dramatic of the whole effort.  The ending is what keeps you thinking,  wondering, and instills in us a sense of paranoia that will keep   neighborhoods on their toes for a long time. If you trust your   neighbors, then it's a bad movie. But if there is the slightest doubt,  by all means, an excellent show.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with the \\"new\\" Bond or if I would like it as much as have in the past. What I found was a James Bond that I found to be a bit more brutal than any Bond movies from the past but was every bit as entertaining as all the others. I have talked to people that really like it and others who don't think it as good as the others but I say it's definitely worth taking a shot and judging for yourself. It overall is much the same as the old favorites but updated a bit to go with what the current type of movies are. I think they came up with the perfect actor to update the series a bit because I sure don't see any of the other actors to play Bond doing the parts this guy did.
158270208X|4.0|Love the journal, cover and message of the day. Wonderful way to do a gratitude list!
B00005JPLW|4.0|I know many critics knocked this movie but they've done that to several movies I've ended up liking. We all have our own tastes and although I do read critics views they often won't stop me from renting or buying the movie if I think it's something I'd enjoy. So for those of you who haven't seen this yet and have been sitting on the fence trying to decide I say rent or buy it (I got it at a great price on sale).
1400064287|5.0|I was skeptical of this book because of its popularity in the business world.  My skepticism was unfounded.  This book was hard for me to put down. It is very clearly organized, very well researched, and is - in general - highly thought provoking.  I believe it is as applicable in the arts world as it is in the business world and have recommended it to several of my songwriter friends.
B000026I8U|5.0|Very fun to listen to. The deeper that I researched Manu Chao, the more fun the experience. His musical partners (amparanoia) and his  background led me to know many other artists and musical styles. Thanks to my friend Patty who intoduced my to Manu Chao.....
B0011HOEY4|3.0|I like Scott, I really like Denzel, and Crowe has been very solid -- so far.  But this movie...?  How could they blow it?  Well, they did. There are a number of parts I liked, but on the whole, something just doesn't gel, or perhaps it's too obviously a mish mash of other gangster movies.  Crowe seems like he's overacting (a lot).  It may be his worst performance yet. I'm starting to think this dude takes himself way too seriously. I think I saw somewhere that he dissed DeNiro. (Crowe, you need to sit down with Bobby D movies and see how it was done. He's not the same Bobby D these days, but back in his day he could run method acting circles around you.) And Washington seems like he's sleepwalking through the role (a first for him). Compare this performance with his performance in Training Day.  True, different characters, but it's also a question of a scipt realizing the character. An actor can only do so much. American Gangster does not.  Why? Well, for one, it's boring.  I caught a whiff of Year of the Dragon in this one, but that wasn't a very good movie either. I probably should give this two stars, but I'm giving it 3 for previous great efforts by all involved, and the obvious techical professionalism that went into the making of this Turkey.  I'm now going to go watch Goodfellas to make up for time lost.
B000B5KQY4|5.0|Great experimental music that catched our attention in the 80s. This is the best album of The Art of Noise I found. For people who were confused by the difference interpretation of the band name and albums released, this is probably the album with the pieces most people know.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Lost is part `ER', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' and yet remains totally unique in every conceivable way. Lost is something to look forward to. It really has become a part of our lives.<br /><br />In many ways the best way to enjoy Lost is to avoid learning anything about it and just watch it with others who know nothing about it and guess what is going on. For this reason just buy it and prepare to watch a whole season in the span of a few days and then sulk in disappointed over how you have to wait another year to watch the next season, skipping TV, because you know watching a season with every episode back to back is the best way to experience the best that television has to offer.<br /><br />The logistics are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island the audience comes to realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them.<br /><br />Why are `the others' on the island? Who will Kate fall for? Who is Ben really? How did `the others' get there? What is the `Dharma initiative'? Are there psychics? What strange connection does Locke have with the island? Are there ghosts? Is this all an experiment? These are the kind of questions that can come up in a single episode of Lost... however the catch is that you have to wait quite awhile for anything to get answered and the good news is that Lost Season 3, does answer a lot of questions... but opens up a whole lot more.<br /><br />Season 1 was about the island. Season 2 is about the hatch. Season 3 is about `the others'.<br /><br />Season 3 is essentially finished with the hatch, but there are a lot more hatches with different things going on. The island expands with more interesting places to visit. It is becoming a bit of a treasure hunt.<br /><br />In the first season we sat through quite a number of background stories for the series character build-ups, that are quite well driven, although extremely odd at times. These character build-ups are still occurring, so they are certainly a mainstream part of the show, and `the others' get their own back stories now too.<br /><br />The producers are still working on the death clock element and they do kill off major characters. Main characters will die in Season 3. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? Will Dr. Jack side with `the others'? Will Sawyer kill again? Is Charlie going to die? Michael doesn't show up for Season 3, but for a split scene we do see Walt and even Boon.<br /><br />The seven degrees of separation are now quickly becoming one degree. We are learning that the characters have more in common then we previously could have imagined. There is a huge twist in a back story in the last episode that will leave your jaw on the stick popcorn floor. The writers of this show are simply layering on the drama to near melting point.<br /><br />The ethnic variations of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer.ith different things going on.

0066620996|4.0|Originally I purchased this book because I had to read it for my Entrepreneurship class.  This book is extremely well researched and the findings are resoundingly true.  If you are a CEO, buy this book.  If you are starting a company and want greatness, buy this book.  I don't have my own company or even hopes of starting one soon, but when I do, I know exactly how I can make it great.  This book takes you step by step on the path to greatness.  The only downfall is that it gets a little redundant, and the last chapter didn't make a whole lot of sense because I haven't read Jim Collins other book \\"Built to Last.\\"  But, indeed a great book whether or not you do have a company.  The principles can apply to any organization.
0425180638|2.0|I recently read(listened to on CD) Black Notice, The Last Precinct and Blow Fly all one after the other on my two-hour daily commute. The Last Precinct was a very disappointing, almost time-wasting, read. I see that others felt the same way. It spends a lot of time inside Kay's head with few revelations and even less plot. After a while, I found Anna to be a pain in the butt. The interaction between the two was fake and contrived. And I hate to say this about a Cornewell novel, but it was boring, even.  The irony is that Blow Fly, which seemed to wrap up and even accelerate some story lines left dangling in past novels, was presented in a too neat package with most climaxes and thrilling events happening off-camera and not written about in detail.  I had stopped reading Cornwell after Black Notice, which I originally read when it was first published. Several years went by and I had forgotten why I didn't like her books anymore because I could still feel the rush of reading her early novels.  Now I know why.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The best film I have seen in years. It is funny, poignant and the music is fantastic.    Do you know if the Coen Brothers have made any more films?
B00092ZMDY|3.0|A real disappointment. Glenn Frey controlled this show and seemed to use a Dick Clark-type dart board to select the repertoire of too many non-Eagles songs. The crowd was very responsive but hardly selective either. Fortunately Joe Walsh is a wonderful entertainer. Don Henley seemed to just go through the motions. A real letdown from Hell Freezes Over.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I too was alittle upset when this set first came out. I mean the timing was just wrong. I too had been one of those fans that bought each individual box set. Well I went ahead and purchased this as well and it's great!!!! I don't ever plan on selling off my individual sets, I think  any true Gilmore Girls fan needs both!! :) It's a wonderful set and yes it's alittle cheesy but  Lorelai and Rory would have loved it and probably owned it as well.
0451529065|1.0|Here is an interesting experiment: Empty your garage of every piece of metal, wood, paint, rubber, and plastic. Make sure there is nothing there. Nothing. Then wait for ten years and see if a Mercedes evolves. If it doesn't appear, leave it for 20 years. If that doesn't work, try it for 100 years. Then try leaving it for 10,000 years.     Here's what will produce the necessary blind faith to make the evolutionary process believable: leave it for 250 million years.   The Book of Genesis tells us that everything was created by God--nothing \\"evolved.\\" Every creature was given the ability to reproduce after its own kind as is stated ten times in Genesis. Dogs do not produce cats. Neither do cats and dogs have a common ancestry. Dogs began as dogs and are still dogs. They vary in species from Chihuahuas to Saint Bernards, but you will not find a \\"dat\\" or a \\"cog\\" (part cat/dog) throughout God's creation. Frogs don't reproduce oysters, cows don't have lambs, and pregnant pigs don't give birth to rabbits. God made monkeys as monkeys, and man as man.     Each creature brings forth after its own kind. That's no theory; that's a fact. Why then should we believe that man comes from another species? If evolution is true, then it is proof that the Bible is false. However, the whole of creation stands in contradiction to the theory of evolution.     In the Foreword to Origin of Species (100th edition), Sir Arthur Keith admitted, \\"Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it only because the only alternative is special creation, and that is unthinkable.\\"       Dr. Kent Hovind of Florida has a standing offer of $250,000 to \\"anyone who can give any empirical evidence (scientific proof) for evolution.\\" Evolution-- true science fiction.

B000BB14YY|3.0|The storyline, heavily Shakespearean, is about a wealthy Warlord who has 3 sons, one of which is bestowed the kingdom. Unprepared for battle he is conquered by deceit. Although medium scale war moves quite patiently, the director keeps your attention to the main characters with effective display of strong acting performances, mesmerizing costumes and large sceneries in Shogun perspective. Literary allusions run wide throughout the film too. I don't want to spoil them for you; but you will be surprised how obvious they really are.
B00011V8AE|4.0|Wonderful early recording of Bob Dylan at his best. All tracks are sublime and give a look into life and issues of the 60's for people who were either not there or were and want to remember the passion.

In the special features, he mentions that this concert is probably the last Pop concert he will make. If this is true, this will make this CD even more valuable in the future.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|Matt Damon is back in Robert Ludlum's the `Bourne Ultimatum' as a trained CIA assassin who lost his memory of who he is. This is a non-stop action packed movie, and the best one in this trilogy. It shows us how the government is watching our every move through cameras placed in public areas and through satellites. Many have argued that this is not a good thing, and as this movie shows, some governmental agencies can use such technology unlawfully. It also portrays the CIA as ruthless killers with cover-ups as their motto operandi. It is scary to think that some governmental agencies have files on us, and if need be, information about us can be gathered within minutes from credit cards and computer IPs. The `Big Brother is watching' age is real and here.    I really enjoyed the pace of this movie, especially the scene in the train station at the very beginning of the movie where Bourne gives instructions to the journalist on how to evade the cameras. The action is unpredictable. He outsmarts the CIA in this scene, but the journalist does end up getting shot. Does the CIA in real life spare no one in order to reach its end? Is this another `Three Days of the Condor?'    Does the CIA murder its own people? According to this movie, they do so all the time if an agent compromises a mission. I did read a few books on the CIA, and it is a known fact that they do use assassins. Those assassins are expendable and effort is always made to make them unrelated to the agency.    The acting and cast are great, and I like how the movie moves from one country to another, albeit a bit too fast for my taste. You have the main action happening in Paris, Spain, Morocco, and New York. Only James Bond travels to so many countries in one movie; if you don't count the movie `Around the World in Eighty Days' that is, and a few other movies.    The chase in Morocco was superb and well filmed. Jumping on roofs and through windows from one building to another was movie making at its best. Thisscene will become a classic.    I loved the ending, and how one agent spares Bourne's life because he had spared his life before. Bourne asks him, \\"Do you have any idea why you want to kill me? Do you have any idea why you do the things that you do?\\" This is probably the only intelligent dialogue in the whole movie. I think the ending makes it clear that there is probably another sequel in the not too distant horizon.    One issue I have with this movie is the shaky camera movement. What is the purpose of filming in this way? Is it to give a feeling of action? During close-ups this really annoyed me. I also found that in some action scenes, the camera cuts from one scene to another way too fast. Bourne's travels from one country to another were also hurriedly executed, but I guess they wanted to imitate Bond.    I watched this movie with two friends and we were glued to our seats until the end of the movie. We didn't even have time to eat our popcorn! But that's because we were already in such a state of mind for a non-thought provoking action packed movie. If you are looking for fun and action, this movie is it. If you are looking for a story with lots of intelligent dialogue, you won't find it here. The four star rating is for the action only.
0439813786|5.0|This is such an amazing book.  I read it to my children, ages 6 and 8.  They would beg me to keep reading more and more.  Then I read it to my fourth grade class and the same thing happened.  One girl even asked if they could miss recess so I could read more to them!  This is book is well worth the money and I highly recommend it.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I'm not going to sit here and compare Sara Bareilles to older and more generally accepted as brilliant artists like Sarah McLachlan or Toris Amos. I'm sure they themselves are rather sick of being volunteered to being some sort of benchmark used to beat down artists like Sara Bareilles, A Fine Frenzy, and her contemporaries because some people are too arrogant to bother admitting that there's a distinction between these \\"generic\\" new artists.     Sara Bareilles' music is catchy, it's pop, and most importantly, it doesn't have its nose up in the air. She writes and sings songs with the one objective of sending her message in the manner that she knows best, and fortunately, the product is something that apparently most people can enjoy.    To the ~elitists~, I'm sure Imogen Heap's angle has been done before, shall I write a negative review by virtue of that right now? Originality is overrated. Musicians cannot pick the way they want to sing, their musically influence, the sound of their voice, and whatever else that reflects who they are and the kind of music they produce. Get off your high horse because if originality is what singers now-a-days lack, then perhaps future generations will have to start learning to sing out of their ears because after a while, ALL ANGLES will be used up and they will just become thoughtless, generic, and cheap copies of the past.    P.S. this isn't an attack of Imogen Heap btw, she's wonderful. Nevertheless, her fanbase seem so intolerant of others singer/songwriters (at least on Amazon) I just had to bring it up, cheers.
B001041JLE|5.0|I'm sure almost every household on this planet has got a copy of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" which is the best selling album of all time to date.<br /><br />Released originally December 1982, the album was produced by Quincy Jones and had an unprecedented 7 US top 10 singles (matched only by the 7 top 10 singles from sister Janet's \\"Rhythm Nation 1814\\" in 1990). This version has been released to commemorate the 25th anniversary of that landmark album. The original 9 tracks (which we all know and love) are here (remastered), as well as an unreleased \\"Thriller\\" era ballad \\"For all time\\" which was newly recorded by Michael and sounds in parts like \\"Human nature\\" (it's just ok), a voice over by horror movie king Vincent Price (the spooky voice on the song \\"Thriller\\" kidding around with Michael, then doing his \\"Thriller\\" rap including a verse omitted from the final recording, I honestly don't see myself listening to this more than a couple of times), and remixes of 5 of the 7 \\"Thriller\\" singles featuring some of today's hottest producers and acts. These are the songs I was really looking forward to.<br /><br />\\"The girl is mine\\" has been transformed into a more upbeat song with will.i.am replacing Paul McCartney (and providing different lyrics), and is surprisingly rather nice. It has a dreamy feel and additional guitars - I prefer it to the original. \\"Wanna be startin' something\\" (which made Billboard's hot 100 recently) features Akon who starts off singing against a piano backdrop, before the more familiar beats kick in. It doesn't deviate too much from the original but is shorter and features a new bridge sung by Akon.<br /><br />\\"Beat it\\" has been remixed pointlessly and features a Fergie duet with Michael. I say pointlessly as it doesn't deviate too much from the original, although the guitar riffs have been turned around a bit. I was rather worried about how \\"Billie Jean\\" (my favourite MJ song ever, and the moonwalking marvel) would turn out. Remixed by Kanye West, it features hard hitting beats (similar to those on Kanye's \\"Gold digger\\"), and a more stripped down sound with that famous bassline taken out and the strings pushed to the fore. Unlike the other remixes, the vocals are mostly Michael's (Kanye appears fleetingly), and it still manages to sound like the original.<br /><br />Last remix is \\"P.Y.T\\" by will.i.am (who also raps on it). Like \\"The girl is mine\\", this is another total transformation with elements of Billie Jean thrown in, a scratchy bass line, and re-sung by Michael with some new lyrics. Nice. It seems will.i.am was the only one not too intimated by the herculean task of breathing new life into these classics.<br /><br />The CD booklet comes with lyrics and loads of photos, quite a few of which were previously unseen.<br /><br />There you have it. It is nice to have these alternate versions which some might like and others will loathe. Still proving that Michael is a potent musical force, the album sold over 100,000 copies in its first week, just behind the week's #1 selling album, Jack Johnson's \\"Sleep through the static\\".ng beats (similar to those on Kanye's \\"Gold digger\\"), and a more stripped down sound with that famous bassline taken out and the strings pushed to the fore.

1592533868|5.0|This book is great.  I have several quilling books and love it when I get one that actually teaches something different.  It has several different projects with full instructions.  This is definitely a book that every quiller should have.
1405006021|5.0|This book is fantastic! My son absolutely loves this story and we read it every night before going to bed. The story is about the monkey who loses his mom. His friend, the butterfly, offers to help monkey find his mother. The butterfly asks the monkey to describe his mother and for every description, leads the monkey to an animal-unfortunately not his mother but another animal-the elephant, the spider, the bat, the parrot, the snake, the frog etc...all based on the descriptions the monkey gives. Turns out that he doesnt know monkey's mother looks like monkey, because his own children dont look like him, i.e. caterpillars. The premise of the story is brilliant, analytical and makes complete sense. The illustrations are beautiful and vivid, the text rhymes and is just the right amount each page for my toddler. I truly enjoy reading this book to him just as much as he enjoys going through the search for monkey's mom. This one is a real winner. I am very picky about the books my son reads- I need them to be interesting, fun, educational, well-illustrated and just long enough to keep his attention. This one meets all those criteria.  I actually think this one is better than The Gruffalo, the other book written by this author that won the Smarties award.
B000088DSQ|5.0|I certainly had high expectations for this set of Beethoven piano concertos, even before I had actually purchased the discs. I've always admired Harnoncourt's monumental Beethoven symphony cycle from the early 1990's with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, so I knew what grand interpreters of LVB's music the maestro & the ECO can be.  The question mark for me was pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard. Being unfamiliar with his playing, I decided to rely on the glowing reviews this set had received, along with my admiration for conductor and orchestra, to help me make my choice. I couldn't be more happy with the result. Aimard, together with Nikolaus Harnoncourt & the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, is absolutely terrific on this 3-cd Beethoven set from Warner Classics. This is a captivating musical collaboration that well deserves the accolades it has garnered.<br /> While I fully expected great things from Harnoncourt & the COE, Pierre-Laurent Aimard has been a welcomed new find for me. His playing in these concertos is wonderfully expressive. He handles the most demanding of solo passages with great aplomb, marking himself as a Beethoven pianist of exceptional virtuosity and depth. These are performances that do not disappoint, comparing quite well with several of my favorite complete concerto cycles, including Perahia/Haitink, Fleisher/Szell and Barenboim/Klemperer.<br />The Warner Classics digital sound is also quite good in these recordings, further making this collection a worthy choice for Beethoven afficianados. With exceptional performances from both soloist & orchestra, as well as first rate sound, this set will be a win/win addition to your LVB library, so by all means, indulge!

B000YIGNKE|4.0|to highly esteem this adaptation of Persuasion. My only prior experience with Persuasion was the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which at the time I found rather boring, and because I hadn't read the novel, somewhat hard to follow. Also, Ciaran Hinds isn't my idea of a leading man, although I liked him as Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre. He \\"is tolerable I suppose, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"    I do enjoy British period drama and was pleased that PBS would be airing a number of remakes of the classics. When I watched this most recent version of Persuasion on Masterpiece, my reactions were similar to some of the negative reviewers who commented on the camera work, especially the way \\"Anne\\" looked directly at the audience.    However, based on the positive reviews which mentioned that the DVD contained scenes not included in the PBS version, I decided to buy it. I have watched it a number of times, and it certainly improves with further viewing. I enjoy Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones as Anne and Captain Wentworth. Their performances are subtle and moving, and most of the other actors are agreeable as well. I especially enjoy the music which highlights the particularly emotional scenes.    I have since read the novel and rewatched the 1995 version and have come to appreciate this newest adaptation for what it is. Although not wholly faithful to the novel or the mores of the time, it stands on its own merit as an enjoyable story about being given a second chance at love.
B00000K3CM|3.0|I would agree with most of the reviews already posted.  However, one must realize this movie was released in 1999.  It is very haunting because the World Trade Center encompasses an entire scene, where Macauley Culkin's character goes up to the viewing platform and looks down on the city.  Very, very sad.  Makes 9/11 seem so surreal.    Also, for young children, this movie can be scary for another reason:  they are afraid that they too might be abandonded by their parents.  Our youngest son was about five at the time and we had to reassure him that he would never, ever be forgotten or abandoned.    For older kids, they see the slapstick comedy of the bad guys and don't realize that this brand of humor can hurt.  Our older boy who was about eight at the time went through a few days of pummeling his little brother in one way or another.    Other than these issues, it was a typical kid movie that was fun and predictable.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I had already read the book several months ago, and was not very happy to be watching the movie for a college class. The book was interesting, but a tad dry, and all I could picture of the movie was one long, boring lecture. How wrong I was!<br /><br />The movie is basically a film showing Al Gore presenting his slide show to audiences, interspersed with personal information about why he chose to undertake global warming as a project. Instead of this being a boring lecture, it actually is quite interesting and Mr. Gore has a great sense of humor. There were several animated shorts included, which helped to demonstrate the concepts that were being presented.<br /><br />The science is basically sound, although there are several places where the science presented is now obsolete. Even though the film is only two years old, the science is moving so quickly that it would be hard to keep it fully up to date. It is, however, a good primer on the science behind global warming and how scientists became interested in the subject to begin with.<br /><br />While hardly the end all of global warming science, the movie is well done and provides for a base understanding of the subject. It is perfect viewing for those with little background in science that want to get a handle on the subject.
0810994739|5.0|My son, Chad loves this series of books relating the misadventures of Greg and his older brother, Roderick. I have been encouraging him to read more, and so, I was extremely excited when he wanted to read the sequel to his well loved book, Diary of a Wimpy Kid. He felt the book was hilarious. Some of the situations (hint: swim shorts) left him laughing so hard that his sides hurt. The entire novel was about how Greg survived the summer, which was one big misadventure after another, all the while wanting to have a closer relationship with his older brother. We both hope that the Author, Jeff Kinney continues to write Wimpy Kid novels. We love them and look forward to the next one.
B000ZK4466|1.0|This cd sounds like Rush  (The singing and drums) meets Yes , does anyone else see this or are most of you to young to hear this ??? The sound is dense and there some great riffs and a couple of very , very  good tracks , the no break between tracks goes with the theme , however if that is the case several of these tunes should be shorter all the tracks (except 2 ) clock in at over 5 minutes , Now you have to remember I opened by saying the band Yes ,so I know what long sounds like ,... What I would do  would be to down load track 3, 5, and 11 and there you have it spend 3-4 dollars and not full price ....But it is your money throw it away however you wish....

0201721481|5.0|yeah, may be it's primer, but it's definitely not the book to start learning about programming on the whole and about C++ in particular, because as I can see authors sometimes make assumptions they shouldn't have made (all of them are in the first part of the book). And for such a misleading title I should've given it 4 stars , but I can't.<br />Pick up  \\"C++ Primer Plus\\" by Stephen Prata as first programming book, as one of reviewers has already mentioned. I should say, that if I read this book instead of Prata's, I'd tear it to shreds and curse the authors (kidding).<br />Plus I think the reader should take some time programming or looking at other people's code before reading this book, because only in this case 'notes' and 'key concepts' put in this book can be appreciated (the beginner just wouldn't consider them important and therefore wouldn't remember).
6305308659|5.0|Words pretty much fail me in describing this exquisite film: its beauty and  sensitivity; its superb cinematography and direction; its perfect cast and their virtually perfect performances; and its INTELLIGENCE.  Keep your hankie nearby.
B00005ASOI|1.0|Has classic problem of a filmmaker who thinks in still images not motion. Great picture ideas somehow try to come to life as motion but hardly do. Weak story lacking flow and complexity. A classic example of a boring B- - movie but made in Europe so it is supposed to be brilliant but is a bore. See Jean Cocteau's Orpheus 1950 to get the real effect of a slow but great Euro movie.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Having read some of the negative reviews, I couldn't understand where some of these folks were coming from.  This is a fairy tale for goodness sakes.  And although some facts are wrong and a few other minor things, it's a MOVIE....and once again a FAIRY TALE.  Liberties can be taken.  I've watched this many times before I plunked down my cash and don't regret it one bit.  It is a great, entertaining story, with excellent actors, a very nicly done story line and sets.  The only fault I can find with this is that it ends.
B000001ELR|5.0|Coming off of the not so popular (MUSIC FROM) THE ELDER, KISS created CREATURES OF THE NIGHT. This album was the beginning of KISS' return to the rock world. With the thunderous drumming of ERIC CARR and the strong guitars and writing made this album stand up right next to alot of other albums. Paul Stanley's vocals on I STILL LOVE YOU are just incredible. I feel this album just wasn't given the praise and attention it deserved.    Stand out tracks are Creatures of the Night, Keep me Comin' and I Love it loud.
B000MTFFZY|5.0|I discovered Delain by accident, but I was intrigued that it was started by Martijn Westerholt, the brother of Within Temptation co-founder Robert Westerholt. I'm definitely getting some WT vibes from it, which I happen to love, so that's good. But the truly refreshing part of Delain, besides the phenomenal and rockin' composition, is the voice of Charlotte Wessels. It's completely pleasing to listen to, but it is as fully capable of being powerful as it is being beautiful. Her range is effortlessly wide, though she never veers into the \\"opera\\" territory that is so widely used in the symphonic metal territory. There are many guest musicians on here, and it was a pleasant surprise to hear so many familiar voices. This debut album of Delain's is in my opinion, practically perfect.    1. \\"Sever\\" - An amazing opener to this incredible album. It starts off with an orchestral intro, then the inimitable Charlotte Wessels enters, followed by Marco Hiatala of Nightwish and a fantastically epic choir.    2. \\"Frozen\\" - The first single; it begins with some haunting bells, and then the guitars enter. The chorus is extremely catchy, with a continuous \\"answer me\\" getting stuck in one's head. The choir provides a stunningly beautiful bridge, followed by a stand-out guitar solo.    3. \\"Silhouette of a Dancer\\" - This one scared the heck out of me the first time I listened to it, but now I think it rocks. I was taken aback by the intensely sinister vocals of George Oosthoek, who growls menacingly yet adeptly opposite Charlotte's vocals. Not to be missed!    4. \\"No Compliance\\" - This song is entirely sung by Sharon den Adel of Within Temptation and Marco. It's pretty dark, and I think it's slowly growing on me. Initially I wasn't too sure what to make of it, because my first listen didn't really meet my expectations. I was willing to give it a chance, though, and it is a rather good song, just perhaps not as strong as others on the album.    5. \\"See Me in Shadow\\" - Second single; LivKristine of Leaves' Eyes accompanies Charlotte, and her light vocals help make the song as melancholy and achingly beautiful as it is.    6. \\"Shattered\\" - This song features Charlotte creating beautiful backing vocals for the choruses. It is very energetic and catchy, and would probably be a great song to listen to while working out.    7. \\"The Gathering\\" - I cannot get this song out of my head; it's absolutely infectious. Marco's voice blends so well with Charlotte's in this one, and the whole atmosphere seems almost like folk music.    8. \\"Daylight Lucidity\\" - Charlotte creates some gorgeous harmonies with herself in the chorus, then Marco and the epic choir join in once again.    9. \\"Sleepwalker's Dream\\" - My personal favorite, and the song that got me hooked onto Delain. The intro features some fantastic orchestral work, and then leads into an energetic chorus that features Charlotte reaching some stunningly beautiful and crystal-pure high notes. I never get tired of hearing them.    10. \\"Day for Ghosts\\" - Marco and Liv Kristine once again take charge for this song. It begins with a creepy piano solo that escalates into a burst of overwhelming orchestral and vocal glory. The intensity doesn't let up either, as the choir joins in to echo the vocal lines of Liv.    11.\\"Pristine\\" - The stunning finale. It's epic with the choir, haunting with the instrumentation, creepy with Oosthoek's voice returning, and beautiful with Charlotte's voice and harmonies.    12. \\"(Deep) Frozen\\" (Bonus track) - This seems to be a sister song to \\"Frozen,\\" or at least an alternative version. Oosthoek is here once again on the choruses, creating a much more sinister tone than its counterpart. Yet, this recycled material still manages to seem original, which can only be attributed to Delain's brilliant musicianship.    Adding this masterpiece of an album to your collection is sure to leave you more than satisfied. You won't be disappointed!
B00005AXLB|5.0|Ignore all those who fail to see the pure charm of this classic fourth feature film from Walt Disney. Racist theme? GET REAL! This is a joyful experience from start to finish with some impressive animation and wonderful music and songs. Love that choo-choo train, the boisterous pink elephant sequence, and of course the poignant Baby Mine. This was released over 65 years ago and still captures the attention of today's youngsters and adults alike. I've watched this countless times over the years (it's only 64 minutes), and find it gets better each time. The bonus features on the DVD features a new music video of Baby Mine and other fun stuff.
0765350386|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a fantasy novel that has made me skip a day at work. But Mistborn TFE has made me do just that, while reading the last 200 or so pages. Simply couldn't put it down.  The world Sanderson has created is bizar and totally believable at the same time. The magic system is so well thought-out that parts of it could serve to explain Newtonian physics in highschool. And for me as a chemist (and toxicologist) the idea of ingesting metals as a way of gaining magical power is simply marvellous. The remark that one needs to burn of the metals periodically in order to avoid them becoming toxic is just one of the little gems in the story.

1401207138|5.0|The Watchmen is a very detailed and deep work. The characters are very interesting, and realistic. The book also touches on many issues including nuclear war, homosexuality, rape, violence, love, and the meaning of life. Not bad for a comic book. Alan Moore is a very interesting person, and a great writer!
B000ZLFALI|2.0|While I give Julie Taymor a lot of credit for her gorgeous visual sense (The Lion King on Broadway, [[ASIN:B000E6ESKS Titus]]), this movie falls flat in most other senses, for which I can't really blame her. Trying to warp any kind of story to fit into such a huge list of songs is a challenge, and unfortunately, most of the plot and relationships between characters are ignored in favor of getting as much Beatles-per-minute in there as possible.<br /><br />The singing isn't terribly inspired, but I could forgive that if the characters were at all human; instead, everyone in this script is a caricature with 5 minutes' worth of background sketched in, and this is supposed to make the audience care about them. Most of the characters feel a lot like the cast of [[ASIN:B000E1YW0E Rent (Fullscreen)]], only less likeable. Even the part I was most looking forward to, a cameo by Eddie Izzard ([[ASIN:B00003CWOU Dress to Kill]]) as Mr. Kite, felt like an embarrassment to the actor. It's kind of sad that I was starting to really dislike some Beatles songs after listening to the covers in the movie, when I've enjoyed them all my life.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|Very excited @ first, my enthusiasm landed lower because of the difference with the CD version.

B0013D8LOK|5.0|Tim Burton: Hollywood's undisputed champion of gothic horror.<br />Sweeney Todd: a psycho barber and famous purveyor of dodgy pies.<br />Hmmmm... what took you so long?<br /><br />It was screamingly obvious what a gorgeous team they would make. Rarely have we seen a film director so perfectly matched to a musical. And the black magic begins when Johnny Depp's white-faced Sweeney steals up the Thames at the dead of night. As the boat slips under a spooky London Bridge it becomes quite clear that Burton was put on earth to shoot this glorious melodrama.<br /><br />The film unfolds like the Grimmest of fairy tales. Depp's bitter Sweeney returns to London after 15 years of hurt. His painful story emerges in hollow songs with haunting off-key melodies. He wears his grievances like armour. His plan to murder the men who condemned him to a penal colony in order to rape his wife hinges around the dismal apartment above Mrs Lovett's ailing pie shop. The atmosphere is vintage Hammer Studios. The gleaming monochrome shots of cobbled streets are drained of color. Effectively overwrought and excellent, Sweeney Todd is a movie of bombastic, impossible camera moves and rhapsodic yuckiness. Burton can't resist filling the screen with scuttling vermin or surges of splatterific violence.<br /><br />Depp's Sweeney is a fiery-eyed, razor-brandishing cadaver with a mad Pagliacci glare. Bonham Carter is comparably corpse-like--a matched composition in bird-nest hairdo, death-pallor complexion, and heavily shadowed eyes. The musical chemistry between Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's genial cockney pie shop mistress is terrific. Sondheim approved the casting, and, surprisingly, Depp has a pleasing, if untrained, tenor. Alongside Bonham Carter's sweetly tentative voice, the numbers are inventively staged. Especially the cannibal waltz \\"A Little Priest\\" and the grotesquely wistful \\"By the Sea\\". Lovett's unreciprocated passion for Sweeney is the heart of the film and her bright idea of stuffing Sweeney's clients into meat pies seems almost perfectly sensible under the circumstances.<br /><br />The film's pace is a surprise. Burton has pruned Sondheim's arias to fit the tempo of a real thriller -- brilliant editing - and the villains are far less stocky. Yes, the ghoulishly attractive couple is supported by a suitable gang of gargoyles; Sacha Baron Cohen delivers a priceless cameo as a jealous unisex rival with plans to blackmail Sweeney. Alan Rickman is a sinister pleasure as Judge Turpin. And Timothy Spall is equally effective as his ultra-violent slithery enforcer, Beadle Bamford.<br /><br />Burton has never been one to spare the gore. The sound of skulls cracking open when Sweeney tosses his victims head first into the basement is not for the faint-of-heart. The director's knack of finding comedy in these ghastly scenes is tested to the limit. And the haunting final shot of the film, the details of which we must keep to ourselves so not to spoil the plot, is a masterful shot, painterly in its composition of framing, detail, and color.<br /><br />There is so much that can be said about Sweeney Todd, but we must insist that you stop reading and simply experience this wonderous film for yourself. A mad serial killer, a helpful, adoring woman, a vile judge, and a barber's chair - all elements that combine to form much more than this simple review can encapsulate. It is masterful cinema, art and entertainment, vision and sound combined for a truly riveting experience.at pies seems almost perfectly sensible under the circumstances.

B000I2JDEY|5.0|As the tagline states, \\"You are cordially invited to George and Martha's for a night of fun and games.\\" Fun, indeed! This is one of the best films ever made, in my opinion, and one of the best directorial debuts ever - courtesy of Mike Nichols. Controversial for it's time because of it's refusal to water down any of the adult elements of Edward Albee's play - it is a riveting character study featuring excellent performances from the entire cast. The dialogue is to die for! Both horrifying and hilarious, this should be required viewing for every film buff.    Something that may be of interest to fans of the film, is that Warner Brothers released a deluxe, 2 LP set of the entire film's dialogue. It's an awesome set, and perfect for those moments when you just want to hear George and Martha tear each other to shreds. It's rare, but if you can find it, purchase it. I am glad to say that I own one!
B000YENUI6|5.0|Eastern Promises was one of the films I wanted to get my hands on as soon as possible. Not merely because of the director but of the stellar cast he managed to sign on. I watched the film several times to make sure I got every little detail. Let's start with Viggo Mortensen's character Nikolai, a rather mysterious person at first sight. The scene in which he extinguishes a cigarette on his tongue promised much fiercer brutality to come making amendments to a corpse that got in the way of a Russian mafia prince played by Vincent Cassel. And this was just for starters. The story begins with an apparently Russian teenager appearing in a pharmacy asking for help in broken English only to break down in a sea of blood. In the next scene she gives birth to a baby girl and dies shortly afterwards. Midwife Anna of Russian heritage assists the birth in a North London hospital and takes it on herself to find out more about the girl and her family. What she does not understand is that a visit to a Russian restaurant takes her right into the very heart of a criminal dynasty of Russian mafia controlling their business from there. Armin Mueller-Stahl delivers a brilliant performance as mafia king Semyon who changes colours like a chameleon, appearing as a loving patriarch, brutal father and icecold killer with all the charm required. Nikolai's role is to be submissive to his protege's every whimp and he does so with utter discretion and testing of the limits of his role. Vincent Cassel brings Kirill to life as only he can with the right amount of zero tolerance, sadistic tendencies and the urge to overthrow his father to become the big boss himself. Anna unconsciously crosses ways with Nikolai when she delivers the diary of the teenage girl written in Russian to Semyon only to find out too late that she has made herself and her family vulnerable to  him. Her uncle Stepan translates the diary too and unravels a story of promises of a better life in London only to end in a brothel and drug abuse thanks to the Russian mafia clan. Suddenly forced by threats of Semyon to destroy Anna or her family, Nikolai has no choice but changing directions and loyalties from Kirill to Semyon in a deadly game to protect Anna and himself from being exposed of his true motive to serve the clan. Eastern Promises is a shining example of how great a mainstream mystery thriller can be.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|One of the most enjoyable films of the 1980's, \\"Tootsie\\" remains as good today as it was 20 years ago. I won't reiterate what otherfolks have said about it here, because all the praise that this movie has received from the other reviewers is justly deserved.    However, one thing I have never understood is the way this movie was and was not lauded at the time. It was up against 2 other films at the time. While \\"Ghandi\\" was certainly a superb epic and probably deserved best picture, I will never understand how Ben Kingsley won for best actor over Hoffman. Kingsley could just look at old newsreels to \\"get\\" his character right. Hoffman had to literally create the Dorothy Michaels character out of nothing but the written word...a much greater challenge for an actor and frankly a performance more deserving of an Oscar. I should also mention that I thought Julie Andrews's performance in \\"Victor/Victoria\\" was better than Kingsley's as well.     Secondly, I have also never figured out why Geena Davis got best supporting actress. Did people confuse her with Teri Garr (whose performance was much better, richer, and more developed) because the 2 actresses were in the same movie? I can only think of a couple of scenes in which Davis even appeared in the film and none of the scenes are particularly memorable.    There were also many other actresses up for this award from other films. Leslie Ann Warren's performance as the mobster's girlfriend is the one that most comes to mind. One wonders who was sleeping with who to even consider Davis for the nomination.    Nevertheless, \\"Tootsie\\" did receive its share of awards (Golden Globe, People's Choice, etc.) It just seems like it was unfairly cheated out of many accolades by the Academy.

1596912855|3.0|I'm a fan of Jane Austen and I have to admit Mr. Darcy has always made my heart flutter though I'll never desert Charlotte Bronte's Mr. Rochester for him.  So I was interested to read this book in which a thirty something single NYC career girl whose favorite dream man is Fitzwilliam Darcy (hero of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) travels to \\"Pembrook Park\\", a sort of fantasy theme park for Jane Austen obsessed fans. Here visitors pay big bucks to dress up and acts like they were living in Regency times and interact with actors paid to help fulfill their romantic fantasies.    The heroine of the book, conveniently named Jane, receives her gift of a visit courtesy of a wealthy aunt's will.   Apparently Jane has had a series of disastrous relationships or in most cases near relationships with a variety of men most of whom from their descriptions apparently were either wrong for her or broke her heart.  This makes the premise behind the book that Jane can't find true love because she compares all men to the fictional Darcy seem false. The book is quick and easy to read and suffice it to say the ending does not come as a surprise.
6305718954|5.0|This is a great movie about possession and religious theory.  It makes you think and the casting is great.  Unless you are a bible-thumper or someone with a stick in your you know what, you'll enjoy this movie.  It's one of my favorites!
0525950079|5.0|If you enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, I think you will enjoy World without End.  The style, drama and historical context is the same.  The time period is 200 years after Pillars and covers the period of the Bubonic Plague which  adds an extra element of historical drama to the saga.  If you haven't read Pillars, this book can stand on its own...but I'd still recommend reading Pillars first as the heroes of that story are referenced throughout World Without End.
B0010ZR160|4.0|When I first realized that Gone Baby Gone was a great film was that I got so swept up in the film that I literally forgot this film was brought to you by the guy who starred in \\"Gigli\\" and \\"Daredevil\\", the former being one of the worst films of not only his career but in cinema in general. While generally I'm not a big fan of these kind of films that seemed like their eye was on an Oscar rather than being a good film, I have to admit I quite liked his directorial debut. There's a couple of issues I have with the story itself but other than that, this is a film that's not as pretentious as others and not as flawed as many.    When little girl Amanda McCready is abducted from her home, the case becomes a Boston public event as people crowd her mother Helene's house and doesn't draw in private investigators/couple Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennero until Amanda's aunt goes to them and requests additional help, namely getting answers from locals who don't like talking to cops. With the help of captain Jack Doyle and detectives Remy Bressant and Nick Poole, Patrick and Angie find there's more to the case than was initially known and also a major moral uncertainty as well.    The film was adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane who also wrote Mystic River but where I felt Clint Eastwood failed, Afflect succeeds but doesn't quite perfect the story's fault. In all honesty, I always felt Mystic River was overwrought and almost emotionally manipulative as the film almost tried anything and everything to make sure you walk out of the film completely moved and crying your eyes out. While Gone Baby Gone still does have some faults, it's better handled and more personal and realistic. The film does have some red herrings and some character twists that I felt were straight out of a TV drama's handbook but I got so into it, I didn't even notice or care at first.    These kind of films are more about acting than flashy stuff or comedic routines and Casey Affleck, known many for being a supporting character, finally shows some lead acting chops playing Patrick who constantly struggles if being morally right all the time is a good thing. While he does have what I call the William Hurt syndrome (read: a dull-sounding speaking voice) he's an interesting character to watch, as well as Amy Adams who plays one of the worst examples of a mother who simply loves her kids too much yet irresponsible to actually be a good mother. While she's a nice sight to see, Michelle Monaghan is both given not much to do and seems too cute and \\"innocent\\" for Boston's profanity-laced neighborhoods.    While I wouldn't buy it (though wouldn't mind if it was a gift), I'd very much recommend Gone Baby Gone to anyone who wants a film that's just a good film rather than a film that thinks it is.
B00104QSOM|5.0|The story is unique. The direction stands alone. The acting is riveting. The movie clocks over 2 1/2 hours in length. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a drama. It is not an action film or a horror film, though, some horrific things do occur in the story. The foundation of the film is Upton Sinclair's great book \\"Oil!\\" and Sinclair's writing ability shines through in the dialogue. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" happens to you when you allow yourself to be visionally transfixed in an era gone by, when Jonny Greenwood's soundtrack pierces your soul and takes the whole film experience to an intensity that is sure to leave you thinking about it long after you've finished viewing. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" has a trotting pace with turns that may shock you. If you are looking for a fast-paced story, this movie is not for you. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a gem.
B0001VV1GK|4.0|I just purchased this for my son who is 19 months old. He really likes it but a corner of the garage needed to be glued down. I figured it wasn't worth returning for a slight problem. Just beware that although the photo shows a road at the base of the garage, it doesn't come with the set.  I thought it came with the road system and my son could have a track to move his cars around. I found that to be a little deceiving. I just think it is a little pricey for coming with a slight defect and no road system.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've read the novel repeatedly and love Bronte's vision of a bond between these two that's both desperate and seemingly hopeless, and finally so inevitable.  I have also read many (MANY) of the reviews here and elsewhere, and want to counter some of the criticisms because this was a gorgeously intelligently done adaptation.  The book's dialog is beautifully suited to the form of a novel, and Bronte's skill allows the reader to be taken up in it without any impression of awkwardness.  But honestly do we really think that's how people spoke at the time?  That the act of conversing has changed so much?  I grant more of it could have been kept in had time allowed, but it did not seem to me so much `dumbed down', as some have said, as it was made more manageable for staging.    The only misstep as far as I could tell was the decision to fit into four hours what should have been given five or six.  It meant some tough choices about what to include and what to leave out, and how to give enough space for the dynamic exchanges essential to the dramatic development of the theme.  Given that, the choice to abbreviate Jane's childhood was reasonable, and there were enough vivid scenes to illustrate just how harsh it was, how little nourishment of any kind she was given.  Though there was little fleshing out of the Helen Burns relationship, the meaning and impact of her loss to Jane was clear.    I thought Ruth Wilson's looks were exactly right - she was NOT classically beautiful and the contrast between her and the actress playing Blanche Ingram made it obvious why Jane considered herself plain.  But she had health, youth and a lovely spirit that between them perfectly explained why Rochester would be so drawn to her.  Wilson's whole package of voice, timing, facial and body language all went to an utterly natural inhabitation of the role that was simply brilliant and compelling.      Toby Stephens as Rochester was admittedly drool-worthy.  Some reactions say he's too young, but his age was spot on - the actor was 38 when this was filmed, and the math in the book suggests he should be between 38 and 40.  Lighting, makeup and Stephens' scowling gruffness at first make him believably un-luscious.  Then the progression of his softening and increasing lightness due to Jane's influence on him make it unsurprising for him to become more appealing as the story moves forward.  His overall dark and charismatic portrayal of Rochester as a tormented but not insensitive soul is captivating, as his struggle grows increasingly accessible and understandable to her, and to us.      I'm completely baffled by the reviewers who say they preferred the '83 version.  The Dalton take on Rochester was too violently unpleasant and manipulative to evoke any sympathy, so that when the scene called for him to suddenly be tender or romantic I just really wished he wouldn't.  Describing him as plain old abusive wouldn't be much of a stretch.   And if Stephens is too good looking, what is Dalton? Clarke's Jane was profoundly lifeless and muffled, and the few scenes where she's not are so exaggeratedly the other end of the spectrum that they seem painfully forced.  Worst was the complete lack of chemistry between the two.    This more updated production was gripping and deeply moving; when Rochester tears around his house desperately hollering, looking for Jane; when she breaks into sobs after the flashbacks.  I get actual goosebumps every time I watch the scene where she supernaturally hears him calling out for her.  The degree of physical intimacy between the leads did not at all detract from the image of Jane as the devout self-respecting and deeply goodhearted girl that she was.  If anything, portraying the extreme seductiveness of his persuasions, and her sad but resolute tenderness in the face of them, only amplified how well she knew what was sacrificed in holding to her convictions.      I do wish the makers had planned and budgeted for a slightly longer production.  A little more of the dialog detail Bronte wrote would have been nice, although there were numerous places where it was taken verbatim from the book.  Also, a bit more play time would have allowed better development of the complexity and depth in Jane's relationship with St. John Rivers.  The time constraints clearly didn't leave room for it, but it was unfortunate to miss such an important element.  There was much in this section of the book to reveal her state of mind and heart leading up to the conclusion.  Regardless, this was truly a superb piece of work, and by far the finest done yet of the captivating classic tale.  Don't miss it.
B0011HOEYY|4.0|Despite the fact I like Blade Runner and Alien, I always found Ridley Scott's career rather spotty. Known not sticking to the same genre, there's times where he'll offer an interesting film, other times he misses the ball severely and others will outright praise a film that really had little to go for it. That's where I always find fault with his films, especially current ones: they're directed with such gusto and flair and outright spectacle at times that whatever story there is gets excused since it's got an \\"epic\\" story thanks to the visuals. American Gangster doesn't have the huge visuals but it's long with lots of speaking roles and is one of those kind of films where it'll entertain you in spots and divide in others.    After Bumpy Johnson dies, his right-hand man Frank Lucas takes up his mantel but does things a little differently this time. Rather than buying heroin from the Mafia, Lucas goes straight to the source in Southeast Asia, strikes a deal which cuts down on costs and thanks to Lucas' low price, it becomes a smash in Harlem though there's more overdoses thanks to the heroin's purity. Keeping family members involved and considerably well looked after, Lucas rises to the top of the drug underworld.    On the other side of the law, Richie Roberts is an almost too-honest cop more well known for reporting near a million in unmarked bills than his cop work. With his personal life not as strong and cops not wanting to work with him because of his anti-corruption views, he eventually joins a drug task force designed to go after the big suppliers and players as opposed to small-town dealers. Unbeknownest to him, Lucas is the man to go after but how can you catch someone that doesn't even stand out in the crowd?    I'm at that age finally where I can appreciate the more longer, character-driven films where emphasis is placed more on acting and pacing as opposed to getting the story over and done with (Seven Samurai, despite being over 3 hours, never feels it)but on occasion, a film comes out that, while not long as any others, still feels like trimming could've benefited the film. Like Kingdom of Heaven, it's not a film long because of so much twists and turns but rather just seeing character's lives and who they are. There's times where the story gets really fascinating and you get caught up in it but then others, you're looking at the running time and find only an hour has passed. It doesn't add anything to the genre or even does what it does the best, but it's probably hard film to walk out on as well.    It's hard to deny that American Gangster is similar to other crime dramas but one that pops up is Heat with a look at both sides who are just as adept at what they do rather than good guy is good, bad guy evil. But whereas Robert De Niro's side is more interesting in that film, here the film is more on the good side since he's just as likable and interesting as a character and although Russell Crowe is quickly becoming like Martin Scorsese's own De Niro...(oh yeah, he doesn't use him anymore, more like DiCaprio), he does deliver a good performance. One that's disappointing is Denzel Washington since, despite having a strong screen presence, he's just not that interesting a character and seems more like his Training Day role part two.    Like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven as well as the phenomenal Blade Runner release recently, Scott loves the big DVD's with tons of features. With the original as well as the extended cut along with several featurettes, it's an interesting look at the film that's just memorable enough to recommend but not enough to absolutely love.
B000068IEU|2.0|I lived in a \\"last house on the left\\" when I was a kid, and was a huge horror movie fan, so this movie always interested me. I rediscovered it as an adult, but it took almost a year to get the nerve to watch it because I had always heard about the intense rape and torture scenes that are in this film. Maybe because I have already seen movies like \\"The Accused\\", as well as lots of horror films, but there was nothing really that shocking in this movie.<br /><br />Well, what was shocking, considering what a cult following this movie has, is how BAD the first half of it is. I'm not kidding. Poor film quality. Really bad acting, stupid beyond belief characters, bad dialog (the part where Mari tells her friend about how her breasts have grown was particularly laughable and could only have been written by a man).<br /><br />The second half of the movie, when the parents find out and start to exact their revenge is pretty good. The characters all seem to \\"come alive\\" and find their purpose. The mother's revenge is pretty awesome and so is the father chasing Krug around with the chainsaw. The introduction by Wes Craven was a nice touch and some of the extras about the movie when it first came out were pretty cool, especially for someone who was not even alive at the time this came out. If you're a big horror fan, then by all means you should probably see this movie. If not, I wouldn't bother.
B000P12LWY|2.0|Personally, I could care less about historical accuracy. If I wanted a history lesson, I would get a book or watch a documentary on the History Channel. When I watch something like the Tudors or HBO's Rome, I want to be entertained first and foremost.     HBO's Rome was great entertainment. They were able to add unexpected plot twists and high drama while remaining true to the historical outcomes.  They often went over-the-top in depicting scenes from Ancient Rome that seemed shocking but nevertheless plausible. More importantly, even though I knew what the outcome was going to be, I still wanted to watch because I wanted to see how Rome would tell the story.    The Tudors doesn't even seem to be trying to entertain anyone. I feel like I'm watching a retelling of period politics with modern actors. All the performances are bland. Even the veteran actors like Sam Neil can't seem to make me like or dislike his character. It's like watching a puppet show. At this point, I already know how the story ends, and The Tudors interpretation of it is not interesting enough to keep me watching.

I'd have liked to have seen more of them through out  the film (but it was mostly about Cloud). The second disk was junk. Could have had a second movie/all kinds of goodies. Instead, bits & piece like a few deleted scenes etc. Well at least it was \\"Final Fantasy,\\" unlike that crappy Spirits Within. A.C. just left me wanting more, but the visuals/action/voice acting were A+.
B00102F5WK|2.0|Why can't I watch a movie and not be inundated with the views of others?  This movie laid its cards down since the word action.  Its whole intent was to object to the actions of the government in the post 9/11 world.  It had some promise but it stayed true to its message and made a villain out of everyone but a victim that was manufactured by writers.  I want the politics to end. If it is going to take a Democrat in office then get it over with.  I want my movies, TV, and other forms of entertainment back from the overwhelming support of those with money in Hollywood.  If they agree with something they sure want to make sure everyone on this continent agrees.  I am not saying I disagree, but c'mon!  Please make a good movie or show for once.  I am tired of this!!!!  Why must we continue to battle each other!!!  We are all Americans!!!!!!!!

B0002CH8C4|5.0|This \\"Tosca\\" is a pure joy for the eyes and the ears. Daniella Dessi, Fabio Armiliato, and Ruggero Raimondi form the cast of fascinating principal characters. Director Nuria Espert has created an original environment where power, love, desire, and revenge intertwine in many ways. Dessi's Tosca is a true Diva--simultaneously flirtacious and somewhat enchanted by Scarpia. Armiliato's Cavaradossi is a sunny soul with a good heart and lots of love for the Diva. Baron Scarpia is brilliantly portrayed by Raimondi whose magnetic presence is felt in even the smallest of sounds and exchanges. His Scarpia is a powerful man, reserved and yet sensual, highly emotional and torn by contradictions.  The chemistry between the characters is palpable and present in every word and gesture, which makes this \\"Tosca\\" one of the most exciting and beautiful experiences you can have.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Despite critical acclaim, many fans of the show are rather harsh in appraising the film, for two reasons - one, the singing and two, the deletion of about half the score.  I am in neither camp, although either of these factors might previously have caused me to pronounce most film adaptations of almost any Broadway musical a failure.  Instead, I am thrilled with this production far beyond expectations.<br /><br />This may not have been, if I had not had so much respect for Stephen Sondheim.  During pre-release publicity, he granted an unusual (for him) number of interviews, stating he is unequivocally satisfied with Tim Burton's vision.  As anyone who appreciates his high level of artistic integrity knows, Mr. Sondheim would not give praise to this project if he were not satisfied.  Stephen Sondheim is considered by many to be the greatest composer in the American theatre, and I have followed him long enough to know that he would not declare his endorsement if he were not truly happy with the finished film.<br /><br />I have listened carefully to Mr. Sondheim in those recent interviews, and finally understand why so many film versions of stage musicals haven't worked.  Time passes very differently in live theatre than it does on film; musical numbers, which pass rather quickly on stage, are apt to seem like a small eternity on screen.  Therefore, the very thing that attracts live theatre audiences is apt to make many movie audiences run screaming from the auditorium.  And there is also the problem of what Alfred Hitchcock once termed \\"suspension of disbelief\\"; in real life, no one ever bursts into song during one of life's dramatic moments, no less accompanied by a full orchestra.  For some reason, moviegoers who have no problem with giant gorillas or men from Mars find singing on celluloid hard to take.  Thanks to some of the theories recently voiced by Mr. Sondheim, I finally understand why so many previous attempts to film Broadway musicals fail.  In short, the theatre and film are two entirely different mediums, with two entirely different audiences.  Although many theatre lovers would be happy to see almost any stage musical transferred to film exactly as done on stage, movie audiences demand something different.  And something different is what they get with Sweeney Todd.<br /><br />And then there is the score.  Tim Burton has said that he is a long-time fan of the stage production of Sweeney Todd.  As disappointing as it is for many fans to accept how much of the score has been cut, it was probably harder for Mr. Burton to decide what to remove.  The original show ran over three hours; 75% of the story was sung, making Sweeney Todd one of the few genuine operas to emerge from Broadway.  The film is less than two hours, and judging by the \\"complete\\" soundtrack CD, easily 40% of the score has been removed, chiefly the ensemble pieces.  Mr. Burton apparently judged (probably correctly) that the witty choral numbers, which worked so well on stage, would be clunky and ponderous on film, and he made the prudent but (I'm sure) difficult decision to let them go.  This is the sorest point for many fans of the show, and had I not been paying careful attention to Mr. Sondheim's recent statements, I may not have been able to get past that point myself.<br /><br />What has been excised is compensated for in Mr. Burton's sumptuous visuals and fastidious detail.  While Mr. Sondheim's changes to the lyrics have resolved previously problematic portions of the score and actually improved it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original.  Though a tragedy, the story is basically a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I have hardly missed the deletions, and I speak as someone who has loved this piece in almost all of its previous renderings.<br /><br />Although never a particular favorite of mine, I admit Johnny Depp is a revelation.  Without detracting from previous interpreters (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's portrayal of Barker / Todd is fully fleshed out, and I was able to immediately excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist.  This is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house.  If anything, the vocal limits of the lead characters actually enhance the realistic feel of the film.  It is also a pleasure to have Toby, Anthony and Joanna played by actors of the appropriate age, and to hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.<br /><br />To me, the real star is the score, although many moviegoers complain about lack of \\"memorable songs\\".  I believe good music should be subtle; the absence of \\"catchy tunes\\" is only indicative to me of the high quality of the music.  Those previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd are urged to acquire the complete soundtrack (with the libretto included) and follow along with the words as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works) how incredibly witty and sophisticated the lyrics are; on first listen you may miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the language, his clever rhymes, and his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who takes the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, especially if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will, in time, work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed.  This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence these days.  Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt gorgeous melodies; that is, real music.  Open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, and don't be surprised if you become a fan for life.a revelation.

B0011FL7FA|5.0|The 60s and 70s was a time when young people aimed for a different, better world. It was an experiment gone so bad, that the pendulum swung to the other extreme and to this day we associate those times with the hippies and the destruction of America's moral fiber.  It is time to re-examine the period. This movie is a good start, if you want to glimpse at what it felt like being young and idealistic.

The story is of a group of archeologist/researchers going back in time to mid-1300s Europe, during the Hundred Years War between England and France. The plot is totally nonsensical, there is nothing approaching character development, the acting is laughable and the editing extremely choppy. I would be suprised to learn if any director/producer/writer involved in this ever got another paid job. There should be a cash reward given to anyone over 18 who can watch until the end. Even if there were, not many would want to attempt it. Timeline gives the entire action/scifi/book-to-movie genre a bad name.
B00005JPTK|5.0|Obviously things are a matter of taste. Some people love it, some people hate it, other just don't care.<br /><br />There is something deliciously horrible to watch our cities being destroyed in the movies. It is like a guilty pleasure. Some uncontrollable curiosity that leaves us in awe before the unusual. It may be looking at a car accident as we drive by or watching New York City being destroyed by the sea in [[ASIN:B0002V7OI8 Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)]], by a monster in [[ASIN:B00005JPXY Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]]] or by the ultimate storm in [[ASIN:B0007PALRU The Day After Tomorrow (Two-Disc All-Access Collector's Edition)]]. It is a pleasure to see the impossible happen with the visual accuracy of certainty while deep inside we know it only lasts for two hours.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND gives you that guilty pleasure... with a twist: the city is not really destroyed. It is Humans who are absent after a deadly disease has wiped us out. And after that, Nature starts to reclaim the Earth. In fact, one of the most powerful images of this film is in the beginning, when Dr. Neville (Smith) drives a Mustang across the city and gets surprised by deers running scared through the streets on Manhattan. Even more disturbing is to see Dr. Neville moving across the woods in Times Square (no less) as he hunts one of them.<br /><br />This is just one of I AM LEGEND's greatest achievements: it really gives us a world (through state-of-the-art visual effects) unseen, unimaginable, fascinating... and lets you explore it. We know there are vampires (or some creatures like that running havoc through the night). But during daytime, we go places and see things we'll never see. And that's pure film magic.<br /><br />So here is the story: Dr. Robert Neville lives alone in Manhattan as the sole survivor to a deadly virus (to which he is immune) who transformed everybody in light-sensitive vampire-like monsters (forced to live in the dark). The crisis (shown in flashbacks as he recollects) happened a few years ago and - right now - Dr. Neville is on the verge of loosing his mind. He talks to mannequins, watches recorded television broadcast and try to have a normal life (with his dog Samantha) hoping to make contact with other survivors like himself. Oh... and he is a military scientist trying to find a cure.<br /><br />Now... it is a ridiculous effort to compare the film to the book, as this film is much more a loose adaptation of Richard Matheson's great novella. This film uses the same premise but makes significant changes in key elements that (I believe) would never really work on a Hollywood blockbuster. So, those who love the novella and hate the film should realize that, many many times, the film's preoccupations and objectives are not the same ones we have on the books they are based on. It is important to appreciate the film in its own merit and outside the burden of the book - a burden any film wants to break free from. Gone are the days where a Hollywood film \\"wanted to be the book\\" because they needed such blessing from such an authority.<br /><br />And breaking down the film's great assets, we'll find only positive elements: Will Smith's very precise performance, a screenplay who tell you the story minute by minute maintaining you always wanting more, great special effects, great scary moments that will please its target audience... and the city we love being engulfed by a destiny without us.<br /><br />Simply beautiful.<br /><br />This DVD version comes with lots of extras, the best of which, in my opinion, is the making of the city's visuals we see throughout the entire movie. Also, it comes with an alternate version of the film with a different ending that would never hit the audience in the same way. Fascinating.<br /><br />The film is not perfect. There are one or two less interesting elements that I will not delve into because I believe they are a matter of taste. And regardless of that, I think this film isa production triumph in contemporary cinema.<br /><br />That's it.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|As a huge P&P fan I had high hopes for this soundtrack and I was not disappointed. If you love the movie then you will love the music. A couple songs have low sound but it's nothing that turning up the volume won't fix. Overall, I would recommend this product to all.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I wish only to add my voice to the chorus of glowing praise for this movie. Comparisons to other westerns are largely immaterial; Lonesome Dove is a work of singular beauty that generates an emotional response unlike that of any other film I've ever seen (regardless of genre). The characters feel like close friends, which is something very few movies can claim. I'm not usually the type to shed a tear during a movie, but there are parts of Lonesome Dove that get me every time. As many have said before, it is most definitely one of the greatest and most beautiful films ever made.

0375714839|5.0|Persepolis is a touching personal account of one girl growing up in a country on the brink-- of revolution, of war, of fundamentalism.  Satrapi exposes herself in this at times painfully honest biography. The novel is entertaining, delightful, ammusing, humorous--but then the cold realities of life and living in a war-torn country set in.  You feel her greatest joys and deepest pains as her family becomes your own.  The art work is charming and original to match this unique creation.  I could not put it down!

Although it seemed a little short, the author's writing style was easy to understand and at times made me feel like I was back in school science classes (which is a good thing!).     Definitely an eye-opening book that has gifted me with never looking at life the same again; or at least not clueless to the wonders of our evolution.    Thank for the great read!  Jonah W.
B00026YO36|5.0|Mark Lanegan's sixth solo album, Bubblegum is definitely the most varied work of his entire career.  The record starts off with the sparse, very Tom Waits-ish \\"When Your Number Isn't Up\\", and  already you can tell this is a different kind of Lanegan record.  Next up is \\"Hit the City\\", one of two songs on the album that feature the vocal contributions of the immensely talented PJ Harvey. The song is a relaxed, kind of droning rock duet. It's nice, and plays well off the first track.                   \\"Wedding Dress\\" is a lovely track featuring Lanegan's ex-wife Wendy Rae Fowler. It features some odd instrumentation and some beautiful lyrics (\\"would you put on that long white dress, and burn like there's no more tomorrows?\\") It fades out to a short but rocking guitar solo courtesy of Josh Homme-- just one of many friends and colleagues Lanegan enlisted to play on the record. \\"Methamphetamine Blues\\" is an interesting rocker with an industrial groove. This is also reminiscent of Tom Waits material. If you really listen, almost every player on the record appears here--for sure an album highlight.                   Things slow down for the next three songs. \\"100 Days\\" is an acoustic track with Mark backed by Chris Goss (Masters of Reality). \\"Bombed\\" is short little duet with Fowler that packs a lot of potent imagery into just over a minute. \\"Strange Religion\\" Keeps the mellow vibe going, and is one of the album's best ballads.                 Suddenly we find ourselves back in rock territory with the retro tinged \\"Sideways in Reverse\\". This is just a really fun song complete with a guest vocal by Izzy Stradlin! It helps to get you back on your feet after three really downer songs. Next is the second PJ track, which is an acoustic and string number, with a really classic feel to it. PJ and Mark trade verses until the lovely choruses. A brilliant song with two of the best voices in the music world.                \\"Like Little Willie John\\" is one of the weirdest songs here, again, with a strong Tom Waits influence. The vocals and the mood and atmosphere on this song are just so good. \\"Can't Come Down\\" is perhaps the only somewhat forgettable track here. It almost sounds like a Tricky type song, and it does not have a Lanegan vocal. 'Morning Glory Wine\\" is another great, haunting ballad. Lanegan sounds really world weary and down here. \\"Head\\" is the next track, and it is possibly the album's catchiest song. It has a good keyboard and guitar beat that drives it along.             The overdriven guitar of Alan Johannes takes center stage on the next track,\\"Driving Death Valley Blues\\". This is perhaps the most out and out rock song on the album, with the exception of \\"Sideways\\". Electric drums combined with the alternating crunching, squealing guitar create quite the soundscape.  The final track is the understated acoustic number \\"Out of Nowhere\\". The vocals are excellent here, and this track serves to bring a good end to the album.            Overall, Lanegan has managed to create with Bubblegum a thrilling piece of music that is impossible to pigeonhole in one genre. It is always unexpected, and shows off the writing and vocal talents of one of the most underrated artists of the 90's.
0060935464|5.0|If you're looking for a fast plot, kick a$$ characters who overcome insurmountable odds, then you should look elsewhere.    If you're looking for the gritting truth, set at a Southern pace (i.e. slow), where things are never quite what they seem on the surface (i.e. small towns), and good does not always prevail (i.e. what ever happened to Dill and why did it have to happen to Tom), then I recommend this American classic.    I've read a few of the reviews and was actually surprised that some didn't like it. While I understand that nothing appeals to all audiences, it was still a shock to me. And the reason for that is that when you love something, it's hard to see why other's don't.    A small percentage of reviewers said that nothing happened and the characters are one-dimensional. While this feedback is obviously valid for those who made it, I have to disagree. The women in the town (esp the Auntie and Miss Maudie) were perfect examples of complex characters living through a very changing (and challenging) time. If you read a bit below the surface, I believe the average reader should be able to pick that up.    Jem was another example of a complex character. We watched him cross that threshold from a little boy to a young man. To me this was proven by his periods of quietness and his behaviors.    Because the story was written to reflect, as closely as possible, true life during a particularly period in American culture, it may seem a bit slow to those accustomed to and prefer contemporary/speculative fiction.     I was born in the South and therefore found the dialogue to be quite accurate of how we spoke during my childhood. This helped me to relate to it and build more of a bond to the characters.    Every now and again, I find (as I get older -- not sure how relevant that is for the younger audiences)  you want to read a book that stays with you. You're not in the mood for a Stephen King (tho he is a master story teller). Instead you want something slower, something with a little more meaning to it so that you when you put it down, you have to sit in silence and reflect on what you've read and why you liked it so much.    This is not a book that I would've read in high school (cliff notes was my preferred method). Unfortunately I did not have the patience nor the maturity (that adjective is reflective of me only) to understand how good people can make bad decisions and still not be bad people. One of the toughest things to do is to stand up in front of an angry mob and tell them that you don't agree with. This, I think, is one of the crucibles of the novel.    For me, this is one of the best books I've read and completely understand why it has won a Pulitzer. She deserves it.
0618918248|1.0|If it's 99% certain that an organism will survive after each single mutation, then the probability that it would survive just the first one thousand mutations is (0.99)^1000 = 0.000043 or about one in twenty-five thousand and the probability that it would survive the first 10,000 mutations would be  (0.99)^10,000 = 2.24 x (10)^ - 44. Scientists like Dawkins know that the odds of a complex molecule like RNA (the crux molecule of primitive life) just spontaneously coming into existence is astronomically low so they try to get around the improbability of this by saying that there are countless billions of planets in the universe and earth just happens to be one where pure random chance created our complex ecosystem. Other scientists say that in order for random chance to have created the right combination of physical laws that exist here on earth for sustaining life there would need to be an infinite number of universes to produce one planet with just the right combination of laws.<br /><br />---<br /><br />\\"There's a reason some theorists want other universes to exist: They believe it's the only way to explain why our own universe, whose physical laws are just right to allow life, happens to exist. According to the so-called anthropic principle, there are perhaps an infinite number of universes, each with its own set of physical laws. And one of them happens to be ours. That's much easier to believe, say the anthropic advocates, than a single universe `fine-tuned' for our existence.\\"<br /><br />\\"'It's not a testable idea,' says Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University.

B000000W5N|5.0|What a streak for the Rolling Stones.  Over a few years, they had five classic albums in a row, \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" \\"Let It Bleed,\\" the live \\"Get Yer Ya-Yas Out,\\" \\"Exile on Main Street\\"--and \\"Sticky Fingers.\\" Those of us who have been around awhile might recall what is missing from the CD--Andy Warhol's concept of the zipper on the album cover.  Oh, well.  Anyhow, this is another classic Rolling Stones' work. The sound is different from \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\"; it seems closer to \\"Exile\\" in its sound (at least to me).<br /><br />The CD starts off with one of the Stones' finest songs, \\"Brown Sugar.\\" Just another salacious song or social commentary?  Or both?  The guitars open this off with a fine riff and chunky guitar licks (acoustic and electric). Bobby Keyes on sax also plays well on this cut.  These words start off the song:<br /><br />\\"Gold Coast slave she bound for cotton fields,<br />Sold in a market down in New Orleans.\\"<br /><br />A great rock and roll song.<br /><br />\\"You Gotta Move\\" was one of blues artist Fred McDowell's best known works. The Stones provide a blues sensibility in this version, although their later live version is more compelling--and better blues.  Nonetheless this version isn't bad.  It's interesting to compare the Stones' version with McDowell's. Key lines:<br /><br />\\"You may be high,<br />You may be low.<br />You may be rich,<br />You may be poor.<br />But when the Lord gets ready,<br />You gotta move.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sister Morphine\\" is a slower song, featuring spare (but effective) guitar work.  This is rather poignantly sung by Mick Jagger.  One line that always catches my attention:<br /><br />\\"The scream of ambulance<br />Is sounding in my ears.\\"<br /><br />On this cut, Billy Preston plays organ, Keyes is on sax, and Price on trumpet.  Nice sound.<br /><br />The album closes with \\"Moonlight Mile,\\" a slow, almost dreamlike and hypnotic song.  An interesting tune indeed!<br /><br />Other fine tunes abound, such as \\"Sway,\\" \\"Wild Horses,\\" and \\"Dead Flowers.\\"<br /><br />One of the terrific albums in the \\"winning streak\\" put out by the Stones at their peak in playing and creating music.  Well worth listening to.Stones at their peak in playing and creating music.  Well worth listening to.

B0000AFX64|4.0|Success of the Star Wars in 1976 made similarly styled space operas flourish. In Japan, Uchu Senkan Yamato known to US as \\"Star Blazers\\" returned to life in late 70s after 1974 original TV series lost the viewing rate battle against \\"Heidi\\" by Japanese anime giants such as Takahata and Miyazaki. The battlestar galactica in 1978 is an enjoyable classic styled space opera somewhat close to Star Blazers or Star Trek series. As recent series of BATTLESTAR TV series show it is characterized by attractive female characters which definitely provides a bunch of episodes for TV drama. A bit of letdown is the ultimate randevous with terrestirians are not shown in the movie and that's part of the weak spot for the script settings.<br /><br />80s rock fans should not miss the first tragetic part featuring RICK SPRINGFIELD as ZAC. And Noah Hathaway who would later become famous as ATREYU in NEVERENDING STORY also appears as BOXEY who lost beloved dog and was given a robot dog instead.<br /><br />Verdict: Enjoyable and entertaining. The tech of intergalactic travel not much shown (just as spaceholding technology or that of warp).<br />Rating: 86 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Casual sci-fi fans who love Star Trek or Star Blazer series. But I am not so sure if Star Wars or Dune fans also love this or not.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|This film represented a giant step forward in comic book adaptations, and, 19 years later, remains in the top tier of this peculiar drama.  Key to this film's success is that, despite consider fan pressure (Tim Burton referred to them as `DC fundamentalists,' a label that is still apt) to do otherwise, the director made sure that he had a quality film first, and a comic book adaptation second.  Fortunately, Burton had enough of a sense of the true character of Batman to incorporate enough of that spirit into his own vision, so as to satisfy all but the most myopic of comic book fans.<br /><br />This film is unique among the many cinematic versions of Batman in various ways, but one of the most important is the fact that in the beginning of the story the audience does not see the action from the perspective of Batman or Bruce Wayne but from other characters.  Nor does Burton provide a ham-fisted, histrionic, hit-you-over-the-head version of the origin story.  Rather, a mystique is created and Batman emerges by bits and pieces.<br /><br />The key to the character is more often hinted at, or symbolized, rather than clubbing the audience upside the head for 2 hours and 20 minutes.  You come to find that Bruce Wayne has a collection of bizarre suits of armor, you see a newspaper clipping regarding the murder of his parents, you learn that he keeps his Batman suit in a huge, impenetrable vault.<br /><br />This film conveys a sense of the absurd, of the gothic, of exaggerations and of the larger-than-life.  All of which are also found in the classic Batman comics.  The special effects are good and hold up well, 19 years later.  The illusion that Michael Keaton can really move like a ninja, wearing a 70 lb. rubber suit was achieved mostly by fast editing, which is more effective than the CGI crap you get nowadays, which makes everybody look like frickin' Spider-Man.<br /><br />Also, since most of the time you only see brief glimpses of Batman, it helps to maintain the mystique.  Batman, when properly handled, is a very compelling character.  But he is also an impossible character, and the harder you focus on him, the more you dissect him, the harder it is to ignore the absurdity of a grown man dressing like a bat to frighten criminals.  Tim Burton and Michael Keaton gave us a plausible Batman, but wisely kept him somewhat at arms length, more often suggesting things, rather than saying them outright.<br /><br />The cast is good-to-great, even Kim Basinger, who was never that much of a master thespian.  1989 was before everyone was sick of Jack Nicholson, he was still turning out good stuff and his Joker is great.  The guys who play Alfred and Commissioner Gordon are really excellent, as is Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, DA.  It's too bad that this movie turned out to be the height of Michael Keaton's commercial success.  Prior to the release of this film, a lot of the fan-boys got their undies all in a knot thinking he'd turn out bad in the role, yet he played this Batman so well, it's impossible to think of this film with any other lead.rly handled, is a very compelling character.

0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama is a highly intelligent man and a talented author.  This book outlined for me a man's ideas on how we might just put America back on the track that our fore-fathers intended.  Obama does not claim to have every answer and does not have the arrogance of many politicians today.  He is not afraid to admit his shortcomings, though equally not afraid to say & stand up for what he believes should be done to help re-unite a country.  He has uncommon insight into the world of the common citizen, as his own roots are not decorated with silver spoons and platters.  In my opinion, this is a man who can connect with the average working American.  The book is not dry political rhetoric.  It is filled with enthusiasm, hope, ideas, and the passions of a different kind of politician than we have become used to in recent decades.

0316067598|5.0|There's a part of me that's always been intrigued by the challenge of boot camp and, in the case of \\"Lone Survivor,\\" training for special ops. I've never served in the military--although I would have no problem defending my country--but this book made me feel as though I had.<br /><br />The story starts at the beginning of an ill-fated mission, then flashes back to Marcus Luttrell's childhood dream and subsequent training as a Navy SEAL. At first, I wanted to skip ahead to what happened high in the mountains of Afghanistan, to read of the firefight between four SEALs and the overwhelming throng of Taliban warriors. Instead, I found myself as engrossed in the training methods and endurance that these men went through just to have the opportunity to serve our country with their lives. There are parts that made me laugh, cringe, and gasp. Wisely, the coauthor stays hidden, allowing Luttrell's voice to speak on every page, giving us candid and believable insights into the processes and experiences behind every SEAL.<br /><br />But not every SEAL writes a book, and not many live through the hell that Luttrell went through for nearly a week, after the ambush and injuries he sustained--not to mention the loss of his very close comrades. The action scenes here are amazing, full of detail, emotion, and things that we rarely see portrayed accurately on film. Some of the details are those \\"stranger than fiction\\" type things that defy imagination. In the course of his survival, thanks to Pashtun tribesmen and his own endurance and ingenuity (as well as the godly intervention which Luttrell attests to), we come to appreciate and respect the heroes of combat even more than ever.<br /><br />Does Luttrell rant a bit about the liberal media? Yes. Does he vent about their early reports of his demise? Loudly. And rightly so. Does he cause us to question the mix of political agendas and idealism that sometimes stand in the way of those we expect to defend our freedom? You better believe it. Sure, we can point a finger at his personal griefs, but in fact its those very things that give credence to his questions.<br /><br />Not only is this a great book to read for anyone who enjoys stories of heroism and the military, it's a vital story to be mulled over by all who make decisions on the political end and all families who stand behind the men and women who put themselves in the line of fire for our safety. I couldn't put the book down.a finger at his personal griefs, but in fact its those very things that give credence to his questions.

I remembered when my mother purchased this for me as a child, I wore my vinyl album out and eventually got another copy and the cassette as well. I have also purchased it on CD and then in 2001 purchased the Special Edition. Now I have purchased the 25th Anniversary Edition and it was well worth my purchase. The unreleased track \\"For All Time\\" is timeless. An of course, you cannot leave out the Michael classics, Billie Jean,Beat It,Wanna Be Startin Somethin,The Girl Is Mine,P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),Thriller,and my personal favorite \\"Human Nature\\". Baby Be Mine and The Lady In My Life were two other non-single songs on the album but were also very good. This is also the first album to have 7 Top 10 hits from one album and this album spent 37 weeks at #1. 25 Years Later and Thriller is still the best. The new tracks with Akon,william,Fergie,and Kanye West are very good. My person favorite is \\"Wanna Be Startin Somethin 2008\\". Make sure you pick up a copy of this amazing album!

0743455967|5.0|\\"Writing is not life, but I think that sometimes it can be a way back to life.\\"<br /><br /> This quote, from Stephen King's second and best work of nonfiction, On Writing:  A Memoir of the Craft (Scribner, 288 pages, $25.00), sums up the \\"it's-not-brain-surgery\\" philosophy that permeates this highly-readable primer on the craft of fiction.  King's first nonfiction book was Danse Macabre, a look at the horror genre in all its forms.  On Writing careens away from the horror corner that King has painted himself into with novels such as Carrie and The Shining.  This book is not about how to scare your readers, but how to take them by the hand and lead them down the path of the well-crafted story.<br /><br /> King has every right to write about life and how writing can take one back to it:  In 1999 -- in the middle of writing this book -- he was nearly killed when a careless motorist slammed into him as he walked along the side of a road near his rural Maine home.  After suffering multiple injuries, King had to learn how to walk again, and credits his wife and his surgeon with saving his life.<br /><br />Perhaps more important than merely surviving, King found his way back to the joys of life.  He credits this successful homeward journey to his writing.  King confesses that his primary joy is writing fiction, while nonfiction comes more slowly:  he nearly abandoned this memoir-slash-instruction manual in the middle of the project.  It is a fortunate thing - both for King's fans and writers everywhere - that he finally finished On Writing.<br /><br />King once characterized his brand of everyman-confronts-the-supernatural fiction as \\"the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries,\\" but he was selling himself short.  The reason why King's readers keep coming back to his thousand-page-plus novels is twofold:  King has an innate sense of story, and he writes from the heart.  Character-driven novels such as Misery and Rose Madder (although he confesses that he didn't care much for the latter) reveal as many secrets about the human experience as anything you will find on a university-level English professor's required reading list.<br /><br />In On Writing, King reveals two things:  the details of his life (King's \\"Curriculum Vitae,\\" which he says have shaped the writer he has become) and the methods of his craft.  King developed a love of the horror genre early in his life, thanks to monster movies starring such luminaries as Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.  King is unapologetic about his attraction to things that go bump in the night:  \\"I was built with a love of the night and the unquiet coffin, that's all.  If you disapprove, I can only shrug my shoulders.  It's what I have.\\"<br /><br />King likens a writer's skills - essentials like grammar and vocabulary - to the contents of a toolbox.  By way of an analogy, he recalls as a boy accompanying his uncle to fix a broken screen.  King's uncle brought a giant of a toolbox with him to do the job.  King asked why his uncle would lug such a heavy toolbox to complete a simple screen-mending:  \\"It's best to have your tools with you,\\" King's uncle replied.  \\"If you don't, you're apt to find something you didn't expect and get discouraged.\\"<br /><br />Two tools that King does not carry in his box are detailed outlines or carefully crafted plots.  King argues that his best fiction has been driven by character and situation, his worst by plot:  \\"Plot is, I think, the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice.  The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.\\"  King challenges his skeptics with an exercise involving two characters and an appropriately Kingian situation.  To tell what this situation is would give away too much of the fun of this book.<br /><br />On Writing is a breath of fresh air in a sea of pretentious writing manuals that have flooded bookstores lately.  This book proves what King's readers have known for years:  the man is about much more than horror.  On Writing not only helped me hone my craft, but caused me to reflect upon my own Curriculum Vitae:  the life experiences that made me the writer I am, and the reasons why I wouldn't have it any other way.but caused me to reflect upon my own Curriculum Vitae:  the life experiences that made me the writer I am, and the reasons why I wouldn't have it any other way.

It was a great delight watching a movie made in a place I am so familiar with. I was a kid when the movie was made and I had a great time strolling down memory lane with the zombies. I saw the candy store and fountain I loved as a kid, and delighted to see the indoor skating rink I one took lessons at covered with shuffling zombies. The courtyard surrounding the big white clock I loved as a kid was now littered with dead bodies. Bikers, the undead, and our heroes roared and wandered over the tile floor that I was so familiar with, and both the heroes and the marauding bikers go on a \\"shopping spree\\" through the department store that has been there since the early 1970s. What fun to watch and remember! On the commentary, which is very enjoyable, George Romero stated that he knew the people who owned Monroeville Mall and when he toured it for the first time, he thought that one could hole up in the mall indefinitely, as everything you needed was there. That, he said, was the inspiration for this movie, which has deservedly become a classic. (I have also read that this was the first totally enclosed shopping mall, though I don't know if this is true). There have been so many zombie movies made that it's become its own subgenre of horror, but I've never seen any quite like this one.<br /><br />Tom Savini, also a Pittsburgher, is also on the commentary and tells us that this is the film that made him the king of gore. In the commentary track, he described how many of the effects were done. As I said previously, the kills are imaginative and top-notch. One zombie gets a screwdriver through the ear, a biker gets his intestines pulled out and eaten, and there are many \\"head shots\\", or people literally getting their heads blown off. Savini also plays a biker and a stuntman in the film.<br /><br />Romero does an excellent job at satirizing the shopping or \\"me\\" culture that we were entering at the end of the 1970s. Materialism and consumerism are very strong undercurrents in the film, and are done very well. The sight of zombies shuffling around a mall in time to happy, perky Muzak, trying on hats, and generally shuffling around the stores moaning in delight is simply hilarious.<br /><br />Would I have liked this movie so much if I weren't so familiar with the location? Maybe not quite as much, but it's still very enjoyable. I think it cements Romero's reputation as King of the Zombie Movies.of the effects were done.

0375847227|5.0|I got this book over the past weekend and spent the weekend finishing it.  I'm not much of a fantasy book reader although I have, through the course of my life, read Lloyd Alexander, C S Lewis, Tolkien but I've never liked anything else in the genre.  Then I heard about the controversy about this series and thought I'd read it.  Also heard it was the highbrow Harry Potter.    Well, let me tell you, Pullman is a genius, flat out.  I don't know how he managed to craft such an intricate, vibrant, riveting trilogy with such complex themes keeping you unable to take your eyes off the page.  His trilogy is proof that the physical book is not dead.  This is the kind of book you need to hold and read in front of a fire through day and night until the last word is read.  Then you want more.    Just brilliant.

I call upon Amazon to stop selling them, for they are teaching people that Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ does not exist or is not relavant to today. This is wrong! Protect your children from these books!
B00004TJKI|5.0|\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is an example of director Otto Preminger at his finest.  Everything about the production is superb, including the script, actors, pace, photography, editing, and casting.  What was particularly impressive was giving the part of the presiding judge in the trial to real life attorney Joseph Welch, from the infamous HUAC trials.  James Stewart's acting talents are well displayed, along with some wonderful parts played by Ben Gazarra,  Lee Remick, Arthur O'Connell and Eve Arden.  The film is a rare treat for the younger generations who did  not see this 1959 classic--a must-see film for all.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This adaptation of Jane Eyre is the finest ever done. It is a new incite into not only Jane Eyre but shows a true side of Rochester like never before. Toby Stephens' Rochester is beautifully done, and Ruth Wilsons Jane Eyre is the best yet.  I would recommend it highly.
0385312083|3.0|Personally, I do not care for Kurt Vonnegut's politics and lack of faith.  The underlying story of Dresden is quite interesting.  However, it has been in vapid dispute the number of dead that Vonnegut claims as irrefutable fact.  Vonnegut paints his star \\"protagonist\\" as an uncaring nihilist.  Furthermore, sporadically dispersed throughout the novel are anti-Christian rants and allusions.  I believe everyone can agree war is horrible.  However, the author could have wrote about it without the liberal, anti-Christian, nihilist prose.  Slaughterhouse five is basically the personal view's of Vonnegut with a mildly amusing story about Dresden during World War II.
006135323X|5.0|The first thing I did after reading Dan Ariely's book was to give it to my daughter, then to my wife, neither of whom are economists or psychologists.   They ate it up.   Dan teaches us how to think:  About the ways we navigate our economic life, for sure, but far more important, he shows us the principles by which we organize the rest of our life as well, from our personal interactions, to the ways in which we  value ourselves.  His book is better than an exposition, it is a mirror.  It inspires us to think about ourselves in new ways.  His examples are compelling, but more important, all readers, no matter what their field or interest, will see through the intriguing specifics and find a resonant chord that is simultaneously deeply informative and deeply personal.  His teaching is all joy, and all meaning.
B000267ZB4|5.0|A child prodigy whose love of the harmonica began after a blow to the head at age 5 caused him to be blind, Hugo Diaz asked his father for a harmonica and was performing by age 7;  shortly after, his sight was surgically restored but the centrality of the harmonica in his life remained. He may have been totally self-taught.  I think all of this history is what we hear in his playing.       He was primarily an Argentine folklorist but he recorded several tango records; his playing on this cd is lyrical, passionate, thoughtful and relatively spare. It is not totally clear but it seems that he is, also, the guitarist on this cd.      The recording is very intimate in the sense that it picks up his breathing and his grunts.  Some may see this as a positive and others as a negative.      Except for his place as the first cut on the soundtrack of the movie THE TANGO LESSON, I have no other exposure to his playing so do not know how this compares, either in his playing or the recording quality, to his many other recordings that I gather are not easily available. He died, I think, 1977 and so there will not be more from him unless it is some sort of re-issue.    Be aware that there are two musicians playing tango music with the name Hugo Diaz. The other Hugo Diaz plays bandoneon, a kind of squeeze-box instrument, and is from Uruguay.
1400031354|3.0|In this second book in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, Mma Ramotswe is newly engaged to her friend Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Her fledgling detective business in Gaborone, Botswana, is doing well, and she takes on several new cases, including those of a cheating wife and a son who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. She also learns that her secretary, Mma Makutsi, has some detecting talents of her own.<br /><br />What is quickly becoming one of my favorite aspects of the books is the subtle ways the author provides small morsels of cultural information to the reader. Although chances are small I'll ever be fortunate enough to visit myself, I feel like I'm slowly getting to know Botswana.

0525950079|4.0|As in 'Pillars of the Earth,' to which 'WWE' is the sequel, the city of Kingsbridge is brought to life with colorful, boisterous, endearing and occasionally excruciating detail. The story begins approximately 200 years after 'PotE.' At 1,000 pages, it's a hefty tome to lug around, but it's a relatively quick and absorbing read.<br /><br />In several ways 'WWE' was almost like reading the first book over again. The protagonists' and antagonists' names have changed, but at times I felt, mildly disappointedly, that I'd read it all before. This was the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Still highly recommended as Follett's prose is breathtaking as usual, but make sure you read 'PotE' first.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Sicko is the most amazingly disturbing movie about America I've ever watched. I feel as if I've been brainwashed into thinking the United States in the best country in the world and found myself thinking seriously about moving to another country for the first time in my life. I'm an active participant on the social website \\"twitter\\", and I decided to see what other people were saying about Sicko. Here's a sampling of what I've found - I think it speaks volumes about how upset this country is with the current situation.<br /><br />\\"Just watched Michael Moore's 'Sicko'. I want to move to England.\\"<br /><br />\\"Finally watched \\"Sicko.\\" Never thought so much about moving out of the country. Depressing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sicko was surprisingly good. Now I feel super motivated to become a British, Canadian, or French citizen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Watching Michael Moore's Sicko. I would love to live in Great Britain.\\"<br /><br />\\"After watching \\"Sicko\\" I want to permanently move to London or France\\"<br /><br />\\"Just finally watched Sicko. I'm equally appalled and bemused by the lack of concern over health care. Why isn't anonymous picketing HMO's?\\"<br /><br />\\"Just watched SickO by MM. Lived in France for five years so nothing I didn't know. A circle of Ignorance and arrogance if you ask me.

Considering moving to Europe.\\"<br /><br />\\"Watched 'SiCKO' last night - loved it. How embarrassing. How infuriating. How did it come to this? Looking over the French classifieds...\\"<br /><br />\\"I.m watching Sicko; we're moving to Canada...\\"<br /><br />\\"Watching Sicko. Thinking about moving to England.\\"<br /><br />\\"Michael Moore's Sicko makes me ashamed to be an American.\\"<br /><br />It goes on and on.

I thought at that moment that this was the saddest book ever written.<br /><br />With this edition, a new generation gets to discover Anne Frank, and those of us who have been around for a while definitely get to see a different young Anne, one who is more of a teen-ager. But the new material simply makes her more human, more vulnerable, more a symbol of the tragic losses of the Holocaust. Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl has profoundly affected millions of people, and I, for one, believe it will continue to do so endlessly.<br /><br />Lawrence J.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|sweet film. once again not your typical movie, the girls came out the top dog. excellent movie, what a rush, nicely put together. when i finished watching this movie i was pumped you know. really tripped out. some of those scenes on here are off the hook. perfectly detailed and very well executed. i didn't think is was going to be as good as it was really. some crazy nutcase who gets a high out of killing women. poor defenseless women. his killing ground: the road, his killing machine: his car. a psycho loser by the name of stuntman mike prowls the streets in search of females he can wack with his car. he follows them does his homework on them and then cuts their lives short. they never even see it coming, and if they sense it they pay no heed to that feeling. you get to know him, a regular guy with a very dark side. he's killed many times before, and he really enjoys it. after he takes out the first few chics you kind of think there's no stopping this guy, but he messes with the wrong females and then the shoe's on the other foot. four chics who don't see him coming are attacked, but fight back. another fun part. what a trip, these girls mean some dirty business. they get together and give old stuntman mike a taste of what's long overdue. great chase, nice performances, and great punches. loved it, because although there are some vunerable females, there's also some kick azz ones as well. liked it because it was raw, and strait up no sugar coating. very sweet.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|When my wife first ordered, and, subsequently, watched this fim, she enthused and sung its praises. I thought that, it was not my 'cup of tea', so, I did not immediately watched it. Some time later, I did. I am not the type of person who cries. However, the scene of a father and child, trying to sleep inside a public lavatory, with someone banging incessantly on the door, blew me away. The camera, fixed upon the poor man's face, capturing the moment of misery, injustice and despair (through his silent tears) was, both; heart-wrenching and very real. I felt that I was him, inside that toilet, holding on to my son. Nothing more needs be added.

B0006HC0I2|5.0|There are not many words by which to describe the awesome 'combination' of the Sir Laurence Olivier/Marlon Brando 'version' of One of the most well-accomplished French Actors, ever to 'explode' upon the Silver Screen, the magnificent, Jean Gabin. This motion picture \\"Touchez Pas au Grisbi\\", is, about loyalty, the macho camaraderie binding the 'participants', as well as the unwritten law of never 'grassing up' your 'mates.' The word \\"loyalty\\" which is the clear message this film conveys, suggests, that, any man who is disloyal, lacks in character, and, basic moral fibre. Should this be the case, then, 'he'; is 'no good' to his friends, or to; anybody else.

6305678715|3.0|1988's \\"The Presidio\\" paired veteran actor Sean Connery with a young Mark Harmon and a younger Meg Ryan in a rather mundane San Francisco murder mystery.  The movie was set at the U.S. Army's beautiful Presidio of San Francisco military base and in San Francisco itself.<br /><br />Connery is Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell, the cantankerous, by-the-book Provost Marshal of the Presidio; Harmon is Jay Austin, forced out of the military by Caldwell and now a hot-headed San Francisco police detective.  When a military policeman is murdered during a break-in at the Presidio Officer's Club, the two must cooperate on the investigation.  Their difficult relationship is made more challenging by Austin's attraction to Caldwell's beautiful but rebellious daughter, played with aggressive gusto by Meg Ryan.<br /><br />The murder investigation leads to a conspiracy with ties back to the Vietnam War, culminating in a violent shoot-out in a bottled water warehouse.  The plot will seem clumsy to audiences now savy on crime forensics; the even clumsier dialogue sometimes threatens to bury the movie altogether.<br /><br />The movie has its redeeming features.  Connerly and Harmon manage to craft a little \\"old bull, young bull\\" buddy chemistry on screen.  A scene in which Caldwell impresses Austin by using a little hopkido to clean up a bar with a loud-mouthed drunk may be the highpoint of the movie.  The movie makes good use of its location shooting around the Presidio.<br /><br />This movie is recommended as mild entertainment for fans of Sean Connery and Mark Harmon.

B000002KHH|5.0|I must admit off the bat that I'm actually not a heavy metal fan. I used to like Metallica and a handful of other metal bands (back in my high schools years), but I've since found myself listening almost exclusively to jazz and classical music.    I recently re-discovered Black Sabbath, always one of my favourite rock bands, and I've been listening to them fanatically for some time again now. PARANOID isn't their best album, in my opinion, (I prefer Vol. 4) but it warrants no less than five stars. I suppose a large part of the reason it doesn't seem quite as good to me is because the songs on it are overplayed to hell--\\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Paranoid\\" are great songs... the first 10000 times you hear them :)    Nonetheless, if you haven't heard Black Sabbath or haven't listened to them in some time, like me, this is an amazing album. \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"War Pigs\\" are my two favourites here (\\"Planet Caravan\\" is also really underrated), but the whole album is wonderful.    If Sabbath's first album gave birth to metal, PARANOID perfected it. I haven't heard any other band do a better job with the genre, and, aside from Zeppelin,  no other rock band has topped them.

He is selected to be in The Running Man, where the riches are enormous for the winner; but not one person has survived to reap that glory.<br /><br />Author Richard Bachman (Stephen King) takes the reader through the violent chase for survival by Richards and the pursuit by professional hunters, with every citizen a possible game show snitch. In this intense story, Richards may be welcomed into the government machine, if he is willing to sell his soul to those who wanted him dead.<br /><br />The manuscript is not the same as the script of the film by the same name; this Richards is an anti-hero, who was created as much by society as he was through his boiling anger with the monstrous monolith of a government.<br /><br />And the end proves that many people can try to run, but they cannot hide.

B000005DQR|5.0|I can sit here and write the best comments of this album.  If you're here, you know why.  No explanation needed.  There has yet to be an album to dethrone Endtroducing as the best album I've ever heard. Some have challenged but to no avail.  No one album has captured the essence of music quite like this album did for me during the spring of 1997.     This is the top of the mountain.  Any other review I make will be a step down. There's a saying that you can only go south from the north pole. As is the case with this album.      Best album since 1997 and continues to be so today.  Incredible.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|OK, so this album has officially been out for three weeks and already I feel like I arrived late to the party. Yeesh. I listen to tons of new music, but somehow missed all the so-called hype about this release, and really only checked it out because Vampire Weekend played PopScene in SF recently. A quick check at KCRW.org shows that it's still high on Nick Harcourt's current favs.    I admit, I was expecting the usual indie darling's college radio fare à la Clap Your Hands Say Yeah [shudder]: silly, ingenuine, self-consciously outré junk for the black lipstick crowd.    Quite the opposite. I mean, when was the last time you heard harpsichord, flute, cello & bongos in American pop music? Been awhile folks. Admittedly, you'll either love or hate this album. There's definitely roots here in dub-afrobeat-rocksteady-reggae-whatever, but comparisons to Paul Simon's Graceland are laughably off the mark. Only one track--One (Blake's Got A New Face)--nods to that Ladysmith Black Mambazo sound so associated with Graceland, and is the weakest (and jokiest) track on the disc IMHO.    Think Belle & Sebastian or The Magic Numbers with some occasional Afro mojo.    Strongest tracks: Mansard Roof, Oxford Comma, A-Punk, Cape Cod, M79 & Walcott.

It's entertaining and loaded with nice on location images with brief descriptions of the shoot. But \\"Photography secrets\\" is a bit of a misleading title for this book. His setups are solid lighting techniques available in a myriad of other books (and in drastically better detail than here), NOTHING NEW.

0679746323|3.0|I approached the book wanting to understand how Mao was able to take control of China and the truth about his reign.    What I got was definitely not objective.  This book would be a good companion piece to research about Mao, but I feel like it's written with an ax to grind.    It's written in the textbook manner, although it makes no bones about presenting other points of view or interpretations.  Very little in the way of useful maps (they mention Outer Mongolia a hundred times, but don't bother to tell you it's present day Mongolia or have it on a map) and pictures placed in inserts rather than chronologically.    I came away from this book with an impressively researched overview of Mao's life and his place in the Cold War but no greater understanding of how he was able to manipulate, intimated, murder his way to the top, and create an enduring cult of personality.  Mao seemed almost like a ghost in his own biography, especially after 1949.  I wanted to know more of the how & why as well as the details.  I can't really address the other serious scholarly issue of the book as other reviewers have.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are great actors, and they played their parts well in this movie.  Denzel played the part of a crime boss perfectly - maintaining his cool regardless of what was going on.  At one point, he spots someone from a restaurant window, excuses himself, murders the man in broad daylight, and then walks back into the restaurant and says, \\"Now where was I?\\" as if nothing had happened.<br /><br />Russell Crowe also played the part of the honest cop well.  Despite pressure from his fellow cops, he \\"does the right thing\\" (in his job, if not in his family life.)  He's believable as the bungling cop who eventually figures out how to bring down crime boss, Frank Lucas (Denzel).<br /><br />Despite the good acting in this film, it still leaves a little something to be desired, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  The movie dragged at times and it was hard to really connect with either character, because the film never tells you what drove them.  They also had virtually no interaction in the film until the end, so there was no real chemistry between them, which made it like watching two good films, rather than one great one.

B000GH2YL0|4.0|The mantra \\"Greed is good\\" was uttered by that 1980s paragon of Wall Street virtue, Gordon Gekko, yet it could just have easily been any one profiled in this mind-warping 1990 account of the leveraged buyout (LBO) of cigarette-and-cookie conglomerate RJR Nabisco, starting with RJR's chief executive, Ross Johnson.<br /><br />Johnson was the one who first saw the benefits of taking RJR's undervalued stock private, boosting both his wealth and control. Small economies were not for him.<br /><br />\\"I'm telling you, we're not going to start running a pushcart operation here,\\" he tells his LBO partners at the outset. \\"I don't want a bunch of your guys coming around saying we should have five jets instead of six.\\"<br /><br />Those jets, used strictly by Johnson and his C-suite buddies for such emergencies as shuttling Johnson's beloved pet dog to safety after it bit someone, were one of many symbols of Johnson excess. Just as odd were his stabs at practicality, like introducing a smokeless cigarette, \\"Premier\\", which drew like chalk and tasted worse.<br /><br />Authors Bryan Burroughs and John Helyar, who covered the story in 1988 for the Wall Street Journal, seem to have been everywhere at once, and show no sign of suffering from lack of access. Whether it's LBO king and Johnson nemesis Henry Kravis, other bidding groups led by First Boston and Forstmann Little, or the RJR management board, everyone seems well represented. One gets the feeling some of these people enjoyed the chance to tell of their small part in one of the biggest stories of the decade.<br /><br />Yet nothing seemed on the level here, least of all the money put up by the bidders, which had a heavy reliance on junk bonds. Numbers themselves made no sense. At one point in the bidding, Kravis engineers a deal whereby he and his partners are paid their operating expenses by RJR in exchange for hanging around another hour.<br /><br />\\"Forty-five million dollars to wait sixty minutes. Incredibly [RJR head legal adviser Peter] Atkins and Company thought it was a good deal.\\"<br /><br />Burroughs and Helyar's greatest accomplishment is by sending you deep enough behind the looking glass that you understand Atkins' position. The authors do a great job of bringing the rest of the fantasy world to life with welcome doses of color and wit.<br /><br />At times, especially at the end, they get hung up with the level of detail they present, telling us not only who was at a particular meeting but where they sat, who was eating an apple, who was wearing a puff handkerchief, what color it was, etc.<br /><br />But the book is solid and well-written, and not nearly as snippy as it could have been. Only Johnson's buddy Ed Horrigan comes off as a complete hardcase. Johnson himself seems fairly amiable even at his greediest.<br /><br />The well-remembered HBO adaptation softsoaps Johnson further by having him played by the quintessentially smooth James Garner. It's an enjoyable movie that made me want to read this. Now I find the book preferable for the more balanced way it handles other characters like Kravis and Ted Forstmann (a joke character in the movie, but a prescient figure in the book who came up with the expression that makes for the title.) There are a lot of brickbats in evidence here, but no axes.<br /><br />Greed is still with us, of course, yet \\"Barbarians\\" takes us to a time when it managed at once to be more comical and stylish than today.as a good deal.\\"    Burroughs and Helyar's greatest accomplishment is by sending you deep enough behind the looking glass that you understand Atkins' position.

B000002OR4|5.0|I love movie soundtracks, and these are what I typically turn to when I want to hear orchestral music (instead of classical music).<br /><br />The SCHINDLER'S LIST sdtk is beautifully haunting, and it's great whether you've seen the movie or not (but better if you HAVE seen it).  John Williams does it again...this man MAKES the movie, so many times, allowing us to take a piece of it w/ us, as it lives on in our memories through the music he creates.  He really knows how to capture the themes and emotions of a film.<br /><br />Just as I've unwittingly bought multiple Tom Hanks movies, I've noticed that my soundtrack collection includes a number of John Williams' works.  With his versatility and genius, it's no wonder...

B000GH2YPG|3.0|Rebecca is a classic, but its thrill comes from the suspense and, especially, certain twists.  So once you've read or seen the whole story, you can never fully reexperience the fun.  If you haven't experienced it yet, I strongly recommend you do so through the Hitchcock movie rather than the book.  Do not read further.  Go rent the movie.<br /><br />WARNING:  SPOILER.  Do not read past this point unless you already know what happens. . .<br /><br />  The gothic suspense makes this book a deserved classic. Nonetheless, it left a sour taste in my mouth.  In my view, it is not well-suited for contemporary sensabilities; the movie endures much better.  The movie reviews tend to make much of the story that producer David O. Selznick forced Hitchcock to stay true to the book.  However, several critical changes by Hitchcock make all the difference to the contemporary viewer.  Warning, once again, my highlighting of these differences gives it all away.<br /><br />  1)  In the movie, Maxim confronts Rebecca, but does not actually kill her.  In the book, he is a murderer.  While that makes the outcome of the book a little more ironic, it robs the hero of any appeal to the contemporary reader.  Adultery as justification for homicide may have been more palatable to readers 70 years ago, but Hitchcock was wise to make Maxim innocent.<br /><br />  2)  I couldn't help but understand the book to be saying that what made Rebecca so horrible, such a repulsive being, was not just her licentiousness but that she was a lesbian.  After the marriage she told Maxim \\"what she was,\\" and the allusions continue throughout.  The book suggests, essentially, that Rebecca deserved her fate for her sexuality.  It's a reefer madness of homophobia.  In the movie, Hitchcock at least makes infedelity, rather than sexual preference, the core of Rebecca's sin.<br /><br />  3)  Hitchcock allows Joan Fontaine's shyness to be understandable and allows her some growth in gumption as the movie progresses.  Her utter helplessness from start to finish in the book grows tiresome as a portrayal of a heroine.<br /><br />  4)  Finally, the opening scenes of the book reveal that Maxim and the narrator have lives permanently and deeply scarred.  They live in fearful seclusion.  The movie permits a sense that they live happily ever after (albeit, not at Manderlay).  A feeling I prefer to be left with (call me a sap).<br /><br />  For an excellent, contemporary treatment of a similar story, that is how someone of DeMauier's skill might have written Rebecca today, read [[ASIN:0743298039 The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel]], which deftly avoids the flaws that plague Rebecca in the 21st Century.
1401300529|5.0|As a child growing up in New York my memories of the Korean War include a social studies class with the words \\"Aggression in Korea\\" written on the blackboard and, later, a ticker tape parade for Douglas MacArthur.  More than fifty years have passed since then.  Other world events made headlines and the war that nobody seems to have won faded from interest.  During all those years though, David Halberstam was honing his skills as a journalist, including a Pulitzer Prize for his epic work about the Vietnam War, The Best and the Brightest.  He was always fascinated by what happened in Korea though, and after several years of research, produced this epic analysis of the causes, the costs, the politics and all the players of this somewhat unappreciated period in American history.  Sadly, just days after submitting the completed manuscript to his publisher, he was tragically killed in a car accident, leaving this final masterwork for future generations.<br /><br />The book is more than 700 pages long, including all the footnotes.  It took me several months to read because it is so dense with facts that a few pages were all I could absorb at one time.  I was fascinated though and details would echo in my mind until I picked the book up again, feeling the pull of this history with all its characters, battles, politics, miscalculations, subtleties and finely honed portraits of all the important players.  It's all there, the victory in WW2, the atom bomb and the occupation of Japan under Douglas MacArthur, whose personal biography is traced back for several generations and who comes across as an arrogant self-righteous despot with little regard for the waste of human life.<br /><br />Halberstam interviewed former soldiers for up-close and personal descriptions of the battles.  He researched thousands of government documents, including diaries of President Truman and correspondence with General Ridgway.  There were differences of opinions and conflicts in Washington and names such Dean Atchison, Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall which I have only heard in passing, became real to me.  I learned about the conflict between Mao and Stalin and the leaders of both North and South Korea.  I learned about how the threat of communism led to the excesses of Senator Joseph McCarthy.<br /><br />I know I'll never remember the names and details all the battles.  But I will remember the incredible hardships of the fighting men on both sides with temperatures well below zero on mountainous terrain.  Some American forces were sent to battle in only their summer uniforms.  The tanks and trucks were not suited to the landscape.  The ammunition was all wrong.  Weapons that had been supplied to Nationalist China had all been taken by the Chinese Communists and were now being used against the Americans.  Over and over I cringed with horror at all the mistakes and miscalculations.  War is horrible, particularly when the cause is based on politics and ego.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It was worth all those hours and hours and hours of reading.  It is truly a masterpiece and a lasting tribute to a great journalist.

B000YENUI6|3.0|I really liked Cronenberg's \\"A History of Violence\\" and was looking forward to this movie.  In some ways I was slightly disappointed.  There was a lot of buzz about this movie and Mortensen has been nominated for an Oscar for his performance.  He was really good in this movie, but the character doesn't have to show a whole lot of range.  He plays an on-the-rise member of the Russian mafia in London.      The fact that the movie is set in London and involves the Russian mafia is rather unique, however, I couldn't help but feeling that I've seen these characters before.  The movie is littered with cliches.  Armin Mueller-Stahl plays a most likeable yet evil mafia boss.  Like movies such as \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\", the film portrays a mafia boss as a wonderful family man.  We're first intruduced to him as he prepares a meal for a family gathering in his restaurant.  Things are just a little too perfect.  You have the usual thugs keeping guard, and all these people arriving dressed up bearing birthday gifts and walking by the thugs like they were part of the furniture.      Another cliche is the boss's son.  He's out of control.  Unlike his calculating father, he's reckless and everything he does jeopardizes the family.  He would have fit right into a story line in \\"The Sopranos\\".  He'd be the loose canon relative who the boss is always covering up for and the only reason anyone tolerates him is because of his family standing.      Cliches or not, \\"Eastern Promises\\" is a decent movie.  The story about how Naomi Watts' character falls in with the gang is one of the unique things in the movie.  She's an outsider who unwittingly steps into the lion's den of the Russian mafia. Evil and violence are with us in every scene but aside from a few scenes, there isn't a whole lot of actual violence in the movie.  The last time I felt this in a movie was in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\".  People called it a violent movie but violence occupied only about 10 minutes of the movie.  When the violence is there, it isn't pretty.  It's painful.      The end was refreshing for a Hollywood film.  The final scene was fitting for the story and will leave you with wanting to see what the future holds.  If you are a fan of Cronenberg's work, or Viggo Mortensen, you'll be satisfied with this film.  It's not a great work, but it is rather well done despite the cliches.
B000UR9T7I|2.0|I love the Spider-Man series.  I don't understand why Blu-ray costs so much more than a regular DVD.
B0010ZR160|1.0|Won't include any specific \\"spoilers\\", but you may want to skip over, if you haven't seen the film.  What could've been a terrific film, turned into a disappointing liberal minded flick...      Casey Affleck (who did a fine job), unfortunately played a character who turned out to be nothing more than a piece of liberal trash...  Ben Affleck did a decent job of directing the movie, but truly ruined what could've been a great ending, and really went the way of the \\"We can't and shouldn't waterboard terrorists\\" thinking liberal, bleeding heart.      Not that it should be surprising, coming from one such as Affleck (or Hollywood for that matter), but when it comes to semantics, the liberals are ALWAYS on the wrong side of the issues.  Sometimes, you HAVE to bend the rules and do what it takes, to MAKE THINGS RIGHT (or to save lives), PERIOD! Ed Harris's character had it right, and people that think differently wouldn't be on MY side, either!    Oh, and by the way, if Casey Affleck's character thought he was all high and mighty, and the righteous one (ruining the lives of SEVERAL fine people in the film), then why not turn himself in and confess what he did during the 3rd quarter of the film.  It was clearly pre-meditated and obviously NOT self-defense.  Perhaps that's one thing Benjamin overlooked, when writing the script...    Had the movie going the 5 star route, but subtracted 4 stars, for the garbage ending!

B000MXPE7O|3.0|This is a very hard film to love, eventhough it resonates from a good screenplay and top notch acting.  Damon is in top form and a stoic spook, his character is hard to like much less love, I really could not for the life of me figure out why Jolie stays with him for so long; he is a bad husband and an even worse father, it is heart wrenching to watch his young son beg for his father's attention and Damon all but ignore him.  Damon puts country above all else and its amazing how startlingly obtuse he is about his families needs.  The film is beautifully shot and though quite lengthy its does not lag.  I really liked Michael Gambon in this, he is not what he seems and his advice to Damon, though not heeded, was the most valuable intelligence Damon gets..get out while you still can.  Damon's character does several things in this movie, that seem so out of character for someone so measured and with very good survival skills, but i suppose it's to propel the narrative, but still it's perplexing.  Be sure to watch the deleted sceens, because, it includes a story line that should have been kept in the movie, De Niro should have cut some of himself out of this film and left some of the deleted sceens in.  There is a great sceen toward the end with Joe Peci, and Peci asked Damon, and im perapharsing, he says...we italians have family and church, the irish have the irish nationalism, the jews have tradition, and he asked Damon, what do you have..meaning the WASP establishment I suppose, and Damon says..I have the united states of america, you people are only visiting..it's shocking in its honestly perfectly illuminates how a person of his time and place would have thought..in a word..scary!
0805079831|5.0|There really isn't anything i can add that hasn't been said by the other 200 reviewers.  Only that there should be a 6th star to rate it & this is one of maybe 10 books in the entire amazon stock that would truly deserve it.  I can only compare it to Leon Trotsky's The Revolution Betrayed in the way it spells out so well what went so horribly wrong.  For such information-packed writing it is a real \\"page-turner\\" with the bonus of ending with what i can agree is an accurately hopeful note.
B000244EMO|5.0|The last time I saw Predator was when I was pretty young and at that time I loved it. Luckily age has been very good to the film being that it was even better then I remembered. As far as sci-fi flicks go this is by far one of the best. It has just the right amount of sci-fi and action to make it a non stop classic.<br /><br />The story follows a group of commandos sent on a rescue mission deep into the heart of the South American jungle. However there mission doesn't go quite as planned. They have just walked into the biggest nightmare of their lives going up against an creature not from this earth. The mission focus quickly changes to how they will be able to survive.<br /><br />This is a tremendous flick. It has everything you need, especially if you are a guy. I would absolutely recommend Predator for any fan of the genre.
B00008976Y|5.0|Plot:     A young widow tries to escape her grief by moving to Paris, but, is escape possible.     My Review:     The 'Three Colours' trilogy is made by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the director of a small multitude of brilliant and exceptional French films, The Double Life Of Veronique; being one of his best.     Remarkable performances are endowed with the protagonist Julie (Juliette Binoche) surviving a car crash that claims the lives of her famous composer husband and five-year-old daughter, Julie (Binoche) makes an anonymous new start in a Paris flat; trying to regain her life.     A stern, frozen response to her persona in much the same of this review being short and bereft of essence. She construes vivid memories, haunted by music from her late husband's unfinished piece, a child's laugh could be heard.     Verdict:     Kieslowski: well done. 9/10.
1401207928|5.0|I saw the Film first, then read the Graphic Novel. Loved both of course and very much would recommend it. Read the book first, the language and writing is as much satired and flamboyant that it feels more ambigious as in the film, the film has its own excellent adaptation of the novel, which makes it more enjoyable. The book has a more Vaudeville and Neo-Dickens-on outlook of it, and it pars well in that much of it feels very cinematic. Both good versions of a cunning and elequent story. 9/10.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Plot:     East Berlin, 1984. State Security begins surveillance on playwright and, on the surface at least, good socialist Georg Dreyman (Koch). But as the operation progresses, Stasi Captain Wiesler (Mühe) discovers compassion in his stony soul.     My Review:     In the early days of modern entertainment, cinema was a new and exciting method of being amused. In those days, German filmmakers were among the most pioneering, innovative and interesting, with classic silent features like Metropolis, Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. However, a lot has occurred between then and now and the country has undergone a long period of troubled history.     This compelling, if not brilliant, masterpiece is European film-making at its finest and proof of an exciting renaissance in German cinema, proof that it has never lost its touch and sense of appeal. It's apparent why The Lives Of Others is this years Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film. This piece focuses on the inevitable human tragedy at the heart of a paranoid political regime that treats everyone as a potential enemy. It contrasts the administrations success to the demising sight of a regime whose tight grip is in a chokehold around its own neck, forcing its best into exile or suicide. Where, a establishment thought it was venerating itself, has become obsessed and distrustful of its own members, it collapses on itself.     In the starting days of East Germany's Ministry for State Security - 'Stasi'- had many hundreds of thousands members, who for the most part where more 'informants', ordinary members of the public were coerced into spying on their friends, family and neighbours; most through blackmail, public infringement or fear of disappearing into a forgotten cell. Alternatively, like many followers, love for the Communist system, but perhaps it's not happenstance that this story begins in the 1984.     Our limelight focus is given to Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), who played the German officer in dir. Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, with flowing locks and open-necked shirts has a charismatic air that encompasses him. Koch's Dreyman is the ocular opposite of Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), whose impassive attitude is the archetype of emotional repression. And a beautiful actress girlfriend (Martina Gedeck). The film inclusively revolves around the characters bearable outlook on each other, which are hopelessly intricate and bound together and yet they barely share a scene. Good example of this inability of tolerance is sitting in an empty attic, listening to bugging devices.     We get a slowly building picture that sneaks into Wiesler's exterior, as his attitude to his subject moves from disapproval to envy to compassion, a man who has sacrificed his personal life and lost a large part of it, all in service of his country that he has tried so eloquently in protecting. An adhering of his homeland and what he has had to given up. It's a truly memorable performance.     Verdict:     A very personal story, set against an magnanimous backdrop of politics and power games. Enlightening. 9/10.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|Plot:     Britain in 2027 is under totalitarian government with a regime under control of the militia. The world is on the brink of collapse because no children have been born for 18 years. Theo (Owen) agrees to escort a refugee to safety, but soon finds his life is in danger from both government and revolutionaries...     My Review:     \\"The future's a thing of the past.\\" This the main tag-line given to a film that endeavours and doesn't quite succeed in depicting P. D. James' interpretation of the future where Mankind is dying and facing complete extinction. This film makes the point astoundingly that the idea of it being the future, may seem far more backward then we have come to expect.     What this piece does is recall the dustily depicted utopia that has become downfallen. Children Of Men takes the action movie conventions and twists them so much that its hard to recognise, it recalls the sporadic virtues of a satire, as the bemused main character Theo (Clive Owen) begins his adventure, conflicting and smashing from odd encounters to the next.     Amid the brilliantly executed explosions true filmmaking is exposed in one superlative tracking shot that covers a mini-siege in Bexhill.This may be the only good part of the film.     Dir. Cuarón has done something not incredible, but satisfactory. Cuarón's film is provocative, flowing with rich ideas and invention but never too conceited to stop and crack jokes.     Verdict:     Amazing and visually stunning in its own satire, however, not welcoming to the stunning work of P.D James. 7.5/10. Barren plot, with intense action.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Plot     Celebrated Victorian stage magician Alfred Borden (Bale) stands accused of the murder of professional rival Rupert Angier (Jackman). The Prestige traces the course of their bitter feud, as their respective acts of sabotage become ever more deadly.     I saw this film after my University lectures, which had gone on long enough, had finished and was looking forward to ending the day with a very well made film as I enjoyed Nolan's' Batman Begins & Memento.     The film opened similar to that of entry of his earlier work 'Batman Begins'. Nolan introduces the main title and the feel of the film from the start is similar to that of Begins. Though the thought people comparing this film to that of Batman Begins is obviously misplaced; as the film is shot similarly and similar tone of colour, is not at all similar as the story is far more complex and draws you in at first with the death of the main character Robert Angier (Jackman). The film follows the two's friendship to the demise of Angier's wife, and their eventual friendship, and the bitterness of tension they need for a large audience attention. The film was outstanding and leaves you with a great ending twist.     After leaving the cinema, I was not at all disappointed and I enjoyed it tremendously and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. Great drama, emotion and the tension between the two rivals of Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman and Alfred Borden played by Christian Bale. The acts performed by these two rivals, though seeming like an 'old trick', is interesting to see how the earlier work of magicians like to baffle the audience before the turn of the century. What \\"The Prestige\\" does very well is re-produce a period of show business history near the end of the century in which competition between magicians was brought on by a secret and aggressive way of determining ones secrets. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain.     Although this type of film may feel like the type played by Christian Bale, but not Hugh Jackman; it in fact works very well with both of them. Their performances are outstanding. It's a great way to show their acting ability in a film that doesn't usually conform to the types of a film in cinema today. They've removed themselves from the superheroes they play, and brought together, with their two different backgrounds, a well made, thought provoking and acted film.     The feel/tone of the film is based on their amounting and rising tension between the two rivals for an amazing magic trick. I usually like magic tricks that conform to the allusion and the feeling of determining how the magicians do it. But though the time set of this film is early Victorian Britain, it does show how past magicians plagued each other for each other's secrets or methods of upon improving existing performances. This can be more interesting than that of the actual trick. Usually the rivals strive to bring back their disappeared acts, hence the title 'The Prestige'. The tricks may seem old and antiquated, but the idea on how the two discover and elude each other is far more interesting. The tension between the two rivals is caused by the accidental death of Angier's (Jackman) assistant, who also is in fact his wife. Angier wants to determine how Borden (Bale) played a part in the act involving his wife as he seems to think he's responsible.     Previously working on 'Batman Begins', Michael Caine pulls out a great supporting role of the character Cutter and assistant of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). He this time chooses to work with Hugh as his trick set-piece designer and helping him develop new ways of showing the same trick. He seems to act more the role of Angier's conscience     Scarlett Johansson, as Olivia Wenscombe, performs her character brilliantly, as well as keeping that American accent of hers out of the performance.She eventually plays Angier's assistant to, as well as steal Borden secrets, his love interest. While we focus on Jackmans' part, we see how Borden, played by Bale, is coping with an ever growing jealously and pride while his rival is making new performances and while his family life also faces crisis. Rebecca Hall plays the character of Bales wife, Sarah Borden. She provides more depth to the character of Borden (Bale) and isn't just a background character. She has her own voice and opinions, eventually asking him to stop as it seems like and obsession, that show how Bales character acts to his continuous jealousy towards Angier.     Borden (Bale) also spends time in prison reading the journal of Angier's and understanding how he tried to reveal the talented magicians' (Bale) secrets. The two both read each other's journals, eluding each other, and striving ambition begins to show more and more between them. They compliment each other brilliantly. Two other actors could not have done justice to these parts. They must have had enormous respect and patience with Nolan.     Verdict 8.5/10     Definitely worth the DVD purchase, however sometimes that these films are not the type of films people go to see in the cinema. This is in fact one of those occasions that if you purchase the DVD, whilst not viewing the film in the cinema, it's absolutely worth the money.

B000002UA9|5.0|There is really not much to say.  Everyone knows the beatles and their music.  There is very little that I would not like.  There is always a song or two that don't particularily empress but for the most part it's a good album or should  I say CD.

This was one of the very first CDs I just had to have to start my collection over again. I originally had this LP from probably the late 70s or early 80s when it was rereleased back then as I was only 4 years old when it first came out, unlike some of you old timers. I am proud to say it is still a great cornerstone to any music collection, even for us young whipper snappers.

B001041JLE|4.0|In 1982, I never was born.. ha ha.. im only 22, i heard all his songs before but i never bought Thriller.  So I had to go ahead and buy Thriller 25 to check out whats new for 2008.  Im disappoint with the remix version of   Billie Jean. I thought Kanye West was gonna rap  on it after he say \\"uhh\\" and \\"yeah\\" but nothing but remake beat.  all his original songs are the best.. But songs like Wanna Start Something was tight and Girl is Mine is my favorite.  We already know MJ is coming back with a new album  this year and what, I didnt know Janet is dropping her new album out in two days.
0765318741|1.0|This book sucks, you read it and get to the middle of the book to be left with no sort of ending. The author then just goes off and writes a whole bunch of stupid short stories which you think are going to bring you back to the main character, but doesn't and your left feeling like you just wasted all your time reading this stupid book.
0441003257|4.0|What do you get when you combine an award-winning humor author with an award-winning fantasy author?  An award-winning humorous fantasy book that plays off the strengths of both contributors.  This is an amazing collaboration that lives up to everything it should be.  It's got an interesting plot, great characters, hip spirituality, and the entire story is laced with jokes that had me laughing out loud.    The only downside is the length of the book.  Some parts dragged too much for my taste - I would have preferred a shorter, more intense and punchier story.  (I do appreciate that it didn't become a series, though, as I prefer my novels standalone)  As it is I still recommend it to many as a shining example of today's best British sci-fi/fantasy humor, right alongside Douglas Adams' fantastic \\"Hitch-hiker's Guide\\" series.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I love this Album......It just gets better and better with Britney! You will not be disappointed. I love the song \\"Why should I be Sad\\" it  is somewhat of  a diss to Kevin. I also love the songs-Radar, gimme more, piece of me, & freakshow. Britney is so awesome....
B00009W0U4|3.0|Only Monica Belluci's fabulous beauty saves this disaster of a movie from ending up in the trash barrel.  The plot is difficult to follow and not separated into scenes.  It's too violent.  Most of the characters are very unattractive, if not downright ugly.  A mess, except for Monica.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|This was one of my childhood movies that I loved to watch again and again..... If you loved the first movie(the wizard of Oz) and have some background of the books you will love to continue the story of Oz with this sequel. Warning for young children their are some mild dark parts of the movie, \\"The wheelers\\" and \\" Princess Mombie\\" may be a little much for young children... So parents pre-screen and decide for yourself. I was a brave child and was not phased by them at all.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Don't miss this movie.  We are a musical family, performers, song writers, etc., and this movie touched us all.
0307388840|3.0|Very well written, even though the story itself is less than the writing/prose. I can see this being a book in the list of literature in college must reads. I constantly felt like I was getting ready to write a book report on the foreshadows and metaphors within. However, the story keeps you going, much like the Great Gatsby. Beautifully written and easily transposed into the ah-ha's, I've felt that way before! The story itself is sorrowful and yet I am still wondering what was true and what was fabricated by Briony. Perhaps I was looking too hard for the inside scoop. This book is for a literary respective, not necessarily a story driven reader. I like both, so therefore, I enjoyed it, but not everyone will like reading it more so than watching the movie.

B0001907DA|5.0|This series is about of misfits that join the police department and follows them through the years. Its cast includes some of the biggest stars of the 80s and 90s and its as funny today as it was when it was new. One of the few series that is actully funny from the first one to the last one. My personal favorite is where the group goes to Miami Beach. That one always has me rolling!
B000X5KSWM|4.0|If Tarja were a new artist, people would be raving about her soaring voice and her lovely stage presence, and would look forward to the next album.    I would like to see her do the more soaring vocals, like I Walk Alone, and do songs with more of an edge. But all in all a fine album from one of the best vocalist in all of pop.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Nearly 30 years after their last full-length studio album, expectations for this were bound to be high.  Also, I do seem to recall that some of the older Eagles albums took a few listens before I came to appreciate them.  But after listening to Long Road Out of Eden several times over the course of a few months, I have to conclude that it's not a matter of inflated expectations or not giving fair chances - it just doesn't measure up to their best work.    It does come close in some places.  \\"How Long\\" has that same perfect combination of country-rock punchiness and wounded tough guy lyrics that graced so many of their classics. \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\" is nearly as good; it's yet another look at the wild abandon lifestyle described in \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" and such, but there's nothing wrong with sticking to a familiar formula if it works this well.  The same goes for \\"Somebody,\\" which revisits the paranoia theme that they have covered so well before, and \\"Frail Grasp on the Big Picture,\\" yet another of Don Henley's wonderfully vicious put-downs of middle-American complacency.  The ten-minute title track, while uncharacteristic of a band that always kept it short and sweet in the past, does succeed in breaking new ground for the guys for a change.  The lovely \\"It's Your World Now\\" is one of their better closing tracks.    But most of the other songs, especially on the first disc, are trite and instantly forgettable.  Thanks to the miracle of skip buttons, it's easy enough to pass them over in favor of the better moments.  But one does have to wonder why they felt the need to water down their catalog with a relatively weak outing when it does contain the makings of a much stronger one, if only they'd stuck to a one-disc set with the highlights of what's found here.  If I had to guess, I'd say it has something to do with all four remaining Eagles wanting their share of the new set after all these years.  If so, I can see why there was no new album for all that time!
B000QQFKYE|4.0|Well Inland Empire is a long, slow, and different film from anything I've ever seen, and that is both a good thing and a bad thing. Even though I have seen Eraserhead I was not prepared for the mind[....] that is Inland Empire. Clocking in at around three hours and most of time moving at a snails pace, just when you think you have it figured out Lynch throws you off with something way out of left feild......3 hours of that gets really confusing. Dont get me wrong I really did liked it alot, but the long running time and slow pace did keep me from enjoying as much as I could have. I do recommend it because I like the fact that Lynch is trying to make his viewers think a little bit, and I look forward to \\"studying\\" it many more times in the future.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky<br /><br />The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is refreshingly honest, and remarably somehthing everyone can relate to. We have all had those moments of times in our lives where we didnt fit in and even if we did fit in felt as though we didn't belong. This tale of self-discovery is in the same vein as that of the classic Catcher In The Rye, and just as every bit as moving. This really is a book for it's time, one that todays generation will regard as a classic in the years to come. The already impressive cult status of Stepehn Chbosky has only increased ten fold with the release of this book insuring him a place in the hearts of young readers much in the same way as Chuck Palhinuik has. The halariously written letters along side the so-low-you-can't-get-back letters make for an interesting contrast much as in the way the real world works, especially in the termultous life of a teen-age highschool student. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a book for the ages.
B0000028M7|5.0|I was initially hesitant to give Alice in Chains a chance because I'd heard \\"Man in a Box\\" before and didn't like it, and so I assumed all their music was that way. After reading that they had good albums like Dirt and were a band with grunge roots (Though that's certainly debatable) I decided to pick Dirt up because it's considered to be their best album. Upon first listen I was a little disappointed, I thought, what's so great about it, it's just the lead singer complaining about his drug problems.\\" But there was enough there upon first listen that I decided to keep listening to it to see if I could find what I'd missed the first time around. And finally I got it.    Why is this album so good? First let's start with the sound. After hearing a couple songs I found myself saying \\"Oh so this is where Staind and Aaron Lewis copped their sound from. After hearing the genuine article I now consider Staind to be an \\"emo Alice In Chains\\". Layne Stayley's drone vocals have inspired many singers if you think about it objectively.  His vocals work well within the context of the songs because the music matches the pace of his delivery, much like The Police back in the 80's  Because of this, you don't even notice that the end of each lyric rhymes. The songs all plod along until they get to the chorus and the cycle repeats itself. This isn't a criticism, just an observation.    Second, a critic may say that the lyrics are depressing and graphic, and that since basically every song is about drugs, the album is too one dimensional to be considered great. Yes, most of the songs are about Staley's heroin addiction, but they aren't meant to be depressing, they were just the reality that he was dealing with at the time and he attempted to deal with it by turning them into songs. These songs don't advocate heroin use as much as people may believe the contrary. If anything they subtlety show what can happen if you become addicted.   In my opinion there is something to be said for beingable to talk about one's drug use without hiding behind lyrical euphemisms and \\"safe\\" generalities. Most people know that most rock stars do drugs evey now and again, sometimes more, but I've yet to hear another album that deals with these issues so openly without caring what others may think. This approach may make songs like \\"Junkhead\\" and its shockingly blunt chorus tough to listen and relate to, but like almost every song on here, it's catchy and easy to sing along to. I sometimes find myself singing it and I'm no \\"Junkhead\\"    I like all the songs on here, but \\"Dam That River\\" doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the album. Even radio friendly songs like \\"Down in a Hole\\" still maintain the bleak outlook established by earlier songs and keep the album from hitting any real \\"commercialized\\" speed bumps along the way.    Some of my favorite songs are \\"Rain When I Die\\" (Gotta love the way Staley's voice soars effortlessly into the chorus) and \\"Junkhead\\" for the introspective ominous guitar solo that grounds the otherwise defiant Heroin anthem. \\"Sickman comes at you as if it were shot out of a cannon with Staley welcoming listeners with a disconnected \\"yeah\\" into one of his bad heroin experiences like the operator of a wild ride you can't get off of. The song's music and lyrics start of fast and energetic before it crashes with a sobering jolt before starting up again, thus successfully creating an allusion to the highs and lows of drug use.    Give this album a chance. It will grow on you.

B000W04S6U|5.0|That's right.  Halo 1, 2, 3, I've never played.  I picked this soundtrack up on a whim at WalMart and I haven't regretted it.<br /><br />Even in the softer pieces, there's an energy that just doesn't quit it.  It's a soundtrack for your own day-to-day life which isn't far from tactical combat.<br /><br />This is the soundtrack of a company of soldiers in a grueling campaign trying to hit hard while conserving strength.  I think all of us can relate.

B00000IREA|3.0|Jane Fonda's transition from innocence to experience---a documentary of the anti-culture doing its thing. It is Fonda showing daddy and the Hollywood establishment that she is a big girl and will take pleasure where she finds it. As Queen of the Galaxy, she does just that. Durand-Durand is the actor who played Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet. He tries to kill Barbarella with ecstasy only to have his machine shorted out by this insatiable woman. I saw Barbarella at a drive-in. I was drunk and had to watch it again years later. It was directed by Roger Vadim. Fonda and Vadim married and had a daughter.

This book really showed how we take life for granted.  THe only fault I found with the book is that I wanted to know more of his experience in Guinea and how he got back to America.  Good book
B000QUUD60|4.0|Elvis' concert film of his Las Vegas act. Elvis had a way of owning the songs he sang. His movies made money but hurt his career. As the movies phased out, the era of the white jumpsuit began. Elvis dug in at the International Hotel in August, 1969. \\"Suspicious Minds\\" climbed to #1. He was back, giving The Beatles all they could handle. He performed at the International (now the Las Vegas Hilton) and did shows around the country for the next 8 years.
B000R4SMCW|2.0|This movie had all the potential in the world, but fell *way* short for a few major reasons.    The very best part of the entire movie came right in the beginning five minutes of film which was only one of two, yes that's right, TWO action scenes in the entire movie.  A husband shoots his wife right in the face.  At first we think she's dead, but later we find out she survives, but is lying in a hospital bed.  This was the only good moment because it was very mysterious when it happened.    As soon as that shooting scene is over, the movie slips into a *boring* story for the remainder of the film (the other 95% of the running time).  The only other segment I liked was at the very end.  It was certainly a twist, but not the best ending you've ever seen, and most likely not the kind of twist you wanted to see.    The entire story deals mostly with a lawyer who occasionally has some conversations with the crazy wife-shooting husband, and that was flat out WRONG.  Focusing on the lawyer more than the husband was a big mistake, because the husband was the one with the interesting character- he was basically a crazy old man who liked to play mind games.  Certainly more interesting than spending the majority of time focusing on the lawyer and his uninteresting relationship with his girlfriend (not to mention acting unbelievable in his lawyer role for the most part- he was very quiet, and didn't act like he really knew what he was doing).  Why did the writers wanna focus on THIS guy?   I have no idea.    And that makes up over 90% of the film.  Sometimes it really does matter which characters the writers choose to ignore, and which ones they choose to focus on.  A movie you should skip because it's not very satisfying.

B000HT34RA|5.0|I recently received this cd and like basically everything on it.It really shows how talented Peter Green was at the beginning of his career. The title track  shows Peter's use of restraint and taste to avoid &#34;overplaying&#34;.<br />The next two tracks, &#34;It's Over&#34; and &#34;You Don't Love Me&#34; (now I see where The Allman Bros. got some of their inspiration) are good but one might think &#34;Where's the guitar?&#34;. Then &#34;The Stumble&#34; comes on and knocks you out.<br /><br />&#34;Another Kind Of Love&#34; is another outstanding track with a slightly ominous feel to it.<br />Joe Bonamassa covered this tune on his latest CD &#34;Sloe Gin&#34; and I usually like how Joe reworks tunes when he covers them (You Upset Me Baby and Had To Cry Today come to mind) but this time the cover doesn't come close to the original and I usually just skip it.<br />The real show-stopper is &#34;The  Super-Natural&#34;, with an unbelievable use of controlled feedback.<br />Gary Moore did a great version of this song on his Blues For Greeny cd.<br /><br />This particular reissue of &#34;A Hard Road&#34; is also worth having for the bonus tracks it has especially &#34;So Many Roads&#34;, perhaps my favorite song on any John Mayall album and has been since I bought &#34;Looking Back&#34; in 1973 (I would also recommend Joe B's version on &#34;You and Me&#34; and The Climax Blues Bands version on FM Live-&#34;Pete Haycock on the Guitar!&#34;). Peter takes a ripping solo on this one.<br /><br />Here's the 3rd time deal. I first bought &#34;A Hard Road&#34; on cd back in 1995 with the standard 14 tracks but never really connected with it mainly because of the sound quality which seemed to accentuate the reverb in the mix, so I traded it away.<br />I found a copy on  Clean vinyl a couple of years ago and was in love but it fell on one of my stomp boxes and a chunk containing the first song broke off.<br />I discovered this 2006 reissue here on Amazon and I am 100% satisfied. The sound quality is awesome and the bonus tracks are great. This has everything I need and nothing I don't.. This has everything I need and nothing I don't.

B000Y7U98C|4.0|I love doomsday movies and books!  I mean, a new slant is always something great to see.  I purchased \\"Sunshine\\" because it was, certainly, a doomsday plot and it had some decent actors in it.<br /><br />Well, I wasn't disappointed!  \\"Sunshine\\" was worth the bucks and the 2 hours of my life.  It was in no way the best movie I had ever watched, but it was closer to that end of the spectrum.<br /><br />The plot, sun dying and ship with nukes to kick start it, is not a new plot by any means.  However, the jacket back talked about \\"twists and turns you won't see coming\\" and that was, for the most part, true and there were a lot of them!<br /><br />The acting was very good.  The characters never varied from their roles and you liked some of them, did not like others, felt sorry for some, and wanted to slap others.  I think the best part of the plot was the suspense created by the ever-changing life and death decisions that had to be made so many times.  Also, it helped immensely that almost all of the actors/actresses were people I had seen before in other, decent to good, films.  They did their job and lured you right into the thick of things.<br /><br />While I won't say that the ending was a tremendous surprise, getting there was.  Worth it!  Watch it!<br /><br />Scott
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|I am amazed this film is getting that positive of a review.  When I saw this turkey in the first week of release I was psyched to see another sniper story/thriller which the reviews made look like a good action packed movie.  There are some half-descent action sequences but that was not the focus of the film.  Mostly they were making a big political film and it spoiled most of the entertainment value for me.  They took what was otherwise a lackluster though passably entertaining film and flushed it down the toilet.  I am assured by a friend that if I had read the book I would be even more outraged at how stinky this film is.  I'll take his word for it.  I would suggest giving this thing a miss even if you are a Wahlberg fan.  I enjoyed 'Sniper' with Tom Berenger much more and that wasn't really a super movie either.  I'd give this movie a wide berth.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Brilliantly directed by Danny Boyle, SUNSHINE is a visually stunning science fiction suspense film. In the future, the Sun has been infected with a \\"Q Ball\\" and is not working the way it should. A ship, named Icarus I, with a bomb as dense as Manhattan, is sent to the sun and blow up the \\"Q Ball\\". The ship never arrives and almost two decades later another ship, Icarus II, is sent to complete the job. It is Earth's last hope--should they fail all life on Earth will completely freeze and die.<br /><br />As Icarus II approaches the destination, the crew comes in contact with the lost Icarus I. A decision is made to intercept the ship as two bombs would be better to have than just one. As the team boards Icarus I, they realize that something must have horribly went wrong and it becomes clear that now not only our their own lives in danger, but so is the fate of the mission and therefore all life on Earth.<br /><br />Visually, SUNSHINE is breathtaking. I found the effects, props, and cinematography amazing. The acting is also superb. Many times the acting in sci-fi films can feel either fake and cheesy or completely overdone. Not so here, the characters seem like real people and the audience can make a real connection with almost all of the characters. In regards to story, SUNSHINE is a mixed breed. It begins as a rather typically sci-fi film, but the last half of the movie quickly turns into a psychological suspense story. Also, even though the film does take some liberties with scientific theories and probabilities in order to make certain elements more realistic, the movie is scientifically very accurate. Boyle worked very closely with several scientists on the movie to ensure that much of what they were creating would be accurate.<br />Overall, I enjoyed SUNSHINE. It really liked the cinematography and effects and I was impressed with the acting. I also enjoyed the ending and was completely caught off guard by the twist in the plot 3/4ths of the way through the film.<br /><br />The DVD includes the usual director's, but this time with added commentary from the film's science advisor, Dr. Brian Cox.; deleted scenes, an alternative ending, and the original trailer. Also included are two short films, DAD'S DEAD and MOLE HILL. I found DAD'S DEAD to be the more interesting of the two, but it's also far more sinister. MOLE HILL is basically a sped-up film that looks at several mole hills over an extended period of time and how they change..<br /><br />The DVD includes the usual director's, but this time with added commentary from the film's science advisor, Dr. Brian Cox.; deleted scenes, an alternative ending, and the original trailer.

B000007U6V|5.0|Kraftwerk truly has a timeless masterpiece on their hands with Autobahn:    More than just electronica, the 22-minute long title track takes you on a journey down Germany's famed superhighway, complete with whizzing cars & trucks, flitting birds...you can feel the highway moving under you.  Florian Schneider's flute is simply gorgeous...    After the drive, we have 2 fantastic ambient pieces, \\"Kometenmelodie\\", followed by a midnight walk with \\"Mitternacht\\"...it all wraps up with \\"Morgenspaziergang\\" (morning walk, literally), which sounds like a 6 AM walk through the woods on a warm spring day.    A classic in every sense of the word, and a release that shaped electronic, and even mainstream, music as we know it today.
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|Disc is very good; HOWEVER, to get a full effect of the Las Vegas production, you have to be there to view the magnitude of the production, and the acoustics.  A DVD cannot duplicate this.
B0010ZR160|5.0|The power is in the details. Director Ben Affleck takes an well paced, richly textured and unflinching look at the hapless of Boston. It is like visiting a foreign land, without the smug, albeit false,  protection of malls and mini-vans.     The characters, mostly, are ugly. The sort that almost slither onto the screen. The sort you would not stand close to at the grocers. Even in this milieu there is one woman and a child that shine as worthwhile. Meanwhile the law enforcers do their job...and the law and the decency imposed is what keeps this social strate from slipping into the sewer.    The law enforcers do their job - except when they don't.    If it were not for one scene of haunting horror, this would be a great date movie. It is provocative and not a movie I will forget. That alone puts it in a very select caste.
0689878451|5.0|I recently saw a discussion on a television talk show about this charming little book.  Two of the women were mothers and were discussing how they wouldn't read this book to their children.  I had heard of the book before so I decided to buy the book and see for myself what might be \\"offensive\\" enough in a children's book to keep it away from little eyes.<br /><br />  What I found, is an enduring story (and a true one) based on two male penquins who form a bond so strong and loving that their keeper guesses \\"they must be in love.\\"  The story shows the two boy penquins doing all the same things the mated penquins do with the exception of hatching their own little baby.  After the keeper finds an extra egg that is laid by another penquin couple (penquins can only take care of one egg), he decides to give Roy and Silo (the male couple) a chance to rear a little one.  With much dedication, the two loving penquins take turns sitting on their nest and after a while, they hatch a cute little daughter, who is named Tango by the keeper.<br /><br />  To me, this book is a story of love.  It shows how families are made up of different components and yet, with differences, there can still be undying love.  I think many people might look at this book as only a children's book addressing homosexuality.  These people are missing the point.  This book is a story of love....the love two adults (regardless of gender) can have for each other and the love they can show a child that they raise.  It could also been seen, in my opinion, as a book about adoption, where a couple can't have children and how they still shower their baby with love though it is not their own biological creation.<br /><br />  I think the story is told with tenderness and is thoughtful of the mind of a child.  I don't think a small child would come away with anything more than two penquins who love their baby very much.  The illustrations are nicely done, simple but fun.  To anyone who wants to share of story of love and tolerance at an early age, this is a good book.  Highly recommended.tolerance at an early age, this is a good book.  Highly recommended.
B000OPOANE|3.0|Great music, as always from Rush!  However, I bought this to play in my car, which plays DVD-Audio in Surround Sound, and this product IS NOT COMPATIBLE!  Don't waste your money, just buy the standard CD, because this format they chose is not very compatible with modern DVD Audio systems.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I'll keep this brief, there are plenty of other reviews out there for this product already. I would say that its worth 5 stars except that, if you haven't seen the show before, it may take awhile to figure out if the heroes are really heroes or not (\\"Ok, theyre the main characters... wait, theyre robbing a bank... wait, the bankers are kinda bad... oh they shot that innocent guy... well it was 'an act of kindness'...\\" etc).  Once you see it once or twice (and you'll prob. watch it more than that), you should like it alot.    The other problem I had with this specific version of the dvd is that I was told (and assumed by the fact that there was another version), that the movie had the extra scenes added in. It does have even more extra scenes than the original copy (which had alot) but they aren't in the movie. So I paid for another copy of the same movie that i already had solely for a few more extras on the side.
B000VZK87O|3.0|Ironically, Kurt Cobain of all people wasn't as pleased as his fans at the incredible success of \\"Nevermind\\" and he even complained at producer Vig's over-polished treatment of the album although I think he did an excellent job.  After all, it's his pain here that people are getting happy about and so Kurt decides to come up with a less polished offering here in \\"In Utero\\" but despite his efforts, his genius still shines through making this although not as good as the brilliant \\"Nevermind\\" an excellent album on its own merits.  Kurt's genius on dynamics and melody continue to shine through and the fans still loved it!<br /><br />This version of the album in mini-lp sleeve i.e. mlps format isn't the best mlps design that I've seen as the cardboard used is thin and of low quality and poorly assembled.  Metallica's mlps version of \\"Master of Puppets\\" is a good example of what a good mlps design should look like in case you are wondering.  Bizarrely a mini calendar for just the months of July and August of 2008 is included together with a 16 page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Most importantly, the sound quality is okay but not brilliant and so given the large asking price for this baby, I'm struggling to find value in this particular version of the album.  Contentwise though, this represents among Nirvana's best ever works and should be in any music lover's cd library.
0307237702|4.0|As I write this it is late February 2008 and Barack Obama has come a long way since publishing this book. He now seems very likely to be not only the Democratic candidate but perhaps the next President of the United States.<br />So I read this book seeking to discern where and how he would act as President. And in fact the book is really more about his political principles and policies than about his own personal or private life. I in fact was disappointed at their not being more personal anecdote in the book.<br />As many have said Obama is a wonderfully skillful writer and communicator. He is readable, understandable and puts together ideas in a very clear way. He outlines his thoughts on health care, educational reform, reform of the political process, transcending party divisions for greater American unity, promoting the American economy, helping the middle - class and the poor. His writing on domestic issues occupies the greatest part of the book. He is essentially a conciliator and even when he advocates his 'pro-choice' position he is respectful and understanding of the 'pro-life' side.<br />He too shows himself as a politician who listens, who makes efforts to hear what people have to say.<br />On foreign policy he tries both to be supportive of American troops in Iraq and critical of the Bush government. He tells about his boyhood in Indonesia and shows his understanding of the complexity of this society, and other poorer societies. In fact in tracing the modern history of Indonesia he again proves an excellent writer.<br />While outlining the dangers presented by radical Iran and worldwide terrorism he nonetheless adopts a certain non- combative kind of speech and line. He seems to believe that he by personally talking to people will change their minds. This may work in America but it is doubtful that it will work with the Osama Bin Ladens and Mohammed Ahmadinejads.<br />He is a fresh voice and he may become what some hope he will be, the next great American President. There is however the possibility too that he will naively misread the character of the powers aligned against America and move it into decline.<br />In any case this book provides a picture of his basic system of beliefs and values.e is however the possibility too that he will naively misread the character of the powers aligned against America and move it into decline.

B0010E8MR8|5.0|When I first heard \\"Rage...\\" I had never heard anything quite like it except that it sounded to me like an intelligent mixture of Black Sabbath, Public Enemy and Led Zeppelin but even then, the originality of the pure hate and rageful vocals got me rivetted. These guys sounded like they really gave a hoot about the topics of all their tracks and in that way was reminiscent of Punk's the Sex Pistols and The Clash and yet despite all these comparisons, the band still managed to get their own signature sound. They are also great musicians and to think that all that great sound effects on the cd came just from Morello's guitar! The rhythm section is extremely tight and the vocalist is excellent. This is one great hard rock album and the strongest tracks are \\"Killing...\\" and my favourite, made famous by the Matrix soundtrack is \\"Wake Up\\". Another truly amazing thing about this disc is the production. Not only are these guys great songwriters and musicians but they produced this album too!<br /><br />This version of the album is a real treat for fans as the mini-lp replica design a.k.a. mlps format is quite well done.  Even the inner sleeve is a very faithful replica of the original lp and a glossy 8 page booklet with all the English lyrics and another non-glossy 30 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese is included together with an essay in that language too.  The sound quality is excellent too. Excellent tracks, great sound quality, highly recommended!
0060989157|5.0|This was an amazing book. Runs neck and neck with the heroin diarys. A must buy!
B000VZK7T8|5.0|I've already started seeing on more recent best of albums lists compiled by renowned music critics where this album is among the top 10 albums of all time along with albums by the Stones and the Beatles and I for one am not surprised.  This album is synonymous with an entire genre that it helped to create and with Kurt Cobain's demise, the demise of grunge was quick to follow.  The man despite his attempts at escaping the fact was a musical genius.  Many musicians, myself included, would have loved to have his great sense of melody and intuitive knowledge of how best to use dynamics i.e. the alternation of loud and harsh with slow and soft to create maximum aural impact.  Kurt had a great songwriting gift and he was able to put all the angst and frustrations he felt so eloquently down on track after track on this album.<br /><br />This version of the album is a treat for fans as it comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve a.k.a. mlps design which although isn't the best I've seen however contains a bizarre mini 2008 calendar covering just the months of March and April, an inner sleeve that faithfully represents the original lp design and a booklet of 12 pages containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Most importantly, the sound quality is very good as well and there is a bit of a surprise on the last track which is actually more than 20 minutes long as after a long pause at the end of \\"Something in the Way\\" we get a few minutes of outtakes with Kurt going even more mental than anything you've heard on any of the earlier tracks which I thought was interesting.<br /><br />This is a must have album for any self respecting music lover's cd library and is destined to become consistently recognised as an all-time classic album.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
0143038419|4.0|It took me quite a while to get into this book, about three months actually.  It is about someone elses personal journey and at times is like the friend who only obsesses on themselves that you seem to always be stuck with.  After months of scattered attempts to get into the book, my mother had emergency brain surgery with a high risk of death or life-long disabilities.  I chose this book to read on the plane and my week long stint in the hospital with my mother.  In the surreal setting of the hospital, surrounded by pain, suffering, hope, prayer, and family, the book became a source of strength.  Some of the mantras the author used I taught my mother to help her regulate her breathing and move past her pain.  I also developed a tremoundous desire to try a margherita pizza, and was not dissapointed when I found one.  There were several humorous and historical passages that I read aloud to my sister, father, mother, and the nurses.  I now feel that Liz is a close friend, and one that helped me through a trying time (though my amazing mother is recovering as only her superwoman self can and will be 100% again).  I can see how the book would not appeal to everyone, but for those that are drawn to self-exploration and search for meaning in their lives, or that would like to know where you can find a pizza so good you actually think it loves you back, Eat, Pray, and Love can be a handbook of sorts.
B00005MM01|5.0|This album is one of the rarest gems I own. Donovan's discography is considerable and covers ground from American Hillbilly ala Dylan to Jazz; all transversely covered with a combination of classic minstrel and psychedelia. This album was originally released in it's present form, as a two disk set - one disk of electric 1968 psychedelic music and one European, Scottish minstrel folk music. It was then released as a single disc - containing only the acoustic songs. I am very happy to see it returned in it's intended original majestic form. The electric songs on this album have never grabbed me. Donovan is pure psychedelia; he's the authentic thing. He's what hippies and beatniks should of evolved into if they had had the potential - classic renaissance men who embody myths. But the production of this album can't hold up to psychedelia. It's too reel to reel and sounds like it was recorded during a vacation on the Isle of White. But the acoustic is pure magic. It is educational in the sense that it exposes the true roots of US folk - European poets with voices like larks who actually could read and write. I highly recommend this CD to anyone. However, turn up the volume while listening. The sound production would be considered bootleg in our present era. Still, it's worth whatever tweaking you have to go through. You won't find a true minstrel again for a long, long time.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|My hat is off to J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, Carlton Cuse and their merry band of castaways. \\"Lost\\" may frustrate and even infuriate its fans for episodes on end, but the show's makers always manage to keep viewers enthralled over the long haul, winding them in ever stronger, ever stickier webs of plot, character revelation, and ominous portent. (For the record, I avoid the show during its regular broadcast season and catch up with it in one gulp on DVD, thus avoiding a good part of the frustration.) Season 3 continues the high standards of the first two seasons, presenting us with further details about the Others, the fate of the Dharma Initative, several intriguing new characters and shocking developments among the old characters that, no matter how closely you follow the show, are guaranteed to knock you for a loop. If you want to know how Locke ended up in a wheelchair, discover how Ben maintains his nefarious hold over the Others, or see a couple of the longtime characters (I won't say which ones) in the very first flashforward of life after the island, Season 3 will provide that, and more. It's still a marvel how Abrams, Cuse, Lindelof & Co. can lead us down ever more bizarre plot pathways, creating an almost Elizabethan body count along the way, and still keep a sense of total continuity. My favorite episode of Season 3 came almost exactly in its middle: the self-contained tale of minor characters Nikki and Paulo, giving us their backstory and their highly ironic ultimate fate. Alfred Hitchcock would have approved, and possibly Geoffrey Chaucer as well! Disc 7 of the set presents the expected deleted scenes and bloopers, as well as a fascinating tribute to \\"Lost's\\" crew, that dedicated group of obsessed techies who burnish the show to a pristine and mesmerizing glow.
B00138EXE2|5.0|I first owned this album on vinyl!  The entire second side was The Gold Bug through Turn of a Friendly Card 2.  It is more than just music tracks.  The album's second side tells a story.  And having been to Las Vegas I can tell you that they hit the nail squarely on the head.  I think The Alan Parsons Project is a great group and, for me, this is the best album they ever recorded (\\"Eve\\" is a close second).
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is absolutely the best set of DVDs you may ever watch.  If you know nothing about WWII, you must watch Band of Brothers.  You will be able to develop a great appreciation for what these men did for our country, and what they had to give up.  The men this series was written about are true American heroes in the largest sense.
B00104W8T6|5.0|Ah, Juno.  \\"The little movie that could\\". I know that dozens, if not hundreds, of reviews just like this have already been written, but I just have to speak, er, rather, type my mind. Let me begin by stating that I have been in love with this movie since I first even heard about it in late summer of last year.  At the time, I was raving about this movie that looked amazing, but because no one had really heard of it, everyone sorta ignored me.  A few months later, this movie is the most popular one in the country.  I'm just saying.  Anyways, having previously stated my love for this movie, it is rather obvious that I would love the soundtrack too. And I know I'm not the only one, seeing as how the soundtrack remained at the top of the charts for weeks, and continues to be in the top 10 of overall albums and number one in soundtracks. On to the music.  As a collection, its quirky and low-fi, which just so happens to be a desirable characteristic in the music I devote my time to. The abundance of anti-folk made me INCREDIBLY happy. Being a fan of the Moldy Peaches, I was stoked to see the name Kimya Dawson printed all over the back of the case [as well as the Moldy Peaches themselves]. I was also pleasantly surprised by a band I had never heard of before, Belle & Sebastian. The Scottish indie pop band creates truly memorable songs that stick in your head and refuse to leave. I cannot review every song individually, so I will just state one simple word to sum up the loveliness that is the Juno soundtrack. Brilliance.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you liked the feel of Moulin Rouge, you'll like this movie...its commentary is amazing.  The music (Beatles), of course, is great too, and I usually don't like it when new people redo old songs.  I got it a couple weeks ago and have watched it seven times.
0143038419|5.0|I can only say that this is a fantastic read.  Ms Gilberts description of her life was inspirational, and somewhat humerous. I'd say she found herself, and everything that she was searching for, which was not always a pleasant experience for her, but I admired her strength, and determination.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I first saw the movie when in grad school in Kingston. It seems a lifetime away now. I went with my friend JMM to see it. We drove up to the theatre in Kingston Township in the evening. After seeing the film, I remarked to him as we walked back to the car, \\"We're never going to be able to talk about this, are we?\\" \\"No,\\" was his answer. And, we never did. The film is too moving to really talk about.<br /><br />So, my wife and I sat down and watched the film, a couple of nights ago. My wife is much more the fan of comedy movies, so she sat through this silently, gripping my hand tightly at times. Early on, she asked, \\"Why are they doing this?\\" I explained as best I could. Later, she fell mostly silent, only commenting again when she realized that Schindler was trying to save his factory workers.<br /><br />It's a sad, moving testament to humanity, this film. Now that we've finished watching it, I find myself again with little to say. What can one say, after all? Anything I could say would pale in comparison.
B00104W8T6|4.0|Loved the movie, soundtrack works pretty well too.  A little more childish than say, Rushmore or the Royal Tenenbaums, but still entertaining.
B000YABYLA|3.0|i entered the theater hoping it was not a typical hollywood movie... well it still was.    * warning: movie spoiler ahead *  so it turned out that the girl Juno wanted the guy just because she wanted somebody so that the love can last *forever*.  how it is possible that juno likes him is mysterious... he made her pregnant, and then knowing that, he still asked another girl to go to the prom... how cool is this guy?  towards the end of the movie, all of a sudden, this guy paulie was the fastest in a racing competition... that's very unbelieveable...  the movie depicted him as running and practicing all the time, and he hardly has ANY sun tan at all.  that's very unbelieveable.  he doesn't look like he had the confidence of a sport person either...  he at most looked like he was pretty good at some video games played by movement of the fingers.      near the end of the movie, juno asked her dad, is there love that can last forever, and her dad said yes, the person who love you just the way you are, for who you are.  and then juno decided that she really loved paulie.  this is very typical of hollywood movie: has a talk with someone, and all of a sudden, she found \\"epiphany\\" and her whole life changed.  she decided the paulie is the guy she loved and the movie end like a \\"they will live happily ever after.\\"  well... this is no snow-white story and life is not as simple as that.  on IMDB, the younger the viewers, the higher rating they gave the movie.  maybe it is more like a fairy tale.
B000RGSOR8|3.0|I impulse-bought this album after hearing Your Lips Are Red once on the radio. This is truly an original, compelling song. I love the driving trip-hop drums and bass, the silky vocals, the Fiery Furnace-like instrumental interludes. Overall Annie Clark is an impressive song writer, poet, and multi-instrumentalist. And she has a beautiful voice that you can't help but fall in love with. Paris Is Burning is a similarly strong song- mysterious, compelling, instrumentally very interesting.<br /><br />But after these two songs, the album loses steam and gets almost elevator-music-ish. I suspect Annie Clark is going for irony with the choruses of \\"oohs\\" and \\"aahs\\" and sensitive piano bar solos, but she risks not crossing that threshold into irony and sounding insipid. All My Stars Are Aligned is one such song- I love the poignant irony of the lyrics, but the music flutters and falters. And in Now Now, the music is layered and interesting, but the lyrics don't quite deliver. Also, Annie's voice is incredibly powerful and versatile, but she rarely strays from the romantic whispery crooner tone. I kept wanting her to let down her guard and start belting it out.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong- I'm a lover of indie pop. I like a lot of the bands other reviewers compare to St. Vincent, like Andrew Bird, Sufjan Stevens. But this album, while interesting and original, is no Mysterious Production Of Eggs or Illinois. It's a decent first effort though, and I'd say it's still worth buying just for that Your Lips Are Red song.
B0012QE4OO|2.0|In JUMPERS, the viewer is asked to believe that the hero (Hayden Christianson) has the power to teleport himself instantly to any point in the world merely by thinking of doing so. Now I have no problem with the underlying concept of this or any other science fiction story, but regardless of the improbability of the plot, I expect the script to respect the intelligence of the viewer or at least his memory by not violating previously accepted facts in the film.  In JUMPERS, the script fails on both counts.<br /><br />What we are expected to believe is that a race of teleporters called \\"Jumpers\\" has existed for millenia and that a second group called \\"Paladins\\" exists only to kill them. Now if this sounds like a rehash of HIGHLANDERS I can accept that but at least with HIGHLANDERS there was a history and a plausible explanation given for the need to kill the immortals. Here, the Paladins led by a one note Samuel Jackson are a group of religious fanatics whose only justification for the killing is that \\"Only God should have the power to be everywhere at once.\\"  The plot revolves around a montage of visual escapes that takes the Jumpers and the pursuing Paladins through the Sphinx, Mount Everest, the Coloseum in Rome, Hong Kong, the North Pole and so many other well-known locations that the viewer has difficulty grasping how that particular jump spot fits into the film's plot in any meaningful way.  The answer. of course, is that it does not and that is why viewer interest and film credibility is soon lost.  Further, the acting is second rate. Diane Lane is wasted in a walk on as Christianson's mother and her explanation of who her son is makes less sense than who she is. The bottom line is that JUMPERS jumps over too many places for the viewer to take even a remote interest.
B0013J79L0|4.0|While this has Hollywood's prints on it, it is self-contained enough to play well to its plot - that of a downtrodden nebbish who learns to break out of his shell and realise his potential. The cast manage to overcome their A-list status and work well to the atmosphere.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|I saw the blue Ray disc movie and bought the Dvd,    It's not fun anymore. The sharpness and sound are all gone.    It was just another stupid vampire movie....    I felt the magic of Blue ray disc again.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|i will always complain that paltrow was the wrong choice: this character needed to be played by a british actress who understands the  true nature of a clearly british novel. i think that there are some things that should only be played by british actors and that is any of the characters from a jane austen novel.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|Even I bought the DVD, not Hi-Def, the video is vivid and bright. The audio was good.    The movie itself is one of my best epic movie.    Two thumbs up to actors and director.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I got the DVD when it first came out and I had never seen the Firefly TV series so I was unprepared for the wild fun of this movie! The first thing that catches you is the originality of this story - this is not at all like the earlier versions of the space opera yet it grabs you from the first frame and just keeps going. The whole story with its engaging cast of characters and their chemistry together ensnares the watcher to dive in and join them. I used to be content with the very thin content of the Star Wars series and still watched some of those old Star Trek episodes with Jim Kirk and the green-painted alien women - but not anymore. This movie exudes quality and it's hard to watch drawn-out and preachy movies with cardboard sets after you've seen Serenity.<br />I'd rather watch Serenity all over again and to heck with that other drivel..When is Mr. Whedon going to finally bring out the next episode?
B00005JMUA|3.0|Two is just two.    One is everything.    The picture and sound are decent. Not perfect.     Sometimes boring comparing to part one.
B00008G9JM|5.0|So critics didn't like this album, huh? That only goes to show that critics are IDIOTS! The music, the lyrics, the arrangements--perfect. I especially enjoy the little intermission, \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\"; it's really funny.<br /><br />After reading that \\"Thick as a Brick\\" was a better album, I actually bought it, and was I disappointed! I listen to \\"Passion Play\\" over and over, but \\"Thick as a Brick\\" just isn't as interesting in any way. Typical when you follow the recommendations of critics--what, for example, was I supposed to enjoy about \\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\\"?<br /><br />This and \\"Aqualung\\" are the must-have Jethro Tull albums.
B000ZLFALS|4.0|A little long, but visually and emotionally arresting with some interesting takes on the music.
B000FZETKC|4.0|I believe this is the real 80s classic, with all the turmoil and angst of teeny-boppers, but with a touch of reality and a high dose of sweetness.  This flick is a most-see for teenagers of all ages, because it really goes beyond the 80s brat-pack attitude to include the feelings of an era with its own style and beliefs about love.
0689878451|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a flaming liberal parent who actively seeks out \\"diversity\\" themed books for my toddler.  Unfortunately, many of these books designed to teach a lesson just aren't that great.  The stories are often too forced in service of the tolerance message. Tango does not have this problem AT ALL. It is simply an excellent book.  The story is well written, it's true, and the illustrations are great. My very discerning toddler loves this story and I'd say it is in the top 3 of most often read books in our library.  She points to the picture of the new little penguin family and says, \\"a daddy, a daddy, a baby tango!\\"  Last time we visited the penguins at our local zoo we asked the zookeeper if they ever had same sex couples raising chicks and he told us that it is fairly frequent--and pointed out a chick who had been parented by 2 dads.  This fact isn't publicized by our midwestern zoo as it was in NYC, but I love that our daughter is getting a fuller picture of life because of this wonderful book. You won't be disappointed!
B0013KTGAG|4.0|I've always had this theory that there were movies out there that no one had heard of, that don't get promoted or lauded by the critics, but are hidden gems, worth searching for, finding and watching.  I've sat through a lot of bad movies looking for those rare gems, and I would say, on the whole, Sunshine is one of those gems.    I think the thing that stands out the most in this movie, and will linger with me for a long time, is how the mix of moving music, disorienting, rich visuals and sometimes Haiku like mysterious dialogue create an \\"aesthetically gorgeous\\" package that you almost feel you appreciate more with your hidden sixth sense.  (The quote is from another review on here.)  You'll probably know what I'm talking about if you've seen it.  If you haven't, and want to see the possibilities of such aesthetics, this is your movie to see.    **SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT** I will be honest though.  The aesthetics and first half of the movie create such a mystical atmosphere (led by the music, and a few brilliant lines), that it holds itself up to an almost impossible standard in order to resolve and complete the beautiful package of the film.  In that regard, it just slightly falls short of the spiritual connection it wants to create, because, at least on the Unbox version, the rich spiritual environment is left mostly explored and unresolved.    Sometimes movie makers may stumble across something great, and not know they have it, and I think that's what happened here.  So the movie would have been perfection if a cosmic answer had been provided, or some suggestion of the connection between our spirituality and the laws of the universe, ie., that we are all stardust and pure energy, and will return to that one day, and perhaps thats where God truly lies.    Popcorn sci-fi junkies, cynics and nitpickers may be disappointed in the movie, but if you see it as less about science fiction, and more of an emotional experience, it may just be one of the best movies you've ever seen.    But at any rate, of all the movies out there in the universe, this is one worth its day in your sunshine.
B00005JOHC|5.0|So nice to watch a comedy that does not filter current humor to a kid level,especially without the commercials. Already pre-bought season 3.
B000K4X5XA|1.0|I had such high expectations of this movie on Blu Ray, I really did.  When I first got a PS3 (as a semi cheap Blu Ray player that happens to also play games) this is one of the first movies that I wanted.  To give you an idea of how much of a Superman fan that I am, I have his shield tattooed on my chest.  I was so let down by the quality of this Blu Ray transfer, it's hard to find the words.  I'm not complaining about the movie itself, just the quality of this BD and what it could have been.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want Lucas to come in and \\"enhance\\" the original film, or anything like that, just clean it up a little before you put it in the high definition category!  This is especially noticeable in the Krypton scenes early in the movie.  On my 1080i 55\\" screen, it looked like someone put pepper all over the shots.  The pristine landscape that they were trying for was noticeably bad, and I was left scratching my head wondering \\"what were they thinking?\\"  Did any of the powers that be actually watch this on a decent sized screen before releasing it, or did they figure Superman fans would snatch it up without really paying attention to it.  I admit, and have said before that it's a 30 year old film, so the quality of the original will reflect the quality of the transfer, but this is an unacceptable release.  From one Superman fan to another, please avoid this release, and hope with me that there will be a better one down the line.  There are good points to this release, the sound and music are fantastic, and it appears to be mixed very well, but you can get that from the standard definition DVD for about half the price.  Commentary track (I believe) is from the special edition DVD, and you can also get the music only track to listen to some John Williams genius at work.  Save your money on this one, or get the special edition DVD and play it through an upconvert player.  Granted, I had very high expectations for this release, and I am very disappointed thatit turned out the way that it did.  Please take my advice on this, and don't spend your hard-earned dollars on it, you will be disappointed.  If you're looking for something to show off how awesome Blu Ray is, keep looking, you won't find it here.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Listening to the music leaves one hoping someone like Roberto Benigini will make the film biography of Ennio Morricone - the \\"star\\" of so many of the films he scored.    Can you imagine \\"Titanic\\" with a Morricone score?.......
1400079276|5.0|Five stars and then some.  Sometimes, you'll read a book and wonder how the author managed to be so brilliant.  This is one of those books that raises that question.    In (very) brief, the book depicts two parallel storylines:  that of a teenager who has run away from home and that of agiing man who, though he seems simple, posseses some remarkable abilities.  The range of supporting characters is wide, and they are all well-drawn (with the possible exemption of the young Sakura, who is not so much enigmatic as she is simply a bit thin); Murakami has tremendous skills in character development:  each character is well-rounded, well-developed, and speaks in a unique voice.  All of the main characters also tend to wrap up their own trajectories, which is a feat (tying up all the loose ends, which is especially a formidable task in a novel as long and involved as this one) that many novelists never seem to grasp.    The plot itself is, as mentioned above, far more complicated than can be outlined in a review.  What a potential reader needs to know is that the plot never becomes entangled and that the reader never becomes lost.  There are plenty of points of metaphysical speculation, and the plot is all the richer for them; they are part of the novel's lifeblood.  This is not navel-gazing; Murakami weaves them into his plot in order to make us reflect not only on the magic realism world of his characters but also on our own being-in-the-world.  Reading this novel is NOT a passive activity but is instead one of active engagement.    Above all, reading this novel is enjoyable.  Murakami has given us a page-turning plotline, one that keeps us asking what on earth could be coming next.  He has given us likeable main characters, ones we want to follow into the next chapters.  He has given us a world where the impossible is possible, and we want to extend our stay there.  He does this all in an engaging, frequently shifting, narrative voice that keeps the novel cohesive and steers us onward.      Translator Philip Gabriel also deserves mention for his lively translation into English.  Puns, jokes, idiomatic expressions, and slang all come through loud and clear in English.  They style of the novel comes through in a natural voice, one that is never contrived or bland.
B00008973A|5.0|I've never seen the stage version of \\"A Chorus Line\\" so my only reference point is the film version.  And I thought it was great!!!  This had to be difficult material to translate to film.  The film starts with a stage filled with hundreds of applicants giving their all for a scant eight slots in a chorus line.  With a wave of the hand the choreographer(Michael Douglas) whittles it to sixteen.  The elimination process that the choreographer employs isn't so much an evaluation of dance technique.  Rather, it's more like an interrogation where he asks the most personal details of the applicants lives.  You sense the dreams and desperation of the auditioners.  You have no real rooting interest here and you hope for the success for each of these youngsters.  The songs and dance numbers are fine but it's the backstories of these fledgling hoofers that is the most compelling aspect of \\"A Chorus Line\\".  There are few names in the cast of aspirants unless you count Janet Jones(Mrs. Wayne Gretzky) and Audrey Landers(of Landers Sisters fame) and Landers delivers the weakest solo in the film.  This film on initial release received a lukewarm critical and public reception in 1985.  There's definitely room for re-evaluation here.  As far as I'm concerned \\"A Chorus Line\\" is superior to the Oscar winning \\"Chicago\\".  Maybe the small screen is the perfect venue to appreciate this film.  Director Richard Attenborough, who won an Oscar for \\"Gandhi\\", deserves kudoes for tackling tricky material.
0764574124|5.0|I have tried to pick up VBA for Excel a few times, but the pieces just didn't seem to fall together for me.  I am in IT, but I don't have a development background.  I have solid Excel skills, but still got frustrated with VBA and would put it down.  Recently, I had a very specific problem to solve for work and thought I would give it another try.<br /><br />I decided to get a book with the basics and read it completely first, then try to start coding my project.  I was in a hurry so I also got the online upgrade to start reading even before my book got here.  I found the book an easy read and occasionally tried a few of the examples as I went along.  I got through the book easily in a few days and feel as if I had a good knowledge base to begin.<br /><br />I am happy to say within 2 weeks, I have completed the project I had first planned and then an even more complex project. I have a third planned now.  I used other Excel VBA resources along the way, but have to give credit to this book for getting me started and with the basics so I could even understand where to go next.  I see the time and money I invested in this book coming back to me many times over due to the hours and hours of work the macros I have been able to write will save both myself and my team members.<br /><br />I still have a lot to learn, but I am very satisified with this book.  I picked this book because of the other good reviews it has on this Amazon site, so I hope you will find my review helpful to you!!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|This is a great spin off show of Doctor Who.  Torchwood is actually an anagram of Doctor Who.  While watching this you will learn stuff about Captain Jack that you never learned in Doctor Who.  The first season was great.  I can't wait untill the second comes out.  It's not really a show for kids though their is alot of swearing and sexual content(doesn't have nudity though) but its still a great show so its really up to the parents.
B000SFJWLU|4.0|I first heard Five Finger Death Punch on Detroit's oldest rock station (WRIF). They played \\"The Bleeding\\" when I was on my way to work and I was blown away.  This goes beyond the typical scream-at-the-top-of-your-lungs new metal.  There is a lot of that in the music, but it really connects with me emotionally this time. I think of \\"The Bleeding\\" as the ultimate break-up song.      The rest of the CD is great as well.  Right from the start, Five Finger Death Punch is an assault on the ears.  I like it that way.  Faster and Louder.  More drive, more sound.      Some may find it one-dimensional with all the pounding, driving rhythm, but the band shows an ability to change gears and moods within that framework.
0375703764|1.0|The worst \\"novel\\" I've ever read. Quite possibly the worst possible \\"novel\\" ever written. Plotless, poorly written, incoherent, and juvenile. The language takes turns being dreary and over-the-top melodramatic. Danielweski seems to believe that he can substitute pointless (unless his point was to uproot an entire South American rain-forest) typography and pseudo foot notes that take up half a page for an actual plot. I think it's a disgrace to literature when people mistake incoherence for artistic talent.
B00005N5S5|4.0|A wonderful film that at its heart has a well thought out story, and for the most part does not betray the fact that it was filmed 25 years ago. I've just re-watched it for the first time in ten years and none of the elements that made it so good in the 1980's have really dated at all. Sure there are no mobile phones to assist Sarah Conner, and the stop motion photography near the end betrays the films relatively low budget, but all in all its a roller coaster ride that takes some beating.<br /><br />The first hour is relentless action with a high degree of tension as well. If by chance you've never seen it before you are really won't be sure who wants to kill Sarah Conner. Of course if you've seen T2 first you may be even more confused....<br /><br />Schwarzenegger was made for this role, and the idea of him being a cyborg with real flesh is entirely believable. If theres one criticsm of the film its perhaps that they should have dubbed a different voice (a bit like they did with Dave Prowse in Star Wars) when The Terminator speaks.<br /><br />Credit must go to James Cameron the director, who was responsible for so many quality Action/Sci-fi/Horror films in the 80's and early 90's. Sadly Cameron hasn't maintained that standard and since directing Titanic (which itself wasn't that good and was 10 years ago now) hasn't made another as good as The Terminator.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though it has been likened to Serpico and it re-enforces my respect for Ridley Scott as a Director. I do however have a couple of negative points to make. First, the sound quality. Like Starr* Burst's review earlier, I found the dialogue difficult to hear and had to turn up the volume. The second point is the cast. It was difficult to envisage Cuba Gooding Jr as the flamboyant character he plays as I always see him in goofy kid movies and it kind of watered down the believability factor. The same goes with Denzel Washington, although he is a classy actor with some great movies under him, I had a hard time picturing him as this ruthless character Lucas, kind of like Tom Hanks playing a hitman in Road To Perdition, you know he's a nice guy. Perhaps I am being too picky though as he does act this role exceptionally well.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews I'm thinking that if you're a life-long, die-hard Johnny Cash fan, you will not appreciate this movie. I, for one, knew little about him and wasn't prticularly interested in his music. Let me tell you, I just ordered an album of songs by Johnny Cash.
B00005JOIH|2.0|Many people vote on reviews based on whether they liked or disliked a certain movie or book, and not based on whether the review itself imparts any valuable information. With that said, I don't expect that my thoughts on this film to be popular and that is likely a good thing. But if you have not watched this film yet, I suggest that you read them through.<br /><br />In this film, Steven Spielberg takes us many steps closer to a world where \\"justice\\" is non-existent and \\"revenge\\" is the replacement term. We are all the worse for it.<br /><br />It is clear from the contradictory and unbelievable opening comments from the \\"Golda Meir\\" character that we are going to be watching a \\"fantasy\\" of what Hollywood would like us to believe could have possibly taken place in the aftermath of these terrorist attacks.<br /><br />Israelis and particularly Israeli war veterans, intelligence officers, politicians and military are not often the sort of impotent, confused, unprofessional characters portrayed in this film. Are they human? Do they question what they're doing and why? Surely. But not in the fanciful, public, and almost ludicrous manner showcased here. In addition to this, the idea that Mossad agents would forget all their training and run around Europe practically looking to get killed is idealistic stupidity and a totally deceitful presentation of the facts. The whole film sadly attempts to make a point about revenge and peace while sacrificing truth and sanity in the process.<br /><br />From the Arabs, to the Israelis, to the Europeans, everyone seems unsure and confused about who they are and what they're doing. But the reality is something much different.<br /><br />How could Spielberg have saved this film? Simply put, he needed to be rational and honest about the individuals involved, their motivations, principals and ideology. The revised \\"ideology\\" that is injected into these characters has them instead reciting quotes from both the Bush's administration post 9-11 party line as well as the media's talking-points as regards peace, morality, law, etc.<br /><br />This breaks the audience's sense of what Hitchcock called the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" and reminds us that this is just more Hollywood fluff, albeit with a serious, somewhat artsy tone.<br /><br />What is relevant here is that a number of terrorists carried out a horrifically unjust act of murder at the Munich Olympics, and that they needed to be punished for what they did as well as prevented from doing it again - upholding the virtues of justice, freedom and rationality. The idea that this is somehow an unjust response because it may lead to more violence is not just irrational, but monstrous. Whether or not 10,000 more people would need to die, we must never relinquish our right as individuals to defend the principals of justice and more importantly - our lives.<br /><br />Novelist Ayn Rand said of justice:<br /><br />\\"It is not justice or equal treatment that you grant to men when you abstain equally from praising men's virtues and from condemning men's vices. When your impartial attitude declares, in effect, that neither the good nor the evil may expect anything from you--whom do you betray and whom do you encourage?\\"ing-points as regards peace, morality, law, etc.    This breaks the audience's sense of what Hitchcock called the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" and reminds us that this is just more Hollywood fluff, albeit with a serious, somewhat artsy tone.

1582701709|4.0|The secret is written for anyone to easily understand. I found it very simple yet informative, It can be life changing if correctly applied in one's life. I thought there was a lack of practical examples and therefore I had to purchase more books after that such as Sychro Destiny by Deepak Chopra, its more informative and gives practical daily exercises to actually achieve your destiny in life and to manifest what you truly desire. Everyone should read the secret as an introduction to spiritual universal laws, but there is more to it. A brilliant read non the less.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|Rocky - The Complete Saga Collection is the ultimate gift for friends, family, or just yourself. This collection contains all six Rocky films. My personal fave is Rocky I and IV. Every Rocky is good and the film has an important message about following your dreams, go underdogs! Get this today, enjoy!
B0000062FJ|5.0|I was in High School when this album came out and remember hearing it for the first time at a friend's party.  I had never heard anything like it before.  The 3 song sequence of 'Shades of Time-Savor-Jingo' just blew me away especially when 'Savor' faded out as 'Jingo' faded in with the dark and brooding drum sequence first and then Santana's piercing guitar.  I only got the remastered CD of this recently and forgot how many really good songs are on here - some that you can't get on the greatest hits CD's.  Notable are 'Waiting' and 'Treat' and the already mentioned 3 song set.  So, added with the classics of 'Evil Ways' and 'Soul Sacrifice' there are at least 7 great songs out of the original 9-song set.  And the other 2 are very good.    Unlike most of the other reviewers, I'm not a huge fan of 'Soul Sacrifice' - don't get me wrong I like it, but it's just not a song I'd listen to over and over.    Highly recommended.  I think ABRAXAS is a little better but this first LP was so raw, so amazingly dark for 1969, that it should be in any Santana fan's collection (just for 'Treat' alone).  The remastering is excellent and the bonus tracks are a good addition.  I'm glad to have the nearly 12 minute Woodstock version of 'Soul Sacrifice' for history's sake but the 7 minute studio version is long enough for me!    Hard to believe this LP came out the same year as Led Zep I & II, The Who's TOMMY,Crosby, Stills and Nash's first, the Beatles ABBEY ROAD, CCR's BAYOU COUNTRY, WILLY AND THE POOR BOYS and GREEN RIVER, Dylan's NASHVILLE SKYLINE and the Stones LET IT BLEED.  Wow, what a year.

0345323882|5.0|This is NOT the movie.  It is bigger, deeper, more meaningful and philosophical -- one of Philip K. Dick's best books ever.  (It has been explained to me that the primary significance of the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" was that it presented a fully imagined future.)  I wish I could get this book with the original title, so much more revealing of the core -- \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"  (I owned it years ago, and wore it out -- wish I had bought extra copies then!)

B00005JLH3|5.0|This was a film I missed when it came out.  Don't even remember it in fact.  A shame but the beauty of DVD is that you can pick up what you missed.<br /><br />This is a fun little film with the old story of the kid with great musical talent who has nothing; get's his big break with a full scholarship to a university.<br /><br />Miles shows up expecting to be treated like royalty but ends up becoming the  problem of the band.<br /><br />Extremely talented drummer with a bad attitude challenges and shows up the line leader.  Who later learns Miles can't read music.<br /><br />It turns out that he lied to the music director and on his application.  Rather then take his way out and study he gets an even bigger attitude which leads to him \\"showboating\\" during a band competition which ends in a fight between the two bands.  He of course gets booted.<br /><br />Things look bad as the band directory faces a firing for refusing to adopt to the new music of today.  The drum line leader forgets he used to love the sound of the line more then his playing and Miles faces loosing his scholarship and his girlfriend.<br /><br />A box arrives and it contains music from his estranged father to which Miles is surprised to music of his father.  It gets him thinking and he goes to the drum line leader to get some help on an idea.  They have a drum off and the line leader remembers his job and accepts the fact Miles is a better drummer but he points out to Miles that even though he is the best; the crowd can't hear him because they hear the band playing.  He also works with Miles to help him learn to read Music.<br /><br />They collaborate and present their Music to the band director who thinks it's a great idea.<br /><br />The final showdown happens at the big competition to which there is a tie that must be settled with the drum lines.  Miles gets his chance and this time he does not showboat.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice film if you like the music.  The side stories are ok and they don't distract.  However, I would have liked to have seen something with the father where Miles sends him music.  Just seemed the right thing to do for me.<br /><br />There are extras and some music videos but they are are watch once and move on.g with the father where Miles sends him music.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you grew up with the Beatles music, the music alone will appeal to you.  But even kids growing up now seem to appreciate the Beatles just as much.  That alone is not enough to make a great movie.  The Sargent Pepper movie was an example of that. What is needed is a movie that is compelling and uses the music well.<br /><br />As evidenced by the reviews here, most people like this movie a lot.  By the same token, many professional reviewers panned it.  And there's a good reason for both.  If you look at the plot as a whole, it could be considered weak.  On a scene by scene basis, or a song by song basis, things are different.  The individual scenes are potent, make good use of the music, and are artistically done. The acting is well suited to the movie, or at least allowed me to become absorbed in it.<br /><br />But if you try to examine the overall cohesiveness of the story, it comes up short. I wouldn't recommend the book if there were one.<br /><br />The same could be said for our dreams or many other things that are great experiences when we take them as they come.  Many songs that we listen to might not work well as prose, nor would the plot of some of the best known operas.  Presentation is everything, and this movie has enough of it to make itself enjoyable, and come through with power and emotion.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Awesome! That's all I can say about this movie. It's a great adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel. Now, that's exactly what it is: a movie based on a graphic novel which is based on actual historical events. It's meant to be graphic, surreal, and over the top. Anyone who is a fan of Miller's work will thoroughly enjoy this. If you are looking for historical accuracy then you will be disappointed. This is meant to be an epic story with great drama and fantastic acts of bravery. The acting, settings, special effects, costumes, props, and dialog are all amazing. This is my pick for best movie of 2007. The special edition has deleted scenes and a documentary of the real spartans, as well as all the behind the scenes footage plus the training the actors went through.
B000002MFN|4.0|This was Madonna's fifth studio album.  It was released simulatenously with her book [[ASIN:8440631170 Sex]] and suffered some fallout from the negative reaction to the book.  Erotica is a concept album about sexuality and relationships, although only a few of the songs are directly about the sex act itself.  Most of the songs have a dance beat, usually with a hip hop or jazz flavor.  In the US, four singles were released from the album: \\"Erotica\\" reached #3 on the charts, \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" peaked at #7, \\"Bad Girl\\" struggled to #36 and \\"Rain\\" peaked at #14.  The songs on this album are quite good, with the exception of the wretched \\"Did You Do It?\\", which is not really performed by Madonna and isn't included on this version of the album anyway.  An underrated Madonna album.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|Greatly orchestrated. This music really brings the emotions and intensity of the film to life. I felt myself getting a little on edge, especially listening to the tracks that corresponded with the intense scenes of the film.
B00005JMJG|2.0|I wanted to like this, but I'm afraid it just isn't that good.  The problem for me was that, despite some truly wonderful, strange images (something like 80% of the movie takes place in Carrey's head while he's asleep and supposedly being deprogrammed of his memories of his girlfriend), what's delivered to us at the end is a very simplistic message: it's hard to live with someone.  I guess what I'm saying is that the stakes are too low here.  That question -- how do you make love stay, since people will inevitably get on each others' nerves -- is pretty realistic; the film then yokes it to a very Philip K. Dick-ian premise of a company that can selectively erase memories (the company's name is \\"Lacuna\\").  It's unclear to what extent this is supposed to be humor, but it's certainly absurd enough that we're unlikely to take it too seriously, even if it seems the actors are (and Jim Carrey does a whole lot of emoting).  All this adds up to a story that is interesting in lots of ways, but just doesn't hang together tonally, or intellectually.  I rarely get bored watching movies, but I was checking my watch about an hour into this one.  It's confusing to watch, and I think unecessarily so.  It's just that if the story-telling were less disjointed, the underlying banality would be apparent.

Viggo Mortenson, plays Nikolai, a driver and henchman for Semyon, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, the owner of a trans-Siberian restaurant in London. Semyon looks like a nice old soul, but underneath he is a monster who will stop at nothing and his son, Kirill, Vincent Cassel, plays his  role masterfully, a man with no conscience.  Naomi Watts plays Anna, a midwife in London. She assists in the delivery of a baby born to a young 14 year old who was raped, and who dies after the birth. Anna tries to find the baby's relatives using her mother's diary. The diary is the secret life of Kirill and Semyon and their home of women used for their pleasure. Anna and Nikolai meet on several occasions, but Nikolai plays his role of the tough, haunted man to the hilt. For Anna and Nikolai, Semyon will unlock secrets neither wants to face.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen is Nikolai,the menacing haunted driver who kills and maims but displays a softer side that is not easy to overlook. The bath house scene, where he fights for his life, naked, but for his tatoos, is one that will be remembered long after the film is forgotten. \\"Covered in tattoos, his body a scroll depicting his personal history of violence, Mortensen conveys a subtle blend of resolve and lost-ness. He's a true, haunting mystery man.\\" --Robert Horton.<br /><br />David Cronenberg allows the violence to face us head on, there is no warning and we are upfront and then it recedes. But we remember what we have seen and heard and there is no going back. This is a world foreign to us, a world of horror, violence and a culture we cannot understand. Trafficking in human misery and total control of all things.<br /><br />\\"Just as the Russian Mafia tells stories through tattoos, it could be said that Eastern Promises is told through bloodshed.\\" Brian Marden<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-23-08<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004W18Z American Yakuza]]<br />[[ASIN:B000CQLZ0Q A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000NOIX48 The Painted Veil]]re we cannot understand.

1401300529|5.0|In his incredibly productive life, David Halberstam wrote brilliantly on a myriad of topics _ from Bill Belichick to this, an opus that sheds light not only on the mostly ignored Korean War but on the failures of world diplomacy and American politicians after World War II. Sadly, it continues into the 21st century.    Others, including a number of Korean War veterans, have written eloquently on Halberstam's portrayal of that sad epic _ or rather the first year-and-a-half of it, and the failure of leadership in both Washington and Tokyo. What struck me, someone who has read a lot of military history, was the portrait of what has to be one of the worst generals ever to hold high command in the U.S. Army _ Ned Almond, a racist of incredible hubris and equal incompetence who was allowed to keep his post as X Corps commander even when Ridgway took over the 8th Army command. Even the worst of the union commanders in the Civil War were more fit than he was.    But what really struck me was the insight into Soviet, Chinese, and American politics that has led to a series of unnecessary wars, right up to Iraq. I've always sensed it with one part of my brain, but never thought consistenly about how U.S. domestic policy drives foreign policy, right up to the use of 9/11 to justify the disastrous Iraq invasion. Halberstam clearly catches the mood of American politics during Korea _ the dominance of the China Lobby. But he also catches in the last 20 pages the way the Democratic party has been paralyzed since by the effects of that war _ that the sense of being \\"soft,'' first on Communism and then on terrorism, led to Vietnam and the early lack of dissent on Iraq.    Maybe this book will contribute to a new reality in American politics.    Given the history Halberstam portrays, probably not.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|As with many others, I had opportunity to view a screener of the video. It has some fairly impressive scenes in it and there was obvious extra budget beyond the normal episode. That said, as a movie, the video was fairly disappointing--it should have been cast as a four episode story arc minimum with extra details to fill in what turned out to be a fairly rushed, plot-obvious film.     The directors/writers crammed too much into the film. Expectations found on many sites for how the Ori story arc would end are spot on in almost every instance. The return of an old, previously defeated enemy in the middle of the film was creative but had little build up. This secondary plot, however, had greater depth and build up than the main plot.    The main plot, dealing with the end of the Ori, was resolved in a classic Deus ex Machina form--something I thought had been decried since the Greeks first developed it. Beyond just being classic, elements at the end of the main storyline echoed the end of Anubis in the tv series with only differing visual effects.     While much of the above is negative, it was a fun, if obvious story, with very impressive visual effects. The video clips of mountains were among my favorite and deserve a place in any documentary of the real earth location. The space battles were also visually impressive, as was the depiction of the \\"Fields of Celestis\\" and the incarnation of the remaining Ori.     Will I buy it when it comes out? Probably... from amazon.com's used item link.
1435393910|5.0|A wonderful book, of course... and I'm sure there's some reason this edition is almost $100.00, but none is given.  I bought a fine leather bound edition for around $50.00 a few years back and can pick up other paper editions for $5.00!  C'mon Amazon, give us a clue.
B000002UA9|5.0|After doing gigs in Hamburg for a while The Beatles finally decided to record their first album titled Please Please Me.  The group presents a collection of raw 50's style rockers as well some of the sweetest, harmonious pop songs ever put on record.  Given, this is not a cohesive LP or semi-concept album such as Sgt Pepper or Abbey Road. Like nearly all LPs of the time, it is a collection of singles as well as \\"filler\\" tracks.  Also, alot of the material consists of covers rather than original songs.     This is The Beatles early in their career.  Long before they cared about making grandiose artistic statements, the fab four simply wanted to make fun Rock-n-Roll numbers.  And that they did, with the shout 1.2.3.4 and the driving rhythms of, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" they rocked harder than few groups did at the time.  Aside from rock-n-roll, The Beatles knew how to make soft lush pop on such tracks as, \\"Ask Me Why\\", and the girl group covers of, \\"Chains\\", and, \\"Baby It's You\\".  Indeed the Beatles took cues from all of their influences including Chuck Berry, Goffin and King, 60's girl groups, and even R&B artists.        The group had been perfroming as a skiffle group prior to this recording.  Like all other skiffle groups, they simply wanted to follow in their heroes (50's rockers) footsteps and make good raw, rock-n-roll.  The Beatles were one of the few such groups to make it big.  Probably because they had the most talent.  Though the songwriting on this album is definitley not as amazing as it would shortly become, the group shows some innovation on the pop rocker, \\"Please Please Me\\", and the shout fest, \\"Twist and Shout\\".  \\"Love Me Do\\" shows up here:  an early single featuring just drums, bass, acoustic guitar and, of course, John Lennon's harmonica.     Though, in the long run, Please Please Me, may just be a prelude for better things to come, it's still a wonderful piece of rock-n-roll and pop. The Beatles never would never make anything that sounded as simple or striped down again.
B0011HOEYY|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing this film.    I was not disappointed.    Russell (the reason I bought this DVD package) was great.  Denzel did a good job as well.    Interesting story to follow.    The film is long but in this case you do not mind.  You do NOT get bored.    I did NOT like however the unnecessary nudity.  AND WE DID NOT NEED TO SHOOT THE DOG.    Excellent DVD package.  Although some of the extras were TV specials or parts of programs I had already taped.    It is, of course, violent.      If you are a fan of Russell `s, Denzel's or Ridley's you will enjoy the film.    I input this review the day before the 2008 Oscars.  TOO BAD the films did not get more nominations.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I have read fantasy/sci-fi my whole life. I do not take apart authors and inspect each word written under a microscope with the intent of criticism. When I receive a new book that looks interesting and different I am totally open to the adventure or experience the author is attempting to convey. I was not disappointed in \\"Sabriel\\". From the first page I was totally entertained, immersed, and enthused. I so enjoyed this book, it flowed well, was unique, and really grabbed my imagination from the beginning. I did not put it down until I finished the last page with a huge sigh of contentment and a big smile.

0375424474|5.0|I've known for a very long time that I have evolved from a common ancestor to my fellow mammals, and the avians, and in fact, all of extant life.  What this beautiful little book does is fill in some of the significant links.  I've long suspected that neotonic tadpoles played an important part in our evolution... in my personal biological history!  Here Dr Shubin explains hiccups as a breathing circuit inadvertently maintained by evolution all the way back to those tadpoles.  I will surely never look at my cousins the frogs the same way again.      I finished this book feeling I know more about \\"who I am\\" than when I started.  It's one of the most readable of biology overview books.  I finished it like a novel I couldn't put down.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
0393312836|1.0|This book was written for pure shock value and nothing more. The ridiculous slang that he creates makes it almost impossible to enjoy the story in any sense.<br /><br />The story is predictable and not very entertaining. If someone was wanting to read a book on gang rape and the evils of mis spent youth then I am sure that there are other books out there there are at least written in such a way that you don't need an interpreter for all the fabricated words in this little book.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that so many give this book a 5 star review. It scares me a bit to find out what my fellow human beings find as a quality piece of work.<br /><br />I was expecting more and was terribly disappointed. Certainly won't be reading this one again.

After getting so entombed by Van der Graff Generater at the 'awed' age of 15, from my beautiful 'Hippy' Uncle, There was a small HEAD SHOP\\" several miles away that sold the eternal *IMPORT* LPs!. I saw 'Peter Hammill/Chameleon\\" sitting right in front of me!!!;{KNOWING the tiny fact that this WAS  Van Der Graffs composer/singer}, I immediately grabbed it like a thief, and sped home... My BEST suprise was that THIS was Peter! . but ...STILL!..Van Der Graff!  SAME players, same Dave Jackson, Guy Evens, Hugh?.. It was a NEW/old Van der Graff to me!!! It TRULY was!<br /> We progressed to Peters\\"In Camara\\" and Silent Corner LPs next!.<br />It really IS Peter's magic/Solo material, yet Van Der Graff {hidden] in the guise of the master name of Peter Hammill under the music.  It IS a beautiful, less attack of Van Der Graff , yet Peter IS the forefront, with his loving bandmates in the non assuming backround roll..It IS a MUST for VDGG betrothed! Buy IT!  NOW!!!!!!! God Bless
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Okay, so I have never been a big Britney fan.  I have liked a few of her songs, but I have never bought an album before.  But when Gimme More came out I liked it.  I read some reviews of this album and thought, I am going to buy it.  And I REALLY like it.  It is infectious and very good.  I particulary like songs 2, 3 and 10.  #2 is a glimpse into the feelings about her life.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|This is a well acted sequence of stories that intermerge; it's also one of the most cynical movies I have ever viewed.  I mean get real, we all know that some nefarious dealings go on and that America has not stayed to worlds most powerful nation by sitting on its hands, but this is the limit..I mean is this what Hollywood thinks of this nation?!!! and if it is, how on Earth can they live here? We are shown to be Oil starved Imperialists who will stop at nothing to control the world...it's like something out of James Bond, except instead of SPECTOR you have spooks from American intelligence.  The movie definitely has an agenda and that really mars the end product, I actually liked many things about the movie, but it had too many stories going on at once and had a definite ax to grind.  A friend told me I'd have to watch it closely to understand what exactly was going on, but I really didnt find that to be the case, I totally understood what was going on, it was crystal clear to me.  I'd probably recommend this movie, because the acting is top notch and the story, though cynical, does at times resonate, it's just a shamne it is so overbearing in its point of view, really there was no need for a hammer, a feather will do; we can use it to swipe away the blowback.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|Pauline Kael famously wrote that the film version of \\"West Side Story\\" was a musical for people who hated musicals.  \\"Across the Universe\\" is a Beatles musical for people who hate musicals --and the Beatles.  At what remove from reality did Julie Taymor and her collaborators conceive their almost pitifully shallow version of the 1960's?  What in heaven's name did they watch before they made this movie?  It's so out of touch with what the '60's were really like that as someone who lived through the period and the music, it looks as real as the Hall of Presidents at Disneyworld.  I'm not talking about surface reality here (it's a musical) but of the emotional, psychological and social substance of this tumutuous decade, one that opened wounds that are still unstaunched, and changed the way a generation thought about the world and themselves.  These filmmakers are so callow they use Dr. King's assassination and the ensuing riots as fodder for an insulting MTV style music video version of events.  It's only one of many unbelievable lapses of taste and imagination.      Not once in this insipid ragout do we get the feeling that these are real people living in the period -- they're hippies from 21st century central casting, and they're as bland and unconvincing as the Partridge Family.  Instead, Taymor piles on her trademark surrealism (which has pretty well worn out its welcome) and even finds a way to insert her Big Boring Puppets in one of the scenes.  Elsewhere, she and the cinematographer steal shamelessly from Milos Foreman's film of \\"Hair\\", which is a masterpiece by comparison.  Even the plot Xeroxes  \\"Hair\\"'s central triangle.       The real failure, though, lies with Taymor and Co's misreading and underestimation of the Beatles' music.  These songs are timeless.  They could have set the story in present day, and the songs would have worked just as well, maybe even been more electrifying when the connections between Then and Now leapt out at the audience.  But that would have required real imagination and empathy with the music, two qualities painfully lacking in this lavish, ego-driven dud.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|Movie that terrified the entire country over 30 years ago is logically flawed from the start. 3 people are killed by shark attacks before the mayor and chamber of coommerce assent to closing off the waters of Amity Island to swimmers. National news reporters are on the scene,yet no request for Coast Guard intervention takes place.Finding and killing this stupendous shark is farmed out to Shaw, using his own boat, probably not safe in a swimming pool.Police chief Schneider and shark expert Dreyfus hop sboard to help save lives and the movie's credibility. They succeed thanks to terrific acting, frighteningly good photography, a lightning pace, and great background music by John Williams. Ironically, it's Shaw who's consumed by pride and stubborness, while the novices reap the joy of victory. The film is timeless and will still give viewers of all ages all that they can swallow.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year.  The acting was shoddy at best, Michale Pina felt like he was reading a script, Danny Glover was difficult to understand, and Mark Wahlberg was ridiculous.  This when coupled with a poorly designed storyline that needs to expound on the ridiculous to help the viewer understand where it is going, made this a real snooze.  If however you like the cliche movies where the US Government must find an ex military type living in the mountains who is disgruntled with their goverment to save the world (because lord knows there cannot possibly be anyone else in the government to save the day), and then finds out that he is being betrayed again, but gets severly injured, miraculously heals within hours, and is out fighting the entire United States without pain (from aforementioned injuries), and oh because he was a Marine can essentially build or control any device like MacGuyver and amazingly does not get shot when surrounded (numerous times) by helicopters and hundreds of soldier than you will enjoy this movie.
0140306013|5.0|Yes, there is a small, fluffy rabbit on the cover. Yes, this book five hundred page long fantasy about bunnies. But it's also about survival against all odds, sacrifices and quick-thinking, and the struggle to create a thing called `home'. Richard Adams, with the help of The Private life of the Rabbit by rabbit expert R. M. Lockley, has created a flawless world of rabbits and their many enemies compete with a religion and language of the rabbits.    One day, Hazel and his prophetic but undersized brother, Fiver, are hopping through the fields near their crowded warren, Fiver has a vision of their home destroyed and insists that they see their leader and tell him that they must abandon their burrow and seek another. He, of course, doesn't listen, so the two create a motley band of travelers, including Bigwig, the fierce and powerful warrior, Blackberry the brilliant and thoughtful, Dandelion, the storyteller, and Pipkin, the loyal but totally useless. Their trials are many (including rabbits who live in the wild, but are being trapped and fed by humans), but they somehow survive and find the ideal place for a warren, and discover the captain of the owsla (the class of strong male rabbits in a warren) from their old warren, who tells of the horrible destruction of the warren; the only problem with the new warren is that there are no female rabbits. So the rabbit refugees manage to rescue does from a horribly overcrowded and cruel warren, and a farm (Hazel, now the undisputed leader, gets shot in the leg in the process), and so their quest is completed and their warren created.     Set in modern-day England's forests and fields, Watership Down is, in my opinion, absolutely beautiful and highly reccomended.

0446693804|5.0|Middle-aged man Landon Carter looks back to the year 1958 -- the year where his life changed forever.  A fairly ordinary seventeen-year-old kid with a social life and a somewhat wealthy family, Landon is happy with his small-town life in Beaufort, North Carolina.  He even runs for class president.  But one night, after he becomes class president, he discovers he is dateless for the homecoming dance.  Desperate, he goes to the one girl he knows would not have a date for the evening: Jamie Sullivan, daughter of Baptist pastor Hegbert Sullivan.  Plain and shy, with an old and battered Bible always tucked inside her arm, a good-doer in all aspects, Jamie is not exactly the most appealing girl in Landon's eyes.  But when she asks him to co-star with her in a play, a play that means a lot to her and her father, Landon becomes her reluctant friend.  As he gets to know her and spends time with her, Landon develops feelings for sweet Jamie.  And that is when his journey to maturity truly begins...<br /><br />Man, Nicholas Sparks sure knows how to create a beautiful story that will have you reaching for the nearest Kleenex.  Having watched the film The Notebook and read True Believer, Message in a Bottle, The Choice and The Guardian (in that order), he has become THE author to go to when you're in the mood for a story that is tragic as well as beautiful and uplifting.  A Walk to Remember is that and a whole lot more.  At first, I wasn't keen on his first-person style.  Landon saying \\"if you know what I mean\\" to the reader almost throughout the book became annoying after a while.  It seemed like he finished almost every sentence that way.  Also, in spite of the book's short length, the narrative gets somewhat boring in some spots.  However, as I read on, I overlooked all of those faults and became enthralled with the beautiful story.  Landon is your typical seventeen-year-old boy who gets embarrassed and defensive whenever his friends taunt him, saying that Jamie is his girlfriend when it isn't so.  Jamie is a little perfect at times, but she is a sweet, wonderful character, and her unwavering faith in God, herself and others through the things that unfold in her life is wonderful and uplifting.  She truly lives her life according to the Bible, and that makes her an extraordinary person in Landon's eyes as well as everyone else's.  A Walk to Remember, like The Choice and The Guardian, will have a special place in my reading library.  I so look forward to reading other books by Sparks.  In addition to being a great writer, he is also a major hottie.  I love the back cover photo in the hardcover edition!  :-)iend when it isn't so.

0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's \\"Shock Doctrine\\" is certainly the history/politics book of the year for 2007 and probably the book of the decade.  She finds the common threads of history that run from the early 1970's to the early 2000's, showing how torture and terror have historically been closely connected to the economic doctrines of Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys.  She shows that merely opposing torture in the abstract, without studying the economic policies that give rise to torture, is inadequate.     Many books begin strong, and by about 1/3 of the way through, they lose steam.  This superbly researched book continues producing strong chapter after strong chapter clear to the end.   The only weak chapter is the last, in which Klein calls for the US to take a third path---neither capitalist nor socialist but more like Sweden, as if the Shock Doctrines are a choice, and a kinder, gentler form of capitalism is a possibility.  In reality, the drive to maximum profit is not an option but a mandate under capitalism, along with all that follows from this mandate.  But the book is so strong and so thought provoking as it ties together everything from CIA brainwashing experiments to the overthrow of South American governments to Eastern European efforts to combat hyperinflation to the US government's non-response to Hurricane Katrina that it is a definite must read.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This movie really depicts his story from his plight from the Nazi's in his homeland to where he spiritually belonged. The actor who portrayed him is excellent, it really seemed like it was actually the real Pope John who was in this film. The only thing is, there are scenes in the first half of the movie that are very intensly graphic in violence for children to watch.    I saw this film on television once and actually had to do extensive reasearch for a long (about 3-6 month's)time before I found the DVD and purchased this online.

0515141429|3.0|Driving along Interstate 15 and enjoying another adventure with Jack Reacher made the miles just fly by.  Didn't realize that &quot;The Killing Floor&quot; was the inception of the Jack Reacher character and series since I had either read or listened to other books by this author that featured this tough ex-military cop character and the stories are such that they do not have to be read in any particular order to be enjoyed.  I did notice that a lot of the Reacher adventures seem to begin with our heroic drifter sitting in a restaurant enjoying a cup of coffee or eating breakfast when a chance occurrence pulls him into yet another crime situation awaiting his particular brand of expertise.  This one is no exception.<br /><br />Jack takes us down south for this thrill ride, to a sleepy little town called Margrave, Georgia.  A murder has been committed and of course our hero is arrested for the foul deed since he is the only &quot;stranger&quot; in the area............and of course none of the upright town folk could have possibly committed the dirty deed.  It appears that everyone has a part to play in this escapade from the local police chief and his assistant (a black cop who has relocated from the Boston area) to a couple of ancient town barbers, to a bank executive and even the FBI.<br /><br />The story is liberally peppered with vicious bad guys committing brutal acts, damsels in distress, slimy town fathers, an ingenious scam, and enough action and surprises to keep you interested and on your toes (like the identity of the victim for whose murder Jack has been arrested).<br /><br />Our fast thinking hero's abilities are put to the test, and of course he passes with flying colors.  Give Jack and his creator, Lee Child, a B- on this one.  3 ½ stars.
B00110K62U|4.0|This new edition of the Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert (taped in 1995 at the Royal Albert Hall in London) is a welcome new edition for any person who found the original concert enjoyable and thrilling. The 2-DVD set comes in a good quality hard case with new artwork. The performances continue to be mostly excellent and one really does not miss the staging too much. There are several new positive additions to this edition. First is the wide-screen presentation of the concert. It was painfully obvious at certain points during the original release (especially the bigger numbers) that you were missing some of the singers on the sides. The new wide-screen presentation opens up the experience so you can watch the concert as it was originally taped. The second positive aspect of this issue is that the whole concert is on one side of one disk, which makes it much more convenient to watch. The third is the inclusion of the \\"Stage By Stage\\" Documentary from the late 80s tracking the recording of the Complete Symphonic Recording as a supplement on the second disk. Finally, for those who want to, you can follow along with new (optional) on-screen lyrics.     However, this edition is not without its disappointments. The first and by far the biggest disappointment is how it's only presented in stereo and not Dolby Digital 5.1 or better. Not having a digital audio option in 2008 is ridiculous and I would have greatly put up with changing disks if it meant having a better quality performance. The second disappointment is the deletion of parts of the concert previously available, which include part of \\"Little People\\" and the speeches by the creative talent behind the show at the end of the concert before the encore. Even if space was limited on the first disk, these deletions could have easily been put on the second disk as supplementary material.     So, while the concert itself continues to be quite enjoyable and there are some new additions that makes it a must have forany Les Miserable fan, there are some basic disappointments that keep this edition from being perfect.
0743496736|5.0|There are many tragic incidents in schools- Virginia Tech, Columbine, etc. But no author has ever dared to explore the psychological emotion behind the shooter, the roots of the problem, and the impact on the community.   But one has- beware Jodi Picoult!  My viewpoint on these kind of situations were easy- blame it on the shooter. Easy to scapegoat, right?   But what I found, what that it wasn't black and white- it was all gray. Fuzzy gray.   I had to admit that I cried a little bit at the end. The book will change your life, your viewpoint on these events... I think the book should get a million stars.   This is what teens should be reading- not the Gossip Girl crap.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|Epica has blended opera, classical, heavy metal, and death metal all in one. Where Nightwish began, Epica has taken to a farther limit. Simone Simons has an amazing vocal range and Mark Jansen's vocal tracks add the aggression portrayed lyrically. Mark's vocal tracks remind me of the band Deicide and add a unique flavor to the sound. I had this album on my mp3 player when one of the tracks came on. I said to myself, \\"I don't have any Nightwish on this today\\", when I remembered it was Epica. If you love the sound of Nightwish then you will definitly want to hear Epica. It's bands such as these that prove that Europe prides its musicians on talent not image.
1878424602|5.0|This was a very interesting book. A spiritual/practical guide for life. There are fundamental basic laws that guide the spiritual worlds. We are, as I once heard it said, spiritual beings having a human experience.  We need guides to help us through life. There is nothing more powerful than that still small voice from within. In all of his books we have to remember that in order to achieve success a person must quiet the mind through meditation. Then we are experiencing life from what he calls a unified field of existence.

B0000C9JCM|2.0|I've had the misfortune to hear this CD and all the perversions of Johann Andreas Pachelbel's chamber piece on this CD once too often.<br /><br />The work was written for three solo violins and basso continuo [violoncello or viola da gamba + organ or harpsichord] and it is a rather virtuoso work, typical of works written for a small group of violins [or cornetti] over an ostinato bass line in the 17th century.<br /><br />All but one \\"interpretation\\" on this CD bares little or no similarity to the written score at all and almost all of the arrangements of the piece are complete kitsch, trash, even. Cleo Laine's \\"song\\" is probably the worst example.<br /><br />So what do we learn about the composer from this CD? Virtually nothing. However, it is instructive to learn how tastelessly a piece of music can be pushed, strained, pummelled, shredded, extracted, decimated, pumped up, deflated, force-fed, mutated and generally exploited by musicians, singers and arrangers who clearly have no knowledge of 17th century music and couldn't care less about acquiring any knowledge of that music.<br /><br />I work in a music shop and it always amuses me when people who've bought CDs like this one decide to explore Pachelbel's music a little further and discover that they've been completely hoodwinked and that the composer's actual music sounds nothing like any interpretation of the Canon [& Gigue] they've ever heard - except, of course, if they've been fortunate enough to hear Musica Antiqua K&ouml;ln's or London Baroque's recordings. They walk away bewildered by the organ music, chamber music and cantatas of J. A. Pachelbel.<br /><br />Two stars for the one rather pleasant H.I.P. recording on this CD.
079073639X|1.0|This movie is boring. There's no suspense or action. The plot is ridiculous. The special effects are not insteresting.    Save your money on this one.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|loved it. just disappointed there will be no season 8. will miss Lorelei and Rory greatly.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|As a movie on the whole it is okay. The acting is great and the story is great. I don't think the facts are straight though. So if you just want to be entertained  and are a fan of era movies then this one will bring satisfaction.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie takes the viewer into an a world of possibilities which is what the Beatles were trying to tell all along. Be open and free to explore your universe. Don't get hung up on the politics because politics are always lies. You only have one life to find love, to give love, and to love your brother as yourself.  This isn't just remanufactured Beatlemania. It's truely a different arrangement with refreshingly good talent, thought provoking images, and a flattering \\"tip of the hat\\" to the many singer/songwriters of that era, that left us too early. It is splashed with top name talents, new and old, whose voices still render the rebellious music of a generation.   This movie has a \\"Moulin Rouge\\" feel to it with a 50'/60's appeal. If you love the music and more importantly the lyrics of the Beatles and were a child of the Vietnam era, you will love it. If your were born later, you will learn to love what it says about your parents generation.
0307346617|5.0|I'd heard nothing but rave reviews from friends about this book.  Normally, I take their statements with a grain of salt becasue their taste's are awful... I mean, they are friends with me, so they couldn't have too much going for them.<br /><br />Some have complained about the author's inability to wirte with different voices for the characters.  I just didn't see that.  I thought all the interviews were clearly different and, despite the rather implausibility of zombies occuring, the dialogue came across as realistic.  I think that the people who claim that there's not enough difference between the characters interviewed just didn't like the book and can't think of better reasoning for their dislike.<br /><br />I give this a five because I read it in two sittings.  Only my favorite of books grab me like that.  I also give it a five because it changed my life, namely, in the way I observe all my surroundings and appraise their ability to be defensive positions should zombies attack.<br /><br />I thought the book was well researched.  The author employeed a lot of geographic information and I thought that was another strong point.  Not only that, but the book focuses on a lot of different aspects, from phamacuetical, military, civilian, children, astronauts! Each vantage gives you a different angle that leadds to a fuller vision of the war, rather than just a \\"how the military won.\\"<br /><br />Go to a library, or a bookstore and read a couple random interviews and judge for yourself.<br /><br />Remember the adage: those who don't learn from history...

B000VBJEEG|4.0|Cute movie my child is only 2 so he can't completely follow the plot line but he is amused by it.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|To me, the mood of this CD is a continuation of the one established in \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\", maybe a little more on the mellow side. Poignant lyrics, pretty melodies and masterful musicianship all contribute to a nice collection, one that 'grows on you' over time. I would love to be sitting in a warm pub on a dreary day with a pint or two, listening to Mark and his band playing these songs. The folk waltz, \\"Heart Full Of Holes\\" contains one of the best musical themes that I've heard in any of his songs - I can envision a roomful of folks raising their glasses and swaying to the accordian-tinged carousel music in the bridge.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|I loved this movie in 1982 and still love it today, however today I have a greater appreciation for that fact that this is old school. No CG, no green screens, this is old school photography at it's best. The use of \\"real\\" atomsphere to help create the overall look is just amazing and what makes it visually so successful.<br /><br /> Now am I baised, well yes, I love Harrision Ford and Sean Young, but Rugter Howard takes the cake in this movie. He brings a cool calm collected crepiness. This is Heavy Metal Mag on screen and done the \\"right\\" way. Yes there are other movies that come very close (Fifth Element and Sin City come to mind). To me this one nails it on the head.<br /><br />I'd give it six stars if that was available.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I was not expecting that much from this movie, and was really surprised!  This movie was hysterical!  I have not laughed so much through a movie ever.  This movie is in a catagory all by itself! Above the rest!
B000Y7U98C|3.0|Sunshine could have been a fabulous Sci-fi. It had it all; the wonderful acting, the gorgeous special effects, and a great plot idea. And the film sticks to that formula for the first 2/3 of the film. I will not go into spoilers, but after a certain point, it becomes very weird and confusing. Not technically confusing, just frustratingly pointless. It makes you question why and how and doesn't give you any answers whatsoever. At that point, it seems very predictable what will happen. It gets pretty cliche very quickly. It just seems odd that it strays so much from being a science fiction, to being a murderous game of hide and seek. I was hoping for something different and it didn't happen. Its almost like the Director was thinking about how to end it, but couldn't figure it out, so he went the opposite predictable way. Which is too bad because the first half of Sunshine was pretty great.
B000F3UAFC|4.0|Helen Hunt has a filmography with a wide span but is probably best remembered for the  'Miss Cutie Pie' roles she established in the television series \\"Mad About You\\" and the award-winning \\"As Good As It Gets\\".  In this movie, based on Oscar Wilde's play \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\", she impressed me the way a fine wine carefully aged to perfection might.  Add to that Tom Wilkinson's best performance since \\"The Governess\\", good support from Scarlett Johansson, Stephen Campbell Moore, and Mark Umbers; and top it all off with costumes and sets which will transport one back to the 30s and there's the formula needed for a truly good movie.  Mrs. Erlynne (Hunt) leads a rather dissolute life, is considered something of a jezebel by the members of high society, and she has a secret.  When she finds she must quickly get out of New York she notices the Windemeres (Moore and Johansson) are vacationing in Italy and sees the handsome husband as a possible `easy mark'.  You just know it's going to get `sticky' somewhere, somehow, but unless you've already seen Wilde's play you're going to be surprised--and delighted.  Some of the minor supporting roles are just a tad overdone, but they are fortunately left behind when things start heating up, so think of them as comic relief and sit back and enjoy.  And keep that hanky handy.
0792833201|4.0|In 1982 Steven Spielberg gave us this enjoyable spookfest; it was directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, 1974), and it is definitely a fun thrill-ride. It contains a few truly fright-inducing set pieces, particularly the clown doll scene. Many's the kid who had sleepless nights because of that. Very effective.<br /><br />From the first glimpse of Poltergeist (The National Anthem heralding the end of television's broadcast day...before most TV was on all day and night) to the last comical scene, you are guaranteed a good time with plenty of chills and thrills. This is not just a good scary flick, it has that magical Spielberg touch. The direction, cinematography, and performances are good. The budget is good, as are the effects for the time.<br /><br />We meet a family that could be our neighbors. They're normal. Not goody goody, not quirky, but average and typical. Believable. So it's so much more jarring when evil forces enter their lives.<br />I like Poltergeist. It's got class. It knows when to be funny, and when to scare you. And when you think the supernatural danger is finally gone, it gets even worse.<br /><br />I have one small complaint about this film. Unfortunately there is a stupid (and poorly done) jump-cut around the 34 minute point where the Mom is showing her hubby the moving chairs; apparently the theatrical release included the line \\"I hate Pizza Hut!\\" uttered by Craig T. Nelson, and Pizza Hut took issue. (Check any legitimate copy of the film's screenplay and you'll find this dialogue.) Therefore, every video release of Poltergeist, from VHS to dvd, has this ridiculously inept edit which cuts from JoBeth Williams in midsentence to when she and Nelson are on the neighbors' doorstep. It's a disorienting and cumbersome jolt, not smooth at all.<br />Maybe I'm nitpicking a good film, but they could have cut it at a better point where a character wasn't speaking. Or didn't MGM consider dubbing over Nelson's line with different dialogue? It's done all the time. Oh, well. It's just a little drawback to a perfectly good spooky film.<br /><br />But even with that peccadillo, Poltergeist is one of the best modern haunted house films available. It's not as chilling as the classic \\"The Haunting\\" from 1963 (based on Shirley Jackson's wonderful novel). Poltergeist is more of a funhouse ride, and it always satisfies..

0143038419|1.0|Yes, I know memoirs are by their nature focused mainly on one person...Unfortunately, the person in this case is way too self-absorbed and whiny for my taste.  It seems the author got paid in advance in order to fund her trip....And the itinerary felt like a gimmick.  I quit the book half-way through, as I really could not stand anymore of the privileged author's writing.  I did take a peek at the end, which made me like the book even less--so she goes on this trip to find herself....And ends up rolling around with a hunky island man.  Love indeed...

I was completely absorbed by the tale of Mamah and loved the harmony with which this woman was depicted, while showing all the adversity she had to go through. Not knowing anything about Nancy Horan, I had no presupposition about this book and fully enjoyed it! For those who haven't read, are on the bubble of reading it, or have read it, whether this book is categorized as fictional or historical, it is a lovely little gem to read!!

B000YDOOU0|5.0|Mr. Metheny has managed to do it again.  He has produced a CD full of good Jazz with a sound that reflects some of the Jazz greats.  He did it all with real musical instruments, none of that synthetic junk which seems to dominate the music world today.<br /><br />As always his love affair with his Genre and that guitar really shines through, with timing next to none.  His accompanists, are all to be comended for a job well done.<br /><br />Included is a track which seems to be a protest of the condition of America today, \\"Is This America,\\" and the equally lamenting \\"When We Were Free.\\"  Some might dispute, but I am guessing this is his protest, and statement.  All in all this is a good addition to any Jazz lover's collection.  Happy listening.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|lets crack it open shall we..<br />review wise i have the USA<br />distribution of this..and i paid $75 for it.<br />the alive 2007 limited-E was out of print the day it was released..<br /><br />1. When you get the \\"disk\\" you are greeted with literally a cd jewel case sized, 1/2 inch think hard cover book, and its a book in every sense of the word, internal fabric based binding and all! On the cover is the alive logo and stuck to it is the blue daft punk sticker, luckily the sticker is one of those super easy removable ones. As for the cover its all gloss black and made really well. The back cover features a full track listing in \\"alive\\" blue. AND for once, the copy right info on the back does not threaten you within an inch of your life!!!<br /><br />2. Turn the cover to open it, on the back side of the cover is where disk one lives, happily resting snuggly in its matt black-thick paper-folder, and this folder thing is firmly bound to the cover...like a how a record would live in its sleeve. On the right is a page of high density black mat paper, its a good place to put the sticker by the way..turn the page to see the actual book.<br /><br />3. The book is actually pretty cool, filled with images of the stage, daft punk, the alien triangle and all its glowing glory, the concert setup and what not. Although for the cost of today, meaning the out of print cost..its not too spectacular, but for the original list price it was sold at.. yea i would say its a huge bonus. After the 50 pages...turn the final page to the back side of the back cover, This is where disk 2 lives. Again its snuggly living in a sleeve.<br /><br />4. To the disks!, side the disks out to view, the disks are like the cover, jet black with just the alive logo, and \\"daft punk Alive 2007\\". Its super simplistic and very cool. As for the CD-R it self, its of standard release grade, best to archive them as they are going to scratch easily, best they remain in the book FAR AWAY from high speed drives and car stereos.<br /><br />5. THE MUSIC, disk one is pure ear candy. 12 continuous meshed tracks covering over 20+ mixes, an entire concert from start to finish with the crowd. The opening track throws you right into the mix and primes you for whats to come. Towards the center things really start heating up with high speed -almost perfect mixes of all there major tracks, and towards the end you will rocking out with the crowd to last second. Sound quality is clear with great highs, mids and bass.I would say the CD achieves max allowed sound range..Owners of large stereos with subs shall very be pleased. Headphone wise lots of channel changes and ear candy..IE they should get an A for mastering.<br /><br />Disk two: EXTRA MIXES! and VIDEO! WELL WORTH IT! THEY SOUND AWESOME!!!<br />video is very cool BUT! it does not show the giant triangle with its full projection screens on!!! its mostly of just the light show and the fans..<br /><br />THE JIST.<br />One, i would imagine one would think its crazy<br />to pay $75 to over $100 for this thing.<br />Especially when its probably floating about on the net.<br /><br />but Alive 2007 LE is not about data on plastic<br />its about the spirit of music..<br />and the fact when you buy a CD or record you should get something<br />concrete for your money!!!!

But I doubt very much if anyone has the knowledge Bill Dufty is offering here.<br /><br />You don't don't read this book, small as it may be, you need to study it. Yes read it, then get a marker and then REALLY read it..........why? It will shake you up more than you realise. The writer has experienced its contents in many ways, and for the rest has delved historically for the comparisons.<br /><br />It is first value for money.It was first published around 1975 and is still going strong.........John Lennon used to give copies to his friends.<br /><br />It takes you to the root of a lot of problems concerning sugar,(Sucrose) and many reasons to give it a wide berth! It is scaring in some ways, this does no arise till you start putting into practise what Dufty says and you get the..............SUGAR BLUES!<br /><br />Ok,you have not had a heart attack.....then wait till you get one.......and then you will REALLY read it......Diabetes.......your sugar level is OK? Is it.........how many have taken the Glucose Tolerance test to find out the body's reaction to sugar and see if it can handle the poison. It is a slow killer as the book will tell you. Basically know what it does to the teeth.....rots them. But why.........why is it the West Indians can eat it and have magnificent teeth? Buy the book and find out.<br /><br />It may cost a few dollars, but compared with the benefits..............it is nothing............Imagine being told.....you have Diabetes....how much would you pay the doctor to say........you have NOT got it........well Dufty tells you how to avoid it. If you don't think this worth knowing, then you should not be wasting your time reading this review.<br /><br />If you have any sense, then get a copy, and show you really value your health. Because that is what you are buying, a key to good health and like a good  map book, shows you the road to take to get it.<br /><br />I think it will shake you. I write this as an ex-marathon runner, and know the damage sugar does to the marathon runner....how it retains all in the gut and refusing to let the real energy through till the sugar has been absorbed.......but then you need more sugar.....more energy.........and so it goes on.<br /><br />Get the book and you will see the value you have just paid next to nothing for..............you just could not regret it.

The book instead is about a collection of misfits in the South with such names as \\"Spareribs,\\" \\"Bubber,\\" and even a deaf mute strangely named \\"Singer.\\" These people do their best to live their lives, and they seem to find some comfort in setting up one guy as a sort of god-like figure (there is an uber-god who seem to be the only content person in the novel). What happens when your god dies? I guess you keep on going. The lives of these misfits sheds light on personal and inter-personal conflicts. If the soul is the seat of passion and turmoil, of beauty and ugliness, of honor and cowardice, then the South is the soul of America, as far as I can tell from this book. Anyway, like I said in the beginning, this book is not about hunting, but maybe you'll find it worthwhile.
1594481717|4.0|After hearing about this book for a long time, I procrastinated and was able to pick it up in paperback.  Not sure why I waited, however, as the book is jam packed with great references, stories, and research to indicate that business strategy won't always be dominated by Excel (with all due respect to the good folks in Redmond).      He announces the \\"Conceptual Age\\" which will emphasize Design, Story, Symphony (big picture thinking), Empathy, Play, and Meaning.  He develops each of these so well, I have since gone out and bought other books and resources he recommends.    I think you will enjoy this book and would recommend it for anyone wanting to think anew about business strategy, or interested in broadening your own personal investigations into these topics.

B0010V4TZU|4.0|The hype for this band reminded me a bit of what happened with the Strokes (who I like) in the beginning of their career.  So I snuck a listen of this album and was pleasantly shocked.  It's a collection of fairly catchy pop-rock tunes that do sound a bit like Paul Simon's Graceland backed by the Strokes IMHO.  That's all OK in my book.  My favorites so far are A-Punk, Cape Code Kwassa Kwassa, Campus, Boston and M79, but the rest of the songs are all listenable too.  The best part about all the hype here is that it's a band where they have a lead singer who can really sing.  I've felt burned in the past by the hype of so-called indie bands like \\"Clap Your Hands, Say Yeah\\" who have great music and melodies, but are fronted by a lead singer who wails away like a cat being strangled.  If you like groups like the Strokes or Maritime, then Vampire Weekend would be a worthy addition to your collection.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|I've read that this film won the Best Foreign Film Oscar at last year's Academy Awards...but I can't remember any of the other awards.  The dire state of American Cinema is only worsened by far better films coming in from other shores.<br /><br />While Hollywood gussies up and prepares to throw more awards at anything anti-Bush, anything that features George Clooney (who will out-preen himself at his acceptance speeches instead of his performance), and anything that obese gasbag Michael Moore points a camera at, foreign films appear to be more interested in things like TELLING A STORY or ENGAGING AN AUDIENCE.  You know, stuff the focus groups that rule Hollywood appear to have completely forgotten.<br /><br />But enough about our mess here....<br /><br />I'd heard about \\"The Lives of Others\\" but deliberately stayed out of the conversation because I wanted to enjoy the film from a fresh perspective, so I won't go into every reason why I liked it.  Suffice to say I liked just about everything in it.  It is a film where everything works.<br /><br />Set in East Germany in 1984 (an homage to George Orwell?), a Stasi surveillance and interrogation expert named Wiesler, wonderfully played by Ulrich Muhe, is asked to spy on Dreyman, an \\"upstanding\\" playwright admired by the State for his \\"non-rebellious\\" body of work.  Why?  A repulsive party member lusts after Christa-Marie, Dreyman's beautiful and talented actress/girlfriend.  If they don't find anything on Dreyman...they're to find something on Dreyman.<br /><br />The story expertly winds and twists through the Cold War landscape of East Berlin as Wiesler, stoicly rattled by the injustice of Dreyman's plot and touched by Christa-Marie's stage presence, goes from being an efficient, machine-like bug to a compassionate human being.<br /><br />I didn't see a false note anywhere in the film.  Like I said: Everything Works.  Definitely check it out.<br /><br />(I was just in Berlin last fall and visited the Stasi Museum, just around the corner from Hitler's bunker.  Any German citizen can go in--just as Dreyman did after the Wall fell in the film--and request his or her file to review.  A dark and fascinating time in a city still struggling with the shadow of the Nazis.  Berlin's a great city.  Well worth visiting and taking any of their walking tours).itizen can go in--just as Dreyman did after the Wall fell in the film--and request his or her file to review.

B000002HMH|3.0|Maybe not the best Metallica album but it is by no means bad at all, much less the trash many claim it to be. On the contrary, its a pretty good effort and its no mistaken it is Metallica. If you are a hard core Metallica fan, this is either a must have because you love everything Metallica or you're gonna hate it like many others because you're still hung up on a single style of Metallica that takes you back to your better days (entering puberty with a crush on the fat girl down the street), who knows. If you're a metal lover and found you enjoyed other Metallica albums, you'll like this one too. Take my 3 stars lightly, I reserve 5 stars for very few, perfect albums, 4 stars for almost perfect. I'd give this a solid 3.5 stars if there was an options for it.

0374280967|4.0|This novella may be only 120 pages long but it is packed with all the intriguing situations you might expect from a much longer novel.  As I began reading I couldn't help but wonder what I would have done if I had found myself in Mr. Hutchings place.  There he was, doing what he did every Wednesday in his City of Westminster mobile library van parked outside the kitchen entrance to the palace.  Obviously he never expected to look up and find Her Majesty in his part of the universe.  And Norman.  Norman was perhaps the most interesting character in the entire book for me.  Would I have been as nonchalant about becoming the advisor for Her Majesty in her new adventures in reading?  I think not.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book because I am one of those Americans who has a deep respect for the English monarchy.  Not so much each individual, but the monarchy as an institution.  Over here, a political dynasty is considered venerable if it lasts 100 years.  To observe an institution such as the monarchy which has survived in spite of all the problems which have occurred within it is just completely amazing to me.  I liked Mr Bennett's portrayal of The Queen.  He was neither too kind nor too unkind.  His balance was wonderful and, in the end, believable.  His social commentary on how an older person must be suffering from a form of dementia if they begin to deviate from their previous norm hit quite close to home for someone who has just turned 65.  I loved it when Her Majesty demonstrated that not only did she still have \\"it\\", she was willing to use \\"it\\" to prove who was still the boss.<br /><br />This lovely little book was, for me, warm and witty and clever and charming.  I sincerely appreciate the fact that someone enjoyed it enough to recommend that I read it.  Now I'm doing you that same favor.  Please read and laugh and enjoy the story.  I was a little worried about how Mr Bennett was going to end it, but I think he did just fine.

This is my all time, favorite movie --  it's  simple, light spirited, and happy, and inspiring. A good reminder to myself and to everyone else in the world, that things aren't always what they seem (to be). Elwood (played by Jimmy Stewart) did not let other's perceptions of his reality sway him.  He continued on his own happy, polite, well-mannered, way in life.
B000OVLBIU|1.0|Disclaimer:  This is a four star movie, and I'm not trying to tear it down; it's a fun film.  But this special edition is Terrible!!!  All the added scenes were cut for a reason.  They range from  unimportant to awful, and you don't have the option to watch the film without the extras.  Here's an example for those of you who have seen the film, and are deciding which version to buy.  When Johnny is about to jump the Blackhawks in the stadium, he flashes back to a conversation with his dad about a helicopter stunt.  In the Extended Cut, they add a scene to the beginning of the film where this conversation takes place.  These two scenes are only twenty minutes or so apart in the movie.  It's unnecessary, and dumbs down the more important scene that was in the theatrical release.<br />All of the added scenes are like this.  It actually ruins the movie.<br />Please, by all means, buy Ghost Rider.  Just make sure you get the regular edition.  I have to spend another $25+ to replace this movie, because I can't watch this cut again.<br />Spare yourself.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|P.O'Brian had his breakthrough as a writer of high literature in an unusual genre for his level of sophistication in the 90s, when he was about 80 years old. Hollywood bought movie rights then, but it took another decade before this movie came out.<br />For me, it was my first encounter with a phenomenon that has given me many hours of pleasure since. I had known of Aubrey and Maturin since a while, but never read any of the books, nor any of POB's other books (interesting novels and biografies, and excellent short stories). After watching the movie, I picked up the first volume of the series and was hooked instantly. Great stuff.<br />The film is good, if maybe not great. The casting of Crowe as Aubrey was a stroke of genius. I am not equally happy with the Maturin impersonator. he is not a bad actor, but he looks wrong. Will definitely watch it a few more times, but unfortunately I haven't yet managed to convert my women to the faith, so there are some social walls to climb.
B000001FDQ|4.0|Ah yes, Yngwie Malmsteen, the love/hate guitar virtuoso from Sweden. His debut, Rising Force, was definitely an album that set the standard for guitar heroics way back when it came out. Of course, classical music mixed with rock music was done before Yngwie came along: Yes's Steve Howe, Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore, Ozzy Osbourne's Rhandy Rhoads, and Van Halen's Eddie Van Halen were all doing it. However, Yngwie certainly took it to new heights, playing much faster guitar parts, mixed with a lot of contrapuntal scales and baroque-styled classical music. A lot of critics say that his music is soulless and mechanical, and while there is more than a little truth to that, I feel that just as many of his compositions, particularly the ones on this album, have a personality.<br /><br />The album starts off with Yngwie's 2 staples: Black Star and Far Beyond the Sun, the latter being slow and melancholic, and the former being agressive and grandiose, which everyone has come to expect from Yngwie. They are both truly unique and special tunes, FBTS being my favorite. Icarus Dream Suite is also a great song which features very dreamy guitar and keyboard parts, and feels like several different songs put into one. There are 2 songs with lyrics on this album: Now Your Ships are Burned and As Above, So Below. Now, even the biggest Malmsteen fan will admit that Yngwie's lyrics are lackluster. It's not they're cheesy like the lyrics of countless hair metal bands at the time, it's just that they're.... not very interesting. There just seems to be no point to the lyrics, and almost seems like a bunch of words thrown together at the last minute. Still, that doesn't take away from the greatness from this album. Evil Eye is a great rocker, and Yngwie actually shows a little bit of restraint on it. Little Savage is reminscent of the rocking-out of FBTS, and Farwell is a realxing instrumental and a great way to close the album.<br /><br />Now, I can't really stress enough how sensational a guitar player Yngwie is. His guitar solos are incredibly complex, fast, and face-melting. The actual reality of how good skilled he is, is staggering. Many non-musicians are awed just by how fast he is, but real musicians (such as myself) can appreciate another part of his playing: playing that fast with such perfect articulation between each note is next to impossible to do, and only a select few of musicians can do that. Don't get me wrong, needless to say, there are plenty of young guitarists out there who don't make albums that play fast and are trained in classical music, and I've watched videos of guitarists playing his songs perfectly. However, no one can really do it like Yngwie.<br /><br />The backing band here is very underrated. A lot of people seem to be criticizing Yngwie for not letting the other instruments showing off. I will be the first to tell you that what those people type is a completely lie. They keyboards are great and there are solos on several songs. The bass is completely audible (and is also played by Yngwie) and there are a few noticeable solos throughout the album. I'm a bass player myself, and I can type with confidence that the bass lines here are more than 2 or 3 notes. The drums are fast and complex. Of course Yngwie is the true star here, but the other instruments still shine.<br /><br />Now, as for all of the criticisms of him out there... there are some people who actually state their cases against him well, but there are also a bunch of morons out there who really need to shut up and think about what they're saying. Yngwie is often criticized for his playing being emotionless and machanical. Admittedly, he has made a lot of songs that do fall into that category, and he really doesn't have any progression, unfortunately. However, some of these critics still acknowledge the fact that he is an incredibly skilled guitarist who knows his stuff. However...<br /><br />There are still a bunch of poser wannabe music journalists thatfeel so smart and clever by criticizing ever little thing he's done. I've read many comments on his videos that say ridiculous things like \\"0MG LYK HIII SUKZZZZZZ I BET HII KUDNT PLAI DA BL00000000000ZZZZZ 0WNLIII RIIIUL MUZAKYANS KAN PLAI DAT STUUUUF.\\" If these people really think that Yngwie Malmsteen, a man that can play 93928281781737857573727817818738348 notes in 1 trillionth of a second, can't play the blues, they must be heavy drug addicts. Then there are the idiots who don't understand that just because they think one guitarist is better than the other doesn't mean that the not-as-good player isn't skilled, such as people who say \\"Michael Angelo Batio is better. Therefore, you are all wrong and Yngwie sucks and anyone who likes him is an idiot.\\" Michael Angelo is an unquestionably gifted musician, but he's not worse or better than Yngwie. Now, let's just say, for now, that he is a better player, ok? Let's see.... so WHAT? All of the sudden because MAB is better than Yngwie, people can't like Yngwie? Their whole argument is based around the idea that one guitarist is better than the other, so therefore you shouldn't like the worse player. This is a totally ridiculous and pointless argument. Besides, both Yngwie and Michael play similar styles, and should be enjoyed for what they can compose, not because one is better than the other. Personaly, I think Yngwie is better than Michael, but Michael is definitely not far behind him. Even if you hate Yngwie's music, you at least have to admire his talent.<br /><br />And then there are people who actually claim that Yngwie's music so simple and easy to play, and therefore he sucks. To these people, I say this: Please, by all means, put up a video of YOU playing something better! I encourage you to pick up your guitar, put your video camera in front of you, and play something more complex and inctricate than Yngwie's playing, and put it on Youtube! You say his style of playing is so easy, so, therefore, you should have no problem playing better than him!<br /><br />Sorry for that huge rant, but I had to get that off my chest. Anyway, back to the CD.<br /><br />I took of one star because Yngwie's music is not something I can listen to at any time. Sometimes, it can be a bit much for me. I have to be in the right mood to truly enjoy his music, and not feel like I'm sitting through a history lesson of guitar wizardry.<br /><br />I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy this album, but if you have the ability to ignore all of the music snobs out there who like to bash Yngwie because it makes them feel intelligent, you might find Rising Force to be something very special. I recommend this to fans of shred music, and just music in general.ng ever little thing he's done.

0316067598|4.0|A very engaging read from beginning to end. The author's often revealed negative judgment of the left distracted and disheartened me. Statements such as, \\"Sorry lefties. But like we say...in Texas, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\\" only served to demonstrate further divisiveness in a culture unraveling because of these sentiments. Those who serve our nation should refrain from fueling partisan rhetoric--and I'm in the military.<br /><br />Great story, however, and told in an easily read fashion.

It's worth seeing if for no other reason than that.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|El Cid has been one of my favorite films, man and boy, for 47 years. It is the story of Roderigo Diaz of Bivar, destined to unify medieval Spain, both Christian and Moor, under the leadership of a single king, in order to protect her from the depredations of a tyrannical invader. It is also a love story as Roderigo loses the love of the \\"beautiful Chimene\\" to protect the honor of his family, and how she rediscovers her love when he loses all for the honor of Spain.    Charlton Heston stars in the title role, whose stature and sincerity easily transition into the mythic finale of the film. The ageless Sophia Loren plays Chimene, whose character is as proud and powerful as that of her lover. The rest of the cast is filled with the best film and stage actors that Europe could produce: Gary Raymond, Herbert Lom, Genevieve Bujold, Raf Vallone, John Fraser, Michael Hordern and Douglas Wilmer.    It is refreshing that, in an age of Computer Generated Imagery, this film chose locations and built sets that matched the grand background of this Spanish legend. The castle of Belmonte, that provides the backdrop to the tournament at Calahorra, blends seamlessly with the sets of the throne room at Castile and the cathedral at Burgos. There is no fakery here. The sets constructed, the costumes, armor and weapons manufactured are all real and as authentic as historical accuracy would allow.    This two-disc Collector's Edition has many special features. Along with the digitally remastered feature, it also has an insightful \\"Making of . . .\\" featurette and a short film on Samuel Bronston, the film's producer. Samuel Bronston was a maverick independent producer during the waning days of the Hollywood studio system, who specialized in making epic films. Among his films are John Paul Jones, The Fall of the Roman Empire, King of Kings and 55 Days at Peking. To this day, Jeffrey Hunter and his striking blue eyes is still my vision of Jesus. It also provides stills from the film, a facsimilie of the souvenir program and the Dell comic book (I still have mine from 1961). My favorite feature is the one on Miklos Rozsa, the film's composer, whose canon of film music has never been equaled in breadth, scope or quality.    This film still stands the test of time and is well worth the asking price and the time spent wandering through its wonders. I hope that you will journey with me through medieval Spain. I have never been disappointed. I know you won't.
B00021R7CG|4.0|My friend gave me \\"The Day After\\" as a gift, and after watching that movie I was interested in seeing other Cold War era movies.  This movie was cheaper than \\"Fail Safe\\" and from the reviews, it sounded okay, so I bought it.  I'm glad I did.    As noted in other reviews, \\"The Dawns Early Light\\" revolves around a nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union.  Thinking that they were attacked by NATO, the Soviets launch a limited nuclear attack on the U.S., then the Soviet Premier FAXes/e-mails the President and tell him that it was a big mistake (I guess there was no direct line red phone).      The U.S. armed forces go on alert and launch in response, even as their bases are being bombed.  Later, the U.S. President talks with the Soviet Premier to discuss options of limiting the overall damage, having decided that the attack was a mistake.  But, while the attack on the U.S. was said to be a mis-understanding, Soviet fighters kept attacking the bombers and U.S. ships were being torpedoed.    References are made about China attacking the U.S.S.R., but it seemed a little odd that the U.S. President didn't have direct communication with the leaders of other NATO countries, or any reports of what was happening outside of the U.S. The U.S. President may be able to stop the U.S. attack, but what about China?    I noted what I thought was a vailed reference to \\"Star Trek\\" when the General, played by James Earl Jones, tells the pilot of his aircraft \\"Smitty\\" that he needs full power out of his engines, to catch another plane within five minutes.    This movie would be a good addition to a Cold War era collection.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|`American Gangster' is a bit uneven at times and somewhat overlong but the film succeeds in delivering a searing indictment on American society and the pervasive nature of corruption in the \\"natural order of things\\" as lived out in the United States during the Viet-Nam War era.<br /><br />There are scattered moments of greatness reminiscent of the classic `Godfather' movies but not quite enough to elevate this film to such a lofty level of consideration. Denziel Washington provides his usual superior performance as gangster / drug lord Frank Lucas. It's his storyline that makes the film worth watching. The role of honest cop Ritchie Roberts portrayed by Russell Crowe is the weaker of the two merging storylines but when the two finally come face to face late in the film everything comes together in grand fashion.<br /><br />My Rating: Worth a watch if you're a Washington or Crowe fan, into gangster films, or just curious about the socio-political climate in the `60's; -4 Stars-.

B00002E224|5.0|We found these DVDs and bought both together as a birthday gift. Before Sunrise is the first installment to a rather intelligent encounter of two complete strangers. The roles are played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who meet per chance on a train ride.    Both are reading books and their concentration is interrupted by a couple who appears to be fighting or loudly voicing opposing views. She moves away to be able to read, and sits by the young American and after a few looks of interest, they engage in conversation, producing a rather witty exchange that simply captures viewers.    They soon are involved in candidly sharing ideas, intimate views on life, past experiences and little by little they are so fascinated that she decides to stop in Vienna and spend the night getting to know one another, for he must return to the USA the next day.    Their 14 hour stop over in Vienna is great and as they walk the streets and ride the trains, we are witness to their relationship and we are enchanted to take part on what is a wonderful tour of this historic city.     The director provides a rare view to two individuals that partake in a rather poignant discussion of rather deep subjects we all confront at one point or another. We used the feature of English subtitles for the hearing impaired to make sure we would not miss a single word exchanged during the film. You are left with the impression that these two shall never meet again... and that is why we bought both, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, to see the next chapter of the lives of these two captivating human beings.     Don't miss it!
B00003CXIP|5.0|\\"Stand By Me\\" is a must and own for everyone! Its a great tale of friendship. From the first time I saw this movie when I was young, until now, its always been one of my favorites! If you havent seen it by some chance, watch it, youll love it!
B0002YLC24|5.0|We found these DVDs and bought Before Sunrise / Before Sunset together as a birthday gift. Before Sunset is the second installment to a rather intelligent relationship of what were two complete strangers. The roles are played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who return after 9 years to share with viewers, chapter two of their romantic encounters.    In 1994, Before Sunrise initiated with both actors reading books on a train ride through Europe. She sits close by the young American and after a few looks of interest, they engage in conversation, candidly sharing ideas, intimate views on life, and past experiences. She decides to stop in Vienna to spend the night getting to know one another. For the next 14 hours, Vienna provides a marvelous setting for their relationship and viewers take part on what is a wonderful tour of this historic city.     Now, Before Sunset brings these two together again, after a 10 year span. They are reunited at a book store, where Hawke, who has published a book about their romantic encounter in Vienna, is giving a lecture on the theme of his book.    They have just a few hours to spend together and this time, the setting is in beautiful Paris. You can sense unresolved issues of love, betrayal, abandonment, grief, guilt... but a certainty that the spark of love ignited 10 years ago has endured the test of time and is now an ardent fire of unrequited love.    The conversations are intelligent, up-dated; their lines are written with great skill and engage us in topics that are foremost in our minds. It is wonderful to be part of the lives of two individuals, now for over 10 years, and hopefully with a third installment in the future, for the movie leaves us again not sure of where these two will take their love relationship.    Jesse [Ethan Hawke] and Celine [Julie Delpy] are simply magnificent. The special features are great for we learned that the actors are allowed to write most of their own lines, their discussions now, as then, are centered around deep subjects we all confront at one point or another, and when Celine plays her guitar for Jesse... that only one song she promises before he returns to New York City... we know that if he leave her again... he is a fool, for their love is simply... magnificent!    Don't miss it!
B000UNYJV8|4.0|I was psyched when I saw this preview! Finally it came out on DVD, of course I rented it right away. The acting is great, the story is good!<br />Recommended to all movie lovers. If you like this movie, check out \\"Green Street Hooligans\\"!
6303011012|5.0|One of the great musical recordings of the 20th Century.  I don't know if the artists even know that a concert is going to come together and have all the elements to make it truly wonderful.  This concert is fabulous with a mixture of musicians who came together with harmony that just takes you away to another place.  Truly, this recording blends all that is good in music and humanity into one great concert, not to mention the venue!    How perfect is that?

B000QCUB8I|3.0|The French have never been pioneers of the electronica music genre. Daft Punk is good for a few tracks every once in a while, but after three albums, they get dull. The same goes for \\"Cross\\"; good tracks are few and far between. Many are often just generic \\"techno\\" mainstream crap, but there are a few gold tracks, namely DANCE, with DVNO's groovy beat with a decent singer, but being a tad boring after a minute. I'm already bored of their career after only one album.
B0010ZR160|1.0|I need to disclose the fact that I haven't seen this movie.  That is exactly why I'm giving it a terrible review.    I recently received this disc and was excited to watch it because of the positive reviews of the movie.  I was disappointed however when I found the movie has a copy protection scheme which makes it UNPLAYABLE in my Media Center PC.  Since I have no other DVD players, this disc is useless.    Don't waste your money on this one.

1932907009|5.0|I haven't read the entire book yet, actually I haven't got past chapter one.  Why?  Because Blake made me think about loglines.  A subject other books I've read haven't put a whole lot of empahsis on, or at least not in a way that makes you realize just how important a good logline is.  So, for the past week I've been writing loglines and have a good handle on how they are supposed to be written.  Now, I'm ready to begin work on a new idea I have, but first I think I'll sneak a peek at chapter 2... Well hell, Blake says I'm not ready to start writing yet.  Okay, on to chapter 2.  Blake, great book.
B00005RG6B|5.0|I have the 2-disc CD when this album came out back in the 90's. It's one of my favorite hard-rock bands, and I am very happy to now purchase the DVD version of this album. I play it on my portable DVD player at work during my breaks. I've received many compliments from people at work pertaining to the DVD content. Evidently there are many more fans of Queensryche than just myself! I highly recommend this DVD album!
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Pretty much everything has already been said about this fantastic movie, which raised the comic book adaptation bar well beyond X-Men, or even Spiderman, has been said; so there is little to add.    I noticed a lot of people complain about the fight scenes. They are quick, confusing and chaotic. This is EXACTLY like it is having a bunch of bats swarm by.    That is the intent of the fight scenes and it is very accurate.    Other then that the major complaint is that this is not a brain dead movie. There are plenty of movies to keep the mouth breathing, knuckle-dragging Budweiser crowd happy. Not every movie needs to be mindless. Go watch Die Hard or  something.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This is a brilliant soundtrack to a brilliant movie.  The original versions are of course greater but this is a worthy try.   Bono usually makes my head tired but even he was a pleasant surprise.

This book is a great follow up to the Kite Runner. Being a huge Kite Runner fan, I was worried that I would be constantly comparing and unable to remove myself from that story. But that could not be further from the truth. The women in this book are FANTASTIC. So strong and at times they will make you want to jump up and cheer.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Generally, I hate other versions of the Beatles' masterpieces.  I still prefer all of the originals but this movie was done so well and tastefully that I found myself enchanted not only by the exquisite music but the story as well.  I loved it.  I have also purchased the Deluxe Edition soundtrack and have created a playlist for my portable player featuring the \\"Across the Universe\\" version of each song followed by the Beatles original.  I even liked Bono who I usually find to be taxing at best to be a pleasant surprise.
0143038419|3.0|Eat, Pray, Love is one of those books that I need to read twice. Once to actually read and follow the story and again to go through and highlight all of the insight that Gilbert brings the reader. I almost feel as though the book could have just been about her interesting travels in just Italy and Indonesia (India) seemed a little long winded and repetitive for me, but it's just my opinion. This book is charming and interesting, TONS of information about other countries, and it will leave you wanting to start booking trips to far away lands.
0452273331|4.0|I had been curious about this book in particular and Ms. Rand's philosophy in general.  Every character in this book is reprehensible.  Not one major character has the slightest in redeeming values or value.  No major character is noble in any sense of the word.  The book is interesting and worth the time but if you are looking here for answers keep looking.  PS  The stilted 30's dialogue is laughable and ludicrous unless you keep in mind the context.
B000WCDI64|5.0|This live concert has the best songs from both of her albumns.  The jazzy, soulful mix in her voice never disappoints.  The band is incredible - tight base lines, and the horn and saxophone section support Amy's unique style and voice at every turn. I saw the concert first on MSN and began to search for a DVD right away.  This DVD is a must for anyone that loves music.
B00005KHEU|3.0|The final ELO album of the seventies found Jeff Lynne and company doing what almost every superstar of the late 70's did...trying like mad to figure out the disco craze. To some extent, \\"Discovery\\" rides the coattails of [[ASIN:B000P6R6VK Saturday Night Fever]] successfully, but it also sounds date-stamped more than any other ELO album. Funny thing was it managed to sell massively and spawned two top ten singles, one of them being the classic rock thumper, \\"Don't Bring Me Down.\\"<br /><br />Even with \\"Discovery\\" being commercially successful, there is no escaping the fact that the album was loaded with filler. The jettisoned string section removed some of the individuality that made ELO a unique sounding band, replaced by synthesizers and drum machines. It turns songs like \\"Last Train to London\\" into songs that scream \\"1979!\\" as soon as they reach their chorus. Both \\"On The Run\\" and \\"Midnight Blue\\" are forgettable.<br /><br />But the first half of the original album was as good as most Electric Light Orchestra got, with the fabulous \\"Shine A Little Love\\" an insta-catchy pop song that few could match. As much as some reviewers slag \\"The Diary of Horace Wimp,\\" it is the one moment where Lynne's attempt to channel the Bee Gees worked for me. As the final song on the album, \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" is still solid, an all mammoth hook that remains inescapable. Your need to own this will depend on how much nostalgia you have for this particular CD, but it is far from classic like [[ASIN:B000F8O4E0 Face the Music]] or [[ASIN:B000LE0TGA Out of the Blue]] are.<br /><br />Quibbles. Two of the bonus tracks are useless. Less than a minute apiece for two demos? Why not a 12-inch mix or a live track or two? The cover art is less than exquisitely reproduced. The \\"Ali Baba\\" inspired cover was rumored to be the most expensive album art ever created at the time...so why the less than perfect reproduction? Also, unlike most of the other ELO reissues, \\"Discovery\\" lacks historical liner notes or comments from Jeff Lynne.Lynne.
0670033375|5.0|The professed intent of this work is the establishment of an algorithm of survival, so to speak, based upon a close look at societies that didn't survive, for the most part. Quite quickly it becomes clear to the reader that cultural/ecological collapse is real but not so readily managed. As the author himself admits, one wonders what was on the mind of the man who chopped down the last tree on Easter Island. And yet this is an intriguing book, well researched, restrained for the most part, taking us to places and times we rarely think about to grasp the reality of how fragile our way of life really is. Along the way is the troubling discovery that yesterday, like today, man is his own worst enemy.<br /><br />Diamond's anthology does make a case that the entire planet is in trouble. But this author is meticulous and respectful: he succeeds in giving the reader a feel for local communities and regions, dissecting aspects of economy, geography, religion and human behaviors where people had real choices and made less inspired ones. One sees that similar processes are at work today in disparate parts of world, from Montana to Australia. I for one will forever feel guilty about broiling orange roughy on the Fridays of Lent.<br /><br />To give the reader some sense of his method, Diamond opens his works with a lengthy essay on the present day State of Montana. Big Sky Country is in trouble, though some folks in the Mountain Time Zone may bristle at his take on a state which has a reputation, at least, for self-sufficiency. The author calmly torpedoes a number of Montana's beliefs and practices, observing that were it a free standing nation, it would fall into Third World status. Diamond outlines a Montanan natural algorithm: its cool, dry, somewhat windy climate on the leeward side of mountains led settlers to seek an economy below the surface, where the state's only true industrial aged wealth resided--in mining. Diamond examines the relentless poisoning of Montana's land and water as a variety of natural toxins, set free in the mining process, began a century of steady leeching.<br /><br />The human expression of the survival algorithm comes into play in Montana quite vividly. For a number of reasons many citizens of the state resist government efforts to organize anything like zoning or greening. Centralization is political poison, a curious state of affairs for a state that gets a 150% return on its federal tax dollar. But Montana is hardly alone in its quirky thinking. Vikings on the verge of starvation in thirteenth century Greenland make considerable donations to the papal Crusade tax. Why people make the decisions they do is the one question Diamond never quite nails down with the precision of his other observations. Perhaps the best overriding definition of our global problems can be defined as \\"contemporary self interest.\\" Just as Santayana warned of the dangers of not looking back, the author raises our awareness of looking toward the future.<br /><br />Although he traces nearly a dozen past and present civilizations, I found the lengthy tale of the Norsemen particularly compelling. The Vikings, having settled modern Scandinavia, began a near millennium of westward settlement. Iceland, with its climate and vegetation, was just marginal enough for permanent survival. The Viking settlement of Vinland, on the North American continent, ultimately broke down because warlike mannerisms were ultimately quashed by indigenous Indians. Greenland, however, was a slow and painful death of nearly five hundred years, where climate, technology, topography and hardheadedness eventually doomed a lengthy effort to colonize the great island. Diamond observed that the true tragedy of Greenland was the Norsemen's failure to learn from a surviving neighbor, the Inuit, who had mastered the boating, weaponry, and dietary limitations of the territory.<br /><br />This is not \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" tree hugging polemic. Rather than trumpet one big problem, the author dissects many overlooked smaller ones of the past, and sets them alongside similar potential strategies of the present day, in some cases species by species. In recent years I have developed a taste for Orange Roughy, a fish mass marketed in US shopping clubs. Diamond observes that most of the world's roughy is a product of the waters off Australia and New Zealand. Recent studies have found that this species does not begin to reproduce until the age of 40, and that most captured roughy is nearly a century old. At these numbers its reproduction will reduce exponentially [406]. Thus I am a kinsman of the last logger on Easter Island, grilling the last roughy on the patio.<br /><br />Roughy may seem like small potatoes, pardon the dietary allusion, but it is a good paradigm for more vital matters of fresh water, soil, food production, toxic waste, energy, and population. [Curiously, \\"global warming\\" is not a dominating theme of current day life problems, a sobering fact in itself.] Diamond discusses several international industry practices, particularly in matters of logging rain forests and drilling for oil. He devotes a chapter to \\"first world yuppies\\" who would dismiss his concerns as alarmist, again with a disarming humor--nobody has ever criticized a town for maintaining a fire house, he observes, if the town has but a few fires a year. [510]<br /><br />I do not know if Diamond is conversant with the writings of St. Augustine, the notably pessimistic Christian philosopher of the fifth century. At the risk of extremely generous paraphrasing, Augustine contended then that mankind is, religion notwithstanding, inherently flawed and selfish. Diamond does not say this directly, but his body of work does not make a liar of Augustine. Diamond's concern is not just that men are selfish and narrow sighted, but that there are a lot more men today, with more technology to do more questionable things. Perhaps prayer need be added to the algorithm of survival.looked smaller ones of the past, and sets them alongside similar potential strategies of the present day, in some cases species by species.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|Listening to \\"Thriller\\" some 25 years on is still a stunning experience. Michael Jackson sold so many of these albums before the backlash set in (and [[ASIN:B000002GVS Eagles - Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975]] overtook \\"Thriller\\") that everywhere you went, a Michael Jackson song was likely playing from 1983 through 1984. As an example, the first Top 40 Radio station I worked for (in 1983) had both \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" in its top ten, with \\"The Girl is Mine\\" and \\"Thriller\\" (even before it was a single) in rotation, plus an album cut from a Michael Jackson/Steven Spielberg E.T. related special album. Not to forget every record Michael had a hand in (Rockwell, anyone?). That meant at least one song from Michael was going to come up per half hour, and maybe more. Jackson single handedly rewrote the rules when \\"Thriller\\" became a phenomenon.<br /><br />More examples. Prior to \\"Thriller,\\" the idea of more than two singles from an album was pooh-poohed, it was considered a way to kill album sales. When Jackson dropped four singles from [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]], it was considered to be a fluke occurrence. Seven of the nine songs here charted as top ten hits, two as number ones. Jackson wove multiple-musical threads into his tapestry, which meant that Eddie VanHalen was on board to rock \\"Beat It\\" and Paul McCartney was there to bring on board the Adult Contemporary crowd with a cheesy pop-duet ballad. VanHalen forced \\"Thriller\\" onto rock stations (which went as far as refusing to introduce the artist or say the record was Eddie VanHalen with Michael Jackson), and the funk of \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\" made this a club savvy smash.<br /><br />Oddly, it is \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" that give the first clues into the freak show that Jackson would eventually devolve into...both paranoid and obsessive, these songs both broach Jackson's Us Vs Them psyche to come. As he sings \\"You're a vegetable, they hate you, they eat off you, you're just a buffet, you're a vegetable,\\" one wonders what made this and \\"Billie Jean\\" so venomous. But that throbbing bass and the moonwalk performance (on the DVD!) sealed the deal. Add MTV to the mix and there was no stopping him. The demand was so great that a cottage industry in Michael Jackson imitators started touring to fill the demand.<br /><br />Yet 25 years and some 40 million sold LP/CD/downloads later, what of the music? Quincy Jones was an immaculate producer...this remaster proves just how pristine \\"Thriller's\\" pop was. The staccato strings in \\"Something,\\" the throb of \\"Billie Jean,\\" the smooth soul of \\"Human Nature\\"... there is hardly a bad sounding moment on the album. Granted, the title track is probably the song that has held up the worst and maybe the chipmunk voices on \\"PYT\\" rank second, but this album is a textbook example on just how to engineer and produce great music. One needs merely to listen to the bonus tracks to catch that.<br /><br />After all, why fuzz up \\"The Girl Is Mine?\\" Will.I.Am should left well enough alone. Barking out a new rap instead of McCartney's playfully cloy counterpart just sounds like a forced fit. Fergie adds nothing to \\"Beat It\\" other than bad karaoke. Akon and Kanye West at least make it sound relevant...but when you listen to the smoothness of Quincy Jones' work on \\"Billie Jean\\" as juxtaposed to the ragged sound of Kanye...well, you realize that West still has a long way to go. The lone original new track, \\"For All Time,\\" sounds like it should have been there to start with (and in the CD era, probably would have).<br /><br />Having lost \\"Thriller\\" from my collection a long time back, I decided to go back for the new version. It was totally worth it.

0618918248|5.0|While I believe that this book is excellent, it doesn't extend as far as I would like to the behavior of some current religious people.   I preferred [ASIN:0446579807 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]which extends Dawkins theories and even enables one to predict that Tony Blair would become a Catholic.   Atheists have to accept responsibility for their own actions.   Religious people can either blame God or seek forgiveness from God,which from a former Christian perspective is strange, as Christ exhorts a taxgatherer to return  to those he has wronged, four times the amount wrongly taken. He does not suggest confession or a donation to the Church.  By becoming a Catholic Tony Blair, in his own mind, has been able to gain   absolution for the undoubted large amount of evil he has done.  It is only in the insane world of religion that he can find any escape from the realities of his past behavior.  Needless to say those who should read this book won't anyhow.

B0011NVCO8|4.0|This review will not discuss the merits of the actual movie (as I assume you've already seen).  This review is to critique Universal Studios' decision to encode the DVD version of the movie with the unrated version, yet only include the theatrical version on the HD side!      Now my question to Universal is: Exactly how much money was saved by NOT including the extra 30 some odd minutes of the unrated version of the movie on the HD side of the combo disc?  Or maybe there was no hi def version of the uncut movie to begin with?  To be fair, it is understandable that Universal does need to make this DVD attractive to owners of Standard Def (SD).  But could this be just the nail in the proverbial coffin of the format so many of us love.      I wish that I had known about the uncut version being only in SD.  But I still would have bought it anyways.  So long HD-DVD, say hi to Betamax and the Delorean!
0066620996|5.0|Review of:  \\"Good to Great - Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't\\"<br /><br />By:  Jim Collins<br /><br />The book \\"Good to Great\\" is a report on the results of a lengthy business research study.  Jim Collins and a team of researchers asked the question: \\"Why do some companies make the leap from being good companies to being great companies, and why not others?\\"  Over the course of the book this foundational question is asked several different ways.<br /><br />In chapter eight of \\"Good to Great\\" the author says that the fundamental question a CEO should ask is: \\"What can we do better than any other company in the world, that fits our economic denominator and that we have passion for?\\" (Page 180)<br /><br />In chapter nine of \\"Good to Great\\" the author introspectively asked what motivated him to undertake the huge project in the first place.  His motivation was to understand man's search for meaning, in his own words:  \\"... why greatness ... the search for meaning, or more precisely, the search for meaningful work.\\" (Page 208)<br /><br />Jim Collins' previous book, \\"Built to Last\\" (NS) is a description of sustained greatness in American companies.  After publishing \\"Built to Last\\" the author asked how companies got to be great in the first place.  \\"Good to Great\\" answers that question.<br /><br />Book Summary<br /><br />Jim Collins and a team of twenty researchers studied the difference between companies that are good and companies that become great.  The definition of greatness was made in very practical terms.  A great company yields a sustained high return to the owners.  For this research a high yield was seven times the general stock market over a fifteen-year period.  The study took 10 ½ years of researcher effort and resulted in 2,000 pages of interview transcripts.<br /><br />The change from \\"good to great\\" is guided by, what the author calls, a level five leader.  The common characteristics of level five leaders are:  modesty, humility, willfulness, courage and company orientation.  Level five leaders are unselfish.<br /><br />Executive compensation plans don't matter between good and great companies.  The important thing is that they are reasonable and fair.  Executive compensation has to make sense, but will not move a company from \\"good to great\\".<br /><br />Great companies place more emphasis on character than on skills, education, special knowledge or work experience.  Skills can be taught.<br /><br />Great companies are tough places to work.  Great companies are rigorous, but not ruthless.  Managers and employees are held to high standards.  Standards are ferocious and consistent.  Great companies seldom have cost cutting layoffs, but underperformers are fired.<br /><br />Practical disciplines for being rigorous rather than ruthless:<br />1. When in doubt, don't hire - keep looking.  Place tremendous emphasis on finding the right people.<br />2. When you know you need to make a people change, act instead of delay.  If you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you've made a hiring mistake.  Do not hire a lot of people and keep the best.<br />3. Put your best people on the best opportunities and not the biggest problems.<br /><br />Breakthrough results come about by a series of good decisions, diligently executed and accumulated, one on top of another.  Start with an honest and diligent effort to determine the truth of the current situation.  The right decisions often become self-evident.  You absolutely cannot make good decisions without first confronting the brutal truth.<br /><br />Four principles of creating an atmosphere where the truth is heard:<br />1. Lead with questions, not answers.<br />2. Engage in dialog and debate, not coercion.<br />3. Conduct autopsies without blame.  With the right people it's not necessary to assign blame, but only to search for understanding and learning.<br />4. Build red flag mechanisms.<br /><br />Organize the entire world into simple ideas.  All the \\"goodto great\\" companies had simple strategies.  The simple strategy guided all their actions.<br /><br />The simple strategic concepts come from three ideas:<br />1. Discover what the company can be best in the world at.  Focus on this world-class strength.<br />2. Use insight into what drives your economic engine.  Determine what single thing dominates profit and cash flow.<br />3. Decide what you are deeply passionate about.<br /><br />Just because you have done something for a long time doesn't mean you can be best in the world.<br /><br />A culture of discipline<br />1. Build a culture of freedom and responsibility within a framework.<br />2. Fill the culture with self disciplined people willing to go to extreme lengths to fulfill their responsibility.<br />3. Don't confuse discipline with being a tyrannical disciplinarian.<br />4. Exercise focus.<br /><br />Freedom and responsibility together allow management to manage the system and not the people.  People in great companies go to great extremes to fulfill their responsibilities, bordering on fanaticism.  Interview and secondary sources made continual use of words like disciplined, dogged, rigorous, determined, diligent, precise, fastidious, systematic, methodical, workmanlike, demanding, consistent, focused, accountable and responsible.<br /><br />The fact that something is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is irrelevant unless it fits into the corporate focus.<br /><br />On the use of technology, the author quotes Bertrand Russell:  \\"Men would rather die than think, many do.\\"  Technology, when used correctly, is an accelerator of momentum and not a creator of momentum.<br /><br />Personal reaction to \\"Good to Great\\"<br /><br />This entire study is just the sort of thing a statistician is trained and inclined to do.  It was highly dependent on good experimental design, data collection and statistical technique.<br /><br />Most readers want to be level five leaders and will see some of the traits in themselves.  Most readers will realize that they are not yet there.<br /><br />Jim Collins found quite a list of differences between his great companies and typical companies.  In my opinion the most important difference is in leadership.  The one most obvious difference between the two types of companies is the magnanimity of their leaders.  Company executives usually rise within an organization by personal ambition.  A level five leader makes the company great for the enhancement of the company, not for personal gain.<br /><br />This book forces the reader to confront realities.  Some common uncomfortable realities are:<br />- Most hiring policies will not get a company from good to great.  Most hiring is based too much on skill and not enough on character.  The level five leader needs to find people with the passion for the business.<br />- Focus is crucial and every leader knows it.  However, many of us still allow ouryselfs to take on projects for reasons that seem good at the time and bad later.  I call these projects one-off projects.  They always take on far more energy and resources (especially time) than expected at the start.  One-off projects sometimes are good opportunities, but they always take too much time and delay more strategic projects.<br /><br />If a leader wants his/her company to go from good to great, the process will start with him/her.<br /><br />References:<br /><br />  [[ASIN:0066620996 Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't]]<br /><br />  [[ASIN:0060566108 Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies]]as:  1.

B000LXHK2C|5.0|Would people just get over with all the \\"Russel Crowe is a great action/drama actor, but just not in comedy...\\"? When I watch a movie, I'm not thinking about actors' personal lives or their previous takes on films. I'm not thinking about actors at all. I see a character. To me, whether Russel Crowe looks better in drama instead of in Comedy or not is not the case. I see the character and to me that's just the way the CHARACTER is. If the character looks goofy, then he's goofy, fun? then he's fun... who cares? People are different, and too much perfection in movies is not always good. With that being said, I would like to point out that the story line and the movie itself was amazing as well! I strognly recommend it.
B000J103WK|5.0|I have been very disappointed with the HD video side of many movies, sometimes it's hard to tell the diff between HD and a good upscaled DVD.  Not with this HD DVD, the video is is breathtakingly good and the audio a match.  If you love the Eagles, you will enjoy them much more in HD.
B001394S1E|5.0|this is a tight, lean, powerful film with cool characters, an interesting plot, perfect pacing and a great ending. there are no silly distractions here like you would see in a michael bay film... you get a completely developed concept and story with characters that are flesh and blood... not just skeletons walking around saying the same things we have seen in hundreds of movies. wonderfully executed low budget film that hopefully will not get lost in the onslaught of horribly executed big budget nightmares. two thumbs up (wish i had a third thumb.)
B000E1ZK5A|4.0|Not factual, but a great story even so. Lots of suspense and action, my son and I enjoyed this movie immensely.
B00005JPTI|2.0|This is a lightweight Will Smith movie. Not much different than all of the others with the typical posing and mugging for the camera. I could really do without the violence he committed against his own dog. I found this really unnecessary and gratuitous. Charleton Heston did it much better in Omega  Man.
B000LSAJ3O|3.0|I love the TOTO of old, but they are not the band they once were.   Audio and video quality good, but song selection poor, many of their classic songs missing and it was very obvious they now can't hit the notes they once could.  1 star for video quality, 1 star for audio quality, 1 star because I used to love Toto, not sure now though after watching this one!
0143038419|5.0|I earnestly enjoyed reading this book and find Elizabeth Gilbert's spiritual incitement compelling. She accurately reflects the Eastern thinking within us. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to enrich their life!!  I'd also recommend reading A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose by Eckhart Tolle if you haven't yet!

B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|Simple:      This is the best action movie in the last 10 years.  This is a MUST HAVE in any action flick library.  Anyone who loves Julia Stiles MUST have this added to their library.
0452287588|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's new book A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose is defenitly worth reading. I had a hard time putting it down once I began to read it, but after my eyes had enough I knew it was time to stop. Eckhart has opened my once closed eyes to a whole new world. I can't recommend this book highly enough!! I'd also recomend reading Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia by Elizabeth Gilbert if you missed it!

B000ZN8036|5.0|Sean Penn reaches here a peak in his vision of society. He reaches a turning point in his historical approach of life. He depicts what 1968ers and hippies have become thirty years later, today, and what their idealism and ideals may produce today. Christopher, an allusion to a certain Christopher Columbus, decides to abandon everything, to give away his 24,000 dollars of savings, to burn his money and disappear in the vast territory known as the USA. He is looking for real life, for real nature, for real humanity, a life, a nature, a reality that are no longer simulacra of the truth, the truth that existed before man and humanity perverted it. So, along the road, he explores several possibilities that are all fake and he will end in Alaska. Sean Penn accumulates the elements showing there is no escape from society and civilization. No escape for the hippie couple Christopher becomes friendly to and who move freely thanks to their caravan, making an income along the way by selling second hand books they recuperate left and right. No escape from social norms in sex when Christopher refuses the approach and gift from a girl on the only basis that she is 16. Woodstock is really gone and forgotten. No escape in the friendship he develops with a farmer of some type who is finally caught up by the FBI for some illegal activity. No escape in the friendship he develops with an older retired GI who proposes to adopt him to provide him with some kind of a family, to provide himself with some kind of a substitute for his accidentally killed son. But no escape either in Alaska where he is trapped in a way three times, at least. Trapped in a bus that is grounded in the middle of the wilderness. Too easy to survive in this absolutely human environment whose engine is dead and has no fuel. Trapped by his forgetting that to survive in nature you have to know nature's cycle and he did not know the migration cycles of animals and found himself one day foodless, and he did not know the cycles of the rivers and found himself locked up by the water of the river and crossed on foot before. Trapped finally by his lack of knowledge about nature and by his lack of preparation that makes him mix up two wild plants, one edible and one inedible. And he dies slowly poisoned by wild sweet peas. And finally, but too late, he understands that happiness is only real when it is shared. But it is too late and he can only compensate his death with the beauty of the sky his dying eyes capture as he breathes out his very last breath of life. Complete, absolute, irreversible evolution of humanity from barbaric animality to necessarily social and shared civilization. To refuse that historical construct is to refuse to live and to condemn oneself to death, in other words to commit suicide.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinescycles of the rivers and found himself locked up by the water of the river and crossed on foot before.

0790731509|1.0|As a devout Christian, I was deeply disturbed and offended by the images of homosexuality depicted in this film.  Naked men in showers, men in underwear dancing and embracing, sweaty half-naked men shoveling and digging - I had to turn away from the TV multiple times before being drawn back like a magnet to these lusty, repulsive scenes.  And then, to make matters worse, the frightful scene with the young lady washing her car in an overtly sexualized and erotic manner.  I felt as if I needed to be washed after watching that sickening scene!  I had to watch it several times with my wife out of the room to fully understand its sleazy intent. This movie should be banned for its blatant acceptance of sinful lifestyles and celebration of sexual deviancy.
1595141715|5.0|Clay Jenson comes home one day to find a mysterious box full of 7 cassette tapes, each side with a number 1 to 13. After putting one in his dad's old cassette player, he's surprised to hear the voice of Hannah Baker, who had committed suicide just a few weeks prior. The tapes detail her descent into suicide, and Clay spends the rest of the day and majority of the night listening to each tape and going to the places that she describes in them. Each tape talks about 1 of 13 different people, adding up to thirteen reasons why Hannah decided to end her life.    In Jay Asher's spectacular debut, he goes back and forth in the narrative between Clay's thoughts and dialogues with others and Hannah's voice on the tapes. The book in and of itself is a brilliant premise, and Asher follows through with a great storytelling skill. Vivid details, even in Hannah's tapes when she talks about each of the reasons, and a raw realism really catapult this novel to becoming one of the best novels of 2007. I highly recommend everyone pick up a copy. It is a very powerful book.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|A feast for the eyes- sets, costumes the splendour.  Cate Balanchett gives a super performance but..and there is no Gold in the Golden Age.... a banquet of sights which whimpers out at the end...despite some phyrotechics of the sea battle with the Spanish Armada at the end  thrown in to liven things up....alas it fails to deliver satisfaction....there was no real story to tell.....
B000YXMMAE|5.0|For the converted, it goes without saying that Radiohead is one of the best and most important bands of the last two decades, and they continue to take their greatness to another level; hence, their lastest effort, \\"In Rainbows,\\" which is giving \\"OK Computer\\" a serious runs for its money for the title of Best Radiohead record.     \\"In Rainbows\\" isn't one of those albums that is going to blow your doors off on its first, second, or even third listen, although I wouldn't be surprised if it did!  At first, I thought it was good, but never envisioned being addicted to it like I am now.  As time has gone on, I find that there are times when I literally cannot stop listening to it.  It is one of those records that, as soon as it ends, you immediately want to listen to it again.     Trying to pick out favorite songs is not an easy task, as every single song is so good, a great indicator of a truly great record.      I know some have said that this record isn't as ground-breaking as masterpieces like \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A,\\" two records that deserve every bit of praise that they get, but to me, \\"In Rainbows\\" combined the best of everything Radiohead had done before it; it combines the rocking and catchy sensibilities of \\"The Bends\\" with the experimental edges of \\"Kid A\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" with the electronic flourishes of \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Hail to the Thief.\\"  In short, \\"In Rainbows\\" is THE perfect Radiohead record.
0060763280|2.0|Pros: this book is actually quite inspiring. There are quite a few things said in the book that have made me think. For example, if you stay comfortable, that's where you will be, here.    Cons:   1. No joking, if on every other page, you find the author didn't mention his great seminar/tape/book, I'll give you a dollar. IT IS JUST TOO MUCH!!!  2. It is true that action leads to result, but many of you must keep this in mind, 90% of business fail during the first year; 5% fail during the next 2; only probably 1% survive, if that.  3. Getting rich involves a lot of hard work - even for Hally Barrie. If you are not willing to put down your time, energy, your health (very often), you CANNOT become rich by just taking actions.  4. Save the get rich fast speech, please. Network marketing? Really? Are you kidding me?    If the author could balance out the cons, which are easy to fix, I would rate this book at least 4 stars.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I am so excited to get this on DVD. I saw the movie 5 times already and can't wait to own it at home. What a fabulous movie!
B00004RE0E|5.0|I bought this because I am one of those guys who remembers growing up snuggling on the dance floor with my favorite girl.  The range of music on this cd is uncomparable.  Steve Perry at his very best.  Neil Schon couldnt be better and being a drummer I feel that Steve Smith should be considered among the very best drummers of his era.  This cd is an absolute must have whether you grew up with journey or not.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Being a fan of Alicia's,\\"As I Am\\" was actually the first album I bought from her. Sorry I never purchased this one ,the time it came out,but finally did.Wow,\\"A Classic\\" indeed. Just great from beg. to end.I rarely give an album 5 stars but had to for this one. Knew the songs,but just one of those things.Now that I do have it,it will always be one of my all-time faves.Karma,You Don't Know My Name,If I Ain't Got You,Diary and Dragon Days highlight this superb effort.If you are one like me,who never purchased an album of hers,but a fan,this would be \\"The One\\" to buy first.\\"Songs In A Minor \\" will soon follow. You will be truly amazed!!!!
1400079594|5.0|P G Wodehouse was very likely the funniest, most inventive and creative humorist in the English language, as agile a wordsmith as Shakespeare and far more prolific.  There are very, very few of his books which are not every bit as funny today as they were when first published.  (You may wish to avoid the very first school stories, but that's about it.)<br /><br />The Code of the Woosters is of a piece with all Bertie/Jeeves novels, that is to say, brilliantly funny.  The plot, which is as complicated and involved as any in British farce, is just about beside the point, as so much of the value in reading Wodehouse is in admiration and enjoyment of the language, the outrageous similes, the references to snippets by everyone from Browning to the Bible to contemporary stage songs, and the ridiculous characters, but even then this one is admirably involved.  Somehow a book involving a would-be dictator (of the Black Shorts), a nauseautingly ugly cow-creamer, a journal of the repellent or objectionable mannerisms of one's companions, friendly aunts and domineering country-house hosts, etc etc et multiple cetera, all combine to jam 222 pages of joy, which cannot but leave you with a huge grin on your face as you close the book.  Like every Jeeves & Wooster novel, it is a must buy.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|Heard the \\"Apologize\\" song several times and liked it a lot. Not enough to make me buy the album,then heard \\"Stop & Stare\\".Another real good song on a well-crafted \\"pop\\" album. As someoned did mention,One Republic sounds a bit like Coldplay. Very good company indeed.Anyway getting back to One Republic.Other standouts on this album are,\\"Say (All I Need)\\",\\"All Fall Down\\",\\"All We Are\\" and \\"Someone To Save You\\".The latter probably being my early fave on the album.If you like real good \\"pop\\" and were looking for another good song ,other than \\"Apologize\\",check this one out.Not a one-hit wonder as I read somewhere here.A band I feel will grow.But in the meantime,pick this one up and enjoy the dream.
9562911640|2.0|The publisher took the text of Charles Haanel and squashed as much of it as possible on each page.  The margins are small, and the text is squished upon each other making it very hard to read.  This layout and publishing is cheap.  This is unfortunate because the material is phenomenal.<br /><br />I recommend the material.<br /><br />I DON'T recommend this book from this publisher.
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book, but the ending was just unperdictable & suddon. Nothing really to it although it was a shock to read the ending I wish Jodi had writen more about it. Gone alittle more into depth of the feelings from everyone as she did through the whole book on the lawsuit.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album only shows how this guy can be inspired by anything. Written while seperated form his longtime girlfriend (they got back together and married later by the way), Beck was able to put the situation to very good use. The songs scream out for attention and flow together in a way that anyone can appreciate. If you are used to Loser, Where It's At and E-Pro, you may be surprised that Beck is not always the \\"happy go lucky\\" kinda guy you imagined. This album shows that he does have his dark momments which happens to be one of the great momments in Beck's history.
B000002MY3|5.0|The best way to describe this album is that it's beautiful in every possible way. The level of honesty can't be ignored. When Alanis has something to say she says it in a way that most people can relate to.The musical arangement, lyrical content and the way the songs fall together has all the makings for a timeless masterpiece. This is one of the few albums in my collection that I would replace in a day if something happened to it. A \\"can't live without\\" album for the ages!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|A bonnet movie for your children.  And adults love it too.  Very moving.  Michael Caine is brilliant.  Rizzo is great.  Gonzo make a wonderful narrator.  BEST Christmas Carol out there.  All ages love it.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|If you absolutely LOVE the way Tarentino uses dialogue to flesh out his films you will LOVE Death Proof. 80% of this movie is talking. And mindless drivel at that. When these groups of women babble on about nothing for what seems like 30 minutes it gets old quickly. Russell is great as Stuntman Mike. And the action sequences are excellent. The problem is getting to the action takes wading through untold minutes of crap.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I loved this CD and DVD combo. The DVD I play over and over. Michael Buble is such a talented performer. It lifts my spirit evertime I watch the DVD or listen to the CD. I have all of Michael's CD's and DVD's. I would recommend Caught in the Act to anyone.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This concert is a MUST HAVE for any Bee Gee's fan! I actually bought this for my 10 year old son, who loves the Bee Gees about as much as I do. After all these years, they still sound and look amazing! Please, please buy this concert if you are a fan! You will NOT be disappointed!!!
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Julie Taymor has done an exemplary job of capturing the sixties/seventies in imagery and song.  It took me back to the era and reminded me of what I loved and hated during the turbulent sixties.  Visually, it was stunning.  The story embraced the lyrical brilliance of Beatles' music.  Older generations will love it, younger generations will not get it unless they accompany their parents.
B000065V3H|5.0|Who doesn't love a movie about a nerdy boy/girl being transformed into something wonderful? Who doesn't want to give them their turn to shine??? That is what this movie is all about!    Nerdy boy falls in love with popular girl. Boy sees a way to get popular girl to date him, it goes good, it falls apart, it all comes back together...CLASSIC!!!! This movie is awesome in every sense of the word. It shows us the feelings of both the cool and uncool. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves the good ol' 80's!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|To help readers that like to classify others, I'll confess to having a soft spot for Michael Moore movies. Sicko is no exception. Being brought up in a country with publicly funded health care, as well as living in a further two, I can only hail its merits. The HMO system launched during Tricky Dicky's presidency has become a millstone around USA's neck. It is the most expensive health system in the world, yet it competes with third world countries for success rates. The general public was mislead by the government. See also Escaping Plato's Cave by Mort Rosenblum and Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky.
B00102FELM|5.0|I haven't gotten my concert video of this great Scorpions concert yet...I WAS AT THE SHOW!!  Wacken, Germany 2006!!  The Open-Air Concert weekend was awesome.  The Scorpions 'family' event was the Thursday night of a three-night event.  Dead center, 30 body-widths from the barricade or so...I enjoyed the entire show.  The weather held and the Scorp's took the stage.  I've not yet seen the DVD of this concert though, so I'm counting on sound tech's and camera work to make it come to life.    I'd seen The Scorpions in the USA in the early years...on the \\"Bad Boys Running Wild\\"-Tour with Iron Maiden as the opening act.  In Germany playing to their homeland the show is incredible.  Of note however, the band is getting older, Klaus has a few pitchy moments...the stage presence no longer harkens to crazy-rockers...although Rudolf and the boys do perform their trademark flying-guitars, pyramid, etc...    The Wacken Open-Air Event is a hard metal, annual 3-day event.  With a crowd of younger metal fans in attendance, ie. fans who didn't grow up with The Scorpions, in comparison with the rest of the Wacken Event, The Scorpions were considered a pop band.  So, the crowd was responsive, in admiration of the 'old rockers onstage' but reserved for the harder acts to follow.    If the technical aspects of the show don't disappoint you'll enjoy a classic performance!!  I know I clapped, sweated, cheered, and sang along to all the songs I grew up with.
B000FWAOVI|5.0|I was delighted to see this book still in print. Totally forgot about it until I saw it at a store recently.. I LOVED it as a kid, and any kid will continue to do so (especially with a well-animated reader)  Grover's begs and pleads for you not to continue will ensure that it gets read to the end.

140120306X|4.0|Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neills continuation of the League saga broadens the scope of the source material, incorporating 20th century pulp novels, comics, children's books and films into its all-encompassing fiction universe. While its impressively crafted expansion on the League mythology makes the book a must for fans, its structure, sandwiching lengthy expository passages, novelty inserts and even a 3D section in between the more conventional graphic novel segments, might scare off more casual readers.
0783231202|5.0|AMISTAD is as relevant today as it was when it first came out in 1997. In at least one respect it is now even more relevant.<br /><br />As most viewers realize early in this film, it was not designed to provide audiences with pleasant entertainment. Rather, it is a kind of didactic drama, serving--like Euripides' ancient Greek play THE TROJAN WOMEN (415 B.C.E.) and the recent George Clooney film SYRIANA (2005)--both as a reminder of a nation's flawed past actions and as a plea to be better  in the future. Insofar as racism and racial violence are still thriving in our country--often encouraged by some politicians and pundits in low places--AMISTAD's main message is still needed, and the film is still an effective means of awakening people to the injustice of granting some citizens a place of special privilege while other citizens are kept subordinate.<br /><br />By a fluke of historical fate, however, this film can draw our attention to things that were not in the forefront of its makers' minds at that time. Viewing AMISTAD in the winter of 2008, I was struck by the repulsive actions of President Martin Van Buren, who hungered so strongly for a second term that he repeatedly tried to deny justice to the wronged men and women of the slave ship--even intervening to have their favorable verdict overturned by the Supreme Court (which at that time seemed to be stacked in his favor by a margin of 7 to 2). Do our presidents ever commit such immoral acts nowadays? Does anyone of any party doubt it? And do the members of our Supreme Court ever make their decisions on the basis of \\"party loyalty\\" despite what our laws and our Constitution may say to the contrary? Are we ever in danger of having a majority of such false justices making vital, life-altering decisions? Has such a thing happened within living memory? Does anyone of any party doubt this? Does anyone believe that President Van Buren was the very last president to try to manipulate matters as far as laws and the separation of our government's branches are concerned? If any of us disagree on the answers to these questions, it is only about the names of the guilty parties and/or the relative degrees of their guilt.<br /><br />And yet, within this film we are shown that, on the issue of human rights and \\"the belief that all men are created equal,\\" 8 of the 9 justices of the Supreme Court in Van Buren's day had the intelligence and integrity to vote to uphold what our Founding Fathers had promised our citizens and had stated about human beings everywhere. And while I found many other parts of this film deeply moving--the parts which had been scripted, directed, and acted to press my emotional buttons on the issues of slavery and the rights of all human beings--in my recent viewing of this film I was also very deeply moved by the sight of our nation's much criticized Supreme Court doing the right thing. In line with the other messages of the film, this suggests that our citizens have a right to expect AND a duty to demand no less from our present Supreme Court as well as from all future Supreme Courts.<br /><br />The British politician Edmund Burke is supposed to have said, \\"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men [and good women] to do nothing.\\" Although no one has ever been able to verify where or when he may have said this--or whether some other person said it who has been wrongly forgotten--it is still a valid maxim, one well worth remembering whenever we are tempted to let someone else do our thinking or fighting for us.<br /><br />And now, coming down off my soapbox, here is one tiny piece of art trivia: the biblical illustrations shown in AMISTAD were done by a French artist named Gustav Dor&eacute;. And although the main action of the film takes place between 1839 and 1841, Dor&eacute; was not born until 1832, and his biblical illustrations were not published until 1865 in French Bibles--and were published three or four years later in English Bibles. Doesthis destroy any of the fabric of the film? No, of course not. Does it make me think any the less of this film? Certainly not. Its central message remains intact--and its new and unintended message about our presidents and our courts needing constant vigilance to keep them working properly is not affected in the least.course not. Does it make me think any the less of this film? Certainly not. Its central message remains intact--and its new and unintended message about our presidents and our courts needing constant vigilance to keep them working properly is not affected in the least.

0743487486|5.0|I was skeptical before reading this book.  No time outs?  No punishments, no rewards?  There's a problem with praise?  I was even skeptical for the first few chapters.  But by the end, I was won over by the sheer amount of research backing up Kohl's parenting philosophy.<br /><br />I told my husband when I finished it that I was going to try it.  We were done with time outs, punishments and praise.  My husband raised his eyebrows but went along.  While I can't say that we've done this perfectly, the change this wrought in the behavior of our oldest (4 yrs old) was amazing. So much so that my husband said about two weeks later that whatever it was that I was doing differently, I should keep doing it.  Her preschool teacher remarked that my daughter just seemed to \\"really change, really grow\\" all of a sudden.  Truly, it was remarkable.<br /><br />It should be noted that this is not a \\"how-to\\" book. There are not a lot of practical examples of how to parent as Kohl suggests.  For this, I would suggest reading \\"How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk\\" by Faber and Mazlish (as well as their other books).<br /><br />Even if you end up not agreeing with this book, I would suggest reading it since it will challenge you to think critically about what kind of children you want to raise and how they way you parent affects them.<br /><br />ETA:  It's now been two years since I first read this book and I would still consider this the most important, even if not most helpful, parenting book I have read.  It not only transformed my parenting but it gave me tools for sorting through the mounds of often contradictory advice out there.  Reading this put me on a quest to build a better, more effective parenting toolbox, and I am so grateful for having learned better ways of responding to conflicts with my children (and for seriously reducing said conflicts as well!).  For books helpful in this manner, I would also recommend reading Larry Cohen's \\"Playful Parenting\\" and Mary Sheedy Kurchinka's \\"Kids, Parents and Power Struggles.\\"\\" and Mary Sheedy Kurchinka's \\"Kids, Parents and Power Struggles.\\"

B000GIXEIG|1.0|Beowulf and Grendel has to be the worst interpretation of the epic poem ever to be filmed. If the viewer is looking for a pictorial representation of the original, this mess isn't it. It is loaded with gratuitous sex and violence, has characters that don't exist in the poem, has language that doesn't exist in either the original Old English or any translation. The action is made up of wildly improbable and illogical events. Beowulf with a Scottish accent is laughable. Beowulf's original home is at the southern end of Sweden. The correct pronunciation of Geat is Gay-ot. Save your money and your eyesight.

006135323X|4.0|Dan Ariely has entered into some fascinating space here; the land of the quirky human mind.  The book joins the genre of \\"popular\\" economics books that seek to apply economic principles to areas of human life outside of finances.  These books have been fairly uniformly insightful and, dare I say, even fun.  Ariely's book scores on both counts.    What sets Ariely's economic offering apart from others is that it focuses in on \\"behavioral\\" economics.  Most economic analysis assumes that people are well-informed and rational, Ariely makes the point that in plenty of cases, people are neither.  He focuses in specifically on the irrational behaviors we humans are so prone to exhibit.    As Ariely describes various experiments he's conducted, you'll find yourself smiling occasionally at harmless foibles you recognize in yourself or others and shaking your head in wonder at other times about just how strangely we're all wired.  It's truly fascinating to read what Ariely has learned about things like the placebo effect in both prescription drugs and surgery.      One nice bonus about the book, is that you can use the book's insights in your daily life.  Perhaps you just want to learn to make better decisions on your own behalf, or maybe you'd like to use peoples' overweighting of fear to make more money investing.  The insights in the book are truly practical.    One point on which I don't consistently agree with Ariely is what he lables as \\"rational.\\"  For instance, he says it's irrational to literally get more pain relief from a $0.50 aspirin than you do from an otherwise identical $0.10 aspirin.  I agree with that (but how cool, huh?)  On the other hand, Ariely finishes up with an example of how people ordering food in a restaurant let the orders of others in their group alter their order and consequently end up enjoying their food less.  In a country like the US that values individuality, people tend to order different items from the menu.  In a country like Hong Kong that values conformity, people tend to order the same thing.  Either limits peoples' enjoyment of their food.  Ariely argues that's irrational.  I don't think so.  People are just adding a factor other than food enjoyment to their decision; in this case, social status.  Ariely can argue that doesn't make sense, but his diners obviously don't agree.    That's just something to think about as you read this very high quality book.  I recommend it highly for anyone who is fascinated by the way people make decisions.  As a bonus, it can't help but make you a better decision maker.  Not a bad side benefit.
B0002IQEHI|3.0|The movie itself is excellent, and the way in which the DVD was made as for menu was fine, BUT, there appeared to be a problem with the manufacture of the DVD disc itself.  I purchased the movie and watched it, but right at the middle of the film (during the auction house scene) the DVD would become unreadable, with only bits of sound or a refreshed frame here and there.  The unreadable nature continued for all chapters to the end of the movie (thus, the second layer was unreadable, as the first played perfectly).  I returned the disc for replacement, and the second DVD had the exact same flaw at the exact same time.  Thus, a manufacturing defect.  Problem reproduced on 2 DVD players, and in a new computer as well.    Good movie, good menus, bad discs.

B00102F5WK|3.0|The special features documentary is worth watching and would get 4.5 stars from me. This was the best part of the film because it gave credulity to the movie.<br /><br />An Egyptian American chemical engineer returns from Africa after getting a hangup on his cell from a known terrorist. This is flimsy premise for the story whereas the chemical engineering angle was more plausible but not developed fully as a realistic connection. As soon as he arrives in the States, he is returned to Africa where he is tortured, so a man, who cannot find his daughter who's dating a martyr-to-be, can locate the terrorist who supposedly called the Egyptian American. The sub-plot of young girl dating the terrorist is good but when it's finally brought together at the end, which is also the beginning of the movie, it just adds more questions instead of tying all the pieces together. Overall the story idea is a good one but the story telling was often confusing because of flashbacks and not smoothly transitioning to various POVs in disparate locales.

What I love about this album is that it is Clapton in his pure state.  Guitar, Amp and occasionally a Wah-Wah pedal.  It's a good mix of his blues and country tunes.  For me, it is a must have, one I would take to the moon with me.  The version of Double Trouble is phenomenal, and one of the best representations of Eric's blues virtuosity.

B0010ZR160|5.0|This isn't an easy film to watch but it is one of the year's stunners and I am shocked that it didn't get more attention when it came to the Oscar nominations. While I loved it for many reasons, not the least of which was a breakout performance by Casey Affleck, I'd have to say one of the most powerful aspects of this movie may be exactly the thing that turns so many viewers off- it takes a long, hard look at the moral complexities of life and the difficulty in doing the \\"right\\" thing and making the best choice, especially when it comes to children and their rights.<br /><br />Some people think that Casey Affleck, playing a young private investigator, comes across as rigidly moral and ethical, especially towards the end of the film. I think differently. All though the film, you can see him struggling with his anger, which threatens to overwhelm him (and does, at points) and his conscience as well as his religious values. More than once, he brings up what his priest would say about certain situations. Some things don't \\"rest easy\\" with him. And yet he has trouble figuring out why and how best to address his ambivalence. He can't seem to fathom the deepest ramifications of his decisions, to see clearly the potential for harm even when one is trying to do good.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the kidnapping of a child, her drug-addicted and inattentive mother and some private investigators who work with the police to try and find the child.<br /><br />Affleck's on-screen partner and lover, played by Angela Monaghan, almost steals the show and I think she was an important counterpart to Affleck's role, even though he is clearly meant to be the lead actor.<br /><br />Where he is often rigid in his opinions, she relates to people on a gut level and senses what is truly right and what could lead to more serious consequences. I found her compassion, heart and way of relating to people to be very compelling and moving.<br /><br />There is a key part of the movie where she doesn't hesitate to risk her life, leaving the men around her stunned at her nerve - and leaving me awed as well.<br /><br />The message I got? When one's beliefs are truly integrated with one's heart, then there is no hesitation during even life-threatening moments. Monaghan was willing to put her life on the line to try and save a child. At the end of the film, I believe she still felt that way and had come to a very different conclusion about how to do that than her partner. Watch it and see what you think - and why the lead characters made the choices they did.<br /><br />There are some parts of the film that may confuse and baffle viewers so I'll warn you right now about those:<br /><br />1. THe language and plot. Graphic, often bloody, full of every curse word you could imagine. Not one for the kids to watch. The dirty and seamier side of life is shown, in all its ugliness. People in this one are hard and some are permanently ungrounded.<br /><br />2. The mumbling and often inarticulate accents of the characters. This was not a distraction for me but it was for some of our friends. Those with even minor hearing issues may have a problem.<br /><br />3. The confusing plot line. It was NOT confusing for me to follow but I did watch the film three times. I'd also read the book. There are a lot of twists and turns in this film. Viewers have to stay alert and need to care about hanging in there. The film can drag in some parts.<br /><br />Even with all the potential pitfalls for viewers, I highly recommend Gone, Baby, Gone. It pushes viewers to think about what they'd do in a difficult situation. It raises questions and inspires debate. Finally, it reveals what brings couples together and the types of issues that can separate them irrevocably, based on one decision.

B000001ESP|4.0|\\"Moving Pictures\\" would prove to be the band's commercial peak.  Like \\"Permanent Waves\\" before it, the album would feature shorter songs with only one clocking in at over 10 minutes.  The album produced two huge hits in \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\" both songs still staples of classic rock radio.  The instrumental \\"YYZ\\" remains a fan favorite to this day as well.  Most Rush fans consider this one to be the band's all time classic.  I like it a lot, but there are other Rush discs that I like better.  The first 6 tracks are the strong point with the hits \\"Red Barchetta and \\"The Camera Eye\\" all being great tunes.  The last two tracks \\"Which Hunt\\" and \\"Vital Signs\\" kind of end the disc on a slightly lower note although they are both decent as well.  I have never thought \\"Moving Pictures\\" was as good as a lot of Rush fans seem to rate it, but it remains a good disc and took Rush to the peak of their commercial success.

B000001ESN|4.0|For almost a decade Rush had been a cult favorite among progressive rock and metal fans.  They had risen to a point where their albums were gold sellers and they could sell out mid to large size venues throughout the US.  \\"Permanent Waves\\" would turn out to be a very transitional album for the band.  Rush moved somewhat away from progressive rock featuring an album of shorter songs (although there are still two clocking in at over 7 minutes) and a generally more straight forward approach.  Geddy Lee also changed his vocal style, doing away with the shrieking that he was known for and generally adapting a more user friendly tone in his voice.  The result of all this was a huge commercial breakthrough for the band.  The album had two songs that actually became hits on the radio \\"The Spirit Of Radio\\" and \\"Freewill\\".  The album went platinum and the band were catapulted to superstardom, a place where they remain to this day.  I remember when this first came out I was disappointed in it.  I loved the progressive rock Rush and they seemed to be moving in a more commercial direction with this release.  The years have been kind to it however and all of these tracks have aged pretty well.  My two favorites have always been the two most prog oriented tracks the slowly building bombast of \\"Jacobs Ladder\\" and the album closer \\"Natural Science\\".  The two big hits still get played to death on classic rock radio, but they remain good songs.  The other two songs \\"Entre Nous\\" and \\"Different Strings\\" are both decent enough.  Overall this is a good, but not great Rush album for me.
B00004RF8J|3.0|Purchased this item directly from Amazon. The movie plays good when you play from beginning to end.  However, if you try to select certain scenes from the main menu no volume plays on the scene. It's kind of messed up if you have to stop the movie at a certain part then come back later to watch it, you can't just go to the part you stopped watching from you have to go all the way back to the beginning. Wasn't worth the hastle of sending back and getting a refund so I just kept it.
0451197968|5.0|Set after 2020, I think what makes this story scary is the public's obsession with reality television...and the more gruesome and self destroying the better. In the book the participant is manipulated by the media, making him appear how they want him to appear...even that is scarily realistic!<br />King had amazing foresight to see how mercenary society could become. Okay...so we're not quite so sadistic to watch a game show that hunts people down and kills them but it's not THAT far fetched to imagine a world that would.<br /><br />Great to read a book with a likable character who we can root for and an ending that fits the story.

B00006DEFA|5.0|So what can really be said about a film in a review that arrives 24 years after the film's first release?<br /><br />First, I cannot believe that it's already been that long. I saw this film in a theatre in England as a boy and it was one of the highlights of my movie going youth. And yes, I'm that old ... or young. Take your pick, dear reader.<br /><br />So, what did become of Tom Hulce? He was absolutely shocking in this movie as a portrayal of one of the greatest composers / humans ever to live. Well, for the record Tom Hulce, kind of decided that it must be cool to put on some weight, because that's exactly what he went and did. He also became a producer doing projects of his own liking. He was also recently in [[ASIN:B000LXH0AE Stranger Than Fiction]], but if you don't look fast you just might miss him.<br /><br />Regarding the film ... a lot of viewers often come away with the belief that this is an intensely accurate story about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which in fact it is a story about Mozart, but it is not all that accurate. This is a movie that was based upon a stage play called \\"Mozart and Salieri\\". What it does capture though, is period set design, wardrobe and atmosphere and it does it so well that any story told within this shell could be utterly believable and engrossing.<br /><br />However, all these things aside, this is an incredibly strong film to say the least and one of my all time favourites. [[ASIN:B000000XBT The music]] is beautifully woven throughout this to carry you back to the life of a would-be madman and reckless drunkard. It's a blessing that he did not wallow in obscurity and is still esteemed as highly as he is today, for WAM, so deserves it.<br /><br />If you are the type of person that prefers accurate portrayals in their bio-pic features, then you should probably see [[ASIN:B00000K3TN Immortal Beloved]], as it is about as true of an account of that Composers life as you're going to see and is wonderfully captured by Gary Oldman.

B000096FUD|4.0|Yes, Lost in La Mancha is the documentary that you've heard about and seen snippets of on TLC and IFC late at night. It's the film that chronicles the misadventure of Terry Gilliam and his crew trying to reclaim ground over one of the most seemingly cursed film projects in cinema history.<br /><br />Lost in La Mancha was supposed to be the big budget film that was going to showcase Johnny Depp, who, during the documentary says that he supports his friend, but very wisely keeps the whole production at arms length. This was probably the vehicle Depp wanted to launch himself into blockbuster-dom, but would have to wait for [[ASIN:B00005JM5E Pirates]] a few years later. But, no worries, I'm sure Johnny will manage just fine without Terry Gilliam.<br /><br />What the viewer does learn from all of this is that terry Gilliam isn't the flamboyant hack that everyone in the movie business tries to make him out to be, but a serious and dedicated filmmaker who has an incredible and very intense vision of the world in which he tries to bring to life through a community process called filmmaking. It does seems a bit strange regarding Gilliam's string of really bad luck that follows him from pillar to post, especially with the recent death of heart-throb [[ASIN:B000ALM4C6 Heath Ledger]].<br /><br />While the documentary isn't that long at all and will end just as you're heavily intertwined within the story, you're left searching the DVD for extras and more information, which is probably how it should be.
B000GALEVI|3.0|Metallica is boldly and appropriately named as it's virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the Heavy Metal genre without any mention being made about the vast impact that this band has made over the 80s and up to the mid 90s.  They lifted up the genre from mindless, juvenile topics of wild sex, drugs and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth.  What U2 did for pop/rock, Metallica did for Metal in blending intelligent topics with very, very good musicianship and hence making the genre more accessible to a much wider audience than ever before.  In doing so, they extended the life of Metal and ensured an audience at a time when people were more interested in synth-pop ala Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones etc.  Metal owes a great debt to this band for ensuring the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it is to this day.<br /><br />This version of the 1984 album comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very, very well executed and is one of the best that I've ever seen.  The gatefold sleeve is made from very good quality thick cardboard and assembled so well that you don't fear it coming apart easily once the glue starts to get old.  Also included is a 12 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  For the English ones you'll need a good magnifying glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicates the original lp design.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sound quality is the same as it was in the original release and hence has not been remastered.  Although good by 1980s standards, the quality is not as good as what we have become used to with all the releases that have been well remastered these days.  For this reason, although the content is very good, I cannot give this version 5 stars as it's hard to justify the value proposition here as you are effectively paying for the mlps design only if you already have the album.  I suppose if you don't already have this or if you are a big fan of well-designed and executed mlps sleeves then you may be tempted to cough up the mulah for this.  If the sound had been remastered and hence improved over the original cd, I would have no hesitation to give this the full 5 stars and to recommend that you part with your hard-earned dough for this.  With \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"Fade To Black\\" you are getting two of Metallica's best ever tracks here and again contentwise you can't fault this album but you'll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album is worthy of the upgrade.ppose if you don't already have this or if you are a big fan of well-designed and executed mlps sleeves then you may be tempted to cough up the mulah for this.

B000VWE5OY|4.0|The first season of Torchwood shows tremendous promise, and that's partly where my 4**** rating comes from. The show itself has some deep flaws, most notably the change in character for Captain Jack from his appearances on Doctor Who, where he has a much more charming personality. Here he tends all too often to bark his lines and yell a lot. It seems that later in the season Barrowman finds his way again and gets Jack back on track. Of the supporting characters, there are problems as well, including too much rebellion and conflict among the team - they are, after all, people we're supposed to like and want to invite into our homes on TV or DVD, but all too often they aren't.  All of that said, some of these stories are fantastic, and I'm excited to see what they come up with for their second season! I'd recommend sci-fi fans give the show a try.
B000GALEVS|5.0|Metallica is boldly and appropriately named as it's virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the Heavy Metal genre without any mention being made about the vast impact that this band has made over the 80s and up to the mid 90s. They lifted up the genre from mindless, juvenile topics of wild sex, drugs and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth. What U2 did for pop/rock, Metallica did for Metal in blending intelligent topics with very, very good musicianship and hence making the genre more accessible to a much wider audience than ever before. In doing so, they extended the life of Metal and ensured an audience at a time when people were more interested in synth-pop ala Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones etc. Metal owes a great debt to this band for ensuring the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it is to this day.<br /><br />This version of the 1986 album comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very, very well executed and is one of the best that I've ever seen. The gatefold sleeve is made from very good quality thick cardboard and assembled so well that you don't fear it coming apart easily once the glue starts to get old. Also included is a 12 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese. For the English ones you'll need a good magnifying glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicates the original lp design.<br /><br />The sound quality has not been remastered but the original production was so well done that you don't really care.  Unlike the \\"Ride the Lightning\\" mlps version, the lack of modern remastering e.g. JVC K2, 24-bit, SHM etc, isn't missed too much as the sound quality is still very good showing that it pays to do a job very well the first time; Edward Deming would be proud.  Content wise there are no weak tracks here and in fact the whole album should be experienced at one sitting which is the definition of a classic album; the whole is stronger than the sum of its parts.  Given the good sound quality, the brilliant mlps design and of course the excellent content you can't fault this album but you'll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album is worthy of the upgrade if you already have this album.  If you don't have it yet, what are you waiting for?  A must have in every metalhead's cd library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!of a classic album; the whole is stronger than the sum of its parts.

0131479415|3.0|This book presents a pseudo-quantitative method for estimation for so-called agile development.  Cohn suggests subjectively estimating relative size of user stories on some arbitrary scale (within one order of magnitude) in a round-table approach called Planning Poker.  Getting input from key stakeholders is a good strategy....not only does it develop buy-in, it sets expectations and clearly defines the scope.  However, caution must be taken when using Planning Poker; these roundrobin techniques are often used as a way of influencing a group to agree on a predetermined conclusion.  In addition the team must guard against \\"Groupthink,\\" where individuals intentionally conform to what they think will be the ultimate conclusion of the group as a whole.  During this Poker process, Cohn suggests estimating relative sizes of user stories on a Fibonacci sequence scale (1, 2, 3, 5, and 8).  The problem with using this--or any numeric scale--is that there is an inherent implication that the effort required to implement each User Story is proportionate to the scale.  (I.e. a user story estimated at 8 Story Points will require 4x the effort of a User Story estimated at 2 Story Points).  In estimation false precision is the enemy of accuracy.  Any computational methods applied to these Story Points (such as the calculation of velocity, essentially a delivery rate, in terms of story points implemented per unit time) is much less valid than the number imply.  Agile development is much more adaptive than waterfall and even more so than iterative.  With its Timeboxed deliveries on the order of weeks (rather than months) and responsive nature with respect to requirements change, I can see how predicting this type of fluid development would certainly qualify as  nontrivial.    With that said, the advantage of relative size, according to Bozoki, is that very early on, estimates of relative sizes are more accurate than estimates of absolute sizes.  Cohn's methods also leverage another fact of life:  the Law of Large Numbers (LLN).  The LLN provides a tendency for errors inherent in a bunch of small estimates (like User Stories) to cancel each other out to a limited extent.    My primary concern with this method is that we have an qualitative method disguised as a quantitative method with out adequate consideration of estimate uncertainty/error propagation.
032147404X|4.0|For a long time from podcasts, articles and books I was collecting tips on how to take better pictures. With this book, there is no need for that. Everything is in this book.  One tip per page, concise, like all Kelby books, this book will give you advise on how to take better landscapes, portraits, etc.  I only wish at the end the book it had a tip-per-line summary that you can carry in your camera case.  For that price, I highly recommend it. If at the same time you buy the volume 2 you get free-shipping from Amazon.

B000E6UWE4|5.0|I purchased Erikson based on reviews I read on Amazon.  When I first picked up \\"Gardens of the Moon,\\" I thought it was terrible.  I could not track with what was going on.  It literally took me three months to get through the first 100 pages.  The only reason I picked it back up is because I didn't have anything else on hand to read.    Steven Erikson is my favorite author.  After I hit a hundred pages I didn't stop reading.  Each book I read in the series absolutely blows me away.  I still think that the first hundred pages of Gardens is brutal, but if you can get through it I believe you will find the next 5000 pages to be outstanding.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Yes there were some great political barbs but who wrote this, a pimply group of 13 year old boys? The \\"gay\\" theme and constant swearing were just too much to stomach. A shame because it really was a great idea, but it was sunk by a very puerile script.
B000NQPZCO|5.0|An FBI undercover agent (Depp) infiltrates the mob by befriending a low-level mobster (Pacino) and finds himself being slowly drawn in to their sleazy world. A tough and unglamorous look at the workings of the mob in 1970's New York with Johnny Depp and Al Pacino excellent in the lead roles. A memorable movie enhanced by a great blue-ray transfer.
1883010039|5.0|This book is the most concise, understandable learn-to-weave book we have found.  The author shares her obviously extensive knowledge of weaving in a way that is clear and not the least bit intimidating.  The quantity and quality of photo illustrations is excellent.  The text and photos make sense together and are extremely helpful.  It is obvious that the author not only knows weaving, but has extensive, successful experience at teaching people to weave.    She starts you weaving from the start, and explains the design elements later, after you understand the physical process of weaving.    If you want to learn the basics of weaving, this is the book to own.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|A great release of a great movie. This set probably should have been available from the very beginning, but better late than never I suppose.<br /><br />The movie itself is a great sci-fi ride that isn't reliant on exploding ships and is more dependent on an actual story with depth. Of course, that's not to say there's no action as there is plenty of that as well. This is the perfect blend of great sci-fi storytelling, genre diversity and action in a single feature film.<br /><br />While the movie is based off the Firefly TV series, the director and writing staff did a great job in making it easily accessible to those who have not seen the series. It's rare that a film so anticipated by its fanbase actually lives up to their expectations; but I would argue Serenity easily surpassed mine.<br /><br />My one gripe is that this version has DTS sound, where as the previous version did not. While DTS is normally a good thing, I must admit I didn't notice too great a difference between the DTS and Dolby Digital tracks. The sound is great regardless, but I was just hoping to be blown away by the difference like when you compare a film like Master and Commanders DTS to its Dolby track.<br /><br />The special features are definitely worth picking up this volume for. The behind the scenes features and interviews are great and do not get boring. The Sci-Fi Inside feature does repeat some elements seen in other special features, but it also provides plenty of material not seen in the other features to make it worth watching.<br /><br />All in all this is a great, if not late, release of a highly underrated film. I know many are probably saying that the sci-fi fanbase rates it very highly, but I believe that it easily deserves praise from the mainstream as well. It's a great movie, based on a great series, that everyone should give a chance whether they're sci-fi buffs or not.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|In any story or film you've got to have at least one character you like or sympathize with and in Torchwood you'll not have even half a one.  Bad writing, bad acting, bad special effects. [...] If it's sexy, sensual, great special effects and better that excellent writing Sci-Fi you want best to buy, Farscape, Lexx, Dr. Who, the X-Files, than this sloppy seconds Sci-Fi wannabe.

0321544080|4.0|I know this book was billed as part coffee table book part instruction book.  While I found it interesting to read and learned a few things most of what this guy does is as a full pro with a lot of time and gear that the average guy, even if he has the money, cannot justify for what is essentially a hobby.  If you want a good read and to see some excellent photos then this is a good book (as I said, I did enjoy reading it immensely), but if you want something more instructional for the hobbyist photographer I recommend Scott Kelby's book Digital Photography Volumes 1 & 2.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Star Wars plots are inconsequential. Only nerds, dorks and geeks know them. It is the characters we remember: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca. George Lucas could have done the world a favor and let Darth Vader die at the end of A New Hope. I was 31 in 1977 and, although I thought the film was okay, I was not swept away like the kids. I thought much of the dialogue was stiff and unemotional. Carrie Fisher has little if any charisma. My favorite is Obi-Wan. He is the one with perseverance, the one who waits years to set things right.

6304479689|4.0|We follow Elvis from city to city. He dons jumpsuits and gains weight. We see his increasing boredom. Elvis disintegrated after his divorce from Priscilla. Lyrics became morbid. Burning Love was the last big hit. His records were good until the end, but there was little recording the last two years. The film got the Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary. It is chaotic but worth it because it is candid Elvis. The quote from his father about guitar players not being worth a damn would not have come out a decade earlier. Elvis' songlist is filled with hits by other artists. His own Lawdy Miss Clawdy sounds as sexy today as it did in the beginning.

B0000524CY|4.0|Scariest movie ever made because its fear stems from the Bible. Max von Sydow is the exorcist. This guy turned up everywhere! He frees a young girl possessed by a demon. I lived my own version. I got in with Jesus freaks after the Army. We spoke in tongues and went to a Pentecostal Church. One night at church, we thought a 15-year-old girl was possessed by a demon. I threw her down and tried to cast it out. I recall Blatty appearing with Johnny Carson. He acted as if the incident were factual. In saner times, we understand that The Exorcist was only a made-up horror movie. I wonder how Linda Blair has managed to live with it.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|While not one of the great movies of all time and endowed with its share of problems, El Cid has always been one of my favorites.  It inspired an interest in Spanish history and the music of Miklos Rozsa.  Both have been rewarding, life-long pursuits.  And this DVD restoration is excellent - clarity, color, sound, commentary, special features, all of it.
078322737X|4.0|A phenomenal movie with spin-offs. California teenagers cruise in a night of self-discovery. Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfuss and Suzanne Somers rose from this movie. Suzanne is the blonde in the white Thunderbird whom Dreyfuss pursues. He is chasing a dream. He finally flies off to college. In Close Encounters, he flies off with aliens. I wish the soundtrack had more rock 'n' roll and less doo-wop.
0553805460|3.0|The initial chapter of this book is what got me interested in buying and reading it.  The prospect of learning how this guy went from a lowly broker apprentice to founding his own firm and having their initial success, was ver enticing.  However, there is absolutely no record on how this happened, it jumps from the brief introduction into the drug/alcohol/party animal that he became.    It took me a while to get back to reading the book after this initial disappointment, but it was worth it.  I had a few hearty laughs amid the tragedy, and the human drama of starting from nothing to having it all, and then see all come crashing down at your own hand, was moving.
B000VAHR00|4.0|Jenny Agutter in her green outfit! It is the 23rd century, and civilization is confined to a domed city. Jenny and Logan escape to find an imperfect world. Washington, D.C. in ruins was an idea not so far fetched in the Vietnam/Watergate era. Peter Ustinov and his cats point to the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. Farrah Fawcett sports her famous hairdo. I like Box in the caves of ice and the color as Jenny and Logan reach outside to see the sun for the first time. This movie is a generational piece about baby boomers turning 30. It takes liberties with William F. Nolan's novel.
B0013FBS20|4.0|I Am Legend can't get a fair shake.  This Will Smith-led production is the third attempt Hollywood has made to adapt the brilliant novel.  None of the adaptions have truly done the novel justice (which is a shame), but this version has come the closest.      Here we have a brilliant beginning; footage of a scientist (played beautifully by Emma Thompson) saying humbly that she's discovered a way to cure cancer.  Fast forward a few years, and New York is utterly devoid of human life, save for Robert Neville (Will Smith).  As the first half of the film progresses, we learn about his meager living, spending the day harvesting and trying to discover a cure, even now, while spending the night huddled in his protected home as creatures prowl.      His only companion, a wonderful dog named Sam, protects Neville as Neville protects him.  They have a friendship based on loneliness and the human need for someone or something to hold onto.  Sam is Neville's only connection to the past and the only way to represent what little humanity is left, either in the world or Neville himself.  This period in the movie is pitch perfect, puncuated by one or two terrifying sequences that instill genuine horror.      Unfortunately, the last half of the film deteriorates into an action movie that completely changes the meaning of the words \\"I Am Legend.\\"  Don't get me wrong, it's mostly done really well.  Constantine director Francis Lawrence has a good handle on the action and delivers some good scenes.  But, it becomes muddled and veers off completely from the novel.  My biggest complaint, though, is the use of CGI.  Instead of using real flesh and blood actors, all of the creatures are created with CG and they look incredibly fake when lined up next to real people.  In the beginning, it's not a problem but as you see more of them (and you will) it's glaringly obvious.  And annoying.    All of this I was expecting going in, though.  Considering that the film was co-written by Akiva Goldsmanwho also wrote I, Robot, I knew this version would stray from the source material just as I, Robot did.  As a movie, it's genuinely thrilling and creates the perfect balance of tension and action through most of its entirety.  And, surprisingly, Will Smith shows that he's a really good actor as he has to not only tackle many conflicting emotions during the two hour run time but he also has to do so without having much of anyone to react to.  Spending a good hour or so without another single actor for Will Smith to work with was a gamble and it paid off.      Your enjoyment of the film is entirely based on what you bring to the table.  If you're coming to this film expecting to see the book come to life you'll be sorely disappointed.  However, if you're looking for a good action movie that actually has a good story and a human aspect, you'll be hard-pressed to find one as thrilling recently.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|I was reprimanded for comparing Peter Benchley's novel to \\"Moby Dick.\\" Jaws may not be the world in microcosm, but it did well at the box office. Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert. Great whites grow up to 20 feet. They are killing machines despite the claims of environmentalists. Australian waters have the most shark attacks. The shark in Jaws takes on a supernatural quality as he menaces the three men in the boat. The sequels weakened the original.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I had this given to me for Christmas. I have seen all the films before and never thought I would own a copy. But it is a classic. With the recent sad news about the death of Roy Scheider it makes it more applealing. The quality of the DVD is far better than we had on VHS.  The John Williams music is still as chilling as ever.

Olivia came from Australia and won the hearts of music fans. \\"You're The One That I Want\\" is the hot number here. The pair dress in black. \\"Tell me about it, stud!\\" Grease appeals to successive generations. Male/female duos perform Summer Nights to karaoke tracks. The film exaggerates. There were no T-Birds or Pink Ladies where I was from. The cast of Grease was long since out of high school, ranging in age from 19 to 35.

006135323X|5.0|Reviewers tend to evaluate a book by how much they agree with its premises or conclusions. But the impact of a book is much higher if it makes you think hard. Predictably Irrational is a book that makes you want to think and re-read it over and over and argue with it and be convinced and change your mind and...    You may agree or disagree with Dan's recommendations after the experiments (though I feel inclined to agree with many); you may concoct alternative explanations for his results (until you read the academic papers backing these results and realize that Dan has already considered and shot them down); you may like or dislike Dan's choice of topics, style of writing, or other nitpicks that reviewers will bring up.    But you WILL THINK! And that is the best thing you can get from a book: food for thought. If you want mental pabulum, move along, this is serious steak to chew on.    Disclaimer: I am one of the fortunate people who got to work with Dan.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|Torchwood's Captain Jack Harkness is more sombre and serious than his character from Dr. Who.  Strangely he is often peripheral in the espisodes that seem to revolve around Gwen and Owen.  I won't mention any spoilers, but his staff are not always behind Jack and demonstrate it.  In fact, Gwen, Tosh, Owen and Ianto, the main characters often are in need of a whack on the head for not doing what they know they should.  Professional in some ways, but emotionally each is a bit of a mess.      The stories range from very good to mediocre.  Actually I liked the two 'Suzie' espisodes best.  The special effects are good and so is the acting. The actors just need stronger more original stories.  I am hoping that the next season brings back Captain Jack Harkness of Dr. Who.

B000026EV6|5.0|I was awed, as everyone was, by Suede's self-titled CD in the early 90's.  It sounded like nothing I had ever heard before.  Dog Man Star follows up on Suede's freshman effort and nothing could prepare you for what awaits!  This CD is soaring, moody, dark and strange all in good measure.  The first track, \\"Introducing the Band,\\" sets the tone for the trippy, drug fueled, songs that follow.  Each song infects following the first listen--and the songs stay with you for a long time.  The highlight track for me is \\"The Asphalt World\\"--listening to this song convinced me that--in 1994--the greatest band in the world was named Suede.  You won't be disappointed.
B0007P0LPC|3.0|Ivy Lin's review is thorough and detailed and since I agree with most of it, I'll just add a few more caveats: 1. Since this was not a live (i.e. stage) performance, I suspect Nureyev's make-up is supposed to give us a message other than the usual stage make-up. What is he telling us about Siegfried? 2. Fonteyn is super-careful throughout. One feels she is just barely making it through. I did see them live many times at the old Met in NYC and she had more abandon then. This must have been taped just before her retirment. 3. Nureyev is technically okay but cold and detached. None of the warmth and ardor of their partnership is apparent here. Nureyev has eliminated all other men (Benno, tutor, companions, divertissement solos, etc.) and has added solos for himself. The self-indulgence hits its zenith at Siegfried's drowning scene - the length of which rivals Mel Gibson's torture scenes. And lo and behold Odette goes off by herself to her eternal rest while Siegfried...? I too prefer the \\"unhappy\\" ending, but this ending seems unnecessarily pessimistic. In other productions, our seeing them united in the afterworld heightens the romance of the ballet and triumph of true love. Buy this DVD only if you are a die-hard Nureyev fan and can't get enough of him or if you have not seen any other instances of their partnership.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|**UPDATED REVIEW**  When I first reviewed this, I listed it as a disappointment. But over time and several viewings, it has become a well favored movie in my collection. It's a sleeper hit for sure. All those things I disliked at first, now it all seems very much part of the charm. I do like this longer cut over the original release cut. But it is worth having both.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I gotta say, I greatly regretted not seeing the double-feature in the theaters. I procrastinated, and before I knew it, it was gone. Oh well. So when I got the DVD of them, I was really looking forward to finally watching two great directors at work. Sadly, though, \\"death Proof\\" came as a disappointment. There was alot to like if you are very much into watching a professionally-made crappy movie. I don't mean that to sound like I know it does. Bad movies can be great. But from someone who has made such brilliant works of pure art such as \\"Kill Bill\\" or \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", what he ended up making here comes across as an overly self-indulgent homage to every single little 'goof' that occurred in low-budget grindhouse movies. Simply put, he way over did it on making the movie look poorly assembled, and the charm wears off fast. And even though I've ALWAYS preferred the longer, extended director's cuts of just about every other movie out there, this one could have been three times better by being half as long.  Buyer beware on this one.  However,[[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], Robert Rodriguez' Grindhouse contibution is totally awesome!
