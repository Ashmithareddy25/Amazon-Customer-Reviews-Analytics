B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam, heroes of a generation, champions of a 70's-oriented guitar sound, harbingers of Neil Young's message that \\"rock and roll will never die,\\" have outdone themselves with Binaural. The album takes the oft-diverse songcraft of all the band members and cooks up a dark, spacey masterpiece in the process. In some songs, the guitars are cranked up to 11---in others, they're barely a whisper. Featuring Soundgarden's Matt Cameron on drums, the band seems to have found a new lease on life after the slow, reflective album that was 1998's Yield. Some songs are still slow, and most are reflective, but Pearl Jam show that they have not forgotten how to rock and rock well.<br />PJ explore Who-like arena-rock bombast (\\"Breakerfall\\"), Pink Floyd-like space-guitar opuses (\\"Nothing As It Seems\\"), and fast punk rock numbers (\\"Gods' Dice\\") with ease. Letting go of a long gone loved one is explored on the quietly powerful \\"Light Years,\\" while \\"Grievance\\" seethes with fury at the World Trade Organization. Guitarist Stone Gossard contributes a pair of dark, haunting numbers---the acoustic-based \\"Of The Girl\\" tells of heroin addiction while \\"Rival\\" is a chilling account of the then-recent tragedy at Columbine High School. \\"Parting Ways\\" may be PJ's best album closer yet, a poignant tale of unaddressable romantic dischord. There's a couple of missteps that keep this from being a perfect album; most notably, Matt Cameron's unbearable musical composition on \\"Evacuation\\" and the odd \\"Sleight of Hand\\". But then you hear something like \\"Insignificance,\\" the album's centerpiece and best track, and listen to it rage and seethe a venemous diatribe against the government for bombing indefensible countries, and it puts a smile on your face and a hope for rock and roll in your heart. Pearl Jam's sixth is a ten.
B000002WYT|5.0|Of all the many dave matthews band albums, this would have to be my favorite.  I find it is just the right blend of all that the dave matthews band is capable of.  With songs like lie in our graves and # 41, the dave matthews band's sophomore attempt far surpases even the most skeptical listener's expectations. Don't take my word for it, buy this album, and be taken in by it's incredible blend of instrumental bliss.
B000002MTR|4.0|Many people slag down RHCP's 1995 album because it interrupts the chemistry between the band's now-classic lineup of Flea, Anthony Keidis, John Frusciante, and Chad Smith, replacing heroin-addled guitarist Frusciante with former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. It's true---this album doesn't hold the same sense of fun and musical kinship that Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik did. However, One Hot Minute is certainly no slouch in the great Chili Peppers legacy. Though gone is the bombastic funk that made the sock-sporting Red Hots infamously raucous and the apple of George Clinton's eye, One Hot Minute takes Dave's hard-rock roots and puts them to good use, crafting a whole album of great, trippy, dark rock songs. There's the gloomy \\"Deep Kick,\\" made distinguishable via its weird spoken-word intro; the moving Kurt Cobain ode \\"Tearjerker\\"; the weird, dark funk-rock ebb and flow of \\"One Big Mob\\"; and the acoustic-based, gorgeous balladry of \\"My Friends\\". \\"Warped\\" and the title track ultimately go nowhere, but \\"Aeroplane\\" is a ridiculously fun romp and Flea's solo piece \\"Pea\\" will have you in stitches.
1878424319|4.0|This book was highly recommended to me by a close friend, and it took me years before I actually felt 'ready' to read it. It is simple and easy to read, and the concepts seem simple, too, but it is not easy to put into practice. The book gave me a whole new perspective on how to look at things, but it is not an instant transformation. It is a book I feel I could read again and again, and reach new layers of understanding each time. The book left me a bit bewildered... what do I think now? how should I behave now? what do I really believe? It is thought-provoking, and potentially life altering, but I am not at the evolutionary stage where I can fully live his ideas. Very good to be exposed to them, however, because they do present options that, if followed, would truly transform your life.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|What can I add to what's already been said about this film? Either you like it or you don't, but I found it to be a huge disappointment. <br />Jim Carrey thrives in Hollywood apparently because some segment of the population finds his brand of humor appealing. On the contrary, I find that what was once mildly funny at best is now old and tiresome, and the Grinch outfit and make-up do little to hide Carrey playing the only character he apparently knows how to play. <br />It might be easy to overlook Carrey's lack of depth as an actor if it weren't for the fact that the screenplay was so uninteresting. What made Seuss' stories so engaging was his unique mastery of the language and his \\"out there\\" creativity in doing so. Virtually all of that is lost here. When you strip Seuss' work of the creativity and imagination, no amount of make-up or Hollywood special effects can close the gap. <br />So what do we have left? A movie that's beautiful to look at, with marvels of technology at every turn -- and not much (if any) substance. In short, a huge disappointment.

B00005JKNC|4.0|Mr. Darabont, the man behind The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile has created another feel good movie.  The Majestic is about a man named Peter, played by Jim Carey, who gets into an accident and gets amnesia.  A man, played by James Whitmore (Brooks from Shawshank), finds Peter on the beach.  He then takes him to town, where Peter is identified as Luke.  Luke is a man who could do no wrong.  The towns rememberance of Luke is that of a God, and Peter/Luke must try to get his memory back, while the town believes he's Luke, Peter is not so sure.<br />Although this story is a little far fetched, basically all of Darabont's movies are, it is a wonderful story that at times becomes a bit predictable.  It doesn't have the &quot;BANG&quot; of an ending like Shawshank, but still contains a story that is definitely worth watching.  <br />The acting is superb, Carey is outstanding, along with a very strong support from everyone is the movie.  The cinemetography is average.  The music is outstanding, it definitely helps the movie and brings out emotion from the characters.  <br />The DVD is very good.  It's on par with the other Darabont movies.  There isn't a lot of add-ons, which is always a dissapointment.<br />Overall...I think this may not be worth a purchase, but definetely worth renting.  I did give the movie four stars...cause I really do love the movie, but its not the kind of movie that I'd pop into the DVD player at random.  Definitely not like Shawshank.  Rent it.  Watch it.  Love it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is an incredible work of art!  Princess Mononoke is both compelling and invigorating.  This is deffinetly one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen.
0385503954|4.0|`Atonement' is an intimate story of an English family and their trials, tribulations, and buried secrets; from the early to mid 1900s, London's military hospitals of World War II, right up to 1999. It's a depiction of the all too common family break up, mistakes made within, tragedies as a result of, and the attempts made to amend the wrongs forced to persist for decades. It's a story of love, the love that's broken within a family; and conversely, the infinite adoration between lovers that thrives without boundary or limitation.<br /><br />The eyes of young Briony Tallis are exposed to situations that her adolescent imagination can decipher only on its own terms, especially when a serious crime is one of those scenarios. The young storyteller is then forced to describe what actually transpired. Unfortunately for her, and those involved, her words change the lives of those close to her forever.<br /><br />Consideration exists about the mistakes that can occur when a court of law is forced to base its decision upon the observations of a child witness. Nevertheless, as these wrongs do happen, life goes on and individuals carry on, mainly because of the love that's so prevalent between them.<br /><br />This was a gripping story from Ian McEwan. His depiction of Turner's eventual situation, incarcerated and in war (without giving too much of the story away), was sorrowful and heartfelt. The persevering and feisty spirit of young Cecilia was both enriching and endearing. Her beauty radiated from the pages.<br /><br />Love conquers all.

B000063US7|5.0|This is their best concert video, which is why I'm glad they chose to release this on dvd first. The picture and sound quality are perfect. It has just a slightly raw sound, but to me, that's what makes this dvd sound so good, like I'm actually there. The performance is incredible. Phil has a lot of energy and some very comedic moments. The rest of the band are also in top form, especially Chester Thompson. I've seen all the live Genesis and Phil Collins live videos and this is Chester's absolute best performance. My only complaint is the price of this dvd...
B00005OAIE|5.0|Forget the shallow insight of the critic's review. John Mayer's debut is both very promising and original. His easy-going guitar sound and jazzy upbeat influences make every track catchy and refreshing. His smooth voice does remind us of Dave Matthews, which you can say is a good thing. As for lyrics, it seems to be a worthy autobiography. And with love songs such as &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; and &quot;City Love&quot;, he seems to really understand  how to treat love equally with both happy pleasure and honest passion. Plus, this album can be a definite crowd pleaser. You'll find yourself singing along, just as others may as well. I'm thinking Mr. Wright probably has something against Rollingstone magazine. I'm guessing Mr. Wright will regret it once this guy has highly matured in future releases. And I'm betting he'll change his name to Mr. Wrong.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Loved it. So pure, so lush, so sensual. Norah's voice is distinct and has a way of penetrating your senses. <BR>Delicious, and I can't wait for more.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth was released 27th of June 1986. This has to be my favorite movie from 1986 along with Big trouble In Little China, Ruthless People etc.  You've probably heard the story a million times but It's about a girl named Sarah who wished her brother Toby away.  Then regrets it and must go through a Labyrinth to save him, where nothing is what it seems.  Then she reaches the castle beyond the Goblin City, where she must fight the Goblin King played by David Bowie. She defeats him and all ends well.  This is my favorite movie of 1986 because it had many lessons to teach without making them obvious.
0780626966|5.0|This is the best of a Nightmare on Elm Street series.  It includes all seven movies with an extras disc and a booklet about all of the movies and even the 3D glass for Freddy's Dead.  This collection starts out with the best on the first Nightmare and the Digital reamstering looks fantastic!  The first nightmare on Elm Street, released on the 16th of November 1984, truly scared me to death.  The Second Nightmare, released on the 1st of November 1985,  was truly the worst one because it wasn't even scary and it really didn't follow the storyline that would come into play in the 3rd one.  The 3rd nightmare On Elm Street, released on the 27th of February 1987, was the best sequel to the original because it involved Nancy Thompson again and followed the story from the first one trying to kill all the elm street children.  The 4th one, released on  the 19th of August 1988, was a little more worse in a sense that it still followed the story but they were trying to make Alice the next Nancy and it just didn't work and besides they killed off Kristen who was the last Elm street kid which should have ended the movie right there.  The 5th and 6th, released in 1989 and 1991, Nightmare's weren't that good because you can tell they were just making it for money and the storyline was becoming old.  The 7th one called \\"New Nightmare\\", released on the 14th of October 1994, was OK but they focused to much on the kid instead of focusing it on Heather who was the original star.  All in all I think this is a marvelous collection for the \\"Nightmare\\" fans but if you only want certain ones then I suggest buy them separately.
B000065V3H|5.0|I love this movie no matter what anyone says.  This movie unlike many other teen flicks of that time actually had a moral to it.  Don't change yourself just to become popular.  The movie was both entertaining and delightful.  Seth green was in it and he was so young! My favorite singer also choreagraphed in this movie Paula Abdul.  I liked the Ronald Miller part because I just graduated from high school and I know how it feels to be left out.  this is a good movie with a good moral to it.  My suggestion is to see the movie once and then decide if you like it or not like it.
B00005R5G9|5.0|Mannequin was a movie I grew up with and i just fell in love with.  i don't even know why but I will always love Mannequin.  Mannequin stars Andrew McCarthy and despite what the other reviewer says I think he's a pretty good actor.  It also stars Estelle Getty from the Golden Girls and Mescach Taylor from Designing Women, they were both hysterical!  Anyways I like this movie no matter what anyone says.

0312263120|2.0|I listened to the unabridged Audible.com version of this book, and finally turned it off in exasperation sometime just before the end. I knew the &quot;answer&quot; probably three chapters before the characters. (What is the &quot;prime&quot; difference between the Uranium isotopes U-235 and U-238? Anyone who's ever been exposed to the Periodic table, which should include NSA crytanalysts and computer programmers, could figure it out in a heartbeat.) Even after they figured out the answer, with the clock ticking down to seconds before the entire NSA databank would be open to the public, they stood around discussing it before taking action. Dialog was something like &quot;3? Do you think it could be 3? Hmmmm. It's a prime number. Yes, 3 dammit, 3! Is anyone listening? It's 3! Could it be 3?&quot; and so on for, seemingly, pages.<br />I agree with the reviewer who suggested the author must have been given a page count he had to fulfill. I will not be buyng another book by this author, unless I hear that it's very much better than this one.
0789723107|5.0|An excellent, non-technical explanation of how to make your Web site more usable. I found myself going Wow! several times in the first few chapters. Some of the information is so logical it seems like basic common sense, yet many major sites fail to follow Krug's simple suggestions.<br />Note that this is not a technical book. It will explain a potential problem, show color Web sites before and after applying his advice, and explain why his approach is better. You can see the results for yourself with his examples. <br />Best of all, he gives a structure for simple web usability that you can apply to any Web site design.  It doesn't give you the actual coding instructions to redesign something, but there are lots of books on the technical aspects of web design.  Personally, I have someone else who can do that. <br />If you have money on the line... say, your job... based on whether people understand and use your Web site, then you absolutely must read this book. It really opened my eyes to the problems (and solutions) of web usability.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This kid is amazing.  Yes he's been inspired by DMB and many others, and perhaps his lyrics aren't quite Pulitzer but his lyrics resound far beyond his young age.   The music certainly does, and our Amazon professional has little to say about the harmonic or rhythmic contributions of this recording.  He's the best thing I've heard in years, and he has lots of time to fine tune his craft.<br />I heard the album from a friend...  This is the very kind of artist we need to embrace to give hope that the next generation won't have to abuse its radio's \\"scan\\" button as have we've been forced.
0553277472|4.0|One might think the title of the book is contradictory or at best misleading for this book is not for technician repairing or riding motorcycle at all. But once closing final page, you should conclude that the title makes sense. The authors question is what is the reason or principle in relation to the life? the law of nature or principles of the world, those are the one the science seeks to find. But those are abstract and empty in its nature. Zen is the method to transcend that abstractness to concreteness of life itself. Principles are abstracted from the rich context of concrete life. But once abstracted, we forget where it comes from. Zen asks us to find principle in the life by ourselves. <BR>The author show the point of Zen in the form of novel. Motorcycle is the product of engineering and science. So its the result of principle-seeking activities. But motorcycle could not be rid with just knowing scientific principles. Moreover, it doesnt need those knowledge at all. Just like riding motorcycle, living through everyday life doesnt need knowing abstract principles. Principles needed in life is concrete one put in practice. Zen is the method to find principle in practice.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie will be the Wizard of Oz of our time.  This is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time.  I saw this movie after reading the book.  What a marvelous adaptation.  I had a huge grin on my face as I sat in the theatre and watched in awe as the characters came to life on screen from the horrible Dursleys to Ron and Hermione.  <br />I was most impressed by the array of talented actors, especially Maggie Smith and Daniel Radcliffe.  He was amazing as Harry.  Alan Rickman was superb as Snape; effectively conveying his dislike of Harry.<br />For the sake of time, there were some scenes that were changed in the movie, such as when Harry Potter meets Malfoy.  In the book they meet on the Hogwart's Express and at the end of the movie, when Hermione solves Snapes potions puzzle (which wasn't in the movie).<br />All in all, it was a faithful adaptation of the book.  That will probably annoy the hell out of all those right-wing Christian lunatics who condem Harry.  If you're sane, and enjoy a good story with great special effects and acting, get this movie.
B00000JGHS|2.0|This movie is not a fully erotic movie as it might be expected.But it is not a clever and funny movie either.So what makes Striptease bad,I guess,is that it doesn't manage to satisfy any taste at all.<br />Erin Grant (Demi Moore) must strip for a living,and her biggest fight is against her ex-husband to get her little daughter back.Meanwhile a [physically excited] congressman (Burt Reynolds)gets fixated on her,a murder occurs and things get quite complicated.<br />Striptease has humor at times,but not much really happens.The plot,if there is any,is pretty weak.The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is probably Demi Moore and her dancing on beautiful Eurythmics songs.However other than those \\"music videos\\",there is nothing else to care about in the movie.I wish Eurythmics used Demi on their videos,which would make making a movie like Striptease unnecessary.<br />The DVD doesn't have a single extra as it suffers from being an old release,so I can not show any reason why you should buy this DVD,except if you are a hardcore Demi fan..
0060506989|5.0|My dad flew in the Valley of Death just a few short years after Gen Moore was there. The descriptions of the terrain, battle, even the politics and diplomatic issues are just outstanding. This book should be required reading for American History classes. It's about darn time someone told the story without all the BS that being politically correct requires. Gen Moore, you told it like it was, and we thank you for that sir.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|While this album had less radio tracks than most Halen albums, this ranks right up there with the rest of them from the Roth era.  Vintage Eddie guitar work and Dave in his prime on vocals.  Not at all a &quot;pop&quot; record; just straight forward rock and roll.  &quot;Unchained&quot; is of course the most well-known track, but &quot;Mean Street&quot; and &quot;So This Is Love&quot; also caught some airplay in the day.  &quot;Hear About It Later&quot; is a track that many have raved about; truly underrated and rocking.  How about the deep, creepy, unique sound on the instrumental &quot;Sunday Afternoon In The Park&quot;, which leads into the short, atypical closer &quot;One Foot Out The Door&quot;?  Clearly catches your attention in the context of this album, which many reviewers have accurately called &quot;dark for VH&quot;.<br />Call this effort just short of the five stars I give VH albums like the debut, 1984, and 5150.  Nonetheless, virtually all VH albums of both the Dave and Sammy eras rank pretty high in my book.  While this is the least commercial album of VH's career, it is clearly a must part of any classic hard rock fan's collection.  A definite masterpiece, just like most of the others.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I hated this movie!<BR>Thank you. You may continue shopping.
B00005QEO1|5.0|As a hard core fan of classic rock, hard rock, and melodic rock, thinking of Aerosmith makes me grumpy.  Their classics of the '70s are great but incredibly overplayed, and their most recent stuff is downright awful.  I truly wish they would just retire...unless they could put out another album as great as &quot;Pump&quot; is.<br />This album is Aerosmith at their best.  With tracks like &quot;Young Lust&quot; and &quot;F.I.N.E&quot;, the band really returned to the best of their '70s roots.  While a silly song, it just doesn't get more fun than the rocking single &quot;Love In An Elevator&quot;.  &quot;Janie's Got A Gun&quot; and &quot;What It Takes&quot; are the best of slower Aerosmith hit tracks--well done and not over-sappy like &quot;Angel&quot; or the awful &quot;Don't Want To Miss A Thing&quot;.  &quot;The Other Side&quot; is an awesome single--again, vintage Aerosmith.  &quot;Don't Get Mad, Get Even&quot; is another classic rocking track.<br />Quite honestly, every track on this album is very good to great.  At the point in time when this album came out (1989), I couldn't have been happier about this legendary band's comeback.  Unfortunately, things have deteriorated since--with the &quot;pop moments&quot; becoming too frequent and the rock tracks trying way to hard to sound &quot;modern&quot; and in unconvincing fashion for the most part.<br />No matter what your feelings are on the last decade of Aerosmith (I know not all will agree with me), I strongly recommend this album as one of Aerosmith's strongest.  Great listen from beginning to end.  Just enough pop to keep radio fans happy with a lot of ROCK to keep the old diehards happy.  Fans of all eras should enjoy this one.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I mean there are a lot of things I Don't like about this movie but it's still good.  The reason I didn't like it was the kid who played Anakin Skywalker, he was a terrible kid actor. Natalie portman was good as the Queen, but I thought her outfits were way to over done.  The movie itself had no where to go and it doesn't seem to fit in with the Star Wars Trilogy.  Although with all those problems the movie is still enjoyable to watch and it's harmless entertainment and is good for children.  There is no violence or gore.  The DVD is OK but it could have been much better.  If you are a Star Wars fan buy this otherwise wait and see if there is a collection of all six movies in 2005 and by the way why aren't the original three Star Wars on DVD?
B000063S6Z|5.0|Moby is the man.  While mass-produced media entertainers provide the bubble-gum pop to get through the day, someone has to do something more substantial.  Most pop speaks to us, telling us what to wear, how to act, etc.  Moby attempts to speak for us, and not about clothes or whatnot.  It's about feeling.<br />Moby breaks all convention.  There seems to be this perception that an artist has to do something drastically different than their last album to show that they've &quot;grown&quot;, or &quot;expanded&quot;, etc.  After Andy Warhol made it, no one told him he had to now become an Impressionist.  What a phony standard to judge an album by.  Maybe the problem is our short attention spans.<br />&quot;18&quot; is a drastically different album from &quot;Play&quot; in its message, not its style.  Somber and spatial, it is a reaction to the geo-political tragedy which has struck our lives.  Songs like Sunday, and my personal favorite, Extreme Ways (&quot;Extreme ways are back again, extreme places I did know/ I broke everything new again, everything I had owned...ripped apart the colors of my sea...and then it fell apart&quot;).  To me, this means that everything that we worked for in the Middle East, is gone, everything new is broken, etc.<br />A tough thing to say, to speak about 9/11.  Moby took the challenge.  A man is courageous enough to speak to us here, and he lays it out.  He does not shock us, but there is a lot to this album, far more than I know.<br />A beautifully crafted album, most songs are very smooth and powerful.  What don't I like about this album?  Perhaps song #10, the intro &quot;One thing's for sure, Moby got soul&quot;.  I think it's pretty obvious he does have great soul, but did he have to say it?  I also feel that &quot;We are all made of stars&quot; is a little too choppy.  <br />One note:  If you aren't too familiar with downtempo electronic music, it may take a few listens to get comfortable with it.<br />But overall, &quot;18&quot; isa great contribution to my life, my enjoyment and my society.  The eighteen bucks I spent for this album was chump-change really.  The  best downtempo album I've ever heard, except for &quot;Simple Things&quot;, by Zero 7.  Fabulous.
B000063UR2|4.0|Legend is a good movie.  Released 16th January 1986 in US, and the 28th of August 1985 in France,  This movie is the most beautiful in visual effects but the story was very basic.  It was about good versus evil.  The movie was often confusing also because you didn't understand where Lily really came from or where Jack came from, and there was no explanation of anything in the movie.  That's also what makes this movie so interesting.  The Director's cut explains some but not much more and the score by Goldsmith does not go and the Tangerine Dream's score is more appropriate and makes it more eerie.  This was not a bad movie but don't anylyze it or you won't like it.
B000068QY7|4.0|When I first bought this CD, I wasn't expecting much, especially after Oasis's last offering, the bland &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants.&quot; But with first listen, I LOVED all the songs on &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;! (ok, maybe not like 1 or 2) This is EASILY the best Oasis CD since their &quot;Morning Glory&quot; days. Even though it lacks the raw energy found on their excellent debut, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is a must buy for any Oasis fan, and a good buy for anyone else. The standout tracks: &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;, &quot;Hung in a Bad Place&quot; and &quot;Little by Little&quot;. The &quot;growers&quot;: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; (I thought it was alright the first time I heard it, but then I LOVED it with a second listen) &quot;Probably All in the Mind&quot; and &quot;Songbird&quot;. All in all, a very good offering. GO OASIS!
B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie is a great movie.  Realeased the 16th November 2001, it was at the top of the box office for three weeks.  This movie had a great soundtrack that should have won an oscar.  The kids in the movie were great actors and the imagery in the movie was the most beautiful.  The DVD was OK but the special features could have been much more and for a movie that grossed 317 million dollars US and is the number 2 movie in the world grossing 965 million dollars, you would think they would have more special features.  For the Harry Potter fan this a must but for the average person you may find this disappointing.
B000065U1N|4.0|Too many movies show war with a hero...there are no hero's in war. This was about the emotion the soldiers go through when they are trapped with only themselves, that they have to trust each other with their lives, and risk you life for on man, and the next man risks his life for you. <br />At first I didnt like that there wasn't much character development, but after I thought about the message behind the film, I liked it more. <br />This is by far the bloodiest movie I have ever seen, not for the weak stomache people. It's a non-stop movie, you don't get a second to breathe, then again, if I were on the streets of Somolia the night of October 3, I don't imagine the delta's or rangers had much time to breathe either. <br />I wish there was more included on the DVD (my reason for only 4 stars...), I actually wish the movie was LONGER.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This is great cult classic.  I have enjoyed this movie since I was 5.  I first saw this movie back in 1989.  It is just full of fun and great lines.  The Special Effects looked great especially for the budget of 2 million dollars.  The klowns makeup looked great, When I was 5 I really thought they were from Outer Space!  Anyways this movie is good if you take it the way it is meant to be taken as a not serious movie.  So you people looking for a good movie Friday night rent or BUY Killer Klowns!
B00003CXZ1|3.0|This movie was not as well planned out as it should have been, the directors should have put more thought into it.<BR>Due to the cheesy story lines I would have to rate this movie 3 stars.  The action scenes are pretty good and the fact that Angelina Jolie does pretty much all of her own stunts, I would advise renting it on the ... shelf.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is worth every buck.  It's ot everything in it, It got action, and a great story.  If you really like war movies this is just another great one to add with Full Metal Jacket and Platoon. This movie has great acting by Josh Hartnett.  Buy This Movie It's Great!
0671027344|5.0|It takes a lot for a book, movie or CD to earn five stars from me. This book was very unique and I could totally relate to Charlie, the main character.<BR>The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is about a boy named Charlie who is starting his freshman year of high school. He doesn't think he'll like it, because he'll be starting without his friend Michael, who shot himself that spring.<BR>Charlie doesn't like high school at all until he meets Patrick and Sam, stepsiblings who are seniors. They become friends and Charlie finally feels that he fits in somewhere. Then he falls in love with Sam, and that's about all I remember except when he gets stoned at that party (that was pretty funny, the milkshake business).<BR>Some parts were kinda graphic, but it's an excellent novel in all. I'd recommend it to anyone over the age of twelve. Or around that age.
B000001ESF|5.0|This album is the best progressive rock album of all time, and the beginning of what we know today as Rush. I am a big fan of Fly by Night and Caress of Steel, but this album is what Rush really is. The lyrics are very intellectual, and this album is very anti-radio. 2112 is most probably the greatest long song of all time, and the only one that can compete is Pink Floyd's Shine on you Crazy Diamonds. I am in heaven when I listen to the Overture and the Grand Finale, and this is probably Neil at his very best. I love the way Geddy, Alex, and Neil play throughout this song, making it a true masterpiece. Passage to Bangkok is also a great song, and one that sticks in your head.  The rest of the album can't really compete with the first two songs, but 2112 itself is enough for me to give this album infinite stars. This is my favorite Rush album even though I love Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, Farewell to Kings, and Hemispheres. How can you bash perfection????
B00005K3OT|2.0|What could have been a cute, enjoyable movie is reduced to ashes by the obvious stereotypes and the silly slapstick posturing. Let's see -- Roman Catholicism is bad, so let's create a caricature of it to demolish; fathers are bad, so let's create a wonderful Mom-only family to raise a little girl; neighbors are bad and strangers are good, so let's create some unpleasant neighbors (wife-beater) and some attractive strangers; moderation and self-control are bad, so let's cast our best actress as an out-of-control diabetic on a binge. How silly!!
B0000508U6|5.0|From the beginning of the cd I went into a trance-like stage of emotions that kept me going up and down and side and up. The first song of the album will make you spin like a crazy dog saying &quot;where did these guys come from?&quot; The album was created with a mixture of beautiful guitar riffs and acoustic guitar strums that cadence into a perfect cd. Try mixing Jeff Buckley's falsetto voice with a bit of Radiohead's &quot;The Bends&quot; and you'll have a pretty good idea of what's this about. Every track has it's own full potential to be a PERFECT single. Try track #6 Trouble, #1 Don't Panic and #7 Parachutes. After hearing those tracks you'll want to hear more Coldplay.
B000063S6Z|4.0|I was thinking that I didn't like the new Moby CD much, but it simply turns out that I wasn't listening to it at the right time. This is a CD for the quiet times at night (probably like the ones where he stayed up in his studio creating said album), when everybody else in the house but you is asleep. Yes, there are fast grooves like &quot;Jam for the Ladies&quot; (which I think would have been a better first single than &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;), but it is predominated by introspective, almost melancholy songs, such as &quot;Great Escape&quot; and &quot;At Least We Tried&quot;  (with heartbreakingly beautiful vocals by Freedom Bremmer). This is not the same record that Play was, and one should not expect it to be. Consider it in context with Moby's previous CD if you must, but treat the album as its own entity.
B000068QY7|5.0|Oasis calls themselves the best band in the world.  This is the truth.  While other bands out there spew out random regurgitated [music], Oasis is still in a league of their own.   Buy this album, you will not regret it!  Liam's writing attempt, \\"Songbird\\", is much better than one would imagine, and none of the tracks on this CD disappoint.  Long live Oasis.
6305127638|4.0|Star Trek: First Contact is no doubt the most underrated of the sereies. It starts off with Capt. Picard having nightmares about the Borg and soon enough appear and try to take over the Enterprise. Their mission isn't to just take over it and turn crew members into Borgs though. They want to stop first contact between mankind and alien from happening. To do that they plan to stop a scientist, played by James Cromwell from inventing light speed. When Picard, Worf and Data fend off the ship, Riker and others go to earth to mkae sure first contact happens.<br />  Back in &quot;96&quot; when I just saw the movie for first time, I found it a real treat. Found it even better than Indepence Day honestly. It has intense action, a cool villain in the Borg Queen and fine chemestry between Patrick Stewart and Alfre Woodard. Generations and Insurrection were ok movies but just don't match First Contact entertainment wise at all. Well anyway, this is my favorite next to the Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock. I hope it gets a Special Edition released soon.
B000068QY7|5.0|After the mediocre and bland &quot;Be Here Now&quot; and &quot;Standing on the Should of Giants&quot;, this was a make or break record for Oasis, and they have delivered a rocking return to the spotlight.  Good mix of songs from the thumping and sneering &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; and &quot;Hung in a Bad Place&quot; to softer ballads like &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; and &quot;Little by Little&quot;.  Start to finish a great listen, perhaps not as endearing as thier sophomore effort, &quot;What's the Story, Morning Glory&quot;, but excellent nonetheless.
B000068QY7|5.0|Oasis is the best band out there today.  They are creative, talented, and smart.  &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; and &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; are both awesome songs.  Liam Gallagher wrote three songs on this album.  And the bands rythem guitar player Gem Archer wrote &quot;Hung In A Bad Place&quot;.  &quot;A Quick Peep&quot; was written by Andy Bell (the bass player).  Noel Gallagher is an amazing song writer.  &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; will ROCK!  May Oasis LIVE FOREVER!!
B00005JKNF|1.0|This rambling sham of a movie is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time on. Thank goodness I only rented it.

B000005L86|5.0|Nostolgic Rythm, Spiritual Sounds, and Rootsy Vibes.  This is one of the most impressive CD's I have listened to in all of my years of listening to reggae music.  They are the ture heart and soul of reggae music.  <br />Their style is unmatched by anyone I have ever heard and they deserve more credit than what they've gained.  I had stummbled on to this CD by accident and I'm glad I did.  This CD has changed the way I look at roots music because its more than just Bob Marley.  <br />If your are a reggae fan this is a must have.  Even if your not a reggae fan, this is a must have.  Just one listen got me hooked and you shouldn't be surprised if you get hooked on the rhythm of the heart of the congos.  This group manifest what reggae music should be like.
B000066NW0|5.0|The new singing sensation from Napanee, Canada has definitely started off right with her debut album \\"Let Go.\\"  This seventeen year old hottie portrays life through her songs.  With songs like \\"Complicated,\\" \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" and \\"My World,\\" we not only hear about events of  her life,  but we hear about things we face everyday.  Avril's writing style is also what I would view as unique.  I belive it would have to be classified as its own genre.  With a bit of punk, rock, and an upbeat feel Avril has definitely come out with an album that can't be touched by any other new release.  I would defintiely reccomend this CD to anyone, of any age, gender, or sex. Buy \\"Let Go\\" today !!!!
B000002B7W|4.0|O.K. don't get me wrong, this is a butt-kicking live album. I think the music on here is great. It has a monster guitar solo by Randy himself, and a not-so bad drum solo by Tommy Aldridge. Song selction is good(could have used some more from Diary Of A Madman though), sound quality is good, all around kicks butt. So this album is completely flawless. WRONG!<br />I think Ozzy should go directly to hell for this. It says in the booklet that \\"Not A Day Goes By When I Don't Think Of Him, He Is Dearly Missed\\". If you believe this for 5 seconds then you are an idiot. OK think about this: Randy died in early 1982. This was a time when Ozzy's career was at it's peak. He had just released two killer albums \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\", and \\"Diary Of A Madman\\". At that time in 1982 he did not release a Tribute album. Then the years go by and his career starts to go downward he puts out the alright \\"Bark At The Moon\\", and the absolutly disgraceful \\"The Ultimate Sin\\". Then he feels that he needs to release a Tribute Album. It was a complete money-making move. His purpose in releasing this was not to pay tribute to one of the best rock n roll guitarist of all times, and his life long friend. NO. It was to bring in some more money and hopefully bring his career back up to standards as it was back in 1980. I just really hate to think that one of my favorite artists(Ozzy) used the death of his dearest friend to make money. I repeat: HE USED RANDY'S DEATH TO MAKE MORE MONEY.<br />Even before this he did have a semi tribute anyway. Yes the 1982 release \\"Speak Of The Devil\\" which was a compelation of live Black Sabbath songs was paying his respects to Randy. So why release another one? Answer:Money, Merchandising, Comercialism.<br />So in conclusion the music is very good, but know that Ozzy at this time really did not give a flip about Randy's death.
B00000I8BX|4.0|Yes, Demanufacture DOES have better songs than this CD. You won't find anything as good as &quot;Replica,&quot; &quot;Self Bias Resistor&quot; or &quot;Zero Signal&quot; on here. But Obsolete sounds great as a whole. Heavy songs like &quot;Shock,&quot; &quot;Edgecrusher,&quot; and &quot;Obsolete&quot; are complemented with more melodic (while still heavy) tracks like &quot;Securitron,&quot; &quot;Descent,&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot;. This is a good CD to put on if you're working on something and need to concentrate. I don't know why, but the choppy, rhythmatic riffs seem to help me focus in on stuff. Oh yeah, and &quot;0-0&quot; is the only semi-good bonus song included, so you should probably buy the regular version or something...
B000060P79|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard and you should hear it too. For all the punk rockers out there pick up this cd. And for all you none punk rockers pick it up too. Because this cd rocks! As a maqtter of fact this whole band rocks! LIsten to me and buy this cd, it will change your mind about the whole punk rock scene. This is the best punk rock band in the world! Also be sure to check out the scooby doo movie soundtrack cd because they have and unreleased track on there called \\"grow up\\". And that also rocks! I only have to words for everyone Simple Plan!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I first heard of Jones on an NPR review of the critically acclaimed album.  One of the points the reviewer made was that Jones doesn't live up, in some cases, to the hype.  He also pointed out that Jones is a singer, and I think I'm quoting accurately, &quot;in love with her own technique.&quot;<br />After buying the album, I do see that reviewer's point.  There are times when the phrasing on this album is very self-aware, very stylized, very much attempting to fit a place where those singers that Jones is most often compared to-- Billie Holliday, Nina Simone-- fit.<br />But, as a first album, I'm sad that Jones has gotten so much attention as a super-woman that people are forgetting that this IS a first.  That she has a long way to go.  That in the first album-phase, few, if any, artists are self-guided enough to resist the polishing that I'm sure must have happened to the album to fit what some record exec thought was the audience's &quot;taste.&quot;  I'm quite certain that with time &amp; experience, Jones will wow us again and again.  And in the meantime, this album is definitely worth a good listening to.<br />It's not yet perfect-- but then, I do so look forward to that &quot;future&quot; when I can say that her work is at the place it promises to go.<br />Having also had the fortune to get to see Jones perform live in a tiny, exquisite venue, I also can say that she is one of those singer/performers who far surpasses the album of the moment.  Support her now and be able to say one day, &quot;I remember back when...&quot;
B000066NW0|5.0|Now that you know how to say it, spread the word! Because a new star is born! Before I get right to the review, all I can say is GET-THE-CD! I found that this album will appeal to all music lovers. It has a little something for everybody.<br />It all started with an infectious tune that was played on the radio one sunny June morning. &quot;Complicated&quot; said the radio DJ. I didn't really catch the singer's name but I was hooked. Did a little researching on the net and found out that this rising star actually writes her own songs! WOWZER! I immediately went to the nearest record store to get her album. I HAD to get it.<br />As a lover of Alternative music, I was suprised to find that her music actually suits my taste.. Her kinda singing actually reminds me of Alanis Morrissette during her &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; days. But wait a sec! Fast forward to the next song. What's this! A nice ballad! Hmm, I wonder what else is in store for me. All the time I was thinking, &quot;What a nice voice she has.. She'll go far..&quot; Then the tempo ups to a grunge-like beat and there I was, bobbing my head up and down to the song. I didn't even have to finish testing the rest of the CD. I knew I'd like it.<br />Bottom line is GET-THE-CD!(If you didn't already get the idea) It's a GREAT album. Avril Lavigne is definitely NOT gonna be a one hit wonder. You won't regret buying it!
B00006879E|5.0|Songs About Jane by Maroon5 is one of the best CD's I've bought in years.  I keep playing the songs and keep finding new dimensions to the music.  Singer/song writer Adam Levine is destined for stardom.  His voice, his lyrics and his guitar playing are incredible.  Maroon 5 is a band with undeniable talent and this Octone Record CD is 12 great songs right down the line.  If you've ever been in love and lost this album is for you. <br />Marron5 is a blend of R&amp;B funk with power pop, think Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and guitar riffs that Stevie Ray would dig and you've got this all white band from LA.  Go figure. Somehow these young guys have gotten a soul infusion and result is a break through album with major musicianship on every instrument.  It's called talent and everything about this CD is original, and that's what I like about them.  Show me something new and they do. And as good as the CD is, they are much better live.  Get on the Maroon 5 bandwagon now because this album establishes them as a major new act on the rock and roll landscape.

0064471837|5.0|I loved this book, I can't express that enough. It's filled with magic, demons, and even a little bit of romance. Surprises seem to lie everywhere, and when you think one thing will happen, another thing does. I couldn't bring myself to part with it, and carried it around like a security blanket. I read it it in three days, and I'm not the type to skim through. If this book was good enough for me to take three days out of my summer to read on my own free will, then it is a great book! ^-^ Read it, you won't be dissapointed.
B00005A0RI|5.0|Beautiful, relaxing, and classy.  Mostly boleros, played with warmth and depth of heart.  It is best to listen to this album as a whole as every song brings out the integrity of the next.
B000066NW0|5.0|Review Submissions contest:<br /> Avril Lavigne's CD \\"Let Go\\" is one of the best CDs I have ever owned. All of her song's on this CD are true to her, life and society in general. I think that the past few years music has lost it's true sense of style. It's all about ridiculous subjects that corrupt young boys and girls around the world. I consider Avril's music almost as a savior. Saving music as a whole. Maybe once she becomes as world wide as artists such as Britney Spears, younger children will begin to listen to genuine music, Avril's music. Maybe artists will begin to change the way they write and perform their music also. Starting by showing more respect for themselves and respect to what they are writing/Performing. There are many stereotypes against different peoples' styles, including skater style. I personally don't judge anyone by their style..but many do. She keeps her style alive. I've read that at many of her photo shoots the stylists want to do her hair, makeup and clothing the way THEY want it, but Avril fights them about it and she makes them do her hair and makeup the way SHE wants it. She even brings in her OWN clothes to keep her true image alive. It's very inspiring about how she is a fighter. Maybe her album will change the way people look at eachother. Instead of judging someone by the way they dress, they will judge them by the personalities that they have. This is a very inspiring CD for me. Alot of her songs relate to what's happening in my life, and I believe that this CD relates to MANY teenagers around the world.<br />      Songs such as \\"Losing Grip\\", and \\"Unwanted\\" are all about rejection, either by her peers who judge her the wrong way, or rejection by somebody she loved. Many teenagers experience things such as this. \\"Skater Boi\\" is a song about the stereotypical \\"preppy\\" girl who turned down a \\"skater\\" boy all because her friends didn't like the way he dressed. In the end, he became famous. The girl was alone with a baby, she endedup going to his concert realizing what she missed out on and what she could of had if she hadn't been so shallow.<br />      \\"Complicated\\" is a song about being yourself no matter what. It's about how people are fake. For example, you can be with that person alone, and you like to hang out with them, but once some of their other friends come along they have to act as if they are a totally different person, putting on a facade just to impress those who are around them, even if you like them for who they really are. It just makes their lives more \\"Complicated\\". <br />     \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" is a song about how  you need to look at life in a different perspective, do crazy things, act what you feel or you won't be truly living. If you are ordinary or normal, life would be boring. Everyone would be the same and the world would be dull. Experience life to it's fullest, and be anything but ordinary.<br />      \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is about how she will always stay real to herself no matter what happens. She won't change for anyone and become somebody's \\"fool\\". She wants people to see her for the real her with whatever she wears, however she acts, ect. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" is a song about how she wishes she could say things to the person she loves, but just can't in fear of not being perfect in their eyes. And if she said the things she just couldn't say to them, she's afraid they might drift away. <br />     \\"Too Much To Ask\\" is a song about how she is rejected by a guy so many times, but yet she will always be there in the end, whatever the pain she has to endure, no matter how selfish the guy is. \\"Mobile\\" is a song about how life seems to always be passing her by. Wherever she is everything's always changing, nothing stops for her. So by the time she comes back home to her friends and family, everything she once knew will be totally different and unfamiliar. As if she were a \\"mobile\\".<br />     \\"My World\\" is about where she grew up and how she grew up throughout herchildhood and adolescent periods. What she went through in her small world of Napanee. \\"Tomorrow\\" is about a relationship not working out even if the person is telling her it will work out...she won't believe it. And about how she won't put up with them always making the decisions today, today is her day to make the decision and tomorrow will hold what is to be. <br />     \\"I'm With You\\" is about how she needs to be saved by somebody else rather then saving herself this time. She needs somebody to be there for her, but no one sees her or can find her. She's alone in her own mess of life trying to figure out what to do when somebody she doesn't know comes along, but it doesn't matter because they are there, and she's with them and not alone. <br />     \\"Naked\\" is about how she puts on a facade through another day she goes through, even if she is acting totally opposite from what she feels inside. Then someone comes and she can be herself, as if she were \\"naked\\". She feels accepted by this person and it feels so right for her, she can act how she feels around them without fearing rejection. She knows that they are there for her. Now she wonders why she was afraid in the first place to be herself and to show the world who she really is. <br />     She's only 17, and she started writing her own material for this CD at 16, it's truly amazing to me. This shows me and everyone else that you don't have to be accepted into the \\"popular\\" crowd to be successful in life. You don't have to lie to yourself and put on a daily facade to impress others. Just be yourself and it will lead you to greater things in life. <br />     This CD is inspiring me to become even more true to myself than ever before, and I hope this CD can inspire boys and girls around the globe to do the same.
B000063UR2|5.0|Legend turns out to be the best it has ever been with Ridley Scott's true version of his dream masterpiece.  For years there has been a soundtrack out with the original music written by Jerry Goldsmith and to finally see the \\"black dress\\" scene with what was originaly intended makes the movie a true \\"Grimm\\" tale.<br />The making of on disc two tells you alot of info on the trials it took to make the movie with most of the cast. (Why Tom Cruise wouldn't talk about this film is beyond me.)  Movie buffs will be amazed to see the old 007 soundstage where the movie was filmed and was the last to be shot there.  <br />For anyone who hasn't see the movie,  take the time to watch both versions.  Tim Curry's performance is worth both versions and he just plays it so over the top that he IS the ultimate \\"devil\\" and evil being.  For Star Trek fans,  Robert Picardo (The Doctor from ST: Voyager) plays the witch \\"Meg\\" and shows how you can play a charater through all that rubber.  <br />Here is also an example of how great visiuals could be attained before the digital age of special effects.  The documentary on the making of is one of the best that has been produced by Universal.
0062502182|5.0|my friend recomended this book to me and i totally loved it. i read it in like 2 days, i couldnt put it down. i highly recomend it to anybody who like a good story with a positive message.
0380973650|1.0|Large, apparently full of interesting bits, but ultimately completely unsatisfying. I was left with the feeling that I shouldn't have bothered, and would ultimately regret my decision to indulge.<br />An enormous disappointment after Gaiman's previous excellent &quot;Neverwhere&quot;<br />Avoid
B00006950W|5.0|I saw this movie it is awesome. If you are a fan of the video game series then I recommend you see this movie and if you have never even played Resident Evil then I also suggest you see this movie. It has lots of action and there is not a boring moment in it. It is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen and I think that you will like it too.  This movie is awesome.
B0000640SA|1.0|This is probably one of the best movies in my collection but the limited edition version is simply awful. In a nutshell the special features are a mess. It's almost like being harassed by your DVD. <BR>The DVD starts out by asking you a ton of stupid questions which, for those seeing the movie for the first time, would help to give away some of the movies mystery.<BR>The original DVD version is much much better. It has the movie and the short story that the movie was based on. THAT IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED but I guess Christopher Nolan wanted to milk the fans for a few more bucks. <BR>A nice special feature for this DVD would have been to have the option to play the movie in sequential order. While this would be a horrible way to first watch the film, I'm sure many fans wouldn't mind watching it that way.
B00000K0DV|2.0|You can't win them all. After seeing this film... that was all I could think of. I was very dissapointed with this film after seeing his VERY TALENTED, \\"ZOMBIE.\\" I guess, I was execpting more. The New York Ripper, has a VERY early 70's look and feel to it, but was made in 1982. It was Difficult to get into the mood... that this was about a CRAZY KILLER, when most of the film is so Focused on ACTS of SEX. It wasn't even WEIRD ..., just normal stuff you would see today. I got the feeling right off the bat he was trying to make a... SOFT PORN movie, instead of a, KILLER ON THE LOSE... film. Right when you think it is going to get Scary, GUESS WHAT?... There is another SEX SCENE. Maybe he should have just called this...\\" THE NEW YORK SEX FLOPPER.\\" I gave it a 2 because his other work with GORE FILMS are just the VERY BEST AROUND. This just isn't his kind of movie. I think he tried very hard... but it just doesn't belong beside his other GREAT WORKS OF FILM, MASTER LUCIO FULCI has done.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This movie is about a suicidal, schizophrenic lesbian who has issues with her parents and is looking for love in all the wrong places. I wanted to like this movie, and in a way I did, but there just wasn't enough substance for me to call it a favorite. Lynch would sort of touch on some very powerful themes but wouldn't delve deeply enough into any one thing build meaning.<BR> <BR>The fact that there are no sub chapters was really annoying but I guess that's Lynch's way of being artistic.<BR>That being said, the performances were superb but it wasn't enough to save the film. <BR>The only people who will like this movie are those who create meaning where it is lacking.
0312979479|5.0|Hey everyone, Let me start off by saying that Agatha Christie is really one of the best authors out there. She tells a story as if she really WAS there and as if The story she says really happened!<br />  Now...most of you might like the Poirot and Marple series...They are really very good, but this book is *different*! There isnt \\"one\\" person after the murderer...there are 10! the whole idea of 10 people trapped in an Island with a murderer is just incredible...to make it even BETTER the murderer is one of them and they have to figure out who it is before its \\"too\\" late!<br />Like I said before the whole idea of the murderer was awesome....<br />You should def. read it!<br />Lattttttttter!
B000066AXE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the subtle and vicarious way this movie handles mental illness. It is an engrossing interior view of how brilliant mathematician John Nash and his decidedly courageous wife Alicia have struggled to thrive through five decades while yoked with his often debilitating schizophrenia.<br /><br />Kudos all around to the actors. If you can forget he's a prize jerk, Russell Crowe is mesmerizing. In fact, his character is also rude, arrogant, and brilliant - but still sympathetic.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly's Oscar was not an aberration. She not only holds her own with Crowe but bests him on occasion. She has come so far from her fluffy eye candy days that it's like watching a different person. Brava, Jen.<br /><br />The greatest achievement, however, may be Akiva Goldsman's script. It takes a revelatory turn in mid-picture and completely opens John Nash's experience to you. Many have complained of too much artistic license and expository compression taken with the real story, but I believe these have not diminished the substance of what John and Alicia Nash have accomplished over the years. The gentle, gradual, yet never final triumph of their love and determination is well-served here.
B000068QY7|5.0|If you didn't like their last album, Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, don't think for a second that you won;y like Heathen Chemisty.  It has great songs and a bunch of suprises.  anybody who knows a little about oasis knows that big brother noel writes all the songs.  In this album Liam showcases his songwriting talents and it comes out great.  The album is worth the money simply for the 2:07 song &quot;Songbird&quot;; Liam best song to date and a highlight on the album.  Liam's &quot;born on a different cloud&quot; is also an unexpected bonus  Heathen Chemistry also has amazing ballads (writeen by Noel), like &quot;stop crying your heart out&quot; and &quot;little by little&quot;.  I would venture to say that there are no bad songs on this album.  That's my 2 cents.  Its really a solid album that gives you what you want.
1587990717|1.0|A serious bit of fermented sour grapes by someone who is jealous of anyone who made money during the 1990's.<br />The whole book is based on the idea that if you place enough monkeys in front of enough typewriters for long enough, eventually one will produce the Iliad. Therefore, no performance, or even a series of performances, can be the results of anything but chance. There is no value in studying the past of anything, everything is random and nothing about the past can provide any insight into the future.<br />Spend your money on something by Paul Krugman.
B00005JKNF|3.0|The witty barbs tossed around in Gosford Park could leave a body-count that even Jason Part Two Billion (coming soon, of course) couldn't match. Many viewers will want to see this movie just for a well-dressed, deceitful, and possibly gay character played by Ryan Phillipe, and who can blame them? Phillipe is a handsome and clever actor. But Maggie Smith  really makes the movie, with her quiet little insults and her gentle scene-stealing.<br />The movie is as much about the servants in Gosford Park as about the well-to-do characters who pretend to deserve our attention more. Director Robert Altman brilliantly plays the two sets of characters off each other, toying with their similarities without ignoring the class differences and injustices that keep them apart. Those similarities first become obvious when one of the new arrivals learns that she will be known not by her own name but by the name of the woman she serves.<br />I wouldn't call this a great comedy, or a great mystery, though it strives to be both. Still, I would call it a great showcase of brilliant acting and clever one-liners. The 1930s period costumes and the character studies make it even more enchanting.
B000068QY7|4.0|I am one of those few, few Oasis-fighters. I truly doesn't think that &quot;Standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; was all that bad, and when everybody's saying how &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; will be Oasis' &quot;comeback&quot; and that they're &quot;back&quot;, I'm in my personal view thinking that they were never gone.<br />Hence, I don't think that &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is a far better album than anything Oasis've done recently. I believe, as most other, that &quot;Definitly Maybe&quot; and &quot;(What's the story) Morning Glory&quot; are fabolous. But I also think that &quot;Be here now&quot; is one of the finest pop-albums ever recorded, and that &quot;Standing...&quot;, well it wasn't Oasis' best, but it was a lot better than most of everything on the genre.<br />It's the same with &quot;Heathen...&quot;. It's not the best album ever recorded, sure, but it's a lot better than a lot else. The most interesting about this album though is that it seems to be somewhat of a turning point for the band.<BR>In the beginning Noel Gallagher was a talented guy who took all his knowledge of rock'n'roll and pop-music and made a spicy porridge out of it, making some of the hottest knock-out-songs of the 90's. It's a bit different now. The same Noel with the same talents, but in stead of taking his oh-so-beloved knowledge and making a spicy porridge, he takes them and makes delicious, elegant and (at least a bit) better crafted, fancy cakes. This makes both the production and the songs a lot more professional than ever before, and therefore Oasis is now a band with more self-confidence than ever before.<br />On the other hand Noel has only written six of the eleven songs. This is perhaps the only problem I have with the album. Liam's, Gem's and Andy's aren't bad; Liam's &quot;Songbird&quot; is a fantastic ditty, &quot;Born on a different cloud&quot; quite talented and &quot;Better man&quot; &quot;decent +&quot;, Gem's &quot;Hung in a bad place&quot; sounds Noeland Andy Bell's meaningless little one-minute-peep is swinging, but nothing more (doesn't have to be either). But I still think that Oasis works a lot better when Noel rules, it seems to be more uneven now.<br />That is one of the reasons why I start to wonder just how better &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; really is, compared to &quot;Standing...&quot; that is. Because, in my opinion, &quot;Standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; is a more solid production. It had some not-so-great songs, something that this album doesn't have, but on the other hand &quot;Standing&quot; had some songs that only the amazing single &quot;Stop crying your heart out&quot; can match. It's a hard comparison, and more or less impossible if you see it out of this point of the view: &quot;Standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; was the good-bye of Oasis' happy childhood, and &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is the first step for a new Oasis.<br />So is this any better than &quot;Standing...&quot;?<BR>Well, I guess so... but more of a different album.<BR>My advice?<BR>Noel, take back the control over the band and keep making fancy cakes, because, believe it or not, Oasis is a band that is needed.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down has to be one of the best movies out there. It is just a well put together movie. I think what made it so good was the directing. Ridley Scott did a great job of doing a very daunting task- to intertwine the jobs of over a 100 Americans in a 2 hour film. Another strong point of this movie was the acting. You couldn't really tell any of the faceless soldiers apart so the new and old actors mixed together and you couldn't tell a difference acting wise.<BR>   The onscreen adaption of this movie was very well done. The book was more detailed but the screen writers of this movie did an excellent job of weaving every thing together in a short 2 and a half hour movie.<BR>   This movie was very, very intense and nerve racking and the only parts you could catch your breath in were the scenes with no fighting- which were few and far in between. The only thing that could turn people off, in my opinion is that basically the whole movie is fighting and more fighting with almost nothing interspersed, such as in the movie Saving Private Ryan.<BR>    As a DVD Black Hawk Down lacks special features and has not many exciting extras. But in my opinion I would buy this DVD just for the experience of seeing this great movie.
B00005JKNF|4.0|First, I'm a sucker for a period piece.  Having said that, I should also mention this movie is not about a mystery.  It's about class interaction, and just happens to have a who-done-it in the middle.  The mystery is really not the point of the story, nor is it important \\"who\\" the who-done-it really is.  The showcase of the film is around two completely separate groups of people existing in one house:  one living in it, and one making it all work.  Beautiful costumes, beautiful scenery, and excellent acting make this a fun movie to watch more than once.  If you liked this movie, I suggest \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\".
B00005JL3A|5.0|This movie was awesome. It has a lot of action and kept me on the edge of my seat. The special effects were great also. At some times during the movie it was a little predictable and easy to guess what was gonna happen next. The beggining was a little confusing. But other than that this was a great movie. I would reccomend that you buy it on DVD. I sure know i am!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Wonderful film!!  Very powerful... As a person who suffers from a brain disorder (though not schizophrenia) I was impressed with the sensitivity and accuracy of the film.  Stigma is something we deal with and hopefully &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; will help to lessen this stigma attached to brain disorders.  During the awards dinner at the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill annual conference this past Saturday in Cincinnati, the screenwriter received the longest standing ovation I've ever observed.  There were nearly 3,000 of us, all touched by mental illness in some way.  Thank you John, thank you Ron Howard and all your staff for your terrific portrayal of a very devastating illness!

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's CD, &quot;Let Go,&quot; is a great CD. Avril and the CD are NOT like the manufactured pop stars that the world is crazed about these days. She is real. She is spunky. She is full of life. That is what makes her CD one of the best CD's I've picked up in a LONG time. (And believe me, I've got EVERYTHING. From Barry Manilow to Wynnona to David Bowie to Ozyy Osbourne to Jennifer Lopez and JaRule.) Her album doesn't focus on &quot;hitting me baby one more time.&quot; The thing I get out of her CD the most is to be yourself and not let anyone change you no matter what. And that is very true. I used to be all in &quot;LOVE&quot; (or so I thought at the time) with boy bands like Backstreet Boys and Nsync. Then, I decided that I wanted to expand my musical tastes. Before long, I discovered the sound of Avril Lavigne. I thought her voice was much better than those lip-syncing &quot;groups.&quot; I mean, HELLO?! She actually PLAYS and instrument and wrote her own songs (with the help of other professionals)! That's what makes this CD so great. Nothing but pure, fun, GREAT songs!!
B00005QDW1|1.0|What happened? No Doubt's sold themselves. What happened to the word &quot;ska&quot; ?! They sound like they're trying to be techno or hip-hop. Maybe change is good for some people, but for No Doubt's change was horrible. <BR>The whole album sounds the same. Pop music can just ruin you. Tragic Kingdom was the ultimately the best album. That's where they left their music and turned into.. into what? What happened to the band? <BR>What's up with this &quot;Hey Baby&quot; thing huh? It's sooo annoying. And &quot;Hella Good&quot; sounds the same. The whole album sounds like it's repeated itself. <BR>For those of you who love the album, give it a second listen to. I'm speaking the truth, I like No Doubt, but this album was purely non-No Doubt.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I got into Pantera a little late, and man i was missing out.  I can't believe how good they are. I only have 2 of their cds so far, but I'm going to keep buying them because they're really solid.  There's not a bad song on here, you can listen to the whole cd.  Pantera is one of the best metal bands around, and definitely one of the heaviest.  Dimebag's riffs and solos are unforgettable.  Vinnie Paul is one of the best drummers today.  You can hear the bass pretty well, and Rex is definitely really talented.  Then there's Phil, who is one of the best, actually probably the best singer in thrash.  He has a great growl and a powerful yell, but also a great singing voice(and he does sing), and a great falsetto scream(similar to Rob Halford at times).  The lyrics are pretty interesting, whether you agree or disagree with them you have to admit theyare definitely not mindless and stupid like some of the [stuff] coming out today.  Buy this cd(and other stuff b Pantera) if you like Metallica, you'll love it.
B000001IPL|5.0|All of The Offspring's albums are equally good.  They are all are five stars.  You should buy all of Offspring's CDs, there awsome.
B000002H97|5.0|First of all, I don't think Metallica sold out with this album.  They were just taking a different approach to their music.  Whatever, that's not the reason I am reviewing this album.  The reason is because I love it!  This might be a bit different from their older stuff, but I  think it's just as good.  It's still Metallica, still thrash, still heavy, and still great.  <br />&quot;Enter Sandman&quot; is an instant classic.  So is &quot;Sad But True&quot;, hell, all the songs are great.  &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; is tied for Metallica's best ballad(with &quot;Fade To Black&quot;) in my opinion.  This album is really where they reached musical maturity.  It does sound very polished I'm sure thats what they were going for.  The production is so good, and the songwriting is some of Metallica's best.  The vocals sound very nice, James sings alot more, and he really sounds great.  Kirk Hammets solos may not technically be the greatest, but they're still real good and they fit perfectly in the songs, so that's all that counts.  The drums sound great, as Lars always does.  Of course Jason is no Cliff, but he's still really good, and like everything else on this album he sounds very good.<br />I don't know why so many people won't listen to this album because they think Metallica &quot;sold out&quot;, This album is awesome.  I'd say fans of old and new Metallica would probably like it, I did.
B000068QY7|5.0|After the somewhat disappointing 2000 LP \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\", Oasis return in 2002 with a fantastic new album.  \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" sees the songwriting of Oasis spread out even more, 3 songs from Liam Gallagher, 1 each from Gem Archer and Andy Bell, while the rest come from lead songwriter Noel Gallagher.  \\"The Hindu Times\\" starts off the new album in a rocky, pyschadelic fashion with a great chorus and guitar riff.  \\"Force of Nature\\" has grown on me over repeated listenings, a great tune with Noel on vocals.  The Archer-penned \\"Hung in a Bad Place\\" is one of the more rockier songs on the album, offering a nice opening guitar intro.  Without a doubt, \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" is the best track on the entire disc, in my opinion.  A classic Oasis ballad, it's destined to be sung by many fans during the band's worldwide summer tour.  It has a memorable chorus and a great middle eight section.  \\"Songbird\\" is Liam's finest work to date, sounding very Beatles-esque with basically just acoustic guitars.  \\"Little By Little\\" is another Noel-sung tune, which could turn out to be the 3rd single off the LP and another classic anthem.  \\"Probably All in the Mind\\" will most likely be an underrated Oasis song, similar to \\"Sunday Morning Call\\", \\"Columbia\\", or \\"She's Electric\\".  \\"She Is Love\\" sees Noel with his last vocal performance on the CD, a soft acoustic-driven song.  The LP closes out with a great song \\"Born On A Different Cloud\\" (Liam written), and \\"Better Man\\" which I haven't warmed up to yet.  This is a great return to the sound that worked on 1995's \\"What's the Story Morning Glory?\\", which has sold over 15 million worldwide.  Oasis has always made excellent pop/rock music and this CD continues that trend.  Oasis popularity (especially in the U.S.) might not ever get back to the days of 1995-1997, but if enough people get their hands on this album, you could see a surge of Oasismania!!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|If I hadn't read the book first, I probly would have loved the movie, but as always, I read the book first.  The special features are nice but I tend to by DVD's just for the qulity of the movie, not the &quot;features.&quot;

0385335482|5.0|I just love how Sophie Kinsella makes Becky Bloomwood's character so unavoidably loveable and laughable. I could not put this one down and so I found myself laughing out loud in public places.  If I wasn't reading the book in public, I was thinking about it and of course, laughing out loud.  <BR>The whole time, Becky makes confessions to us about her shopping problems.  Oops- did I say problems?  I meant investments... I mean, everything you buy has to be some kind of investment, right?  I just laugh about her fascination with clothing, shoes, accesories... basically anything that sits in a shop and has a price tag.  I don't know what it is about this particular book... it is so perfect throughout.  I've reccomended it to everyone I know and do the same for you.  You'll love it... and guess what?!?!  There's a sequel... oh yes, the aventure continues!  Buy this one, you'll love it (it's the best investment ever)!  The only thing is, it will be hard to find a book this good after youve read it.  I'm still trying!

B00000JGHM|5.0|Michael Mann's 1995 epic should have swept the entire Oscars in 1996 but noooo.. It had a plot so I guess that was asking too much.  Michael Mann proved to the world after this film, or should I say after this EVENT that he is now the best director of our time.  That cool bluish hue he throws into his films with the brilliant cinematography of Dante Spinatti just spelled the recipe for a total epic masterpiece.  Brillant writing and top notch acting with an incredible cast gave this film an instant classic title.<br />His works before HEAT and after it proves my point clearly.  Now if Mann would make a Voltron live action film, Id be in heaven!
B000066NW0|5.0|I remember when i first saw avril lavignes video complicated on trl. Right when i heard it i wanted to know when her c.d. was coming out. I mean she is a skater chic, you dont find may of them on trl. so it was so awesome to see that. also i love how she doesnt care wat people think and knows how to have fun. whn i found out when her c.d. was coming out i was so hyped, cause i really wanted it. It is a great c.d. Girls can really relate to most of her songs and thats awesome. so everyone get her c.d.<BR>Rok on!<BR>Jenn
B0000029DD|5.0|i bought this cd about a year ago, gave it a few listens, and although i identified jeffs obvious talent, i didnt really connect with the songs.  about two weeks ago after scrounging around in my record collection,i found it in the bottom of my bin, and threw it in. now i am simply wearing out the cd, this is one of the 10 best albums of all time.  jeffs voice soars throughout, with amazing sincerity and pain in his lyrics. the guitar work is masterful.  this is by far one of the top 2 or 3 albums of the 90's.  jeffs tragic death haunts you thru out, it leaves you wondering what couldve been, and thankful for what was, all at the same time.
6305308659|5.0|Before I start my review of this GREAT movie, I feel the need to address what the Reviewer: Jean-Francois Virey said.  <br />She says that this movie welcomes Satan into the perfect world of the fifties.  Reality check sweetie, that is not how the REAL 1950's were.  I too am a Christian, but come on.  The people of the fifties had the same problems as we do now (just not in the public's eye as much.)  Also, I hate when some &quot;Christians&quot; have to say something about everything (ex. Harry Potter.)  Can't anyone just sit down and enjoy something. GET A LIFE WOMAN.<br />Now that is over, I want to say that this movie is my #2 favorite movie of all time. The fifties is my favorite time of period. Rock and Roll is brand new, Teen rebellion, the cars, and the greatest of all--The Malt Shops.  That said, This movie has everything. It has humor, emotion, fantasy, and of course--Tobey Maguire.  He is the greatest actor of all time. Reese Witherspoon is Awesome as well.  Please go rent or buy this.  GREAT GREAT GREAT movie.
B00005R1N3|5.0|A rare treat for fans of the genre. Two short interviews with John Saxon are an added bonus.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is simply one of the finest films ever made. Anyone who's had to sweat out a paycheck lorded over by morons and surrounded by backstabbers will find a lot to relate to in this movie. Since this masterpiece is not yet available on DVD ( a horrendous oversight ) go ahead and get the VHS.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Often, it seems that artist work hard to create one hit song, then after doing so, they blow off the rest of the album seemingly coming up with and recording the rest of the songs over night; Shakira is no different. She obviusly knew that &quot;Whatever Whenever&quot; would be such a hit song that it would cause her fans to buy the entire album.
B000002H97|5.0|Some say Metallica sold out. Some say this album is their best. This is one of my favorite albums, PERIOD. I also think it is Metallica's best work. You can listen to each and every song on this album without wanting to skip one. It is different from their older stuff, but that makes it better. Just because the songs are shorter and it doesn't sound as hard doesn't mean they sold out. This album is and will continue to be much better than most of the metal out today. I recommend it to anyone who wants hard rock and a few ballads with great vocals. My favorite track on this album is &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril, I can't let go of your CD! This CD has definetly got more potential then any other C.D I've ever purchased, It has great lyrics, Great music, and it just rocks! For someone so young and Small, this CD is Huge. Avril Lavigne makes me pick up my guitar and  just rock out. I look up to her and respect her lyrics and totally feel in touch with everything she says!  She is my role model and I think that she makes everyone realise who they really are, and that, you don't have to be little miss glamour queen to hit it big in the music buisness! CONGRATS AVRIL! THIS CD KICKS SOME MAJOR [rear]!!!! WE LOVE YA TONS! KEEP IT UP AND DON'T LET GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is a beautifully arranged CD that you'll like to listen to after a stressful day.  Diana's voice is so beautiful its hard to stop listening to her. My favorites on this disc are &quot;maybe yo be there&quot;; &quot;cry me  a river&quot; ; the title track &quot;look of love&quot; and &quot;S' Wonderful&quot;.  <br />I also have her earliest remaster CD &quot;Stepping Out&quot;. This CD is difficult to find in stores but gives a sharp contrast to Diana's great talent.  On stepping out she picks up all her rythm; she swings; steps and beats...really terrific
B0000027RL|5.0|Time to do something about it.  This is the greatest album I've ever owned.  To me, there is nothing better, no other music does as much for me as the songs on 'Ten'.  It's something you can't put your finger on, but every single song brings about some kind of powerful emotion that just can't be evoked by anything else.  I don't know how they did it, but somehow they managed to stumble upon a perfect formula(spaced-out guitars that sound heavy and soothing at the same time + hyperactive drumming + funkyass basslines + of course, Eddie's voice which manages to be guttural and beautiful at the same time) that countless other bands have attempted to imitate, that no one's been able to touch since.  The tempos are deliberate yet driving.  Every single guitar solo on this album sizzles.  The melodies are somewhat lacking on some songs, but it's forgivable since they improved so much in that department over time, and it does nothing to detract from the anthemic quality of every single song.  Here's how it goes:<BR>\\"Once\\" - A very strong opener, and Eddie's voice is probably more abrasive here than it is on the entire rest of the album. What better way to introduce yourself to the world than with a pounding ode to insanity with lyrics about killing people for no reason at all?<BR>\\"Even Flow\\" - Instantly recognizable, this is one of Pearl Jam's most popular songs, and with good reason too.  Great verse and spectacular chorus lead up into an epic conclusion....\\"YEAH!.....whoo!....aw, yeah.....fuggit up!\\"(incredible solo goes here)<BR>\\"Alive\\" - Oh. My. God.  There are no words to describe how great this song is.  From the opening riff that sounds very spacey to the final smash of chords and drums, there in not a single bad or non-golden moment in this entire song, not one.  This is as perfect as music can get, according to me.<BR>\\"Why Go\\" - The ONLY track on here I don't particularly worship, it's good I suppose, but compared to the rest of the material here, it's just so lackluster.  Should've put \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" on the album instead of this one so us PJ geeks wouldn't have to buy the \\"Jeremy\\" single.<BR>\\"Black\\" - Catharsis. Beauty. Poignancy.  PJ's first \\"ballad\\" type song is still one of their best.  I love how it starts off sounding so hopeful and lighthearted, then quickly drops into the dark pits of despair and anguish, one of the best verse/chorus transitions I've ever heard.  Aaron Lewis will rot in hell for butchering this song.<BR>\\"Jeremy\\" - Easily their most well-known song, though I personally think Alive should've been. Eddie's storytelling-style of songwriting is in its strongest form here, and the music accompanying it is simply incredible.  Though the lyrics are quite moving enough on their own, I think the non-lyrical vocal parts near the end(\\"hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,\\" and \\"ooo-whoooooaaa oh, oh, ohohoh\\") are much more powerful.<BR>\\"Oceans\\" - This one was really difficult for me to enjoy at first; guess I was just put off by the extremely high-pitched vocals in the \\"chorus.\\" But it grew on me and now it's one of my favorites...mainly because I can relate to the lyrics about not being able to be with someone that you love. This one screams out \\"old-school arena rock\\" louder than any other song here.<BR>\\"Porch\\" - I love how it goes straight from the slow, everloving balladry of Oceans to the thrashing angst of this track.  The onyl song here written entirely by Eddie, it's probably also the fastest song on the album.  A live staple for sure.<BR>\\"Garden\\" - Haunting and powerful.  Always evokes images of candles being light in a cemetery at night, don't know why.  Jeff and Stone come up with some really great songs together.<BR>\\"Deep\\" - Another song written by Jeff and Stone, this one being the stronger of the two.  This one has the distinction of being Pearl Jam's first waltz-time song.  Eddie's lyrics about a man whose habitual drug use leads to suicide sound downright prophetic in retrospect.<BR>\\"Release\\" - The perfect ending to a perfect album.  Makes everything they did up to this track sound like mere hack work, like they wanted to wait 'til the very end to show what they were capable of.  The only song on this disc written by each memeber of the band.<br />In short, if you don't own and worship this, you are somebody I will hate with a passion for the rest of my life.  Nah, not really, but I'll certainly never respect your taste in music until you buy this, listen to it endlessly, and praise it as the masterpiece that it is.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is an extremely good album to listen to after a stressful day.  Very soothing.  Diana krall has such a beautiful relaxing, sexy voice that she cannot help but lulls and soothes you.  Best tracks on this CD are 'cry me a river'; 'look of love' ; \\"S' Wonderful\\" and one of my favorite 'Maybe you be there'.<br />I also have her earlier CD's;  like Stepping Out.  Not many stores carries this CD but REALLY REALLY good CD. One that peps you up than soothes you.  She really swings on that CD.  Her rendition on Body and Soul was really terrific.  I also heard Billie Holliday's rendition but Diana's rendition was so much better even though I think Billy Holliday other works are fantastic. <br />Bottom Line is that you have to listen to Diana Krall stepping out CD (remaster version).  It's really wonderful.
B0000046PE|5.0|The world lost a great asset with the passing of Ella Fitzgerald. Luckily her legacy lives on in her recordings. There are a plethora of recordings of Ella Fitzgerald, so why get this one? Because here in a simple three disc set is the great cross section of Ella. There is the soft, cooing Ella who wraps her silky voice around Summertime, Angel Eyes, and How Long Has This Been Going On?. There is the high energy bopping Ella with It Don't Mean a Thing (if it Ain't Got That Swing), Something's Gotta Give and Too Darn Hot. And there is the most personalble Ella doing her fresh and honest attempt at Mack the Knife. There is nothing new here really - most of these songs are available on other CD's. But this is the package that brings so many facets of a great lady together into one extremely loving and listenable package.<br />If you don't know Ella - buy this and listen repeatedly to it - you'll be richer for the experience.<br />If you know and love Ella - this is simply a great package to put on the stereo, sit back and enjoy one of the finest singers ever to grace us with her voice.
B000002AGE|5.0|When Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul teamed up with the late, great Jaco in 1976, fusion fans were stunned. The new band released what I consider their best record, 'Black Market', with drummer Alex Acuna. Then, with percussionist Molono Bandera, they released their most popular record, Heavy Weather'. And it's pretty good.<BR>     &quot;Birdland&quot; was the big single, but it's too weird. The live version is much better. &quot;A Remark You Made&quot; and &quot;Harlequin&quot; and two beautiful pieces of music. &quot;Rumba Mama&quot; is a duet between Acuna and Bandera, and is interesting if you have a broad taste in music. However, the real gem of the album is Jaco's &quot;Teen Town&quot;. It is 2 minutes and 51 seconds of amazing fretless bass. (Jaco also plays drums on it.) All in all, this is a great Weather Report album and a landmak reocrd in jazz fusion.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|The director's cut is much better than the PG-13 version that was previously released.  The movie still suffers from the love triangle B.S. that clouds the real purpose, but it's worth wading through to get to the battle sequence.  That's the payoff.  Body parts flying, blood, guts, extra explosions.  It's just as graphic as Black Hawk Down.  As for the extra features -- stellar!  Great, in-depth stuff and worth the price.  The packaging is really good as well.  You get some postcards and a small flyer. It's a good package. There's a ... rebate inside the DVD for those of you who've purchased the previous version, so you really get this new package for [money], which is a bargain considering what you get.  If you liked the movie despite the romantic stuff, you'll love this version.

B000068QY7|4.0|Liam Gallagher, in one of his more sensible conversations with an interviewer, has said that after Oasis have produced, in his words, a &quot;great album&quot;, then they'll probably call it a day.  He did say that this was close to a great album, but the next one will be closer.  I have to agree with him.  This album is not the best album in the world, by any means, but its still Oasis, and this album includes the sort of music you associate Oasis with.  Some of it, like the opener &quot;The Hindu Times&quot;, is pure rock &amp; roll, the Oasis way.  Other stand-out songs for me are &quot;She is Love&quot;, Noel's song writing back to its best, and &quot;Born on a Different Cloud&quot;, Liam's song writing at its best (yet.)  I would recommend you give this album a try, if you are of a fan of Oasis' earlier recordings, such as \\"Definitely Maybe\\" (still, in my opinion, their best), but also like their musical development on each subsequent album, evident on the beautiful tune \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\".

B00005B4GU|5.0|This is an easy album to review.  It seems to me that the band have a clear objective which they fulfil comfortably.  It is a charter at which any other group would fail abysmally.  They set out to creat a 'contemporary' sound, bursting with alienated, pained vocals, sweeping soundscapes of texture and rhythym.  The only thing which prevents me from giving this album an even more glowing review is that it rather sets out to exist somewhere between the background and the foreground, in that shifty transmutable zone between concious and subconcious.   During playing this album there are moments of great lucidity which are incredibly engaging and sections where the music becomes pulse-like and washes over.  <br />Ambitious, melodic, beautiful, as good as anything else by Radiohead.  Once again they continue to march on into unexplored terrain.  I eagerly anticipate their next move.

B00003CXI0|1.0|I've read all of the harry potter books and I thought that they were great but then I went and saw the movie and I was severly disapointed . I know , I know , people will be saying that of course I didn't think that it was as good as the book no movie ever is but while that is true not only was it not as good as the book I honestly thought that it was a bad movie.<br />Now I will admit that the casting for ron , hermione and hagrid were spot on however daniel radcliff (harry)couldn't act if his life depended on it , and as for dumbledore , this is the wizard that voldemort , the most powerful dark wizard of all time , is supposed to be afraid of he is an old frail man who no-one could possibly be in the least bit scared of , and don't even get me started on voldemort he didn't look remotely scary the director could have tried a little harder.<br />Last but not least is the fact that loads of scenes were cut out , there wasn't three matchs of quiddich only one there wasn't a potions test to get past in the dungedon , and the way that voldmort was banished in one of the last scenes was completely different to the book.<br />I don't think that this movie deserves even one star but unfortunately that is the least amount that you can give , my advice , don't even bother wasting you money renting this movie out.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut CD, \\"Let Go\\" has been selling off the hook since it's release date of June 4th, 2002.  Her CD features the #1 hit, \\"Complicated\\" which has topped both Canadian, and American music charts.  The CD has reached #5 on Billboard charts, after only 3 weeks of release.<br />\\"Let Go\\" has variety of moods in every song, almost like Avril took the whole CD out of her diary.  Songs like \\"Naked\\" and \\"I'm With You\\" show the deep side of this 17-year-old punk from Napanee, Ontario.  Tracks such as \\"Losing Grip\\", and \\"Unwanted\\" lets the listeners more into Avril's personal life, loud and clear.  This angsty girl has a lot of gut and emotion.<br />One of the more bounce along, jump around songs on the album is \\"Sk8er Boi\\".  This one is about how a girl turned down a 'boi' because of the way he dressed, and Avril claims the boy and rubs it in the snobby girls face.  Harsh, but true.  That just shows how kick-[rear] this girl can get.  <br />The track, \\"Mobile\\" is about how she has to pack up, and leave all of her friends.  \\"Everywhere I go, I am Mobile\\" she sings, putting it lightly.  <br />Avril, who is only 17... co-wrote all of the songs off of this 13 track CD.  \\"Let Go\\" also includes an Enhanced feature, which includes a bonus track, EPK, and the video for \\"Complicated\\".<br />This CD is full of surprises.  Rap, punk, the list goes on... Avril is here to stay, and this is only the beginning.<br />Pick up your copy of \\"Let Go\\" today.
B000067JHW|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time it is a pretty simple movie about a girl helping her friends and trying to take risks in relationships .<BR>It doesn't make the slightest difference if you hate subtitles after five minutes you will be so wrapped up in the movie you won't even notice them.
0312265859|5.0|Stephanie Plum is back again and is better than ever in this laugh-a-minute book.  She is asked to help her parents' neighbor, Mabel Markowitz, to find her daughter Evelyn and granddaughter Annie.  They have disappeared and the daughters' ex-husband is threatening to take Mabel's house because of a child custody bond which was put into place at the time of Evelyn's divorce.  Stephanie goes through her usual misadventures of exploding cars and missed chances at apprehensions, but this time the plot also includes a man in a rabbit suit, spiders, and other hilarious complications.  Plum's supporting cast is wonderful, as usual, especially her buddy Lula, and the two men in her life, Ranger and Morelli.  This is vintage Evanovich and should be fun for old and new fans.
B00000K31Q|5.0|In this remake of The Taming Of the Shrew, Julia Stiles stars as Kat Stratford, a rebelious misunderstood teen who's sister, Bianca, cant date until she does. This becomes an obsticle for  Cameron, a love struck boy who wants to take Bianca out. So he pays and talks Patrick, the scariest guy in school to take Kat out on a date, insuring his date with Bianca. But of course everything goes hay wire and Kat finds out about the plan. This movie is great. The dvd doesnt have much in the special features catagory but its ok. This is a great comedy and you cant even tell that Shakespeare even had anything to do with it.
B000000W5F|4.0|When I first put on Tattoo You I was happy that it had the more familiar Stones sound, without the disco, punk, and experimentation of their albums of the previous few years that had been less than appealing, at least to me.  Well, maybe \\"Heaven\\" is experimental, but the result is very nice, a lovely ambience.  But for the most part, the rockers and ballads on this CD are a return to the basics, while at the same time having little redundance with respect to earlier songs.  C'mon detractors, Keith Richards' \\"Little T & A\\" is really cool, one of the most quintessential Stones-sounding songs.  The group also came up with one of their signature tunes here in \\"Start Me Up,\\" not as strong as their classic rockers but certainly as catchy.  \\"Hang Fire\\" is another good potent number.  The more mellow stuff is on the latter part of the CD, and the last two tracks, the ballads \\"No Use in Crying\\" and \\"Waiting on a Friend,\\" are very evocative.  There are a few so-so cuts, but for the most part it is a solid lineup.  Not only is \\"Tattoo You\\" authentic Rolling Stones, but it represents a latter-day high-water mark--they have not come up with anything better since.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This has just recently become one of my all-time favorite horror films. This has it all, the \\"klowns\\" look awsome and it didn't take much money to produce them, I love so many parts in this film, well first off the story. People see this comet shoot from the sky all fall nearby, an elderly man goes with his dog Pooh (I think that was right) to check out what it was, he thought he discovered Haleys Comet, turned out to be the circus. A glowing red and yellow circus tent, in the middle of the woods, from there on the klowns take over, trapping the entire town in cocoons of cotton candy, there are many humorous parts in this film, such as when the klowns go inside the drug shop and start making an entire mess of the place, most funny was when the klown came to the counter where the nervous clerk was and put down an enormous amount of items on the counter. Not much on scares but alot in laughs, and the film never slows down, it always keeps it's pace. I really love those klowns, especially the one that comes out of the pizza box! Now I won't suggest so quickly that this is a film you'd like your kids to see, but if they already watch these types of film then theres no argueing that they can watch this, there is strong language to go with only abit of blood, head boxed off hint hint. But the ending was strange, did it have any meaning that the klowns are still out there? I think so, also how about everyone that were left inside the cotton candy cocoons or the strange giant baloons, all goners! The huge klown was awsome and the klowns reactions to thinking the ice cream truck was their god was hilarious. A must see movie for anyone, anywhere! FANGTASTIC!
B0000636UN|5.0|I admit I bought this album solely due to hearing the catchy &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; on the radio. I own Crow's original album, and have enjoyed the subsequent hits she has had since then, such as &quot;Every Day Is a Winding Road&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot;. This album absolutely does not disappoint from the first track to the last. In fact, I am impressed at how far Crow has come in her musicianship, lyrics, and arrangements. This is a wonderful album that I highly recommend to anyone who appreciates a good blend of  uptempo rock and soulful ballads.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Even though Sting has become synonymous with the rocky type sound of the police, for this album he has taken the classics we all know and reinvented them into a jazz based style that is certain to have your feet tapping. The performance came at the end of the &quot;Brand New Day&quot; tour and Sting himself decided to remake these songs into a more intamate version of the originals with a line up including cello, double bass, trumpet and trumbone the sound is full and contains great solos. Parts resemble dinner jazz and others blues and even gospel I have listened to it every day since I ought it and I'm still not bored. When your streesed put this on and it will calm you. When your in the mood for some great music it will give more than you need it is a masterpiece of music and I would advise it to anyone
B000002NBY|3.0|Throughout his solo career, Paul Simon has been a challenging inspiration to many musicians of the 80's. Simply put, his music still continues to make so much joy.<br />His 1986 landmark album, Graceland, was a landmark in his solo career. The songs were tough and understandable, during a time of oppression in the community of South Africa, where the album was inspired. From You Can Call Me Al, all the way to The Boy In the Bubble, Paul Simon made a fusion of rock and zany pop music that still continues to make a great influence in our culture today.<br />Although Paul Simon has never been able to duplicate the success of Graceland, or his cleverness with Simon &amp; Garfunkel, his music is still as strong and everlasting as you could expect from the only living boy in New York.
B000066NW0|5.0|As a lover of music, I have heard it all and seen it all. I've heard music that i disliked and liked, and yet none of the music that i liked has been so in sync with me as Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot;. This CD completely expresses what many other artists are afraid of saying through music. It has soul, personality, and is original. With songs such as &quot;Losing Grip&quot; to &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; (also my favorite) Avril shows attitude and confronts the world. Out of my rock CD collection, Avril's &quot;Let Go&quot; has so far been the only  one that i couldn't stop listening to. I love every song, and I can relate to every word, which makes it so much more appealing. All i can say is that this CD is awesome. It's so wonderful to have someone like Avril come out and give everyone the extra push to be different, to stand out and to be proud of it. Truly, she is &quot;Anything but ordinary&quot;. I look forward to her being one of the best artists of tomorrow.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought Avril Lavigne's Let Go CD after hearing her first single &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio.  I loved her voice and how it's not drowned out by any obnoxious beat as in most of the new songs you hear on the radio now.  All her songs have the normal rock flavor, with electric guitar, bass, and drums.  I am a rock fan myself so of course i love the CD.  On the CD there are all kinds of songs, some have a more slow tempo and some are more upbeat.  My favorite songs on the CD are &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi.&quot;  Avril herself seems to be like the typical punk where she doesn't care about what other people think and she just does things the way she wants.  She definately has her own style.  Also in her songs she sings with a lot of feeling which is a nice change from Britney Spears, who hardly sings at all.  So my advice to everyone is to buy the CD now and be a leader!  Before it's too late and it seems just like you're followng the crowd instead of doing what you want.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This film contains an incredible Oscar-nominated performance by Russell Crowe.  I was lost in his portrayal of the troubled John Nash, and was incredibly impressed.  Jennifer Connelly's Oscar-winning performance truly reveals a wife desperate to help her husband, and some of her moments onscreen are purely inspired.  A powerful story of frustrated genius and love overcoming dire circumstances, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is masterful.  The character of Nash reveals a man that finds it difficult to accept his insanity but still can find humor and joy in his life.  <BR>The deleted scenes are worth purchasing the DVD versus the VHS, revealing a scene with Ron Howard's father as well as John Nash's creation of a mathematically perfect game.  Commentaries offered by the director as well as the screenwriter provide interesting insights into the film.  <BR>This movie is definitely a must-see, and the DVD and its goodies will only make it better.  (It would be a crime to see this film on pan and scan VHS)
B000066NW0|5.0|This was a great CD. I enjoyed all of the songs and I think that most of were really meaningfull. The music was great and Avril has an outstanding voice. There is a great variety of music types which is what makes her music so enjoyable for everyone. Avril is an outstanding singer and has an outstanding CD that I think you should check out!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut cd is a album jam packed with meaningful lyrics and great music. Her songs reach out to the listener, and are easy to relate too. Her song &quot;Losing Grip&quot; is powerful, and &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; is just fun, and it will make you want to get up and dance. This entire cd is awesome, she is an extremely talented singer/songwriter/guitar player. She deserves all that comes from this.
0312265859|5.0|Ms. Evanovich is still in top form with Hard Eight.  She has written an edgier Stephanie Plum story without compromising any of the outrageous hilarity of the previous novels. I for one cannot wait until Stephanie's next outing. Keep up the good work!!
B00003CXZ3|4.0|Leonard Shelby has a condition of extreme short-term memory. He lives in the immediate present tense. He remembers everything that happened to him prior to \\"the incident\\" but he can't make new memories. He can only remember things for a few minutes, then everything fades. He's trying to hunt down the man who killed his wife during that horrible \\"incident.\\" He takes polaroids of things and writes notes on them as reminders. He tatoos notes and various facts all over his body. He doesn't know who his friends are or who he can trust - every time he meets someone, it's for the first time.<br />The film starts at the end and goes backwards in short spurts, revealing a little at a time - just like Leonard's memory. It'll take only one jump back for you to realize what's happening. Just go with it. When it all comes together, look out!<br />Guy Pearce (The Time Machine, The Count of Monte Cristo) plays Leonard Shelby to perfection. Each situation Leonard finds himself in is a complete mystery. There's some slight humor in given situations, some fear and sadness. Pearce is so convincing. You find yourself really sympathizing with his condition. The two major co-stars are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, who starred together in The Matrix. My first memory of Joe Pantoliano was opposite Tom Cruise as \\"Guido the Killer Pimp\\" in Risky Business. Always a great performance.
B000068IEU|1.0|I just wanna know how anyone can think this was good or scary. It was boring, ugly, terribly acted,cheesy, and the list goes on. I am very open minded and a HUGE fan of Wes Craven but c'mon people this is so amateurish it looks like some kid made it as  a joke.Sorry but i just dont understand how anyone would think this slop is worth 12 bucks.
B00003CY6L|5.0|I was really surprised by this movie. I thought that it would be really sappy but it wasn't it was really good.  The story was the best part of the movie. The part that really kept my attention was how they constantly kept  missing each other.
6305079900|5.0|Terminator is one of those movies I remember long after I walked out the theatre. What I remembered most was that it was pretty darn scary. A good thriller type of film to watch on the TV or Theatre. The effects were very cool at the time and the robot and mechanical effects were pretty impressive.<br />Of course James Cameron and Arnold Swartzeneger had a chance, with more time, money and technology, to do the second Terminator much bigger, better, faster and louder - but this one had a simple story and motivated the characters to really move.<br />Linda Hamilton and Michael Bein were great together and the action very intense. Ironically enough The Terminator is a bad guy in this movie. He spends most of his time trying to kill Linda. In the sequel, he is just the opposite - trying to save Linda and her son. It's irony with a twist.<br />This is good science fiction, with good action and some very scary scenes; I purchased this DVD, which does not have all the extras. Since then, the new DVD has a lot more. Oh and Terminator 3 will be out in 2003 - if you didn't already know!
0767002652|5.0|It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced; in fact, it is the yardstick against which all other period dramas have been measured ever since.  Five series were produced in total (on five boxed sets), and the entire series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, the Roaring 20s, and finally concluding with 1929`s stock market crash).  <br />The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery.  The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents).  I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away.  Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.<br />Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household.  First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord.  Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges.  Other memorable characters to whom we are introduced in the first series include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer.  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs \\"family\\"too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.  <br />The first through fourth boxed sets cover series one through four respectively, and each set contains thirteen 50-minute episodes on seven tapes.  The final boxed set (series five) contains sixteen 50-minute episodes on eight tapes.  <br />Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward's death in 1910.  There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite.  Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI.  Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed.  Series five covers the twenties.<br />In conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama.  But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of \\"goings on,\\" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more!  I usually recommend buying the first boxed set and then, if you like it, buying the rest.  This is one series about which I have no hesitation in recommending that you go ahead and purchase the lot; you won't regret it--it's simply THAT good!  And those who've enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs, will surely enjoy The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which were produced by John Hawkesworth).  Extremely highly recommended!
6303314015|5.0|Disney had a doosy on their hands when they had to follow up the critcally acclaimed and Academy Award nominate &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; but the studio came through with shining colors.  The story line and plot seemlessly blends humor, sadness, hope, triumph, suspense, action and joy.  From the soul-stirring opening scene whe Simba is introduced at Pride Rock, to the race in the gorge to save simba from a raging stampede, to the finale where Simba and his fellow lions fight to save their kingdom.  To put it short, this movie is a masterpiece of animation and moviemaking in general and having Elton John write the music to the movie doesn't hurt at all.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Its tragic how  Phoenix wasted his talent and died so young. This movie shows us maybe the best how gifted he was. Well, what ought I to say about the movie? You have to see it if you like films like &quot;My girl&quot;. But &quot;Stand By Me&quot; is really better. Its not sentimental, but nostalgic, sad, funny, and, most of all, MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE 12 AGAIN. And thats the money worth, isnt it??? A really lovely movie with great actors and an ending which makes you cry, without typical &quot;Hollywood-Stuff&quot; Love from Tati
0060934913|4.0|If you've seen 'A Cook's Tour' on the Food Network (which, ironically, Bourdain blasts from time to time in this work), you're familiar with the author's take-no-prisoners approach to food and life.<br />It carries through the book. <br />He's a man who knows his passions, is single-minded about them, and has a talent for explaining them and himself. It starts with a moment of revelation when young Tony has his first oyster and he's still going strong thirty years later in a Dionysian binge through Tokyo. This man isn't afraid to eat anything and he tells you why in this book.<br />Rather than being a scandal/gross-out/behind the scenes expose, this is in fact the autobiography of a chef.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Some people think that this movie could have done without the lovedubby stuff, but if it hadn't had it I know that I would not have like it.  I saw it in Disney World and boy am I glad I chose that instead something else.  The historical facts might not be correct but it's just a movie it was exciting to see and I thought that it was the best movie of the year.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|The new version of The Time Machine was amazingly silly! Even the talents of Jeremy Irons couldn't save this script. The movie kept the basic of the original HG Wells Story but forgot the most important part - having characters we like. They did adjust the story a little bit.<br />The special effects were state of the art, of course, but that didn't help the lack of feeling and compassion this script had. The sets were grand and the Time Machine itself had an interesting design, but the movie lacked a lot. I just can't find a lot of good things to say about this one. The performance was by the best friend - Fred Flintstone himself in The Flintstone Viva Rock Vegas and The Full Monty's - Marc Addy.<br />This is not something I would recommend seeing in the theatre. I will definitely rent it on the DVD went it is available later this summer. It may work much better on the small screen because if bombed on the big one!
0684803356|5.0|An interesting historical novel set in the context of Revolutionary Spain, but classic Hemmingway, it carries with it the important lesson of activism over apathy, especially pertinent to today's world.  It teaches that ideals transcend political boundaries and that if you believe in something strongly, then you owe it to yourself to protect that ideal in any part of the world and at any cost, even that of your life.  Intwined is a beautiful love story.  One of my top 5 greatest books of all time.  Thats a rave, baby.  The poem by John Donne at the beginning makes the book worth buying.<BR>A 5 because it is a great story with an invaluable lesson.  If you gain nothing, you still read beautiful prose by one of the greatest authors ever.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Yup.  What the first \\"Toy Story\\" did well, the sequel does as good if not better. The script was smartly written to give added depth to the characters and has them deal with issues that come out of leftfield but don't come off as farfethed, such as having to deal with the aspect that eventually, their owner will outgrow them.  Tim Allen and Tom hanks reprise their roles as Buzz and  Woody, and they are hilarious.  Don't be fooled to the sequel stigma, treat yourself to maybe the best sequel in the history of Hollywood.
0061020710|4.0|This book has been a thrill to read, it kept me on the tips of the pages wanting to keep reading even while my mom was yelling at me to go to sleep. It is the first book I've ever read that has been in the humourous/fantasy catagory and I can\\"t wait untill I can make it back to get the second! Rincewind and Twoflower are the most hilarious heros ever in the fantasy department. Thumbs up!
6304493681|1.0|Ok people there are lots of [bad] anime out there, and this movie is one of them.  I bought this because all the reviews were good and now it is so overrated and boring. Watching it was like going through ancient chinese torture. In a nutshell, it was a plotless,  computer-animated piece of ...  And the music? My ears almost burst from that nasty high-pitched nuisance called singing.  It was confusing and uninteresting. If I can give it ZERO stars, I would in a heartbeat. By the way I sold this [stuff] to my friend ...boy was I happy from getting that out of my house. If u like Escaflowne, Utena, Gravitation, or Yami no Matsuei...stay away from this movie. If you want to see more [stuff], watch the second part and don't even get me started on Princess Mononoke.
6305265488|5.0|It has got to be the best cinderella story ever told. The actors in this movie are some of the best actors I have ever witnessed.  The cast was chosen extremely well.  It tells of the story of cinderella but doesn't dwell on that fairy tale story.  IT makes the situation seem like it could have really happened.  It didn't have all that bobity boop stuff everything was so realistic.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|It's no wonder this movie has been acclaimed by critics and has received a number of academy awards including Best Picture. The story of a man's life struggling through the mental illness of schizophrenia is both heartrending and captivating. And obviously by experiencing true value of love and family, this man's instinctinve decision of healing himself is a journey all of us would be touched to witness.<br /> Russell Crowe's most promising performance of this incredible  man, John Nash, leaves me wondering exactly why he was not the one with an oscar in hand. (Although Denzel Washington also did an excellent job as a villian, though a good character is always admired.) Jennifer Connelly also did an equally excellent job, along with the ever talented Ed Harris.<br /> Many filmmakers like to create characters that are complex and unusual, sometimes to the extreme that they don't exist. And most of the time they pull it off, because as humans we honestly relate. Being that John Nash's life accomplishments were real, and his imagined characters were close to real, the humanity audiences saw were admired. And what made the film truly touching was how even though people lack a sense of balance in their minds, giving them these sorts of mental illnesses, they are given an even better gift that normal people like most of us are missing. And that's what really makes his mind beautiful. <br /> Film and psychology are things I plan on doing for the rest of my life, but I'm not sure I can do both. People like John Nash are reasons why I choose psychology, and amazing directors (who also directed this film chronologically) like the brilliant Ron Howard are reasons for my desire of filmmaking. Even though this movie was said to be inaccurate in some areas, it is definitely one of the greatest films in history. That's just Hollywood's way of getting to you. So, just watch it if you haven't already, because you'll be missing something magical.
B00005A46T|2.0|Although this is an improvement from their first cd, this still is not very good. So why is it bad? Let's start with the vocals. Corey's scream/growl is nothing special and I think he could probably do better if he wanted, and his clean voice is weak and makes him sound like a rapper at many parts. And when he doesn't sound like a rapper he just sounds whiny and annoying. Next come the guitarists. These riffs are incredibly simplistic and easy to play (trust me on that one, I play guitar). I realize that they were trying to write catchy riffs that are good for moshing, but they could have thrown in some more technical stuff, and some guitar solos would make the songs way cooler too, but they don't have any of those things. I can't say much about the bass because the guitars are tuned down so low that you can hardly hear it. It's like the bassist isn't even there. Next is the drummer (the main drummer, I think his name is Joey). This is the only person in this band that has any talent (which is one of the reasons I gave this cd a 2 instead of a 1). He's extremely fast and an all around good drummer. Well, I think I've covered everyone in the band that actually does anything, so now I'm left with the other 4 members that are completely useless. The extra drummers don't do anything, they just run around the stage and come back to randomly bang their drum set whenever they feel like it (I've seen this band live, and that's all they did). Finally we come to the keyboards, which are used for ten or twenty seconds in only a couple of songs and add nothing extra to the music at all. If they are going to have a keyboard player they should at least use him enough to add to the music and give more of a feeling to it like most black metal bands do. As far as songwriting goes, these guys really haven't done anything clever or memorable, they are just trying to be as heavy and aggressive as they can be (which still isn't very heavy) so they can scare people and make them think that they are crazy (which is the same reason they wear the masks). The sad thing about that is that it actually worked. The lyrics are just pretty much your basic f**k the world I hate everything type stuff most of the time, and sometimes switch to the my life sucks and I hate myself type lyrics. I don't have a problem with lyrics like that, I just think that they could have figured out more clever ways to say those things. On the upper hand, the first few times I listened to this there were a few catchy parts that stuck in my head for a while, then on the lower hand again they got boring pretty quickly. Overall, if you are looking for some MTV heaviness that's simple and moshpit-friendly, look no further. But if you are like me and like more  skillfully played and well written metal, I strongly suggest that you avoid this.

B000066NW0|5.0|I think that Arvil Lavigne's Cd &quot;Let Go&quot; is a very well put togethter project. It has songs that almost anybody can relate to, and she has such an awesome voice. I think that it is really cool that she writes her own stuff and that she is herself. I admire her very much for that.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold has written an interesting and readable first novel with a very unusual view of life after death. Susie Salmon and her sister Lindsay are very memorable characters and her parents sympathetic. However, it was not the GREAT read the pre-release publicity led me to expect only a very good light read that made me think.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I don't think Gladiator is a great film. Oh it looks wonderful, the fight scenes are great but, and I know it's not just me who thinks this, the whole enterprise isn't very involving. I left the film feeling nothing.<br />The problem is the hero. As a general he hacks and slices barbarians. Through misfortune he is made a slave and he hacks and slices through gladiatorial games. There is no reason to like the guy and the idea that he wants to join his family in the after life doesn't hold much water.<br />What is worse is the fact that is glorifies ancient Rome. You get the sense that film makers believe that the Roman Empire was a noble enterprise. Never do you get the sense that, like in Unforgiven, that the killing is needless or that the hero is in fact as bad as the people he's killing. I wasn't enjoying the film because I was never convinced that the heroes task was either justified or compelling.<br />However, this is a Ridley Scott film and of course it's very well made. The fights are great and all the acting is fine.<br />Epics like Braveheart, and Spartacus were about freedom. Maybe it's just me but Gladiator is a hollow experience by comparison.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|A more appropriate title would have been Pearl Harbor: The Director Strikes Back.  There is so much to say about this DVD, I don't know where to start.  First, let me start by saying that this is the movie that we should have seen on the big screen.  Many of the differences between the original cut are very subtle, but they work wonders.   <br />One of the biggest improvements over the original is the added footage to the Doolittle raid.  Though they are fast and brief, they make the scene more coherent. They also give the viewer a better sense of the damage inflicted by the raid, as well as the level of danger for the raiders after the bombs are dropped.  IN my opinion, this is the most improved scene.   <br />The Pearl Harbor attack is enhanced by scenes of carnage that were not included in the original verssion.  They make the scene even more stunning and unforgettable.  <br />The extras are almost endless;   I honestly haven't gotten to view them all yet.   I rarely find director commentaries worth viewing, but I found this one terrific.  Critics have poked fun of the dialogue in this stupendous film, but Bay points out that he was trying to stay true to the plain spoken language of the time.  He also explains the purpose of the love story, and inadvertintly points out the ridiculousness of comparing his film with Saving Private Ryan.  <br />Along on that commentary track is a  WWII film historian (who was also Michael Bay's film professor).  Together they explain the film in a historical context, debunking the idea that Bay's film was not accurate.  <br />There is so much that could be said about this DVD.  Michael Bay has set a new standard here in DVD excellence that will no doubt frustrate cheapo studio execs.   <br />This is truly a must own DVD.
B000065V9P|2.0|After a brilliant project like \\"Passion\\", one would expect PG to hold on to some of that when he came back to pop.<br />But it just ain't so.<br />Many of the musicians are the same.  The artwork motifs are consistent.  Some of the sound is still recognizable.  But it sucks.  The lyrics are weak, the songs are predictable, and the depth just isn't there.  I was especially disappointed because it was promoted as an experimental album.  The only experiments here are placed in such a way that only those involved in the recording would ever notice them.<br />It's especially sad when songs with potential, like \\"Come Talk to Me\\", wastes away with a linear arrangement that drags for 7 minutes with little change.  Not to mention songs that shouldn't be there at all, like \\"Love to be Loved\\", where PG sings \\"I love to be loved.\\"  The obvious has never been stated more ... obviously!  And then there's \\"Steam\\" (what is this, a \\"Sledgehammer, Part II\\"?) which sounds more like a safe bid for a hit and a Grammy than any kind of experiment.  And the second half of the album I can't even remember well enough to rip on it--it's just plain unmemorable.<br />If there is any good news here, it's the song \\"Blood of Eden.\\"  The lyrics actually took a little thought.  I'll also admit that the album has some very soothing moments, as did \\"Passion.\\"  The big difference is that with the \\"Passion\\" album, the music speaks.  And \\"Passion\\" didn't even have words!
6305212139|4.0|This is a great vhs concert.The girls do great without Geri,(one of the others sing her parts.)I just wish I could find it on DVD.I now have a DVD player and know this would be great add to my collection.If your still with vhs or moved on to DVD,(but still have a VCR),then this what you need.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Being a very strict music fan, it is hard for me to venture off to new artists. I was first a fan of Barbra Streisand, moved on to The Carpenters and Celine Dion. When I moved on to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera it was a big step. I only choose singers that I know will las for at least 20 to 30 years.<BR>Hearing Shakira on the radio singing &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; was when I became a fan. I heard this beautiful voice: A DIVA! I went to download &quot;Wherever, Whenver&quot; and &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;. I got hooked and I went out to buy &quot;Laundry Service&quot;.\<BR>When I listened to the album I had mixerd reviews in the beginning. Then I realized that it was a MASTERPIECE!  She was a DIVA!<BR>Here is my review of songs...<BR>1.Objection (Tango)<BR>A very nice opener to the album. The beginning you think &quot;what the hell did I buy this for&quot;...then it moves on after 20 seconds to a song you'll keep in your head all day! Rumor has it that this will be the 3rd single!<br />2.Underneath Your Clothes<BR>My favorite track! This shows the true diva.<BR>3.Wherever, Whenever<BR>I can't get enough of this song. Her voice rocks!<BR>4.Rules<BR>I like the message to this song. If you're in love you understand!<BR>5.The One<BR>This song fit me at instant I heard it. I felt that way at that time! Talk about relating to the album<BR>6.Ready For The Good Times<BR>A fast-pace song. You can pretty much tell that by the title.<BR>7.Fool<BR>This song I can relate to at this time in my life! &quot;I-I-I-I-I'm a Fool!&quot; in love!<BR>8.Te Dejo Madrid <BR>Being a person who only speaks English and French I don't care much for the espagnol tracks. If it was english I'd love the vibe!<BR>9.Poem to A Horse<BR>When I read this title I wondered what the hell i'd be. It's not my favorite track, but I like it!<BR>10.Que Me Quedes Tú <BR>Another Spanish track. I like the rhythm.<BR>11.Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)<BR>I like the Spanish version of this song as well. It's so damn cool!<BR>12. Suerte (Whenever, Wherever)<BR>Naturally the Spanish version of the English hit. It was also a hit in this version! I love this!<BR>13. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)<BR>A nice beginning and ending to a MASTERPIECE!<br />Shakira rocks as an artist and she'll be around forever! She will always be singing!<BR>Go Shakira!
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is his best album this side of Thriller. I loved \\"Thriller\\", but what I thought made this album at least just as good as Thriller or maybe even better, was his willingness to open up his heart, mind, and soul into this music. A lot of it is very personal and one can feel the pain in his voice and words. It made me cry a lot actually. Who would've thought MJ could make you cry (he made me cry a hell of a lot more as I went through his later catalog)? this may be his best album to date, in the sense that its the one he not only put the most of himself in it, but is a consistently great batch of songs. Its far more personal then \\"Thriller\\" was, the album which Michael was only just beginning to show himself in his music.<br /><br />  I am sure for Michael this album was his statement of how he felt at the time. I mean to say, this album is definitely in the moment, a bit of a confessional, but not quite as much in the same way [[ASIN:B0000029LG History Past, Present and Future Book I]] would be later because of his legal and personal troubles. During the Dangerous era, he was at the height of his popularity, just around the time he was being accused, mis-judged, pre-judged, used, and abused and this is where the stresses of fame really began to show, while on [[ASIN:B0013D6LEM Thriller]] and [[ASIN:B00000269M Bad]] we only got glimpses on tracks such as \\"You Wanna Be Starting Something\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone\\". I would love it if more people would open themselves up in to their music in popular music like Michael did. It may not have always made great music, but its much more interesting then hearing about how you did it again.  ;P<br /><br />  I love songs like \\"Keep it in the Closet\\". Its a whole lot of lust, but yet it says \\"Promise me for now we'll keep it in the closet\\" and I can respect that. It is that line between lust and restraint that makes it sexy, and while some critics like to disagree, I feel the video is very sexy and it fits the song in its restraint.  It wouldn't have made sense for the video to take a step further, it would have contradicted the point of the song.<br /><br />  These songs made me see Michael in a whole new light. Songs like \\"Why you wanna trip me\\" show that Michael's a person too. He's wondering why everyone is putting all their energy on him when they could use it do do some good in this world (very well said Michael).  Something which is exemplified in \\"Heal the World\\", a saccharine song, yes, but it is really a testimony of what Michael's true heart was, he just wanted to help other people, and he wanted to inspire others to do the same!  I loved \\"Give in to me\\" not quite what I thought it would be, but that made it better(another personal one).<br /><br />  This album touches many genre's: From Funk to rock, to R&B to Gospel. This album has a lot to offer. It has a good deal of personality. It fast became one of my favorite albums, and my favorite Michael album next to the present part of \\"HIStory\\".<br /><br />  The album cover is a little funny, how when you first look at this he's hiding \\"Behind a Mask\\", but when you actually listen, you can see he's really not trying to hide who he is, what he is, or what he wants. He sets it all free into the air here. I can sympathize with almost every word in some way because I myself have had to hide behind that \\"Mask\\" in the past now. Michael really is the \\"King of Pop\\". I believe  and I know there will never be another Michael (EDIT: esp now that he's been gone 4yrs, there is a HUGE gaping hole in popular music that will never be filled), he's truly one of a kind for better or for worse. I just hope he finds God more learns to put all his trust in him instead of others(and me too!).<br /><br />  So thank you Michael for this great album!!! I don't want another Dangerous or another Bad or another Thriller(ect.), but I WOULD love another great personal album like this one Michael, just put your whole self forth and hold nothing back! Thanks for taking the mask off & revealing yourself to us.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amying the mask off & revealing yourself to us.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
B00003CXTG|1.0|Why does Hollywood have to make a three hour movie about a terrible day in US history and turn it into 'As The World Turns'? I could not believe that I sat through this piece of junk. It was 2 1/2 hours of 'General Hospital' and 1/2 hour of reality. It's a shame that Hollywood feels that 99% of the films that come out today must contain some kind of soap opera setting to satisfy what they think the lady folks wish to see. I find that to be rather insulting to women and I am not a female. There is nothing romantic about December 7,1941. It gets 1 star for the actual attack sequence. I must mention that I highly doubt that while they flew  over head, the Japanese pilots were signaling to the American children to take cover. Silliness. If you wish to see a great film on Pearl Harbor, seek out 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' and let this one rot.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD's lyrics speak the truth and is easy for most teenagers today to relate too, they go from falling in love to having the worst job ever and all that in between. It's an amazing CD to own even if your not into this kind of music. Not only is it a great CD but the guys in the band are really nice and they are awesome live.
0385503954|5.0|A few impressions of Atonement:  The characterization of the adolescent Briony is stunning.  She wonders, at one point, if *everyone* is just as aware of their being as she is.  McEwan's depiction of burgeoning consciousness in an adolescent mind is, I think, nearly unparalleled.<BR>I am not a fan of war literature, but McEwan's lengthy description of the miserable retreat of British troops from France during WW II is wrenching without ever being maudlin, sentimental, or gratuitously violent. It is the chaos of war and its humanity that he describes so well.<BR>This book was difficult to read yet impossible to put down. I found myself with the book on my lap at work, trying to sneak passages when I could.  I can't imagine any serious reader being disappointed with this book.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I really liked the DVD. It had a lot of cool extras that aren't available on the VHS version. I liked the movie, too. It's cool to write from the perspective of a kid, and I had a lot of my past questions answered. I would definitely recommend the DVD if you don't already have the VHS version, and even if you do already have the tape, the DVD is a good addition to your collection.
B00003CY5J|4.0|The chemistry between Edward Norton, Robert De Niro, and Marlon Brando is what makes this film so great. Each of the characters is well developed and the heist that they pull off is shown in very realistic detail. De Niro's character is a very cool jazz club owner(the movie features some great jazz) who is about to retire but is convinced to pull off one more score by his backer, Brando. Norton comes in as the cool but young and less experianced theif who is envolved in the heist also. Norton's character has to pretend that he is retarded as part of the heist which Norton does perfectly. This film is a must-see and if you don't like one of the actors in this movie, you will after you see this!
0812550706|2.0|This book was alright, it was not very good, but I would not say it was absolutly terrible either. It kept me flipping the pages. However, I still have a few bones to pick. The author's writing style is not very smooth and his prose is clumsy at times. It is not the fact that it is simple, and personally I like simple as oppsed to literary gimmericks, but it is that he muddles it and it does not flow properly. He does not do too good a job at painting visual images either. In fact, he does not even describe his characters physically once except to mention that one boy was black and a man is fat, which is a little suspicious. The pyhscology of the book and the mental struggles were not original or captivating enough to make up for lack of imigery either. The personalities of the characters were also quite steriotypical and clice, and none of them were too deep. It is a very typical plot and did not enlighten me, and was highly unrealistic. I suggest that Mr. Card read the Art of War by Sun Tzu to really know how battle tactics work. Finallly, it is sexist. Once it is stated that women have too many years of evolution against them. Excuse me? In the battle school, there is only the one token female student, and the students are all refered to as \\"the boys\\" and the military people are \\"the men\\" and quite honestly, what they lean there has nothing to do with physical strengh and more with brains and quick reflexes so there is no sufficent reason for the lack of female students. That is unacceptable.

B00005JKDR|5.0|I took my little niece to see this, and *both* of us just fell in love. It really shows the importance of perspective--the monsters and the children totally misunderstand each other and then come to an understanding. It's so cute and has really good lessons in it.
0380973464|5.0|Cryptonomicon was a great read. I enjoyed the banter between characters and the narrative that guided the story. The backdrops were vibrant and alive, and the use of two interleaving timelines kept the story fresh (oh great, another Bobby chapter! . . . but I really want to know what is happening to Lawrence!). However, the part I enjoyed the most was the detail. The level of detail Neal Stephenson went into to explain and enhance the story was truly mesmerizing. By delving deep into Lawrence's libidinous angst or Avi's holocaust-inspired drive, we get a much deeper look into how each character sees their world and why they interact with their world in the ways they do. The story could have been told without all of the detail and it still would have been enjoyable, but we wouldn't care about or understand the characters as much and that would have made Crytonomicon an interesting-made-for-televsion type of story instead of the collosal-Ben-Hur-on-the-big-screen type of story that it is.<br />Speaking of movies, if you are from Hollywood, please don't make a movie out of this book. There is no way you can do it justice without carving out huge, and essential, sections of the story. Merely my opinion, and I'm sure Neal Stephenson would disagree (at least financially).<br />Cryptonomicon is certainly a technical book and there are a number of chapters that might not be accessible to a lot of readers. However, if you have a technical background or a technical aptitude, nothing in the book will be beyond comprehension. If you read Cryptonomicon and find yourself aghast at the explanations of cryptography for example, but are still enjoying the book, bear with it - Cryptonomicon is certainly more than just numbers and math.<br />If you are looking for a light read, skip this book. If you are looking for easy to digest brain candy, again, skip this book.
B000059ZLH|4.0|I have been rockin to DT for 6 years. (Im only 17) This was a really good show. The sound was mixed quite well for a live feature. The instrumental part of the music was &quot;on the ball&quot;. James Labrie sang pretty well except for a few occasions of being flat or falling short of his desired high notes that he so effortlessly hits in the studio. I suppose it happens to most lead singers with age. We dont all age like Paul Rodgers. But all in all it was a note-worthy show. Any DT fan should seriously consider buying this DVD. Live cd's are good but cant capture the visual like a video or DVD.
B000002BBY|4.0|To compare Oasis with The Beatles wouldn't be fair to either of them. But Morning Glory was defintely not maybe a brilliant record. &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;, and &quot;Wonderwall&quot; will live forever, (well not in the US). Other tracks such as the title track and &quot;Dont Look Back in Anger&quot; were always clever tunes..I would give it 5 but the whole album isnt as punk rockish or rugged as their debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; which is obviously their best and my favorite album. But if your not the 14 million plus who purchased this record, by it now.
0738206679|3.0|I found this book to be entertaining. As though anyone REALLY knows how the world is put together! Interesting enough in theory, but Barabasi's evidence was not convincing enough for me. It's another attempt to popularize science, and a fairly good one, but that doesn't necessarily make its ideas true. Think skeptically--like a scientist would.
0316666343|4.0|What a pleasure it is to actually have to pry myself away from a novel.  This is one of the best novels I have read this year and would highly recommend it to any reader.  While the premise initally appeared a bit morbid, the story is one of honest inflection and tremendous growth.  I think every person could gain a little insight from this 14 year old girl.
B000002HMH|5.0|A lot of people have been complaining about this CD, saying it's \\"Not the normal music that Metallica used to\\" That it's \\"Not as good\\"  I have to disagree, however, since I think this is by far the best work that this rock out heavy Metal band has done in their entire career.<BR>     The songs are excellent, and they also are highly addictive to listen to.  Mama Said is just one of the great songs, due to the nice country/dramatic mix to it which elevates this song to over five stars, definately.  Poor twisted me is also a song that is a \\"Must listen to.\\"  It sounds great, and the song itself is comedic, (Comedic in a good way, keep in mind) Because it kind of reminds me of Mick Jaggers \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\"  The narrator of the song is really evil and dark, which makes it funny in a sense because it's so twisted.<BR>     Bleeding me.  All I can say about that song is \\"WOW.\\"  The song really starts out slow at first, and you think, \\"Sheesh, I didn't know that Metallica could be this slow\\"  Don't worry, within three minutes of the song it gets insane and before you know it you're thrashing your head back and forth.  You'll be lucky if your head doesn't knock a wall on accident like mine did...ouch.<BR>     Ronnie.  Another great song.  Think of Ronnie as an old fashioned Rock song only with the mix of heavy metal put to the batch.  There's harmonica in the background, and probably a dozen other instruments that of which I can't really name since I'm not a musician, but Ronnie is worth the entire CD within itself.  <BR>     Cure.  Excellent.  A masterpiece.  Not as good as Ronnie or Bleeding me, but it rocks out and if you're into metal then this is the song for you.<BR>     I could give my opinion on the rest of the songs, but let me just sum it up to say this:  It truly is an excellent piece of work, and you will enjoy it.  For about eight months, I listened to no other music besides this and Reload, which is just as good, if not better.  Buy it, you'll not regret it.  And it doesn't matter whether you're an old fan of Metallica or a new fan, you'll like it either way.  I hope that they come out with another CD soon, and I know they will eventually.  These guys never have a dull moment in their music.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago, sadly only once, so I don't remember much on the movie itself, but I do remember my emotions and reactions while I was seeing the movie and after I saw it. This movie is a true masterpiece, the animation is beautiful and the music is breathtaking. Mononoke Hime (hime= princess) is not recommended for younger viewers, mostly because of the violence and blood, but you can buy it using that excuse (buying it for your children or sibling ^_~) because I'm sure you'll end up liking it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Canadian native, Avril Lavigne, continues to pick up new fans everyday with her debuet album Let Go. Her hit single &quot;complicated&quot; is all over tv and the radio. It even reached #1 on Mtv's TRL. Her cd is full of hits that will touch all teens(esspecialy young women). Lavigne writes all her own music and bursts out every one of them with her amazing talent. Each song is powered but her amazing band that gets your head bobbing. With punk influenced songs like &quot;Sk8ter Boy&quot; to mellow songs like &quot;i'm with you Lavignes cd, Let Go, diserves a listen.
B000066NW0|5.0|I just have to say that Avril Lavigne is one of the most talented artists I have ever heard. Her words in her music are so meaningful, that when you hear her songs, you can understand what she was going through at the time. I picked up her cd a few days ago, and I have to say that I was very pleased with it. She really let her feelings out in her songs, and that's what I love about her. She's not afraid to show her true feelings. When I heard &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; the first song, it blew me away! It was the perfect opening song for her cd, and I could really relate to it. The songs that I really loved were &quot;I'm With You,&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say.&quot; &quot;I'm With You,&quot; was more of a mellow, but powerful song, and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; was a feel-good song that made me want to sing along. Another song that I liked was &quot;Nobody's fool.&quot; It showed that Avril is real and she's not going to let anyone change that. This cd is really amazing and I strongly suggest that everyone who likes pop/rock, or wants a cd that has meaningful songs, get this cd, because if you don't, you'll be missing out on an amazing cd! You won't disappointed!
B00005JKNF|5.0|I really enjoyed _Gosford Park_, a period, costume drama something in the mold of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians. A group of upper-class British society types and their hangers-on gather at a country estate for a weekend of shooting. During the course of the weekend, the lord of the manor is killed and a rather bumbling detective comes in to investigate the crime.<br />Sounds like something you've seen before, doesn't it? Well, the brilliance of the film comes in the fact that the story focuses on the various servants--valets, cooks, butlers, etc.--who make up the \\"below stairs\\" society in the house. We see those above stairs through their eyes, as well as the comings and goings related to the murder investigation. The actual murder isn't really solved per se, though we know who did it by film's end. What really matters are the interactions between people and the exploration of this little-seen society, in which social hierarchy is just as important, if not more so, than in the above stairs world.<br />The DVD has some excellent extras--an extended sequence of deleted scenes, with insightful commentary regarding why they were cut; an interesting behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the film; a brief look at the accuracy of the film--they actually tracked down a head cook, a butler, and a ladies' serving maid who acted as consultants to make sure the actors were realistic; and a great question and answer sequence that catches several of the cast and crew following a special screening of the film. It's obvious that all involved were having a great time making this movie, and that infectious spirit of fun comes through quite vividly.
B000066NW0|5.0|I first her the Complicated song on TRL and right after I heard it I just had to go get the CD.  I love her lyrics because they are so real and so what most teenage girls are feeling.  Her voice just makes the lyrics so much more meaninful than they already are.  I hope everyone buys this cd because its well worth it and your listen to it everyday.
B00005JKNC|5.0|This is one of the few movies out that you could easily let the family see.  A great performance by Jim Carrey, along with a bunch of classic actors.  I would definitly recommend it.  There is very little foul language, no sex scenes. I think the closest thing to offensive was a short bar scene.  If you haven't seen it yet, do it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Who cares if The Strokes dress like &quot;bums off the streets&quot;? Who cares if The Hives, The White Stripes and The Strokes are all the same? Just listen to the album without caring what they dress like, or with the idea that they &quot;saved rock'n'roll&quot;. It's honestly one hell of an album.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I have been reading some of the negative reviews about this movie. Reminds me how great works of art in history were often unappreciated. How this gem could be considered a waste of time or \\"pap\\" is amazing. The filmmaking, particularly the acting, direction, music, cinematography, etc. are first rate. If not for his boorish behavior at the British awards, Hollywood's chauvinism and the belated effort to right racial wrongs in favor of an outstanding actor who should have won for The Hurricane, Russell Crowe would and should have won. He is far and away the best actor working today. Ron Howard showed a depth and maturity comparable to Spielberg in Schindler's List, and Jennifer Connelly fully realized her star potential. But please...if intelligent, humane and sensitive movies are not your fare, and you want Arnold/Sly or How to Not Be a Mummy or Teenager While I Screamed and Saw What You Did In the Five Prior Sequels is more your fare, then do not waste your time.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed has evolved through different phases since they burst into the music scene with \\"My Own Prison.\\" While that album may be their most visceral and \\"Weathered\\" their most artistic and emotional, \\"Human Clay\\" is certainly their most accomplished and powerful. It is an epic in every sense of the word when it comes to rock music. Creed is one of the definitive hard rock bands of the late 90s and now in 2002 and \\"Human Clay\\" is a great example of how they have achieved such a high status. It is at once a sonic blast of energy and a poetic, emotional trip examining life... I think not. Creed has found its own identity and sound, a wonderful hybrid of the sounds we hear now in a post-heavy metal and post-grunge world. The opening, \\"Are You Ready?\\" is roaring and exhilarating with soaring guitar melodies by Mark Tremonti and explosive vocals by Scott Stapp. The following song, one of Creed's best cuts ever, \\"What If,\\" is violent, truthful and very thought-provoking in its lyrics (\\"human pride is a veangful song, inspired by the times you've been walked on\\"). The instrumentals are also edgy and an example of metal virtuosity with the soft, melodic opening that quickly turns into a violent assault. Other noteworthy tracks are \\"Beautiful,\\" which manages to be alluring and striking. \\"Never Die\\" is atmospheric and features Eastern melodies while the hit single, \\"Higher\\" is exciting arena rock and the Grammy-winner, \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" is a nice emotional welcome. \\"Say I\\" is crunching and epic. I think \\"Human Clay,\\" like Creed's other two albums, may surely pass the test of time as the years go by. It is an excellent showing of craftsmanship, Mark Tremonti is undeniably one of the most important guitarists in modern hard rock and Scott Stapp one of the most passionate vocalists in the tradition of, yes, Eddie Verder of Pearl Jam. \\"Human Clay\\" is a masterpiece of modern hard rock, one of the best albums any new band has produced.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie sparkles gorgeously with breath-taking special effects, wonderful performances, and a soundtrack to blow your socks off.  It was absolutely the best movie I have ever seen.  Haley shined in his role as a remarkably life-like robot child who gets attached to his &quot;mother&quot; after she reads the magic words which are only to be spoken when you plan to keep your child forever.  Packed full of priceless childhood wonder, like a winding fairy-tale with a joyful reunion as the ending.  Perfect in every way, complete.  The soft background music, composed by John Williams adds a wonderful delicate frosting to the cake.  If you want a movie that will keep you watching it again and again, falling in love with it every time, or even one to let out a tear or two, this movie would be the greatest addition to any collection.  I whole-heartedly recommend it.
0399226907|5.0|Another great story from Carle.  His illustrations are always fantastic, but his stories can be erratic.  This on is a dead-on hit.  It is the brief story of a caterpillar's feeding frenzy before he makes his metamorphosis into a butterfly.  The book introduces children to the days of the week, the names of fruits, and numbers as the caterpillar eats through different foods each day --two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, etc.-- until he finally weaves his cocoon and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.  This story is a hit every time.  Carle's bright colors and clever die-cut artwork never cease to entertain even the youngest child, and there is surely nothing in nature closer to magic than the emergence of a butterfly.  This is a beautiful and fun book that will enthrall any child.
B00002Z88D|5.0|WHAT A CD!!!!! Definately one of my all time favorites. Here is a basic outline of every song:<br />CD 1<BR>1. The Ecstasy of Gold: 10/10 Awsome instrumental, slow, short, and sweet!<BR>2. The Call of the Ktulu: 9/10 Another great instrumental, longer, gets heavier at the end, awsome.<BR>3. Master of Puppets: 9/10 Great, love the lyrics.<BR>4. Of Wolf and Man: 8/10 Don't like it as much as the others, but 8/10 still means a good song!<BR>5. The Thing that Should Not Be: 10/10 Love this song, couldn;t be better.<BR>6. Fuel: 10/10 My second favorite song on CD 1, third favorite out of both CDs.<BR>7. The Memory Remains: 10/10 Another awsome song, this CD is totally awsome!!<BR>8. No Leaf Clover: 13/10 Oh My God, with out a doubt my favorite song of all time. The drums are explosively incredible, and the lyrics are shuddering.<BR>9. Hero of the Day: 9/10 Don't really like the beginning to this song, but it becomes incredible near the end!!<BR>10. Devil's Dance: 7/10 One of my least favorite songs on this CD, still not bad though!<BR>11. Bleeding Me: 9/10 Just plain and great!<br />CD 2<BR>1. Nothing Else Matters: 10/10 Slow, and genius. Another favorite!<BR>2. Until it Sleeps: 12/10 Nice!! It has a different feel on LOAD. On LOAD it sounds rather slow, quiet (except for the chorus) and funky. On S&M, it has a dark, heavier feel. Either way the song is awsome!!<BR>3. For Whom the Bell Tolls: 9/10 Not a favorite, but great nevertheless.<BR>4. -Human: 10/10 Great song, a favorite.<BR>5. Wherever I May Roam; 11/10 Oh Yeah!! Very very awsome. That sums it up! :-)<BR>6. Outlaw Torn: 9/10 Slow, great melody. <BR>7. Sad But True: 8/10 An OK song, good, but not my taste. That's sad but true.<BR>8. One: 9/10 Slowing down. It seams that the CD is losing steam.<BR>9. Enter Sandman: 10/10 And then the Sandman comes! Great sound. It reminds me of the theme of jaws (not that it's simple) but that it sounds as if something is coming and it can't be stopped. PULSE!<BR>10. Battery 10/10BOOM!!! Wild and fast. Love the drum solo at the end! GREAT END!<br />In summary, this is a must have for Metallica fans. The orchestra takes a few listens to get used to, but it is well worth it! Average score: 202/210 = 96% of this CD is completely AWSOME!!! Have fun!
B000068QY7|5.0|The Best band in the world is back. Heathen Chemistry is everything Oasis stands for soaring anthems and great ballads. When When the Hindu Times comes on it just hits you right in the face. Force Of Nature follows with a iggy pop drum loop and Hung In A Bad place is oasis using there stooges pistols influence and wearing it proud. The Next Song Stop Crying Your Heart Out is probably one of there best. When you hear it makes you feel back like your in 1996. Songbird Liams latest tune is a short number but one of the best on the album it shows that he actually has the goods. Little By Little follows and is amazing it sounds a lot like floyd and has a great chorus arena rock n roll at its best. A Quick Peep is written by Andy Bell i would have liked Thank You For The Good Times in here but its ok. Probably All In The Mind is Oasis meets the stone roses meets the Beatles great stuff featurnes Marr on the solo. She is love is written about Noels Girl Friend and sounds like a Ryan Adams tune. Born On A Different Cloud is probably the best song lyrically on the album and it comes From Liam he has gotten really good and has grown up alot. Better Man the last track is a blusey number and if your a fan of the guitar you will love this track.<br />Stay Madferit Buy The Album
0380817683|5.0|Somehow Marian Keyes tackles a weighty subject with insight and humor at the same time-amazing! A gripping story with a character you will root for. Well worth your time. Fans of Keyes will love Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin - another WOW!
B0000640RX|4.0|It just goes to show you how fair pricing can benefit the major studios. I picked up this set having only seen the first film, simply because the package offered so much for a low price, I couldn't resist. I won't bother reviewing the films per se, as I'm sure most of you are more familiar with them than I am, suffice it to say that they were great, old-fashioned, action packed fun. So old-fashioned in fact, that they almost seem an anachronism in the modern age of PC Hollywood. It seemed quite strange to see films of reasonably modern vintage with such 1950's \\"John Wayne\\" attitude... The low price, high picture and sound quality and plethora of neat extras make this a no-brainer for any fans of these films. My only real complaint, was the 1rst documentary on the bonus disc,... being an utterly useless and jarringly out-of-place piece of anti-war propaganda. Thats aside, you can't go wrong here.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is a masterwork of film making because it takes the character and life of a man and highlights the various facets of a man in the mere space of a movie. Welles makes it appear so easy and that's the delight of the film. Good picture quality and the included documentary was also considerably enlightening as well speaking about Welles and Hearst as parallel lives that collided violently. I have not yet taken advantage of the commentary from a choice of two individuals.
B000002UVX|5.0|When one must wonder what Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsys could of done.  If this live performance at the Fillmore East was any indication, we missed out on alot.  Hendrix was absolutely on fire throughout the whole performance, especially during the 12 minute &quot;Machine Gun&quot;.<br />Backed by Buddy Miles on bass and Billy Cox on drums Hendrix went for a much more blues oriented tone than usual.  Blues was always an evident influence during his time with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but during this live performance he seems to dig deeper into the genre.  Buddy Miles also got the chance to take over vocal duty during the songs &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;We gotta live together&quot; which do not dissapoint.  <br />My only gripe with the album is the missing dialogue between Hendrix and the audience.  The only time we really hear Jimi speak is for a short few seconds before or after a song, and even then it just doesn't feel right.  Instead of fading in and out between songs, the album should of been a complete performance, dialogue and all.  But ultimately, this doesn't damage the quality of the album.<br />If you're a Hendrix fan that has been debating on whether or not to pick up &quot;Band Of Gypsys&quot; don't delay any longer.  The Band of Gypsys had the ability to be simply put amazing, unfortunately Jimi was taken early.  But this small window into their amazing potential is enough for any rock fan to be satisfied.
B000066NW0|5.0|Listen, the rating thing only let me vote from 5 stars, if i could have i would have made this infinity! this is the most amazing cd anybody would ever buy! if u dont have it, u HAVE to get it!

6305508550|5.0|Rather simple, yet very funny film for those who work in an office.  Great characters.  Cult-like following (like Fletch, Swingers, etc.)
B00005JKNF|4.0|Robert Altman always weaves more characters in and out of a story than most directors could handle in a decade.  He is the master at this; and his films have a look all their own.  The acting in this picture is stellar.  Many have lauded Maggie Smith, but she still makes me laugh when applause is given of a musical number and she says, &quot;Oh don't encourage him.&quot;  Then to see her cackle when Ryan Phillipe gets tea poured in his crotch is a sheer pleasure.  Cindy Wilson is again marvelous with a multi-layered performance.  Helen Mirren's controlled performance is breathtaking.  Even Bob Balaban as the perverse Hollywood director is flits about wonderfully.<br />The DVD version offers a tremendous amount of bonus material.  It shows a lot about how Altman works to see the scenes that were edited out, and there are a great many.  I particularly enjoyed the one where Jennings (Alan Bates), the oh so proper butler, is pouring wine into a bottle, tastes it appreciately, and then knocks over the bottle accidentally and cracks up as the scene is cut.  It's a great little moment to enjoy.<br />This film is a bit a slow, but we can't always be in a hurry, now, can we?  I enjoyed it in the theatre, and think the DVD version enhances the movie experience immensely.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Having watched 2/3rds of the movie I took a break, which obviosly  wasn't the intention of the producers of the DVD. With no chapters, fast forward from the start was the only choice in reaching the point I stopped. Had I wanted a tape, I would have bought a tape. Result? Threw the DVD in the garbage, film concidered uninteresting. I won't buy any other Universal DVD's either, if they really don't know the difference between the DVD and tape format. I'll stick to companies that do.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Wonderful film, strong performances by an interesting cast.  Joe Welch does steal the film, but one correction.  In his review Heath McEwan says that Welch \\"defended Josephy McCarthy during the 1954 anti communist witch hunts.\\"  Of course this is wrong: Welch defended the Army in the Army-McCarthy hearings and is often credited -- in his defense of his associate Fred Fisher -- for starting the process by which McCarthy was exposed and brought down.  Welch was a honorable man who deserves to have this set right.  At any rate, a very good film.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is easily Nirvana's best album.  Don't get me wrong, all their other ones are great, but this one is different.  It's more alternative than the other albums.  Just listen to Heart Shaped Box, Pennyroyal Tea, and Dumb.  But it's got songs that showcase all the sides of Nirvana.  Songs like Milk It and Scentless Apprentice are raw and grungy.  All Apologies and Serve the Servants are poppy and melodic.  Very Ape and Tourette's are hardcore punk rockers.  And I just love the lyrics.  They're so bleak and I can relate to how Kurt was feeling when he wrote these (&quot;Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old&quot; &quot;I think I'm dumb, or maybe just happy&quot;)  My favorite songs are All Apologies, Serve the Servants, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, Dumb, Scentless Apprentice, Pennyroyal Tea, and Francis Farmer will Have Her Revenge on Seattle.  If you're used to Nirvana, circa Nevermind, you might have trouble getting into this.  But it's worth it.  Get these Nirvana Albums in the following order: Unplugged in N.Y. Nevermind, Incesticide, In Utero, and then Bleach.  I haven't bought From the Muddy Banks... yet, but if it's got Nirvana on it, it's gotta be good!
B000000OAN|5.0|Freddie Mercury said once that his two biggest influences were Jimi Hendrix and Liza Minelli. That says everything about this CD, which is a mix of styles that would have seemed impossibly different had Mr. Mercury and company not taught the rest of us just how well they go together. In \\"Death on Two Legs,\\" the album opens with the rough-edged, loud rock and roll that made Queen a Top-40 favorite in the 70's and 80's. It is closely followed by \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon,\\" a lilting feminine romp that celebrates idleness. The combination produces a surprising flavor I've never tasted anywhere else. This band is one of a very special kind. And this CD is perhaps the best example of their talent.
B000004C0Y|1.0|The quality of this addtion is very poor and it is not near as good as the Family autherized copy.  It is not centered right and some seens are out of focus and I was very disappointed.  I have searched for the better copy and have not been able to find it.  If you have a copy please e-mail me thank you (I have a copy on VHS)
B000065U1N|5.0|To the other reviewer who gave this movie one star because it was &quot;all action&quot;, I would like to respond that this movie was not meant to have a storyline like &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;.  The movie was adapted from Bowden's book &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; which gives a HISTORICAL description of events which took place in 1993.<br />This movie is one of the most historically accurate war movies ever made, far surpassing Saving Private Ryan or even Band of Brothers.  It's attention to historical detail is amazing.  I'm sorry you didn't catch the story line; it was: &quot;We go through this for you, and you don't even bother to thank us&quot;.<br />My advice is not to watch this movie for entertainment (although it can certainly provide that).  This is the real story of what happened to American soldiers in Mogadishu, 1993.
0446310786|5.0|First read this one in High School as required reading for English, and with no regrets.  Timeless classic.
044022425X|3.0|I decided to read the 4th book in hopes that the author's pace would heighten and her wordiness would lessen.  500 pages later, the plot and the characters finally began to pick up.  I believe that the author couldn't decide whether this series should be in the romance section or a work of historical fiction.  Too bad she chose the former route.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the one CD that finally shows the true talent among women coming into the rock scene.  We have been bombarded with the normal \\"male is the only metal-maker\\" and \\"pop is the only way,\\" but this is the album that has made the change.  It is one of the best CDs out right now...every track is filled with passion and talent.  Avril Lavigne's voice is incredible at every high and low note.  She is an amazing artist and the \\"Let Go\\" record is a must buy.  This is an album you cannot and will not get tired of.  Avril needs to be supported to the fullest.
B00000IBRX|5.0|I fell upon this while watching the sci-fi channel, and thought that it looked interesting. It ended up being my new favorite movie! It had a very distinct plot, yet I do not recommend this for children under 12. 'What Dreams May Come' follows the quest of a man who dies and goes to heaven. When he finds out that his wife has commited suicide, he ventures off the the underworld to persuade his wife to forgive herself so she can join him in heaven.
B00005LMBK|2.0|This cd was a disapointment to me. Only song i liked was Clint Eastwood. The singing is ok at some parts but the music mostly[disappoints].
B000066NW0|5.0|Whenever I first heard of Avril Lavigne and heard her song &quot;Complicated&quot; I knew right away, that she was gonna make it.Whenever I bought this cd, I found a lot of talent, and great skills that this young women has. I cannot believe that she is my age and has so much talent in her. Whenever I heard her song &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; I knew right away that this girl was my new idol! Just how she shows herself and how different she is from all these other young women singers, she stands out the most. Her voice is so unique and I cant stop listening to this cd because of it. She really stands out from the rest and I know that this girl will make it! I will always stick by her as a fan and whenever she comes to my state for a tour I will buy tickets! So good luck to Avril and if you dont have this cd I really do recommend that you get it! You will be amazed by this girls talent.
B000066NW0|5.0|The debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; from Avril Lavigne is now in stores all over the nation.  When I first heard her name, I thought something that was probably in the minds of countless others: &quot;Who?&quot;  Then, after I was informed, I had another thought: &quot;Oh, great, another pop chick singer.&quot;<br />Normally, I'm not into alternative, I enjoy rock (acoustic, hard, punk, etc.).  There's something different about &quot;Let Go.&quot;  There's actually emotion and feeling behind the lyrics, written by Avril Lavigne herself.  All too often, I hear songs with mushy lyrics that are just playing to make money off of soft-hearted people.  The songs in &quot;Let Go&quot; have a realism to it, they aren't empty words.  The only way to describe them is raw, emotional, and real.  You can feel that these lyrics are straight from Avril's heart.  That's what impacts me most about this album.  Of course, Avril Lavigne's fantastic vocal ability doesn't hurt....<br />The songs, themselves, have life not only in the words, but in the music performed by Avril's band, and even she herself accompanies with her own guitar-playing.  The first radio single off of &quot;Let Go&quot; is called &quot;Complicated,&quot; and it's currently climbing the charts to the top.  Of course, it has good reason to.  &quot;Complicated&quot; isn't just catchy, it has staying power, as do other tracks on this CD.  This particular selection is a great tune with an acoustic feel.  Several other songs from &quot;Let Go&quot; really stand out in my mind.  Songs like &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; &quot;Unwanted,&quot; and &quot;Mobile&quot; are my main CD picks.  They are a bit more rockin' and the lyrics are especially emotional and grabbing (which is common trend through the entire CD).  Another track, aptly titled &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; is fun, fast-paced, &quot;punk&quot; style tune featuring a great story about a guy and a girl who are complete opposites, but meant for each other, while songs like &quot;I'm With You,&quot; &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; not only are powerful, revealing the emotional vunerability of people in love as well as display Avril's maturity, with some of the most powerful lyrics I've heard in my short career of songwriting,  they show the true ability of Avril's amazing voice, too.<br />So to recap, Avril Lavigne's full length debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; covers all the bases, with taste.  Great singing, great lyrics combines to equal a great CD that is worth buying.  Unlike pop singers from the recent years who are known for their image, Avril Lavigne is quite different in her focus, the songs reach out.  Without hype, without image, just raw music.  With this album being her first and only being 17, you know she's in store for a great musical career.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is hitting everyone with a BIG BANG!  And just in time for the 4th of July!  Avril recently dropped her new album, 'Let Go' and the fans are going to the extreme to get a copy, and it's no wonder, sense this Canadian does know how to Rock.  From &quot;Complicated&quot; all the way to &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; Avril is giving Teens a new reason to be themselves and it is defiantly paying off.  In the First single from &quot;Let Go&quot; Avril expresses just how &quot;Complicated&quot; all the posers of the world can be, letting them know that 'being somebody else 'round everyone else'' can be so 'frustrating'!  Skip to the next track on the CD and you may start to feel a little guilty for blowing off the 'Sk8er Boi' that might have asked you out.  In &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; Avril sings about a girl listening to her friends and not giving that baggy clothes boi the time of day and soon regreting it when she turns on the TV and sees the Sk8er Boi 'Rocking up MTV'.  I think it is safe to assume that Avril Lavigne is going to be the next BIG thing for sure.

B000066NW0|5.0|Place the album 'Let Go' in your CD player, and be ready to be transported into the wild world of Avril Lavigne.  From the edgy rock of &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; to the melodic tune of &quot;I'm With You&quot;, skater chick Avril Lavigne breaks the barrier of sappy ballads and teen pop, digs down into the core of it all, and delivers music's heart and soul straight out.<BR>   A 17-year-old native of Napanee, Ontario, Avril says it all in her debut album, 'Let Go.' &quot;I'm just coming out and I'm going to clearly be myself-I write what I feel, I never worry what others think,&quot; says Avril.   <BR>   The rock-driven, guitar-riffed sounds on the first album have turned some heads to, and from this soloist.  Though Avril's punk/skater style has had some wondering, her image is just defining everything she is; emphasizing the foremost theme of her album.            <BR>   With Avril's striking lyrical ability, she captures her very own visualization on particular situations and portrays real-to-life scenarios all in the matter of 4 minutes.  How many artists can do THAT?  <BR>   Whether it was written or co-written by the teen herself, every song on 'Let Go' has Avril's solid contribution.  You don't have to listen closely to hear the message that is clearly being said in every one of Avril's songs.  Play it cool.  Be real.  Be you.  Though these straightfoward words are in fact what a normal person should be, Avril chooses to remain &quot;Anything But Ordinary.&quot;  Everything Avril is standing for can easily be put into three words: Rock on Avril!

B000065U1N|2.0|Since Saving Private Ryan's opening D-Day scene hammered audiences five years ago, Hollywood has taken that movie's brutality a couple steps further with war films and miniseries (\\"Band of Brothers\\") that are, essentially, 2 hour battle sequences.  Certainly, it's important to show modern audiences just how horrific war can be.  But to do it to such numbing effect ends up having the reverse effect upon viewers.  We become desensitized to even the most shocking violence, and films that are meant to be anti-war are morphed into intensely graphic action films.<br />Nothing illustrates this point better than Black Hawk Down.  While Ridley Scott's film is masterful in its technical details, and its ability to illustrate the tactics of modern warfare and how they can fall apart, it fails to establish any real sense of character or story.  We concentrate on a cast of maybe 20 or 30 soldiers as they participate in the disastrous 1993 raid in Somalia.  But because there are so many characters, and because their introductions are so brief and indistinct, it's impossible to involve yourself in the personal stakes of the raid itself.<br />Of course, we knew nothing about the characters in Ryan before they went into battle, but we learned about them during the battle and had the added context of just what was at stake (namely, the free world itself).  Here, the purpose is somewhat questionable, and that works against the audience relating to the characters.<br />So, without any real attachment to any of the men involved, we watch for 90 minutes as they endure hell on Earth.  But keeping track of it all is so difficult that eventually you give up, and the resulting barrage of blank warfare feels like piling on.  There's really no point in watching it, unless you really enjoy watching warfare.  In that sense, you could call it Warnography, because it's war without context.  And that's too bad, because the story behind Black Hawk Down is extraordinarily compelling.  But that's losthere in a haze of gunfire.  Then again, that might be your thing.  <br />(Note: When the film is over, we see a screen telling us that 19 Americans died and that over 1,000 Somalis died.  How did the Somalis die?  Were they all killed by Americans?  Did warring factions kill each other?  It's critical information that's left out, and makes Black Hawk Down more frustrating as a result.)
B00005QW5X|4.0|Hedwig was my favorite movie of 2001, and I was excited for the DVD. All those deleted scenes to see! And I was sure that John Cameron Mitchell would dish out a fantastic commentary.<br />The DVD is good - there's a fantastic &quot;making of&quot; documentary that's 80 minutes long, filled with fantastic tidbits and interviews with everyone from one of the folks who first invested in Hedwig on stage, all the way to John Cameron Mitchells parents. Great little feature documentary.<br />The deleted scenes are interesting...so many scenes with Phyllis, Hedwig's manager, were cut out of the final film. And it's fun to watch the actor who played the young Hansel do his bed dances. Hilarious.<br />But the commentary with Mitchell and the cinemetography (or director of photography...can't remember which), was flat and dull. There were a few interesting tidbits revealed (trivia: what had Michael Pitt been eating before his and John's pivotal make out scene?), but on the whole, the commentary is bland and uninteresting....which is surprising, given the fantastic flavor and excitement of this movie.<br />So, I give the movie five stars, but the DVD only three...which evens out to four. Worth your time if you're a Hedwig fan, but if you're not sure about the movie, this DVD probably isnt' going to convince you.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I was deeply moved by this movie.  The story of a woman trying to make it in Hollywood, it is one of the greater character studies I have ever seen.  When the final act unfolded, and I realized what I had been privy to, I started squirming in my seat, almost embarrassed and apologetic that I had been such an intruder into this woman's head. <br />Naomi Watts was truly amazing.  If the Oscars actually rewarded talent, she would have walked away with one.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko was a great movie. I was stunned by the concept and execution when I first watched it on VHS. Then I got the DVD and had my brain blown.<br />First off, let me just say that the DVD is packed with features: two commentary tracks, dozens of deleted scenes, the full website (which has crucial epilogue stories, and is only accessible online with difficult trivia paswords), full copy from the book that plays such a vital role in the story and so SO much more. The Donnie Darko DVD is how DVDs should be: filled with features, all of which enhance the film.<br />So, first things first: the director's commentary is AMAZING. If you had any questions after watching the movie (which most everyone did), the Richard Kelly addresses most of them...with humor and charisma. Jake Glyndenhall is also part of the director's commentary, and he's very funny. I especially loved his joke about &quot;FOUR MILLION DOLLARS! We only had FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!&quot; His groundskeeper Willy impression was pretty spot-on, too.<br />The other commentary isn't quite as good...mostly just cast and crew chatting over the film, and Producer Drew Barrymore rambling about whatever.<br />The deleted scenes provide some incredibly important story components, addressing Donnie's medication, who Frank is, and so much more. I couldn't BELIEVE that some of these scenes were cut. Some of them are just such integral aspects of the storyline....and I think you can feel their absence in the film. Richard Kelly provides commentary for these, too, explaining why he had to cut each scene.<br />Reading &quot;The Philosophy of Time Travel&quot; book that's referenced in the film is a great advantage towards understanding the story, as well. It's a little hard to read all the text on your screen...but well worth the squinting. It's clear that Richard Kelly put a LOT of work into this story, and it's nice to see all that work in one place.<br />Perhaps my favorite part of the DVD were the &quot;Cunning Visions&quot; infomercials. You have to turn the commentary on to appreciate the sheer comedic genious of these things. So so funny. I also recommend reading the website stories before watching the infomercials. It'll all make sense that way. Regardless: &quot;I'M NOT AFRAID ANYMORE!&quot; HA!<br />In sum, this DVD enhances and explains this wonderful movie, actually improving on the original film. Highly recommended, especially to those who just didn't quite understand what happened in the movie. If you liked the movie the first time around, you'll be as floored as I was with this DVD, and understand why I think this is probably the best DVD I've ever seen. So many features, such great commentary, and beautiful design. BRAVO!ons&quot; infomercials. You have to turn the commentary on to appreciate the sheer comedic genious of these things. So so funny.

B000001FDQ|5.0|I dont write many reviews but I had to put up a review for my fav guitar album ever. I'm a seasoned guitarist and grew up idolizing Eddie Van Halen, this was until I heard Yngwie play in Alcatrazz. I was converted over. Then I heard this 1st solo cd and was blown away. Better than anything Ive ever heard Eddie play. A bit different styles between the both, but I love the fast technical classical style that Yngwie has. To this day, this is the best guitar album I've ever heard. It still blows me away. The singing and production sorta [stinks] but the songwriting and musicianship is phenominal.

B00005JKL8|3.0|In 1998, with \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" Steven Spielberg raised the bar for all that would follow in the genre of \\"War\\" films (just as his colleague, George Lucas, had done some years earlier for Science Fiction with the original \\"Star Wars\\").  Spielberg put the reality into war on the silver screen, and since then nothing less has been acceptable.  Not to say that \\"reality\\" alone makes for a successful film; other elements must be factored in, and in the final analysis, each film will succeed or fail on it's own individual merits, reality aside.  One that does succeed, and for a number of reasons, is \\"Behind Enemy Lines,\\" directed by John Moore, which delivers that expected reality, but offers a lot more along the way, as well.<br />On a Christmas Day routine recon flight over Bosnia, Navy pilot Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), and his navigator, Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson), notice some activity in one of the \\"demilitarized\\" zones (which also happens to be a \\"no-flight\\" zone), and summarily take it upon themselves to investigate.  Their efforts immediately cause more than a little consternation in certain quarters, however, and very quickly their mission goes south with dire results.  Having seen (and photographed, no less) things not meant for their eyes, they find themselves on the wrong end of hostile missile, and their plane goes down.<br />Having ejected in time, Burnett finds himself on the ground, alone, and in hostile territory.  He manages to call in his position, but due to the muddled and convoluted politics of the moment, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) is prevented from sending help in straight away, which leaves Burnett for a time to his own devices for survival in unknown terrain while in harm's way.  But Burnett, a seven year veteran, is determined to make it, and to make this mission mean something-- which it will, if only he can get the proof of what he's seen back safely.  And that means beating the enemy at their own game, and on their turf.<br />Initially, Moore's film seems destined to become just one more of the brutally realistic and action packed war stories that have evolved since Spielberg's \\"Ryan,\\" albeit a good one, from all indications early on.  The story is solid and there's plenty of action, all of which is carried off nicely by star Owen Wilson, but by the half-way point there's nothing much that sets it apart from the usual action/drama survival film.  It plays out, in fact, like a cross between \\"Enemy At the Gates\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  Then something happens-- and it takes a turn that kicks it up a notch and takes it beyond anything those other films offered and/or delivered.  <br />Once the action surrounding Burnett's dilemma is established, Moore sharpens his focus on the more personal aspects of the story, and it suddenly becomes more than just a quest for survival; it becomes the study of a man on a mission, a man with a goal and a purpose, an individual against whom the odds are decidedly stacked.  And by infusing that decisive human element into the story, it elevates the film to a higher level and achieves the kind of success never realized by either of the aforementioned films, in part because of their failure to effect that very same level of human drama that sets this film apart.<br />As Burnett, Owen Wilson is very effective, turning in a performance that is quite natural and affecting.  Wilson has something of a quirky appearance and a rather mesmerizing tone and manner of speaking that gives him a charismatic screen presence and makes him extremely accessible and convincing.  He manages to avoid the trappings of the stereotypical \\"fly-boy\\" character, checking his ego and machismo at the door, and it makes Burnett very real and believable.  It also makes the development of his character-- his actions, reactions and attitudes-- convincing as the story progresses, as well as lending credibility to the overall film.<br />Hackman, on the other hand, falls directly into stereotypewith his portrayal of Reigart; this is a character we've seen time and time again in just about every war film to come down the pike.  But to his credit, Hackman does it extremely well, which is the beauty of watching an actor of his caliber perform.  He's the consummate professional, and even when covering familiar ground, he has the ability to make it seem fresh and, most importantly, entertaining.  Hackman is a gifted actor with a tremendous range; this character-- by it's inherent nature-- simply has nothing to offer by way of a challenge.  Reigart is merely a character that serves a purpose, and Hackman realizes that intent to the fullest.<br />The supporting cast includes Charles Mark Whitfield (Rodway), Joaquim de Almeida (Piquet), David Keith (O'Malley), Olek Krupa (Lokar), Vladimir Mashkov (Tracker) and Marko Igonda (Bazda).  A film that offers some insights into politics, as well as the human condition, it manages to be thought provoking while delivering some terrific action, drama and solid entertainment.  Worthy to be called one of \\"Ryan's \\" more successful offspring, \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is the watermelon of war films; it takes some doing to get through the rind, but once you get to the good part, it's pretty sweet, and more than worth the effort.  And that's the magic of the movies.
B000066NW0|5.0|theres just one word to describe Avril...&quot;Real&quot; . shes so true to herself..and shes not afraid to be herself. she doesnt care what people think of her. and thats the way everyone should be. Her songs are about everyday life..and how the world works, and just how everything is these days. She also writes about her experiences in life , for example &quot;skater Boi&quot; its about her turning down a skater boy just because her friends didnt like his apperance, and then he ended up being a super star. In my opinion..i think shes the best music artist around. She writes her own songs..plays them..and sings them. Now that's a real artist if you ask me. Her album is soo great. I love everyone of her songs! I mean..she didnt even try to be come big..she just did. She has amazing talent.I mean..i knew about her before her video came out..and before her album came out..and to see her go this far already..just makes me proud of her! it might sound crazy but its true! i mean i havent even met her yet..but i feel like i know her, and i just feel really proud that she has gone this far already. i guess thats all i have to say...chow!
B00004Z459|1.0|I purchased this CD hoping to hear some good music from an obviously over-rated group... of course, as expected, I was highly disappointed. The lead singer's screaming voice is enough to annoy anyone after a few songs, the sound of the band is nothing special, and it was just... boring. Every song sounded just about the same - if you flip through the tracks, you'll see what I mean. The lyrics are extremely unoriginal and dull, and frankly, I don't really care about hearing all their problems (that's all they sing about). Linkin Park is just another of those mass-produced group made to make money. Don't even bother buying their CDs. If you have to listen to something of theirs, download Points of Authority or something that's bearable... and if you've already bought the CD, I suggest chucking it into your swimming pool.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album is beyond words. Or that's just because I'm too lazy to write a good review of it; I think every else has basically covered it all. <br />So...<br />BUY THIS CD. NOW. ^_^
1559277246|3.0|I adore Janet Evanovich, so much that I buy her books in hardback and still buy the audiobook.  Hard Eight was long on funny, short on plot, and I am ready for Stephanie to grow up.  I loved the characters, but the mystery was WEAK.  Still, it was better than most.  Truthfully, I have very high expectations of Janet Evanovich.  <br />Of course, none of this keeps me from looking forward to the Christmas novel to come out.  Keep 'em coming!!!
B00005V0X5|4.0|Since I originally bought this cd back in 1988, I had hoped they would rerecord it. You could always hear the complicated riffs, but couldn't bear to listen due to aweful quality. The title track, Killing Is My Business and Looking Down The Cross have been long time favorites of mine. To hear them remastered is awesome. <BR> This cd never got the recognition it deserved. Every lick, every bass note, every beat and every lyric are clear and intense. My interest was peaked with this cd when the Cryptic Writings comic books were released with the story line for every song on this cd and a few off of Peace Sells. To my knowledge, only 4 issues were released. Once again, with this rerelease I am back on the &quot;Killing&quot; wagon. <BR> I do no feel this is Megadeth's best...Rust In Peace will always be my favorite, but I'd put it in the top 3. Lots of bands play speed metal or fast paced music, but to play as fast as Megadeth does and as complicated of riffs blows my mind. If you're a long time Megadeth fan or into fast metal, this cd is for you. I do not recommend it for those who are new fans...Risk, The World Needs A Hero &amp; Cryptic Writings lovers. I too, like these cd's, but if these are all you know, you may find this cd is too much for your fragile ears. This is Megadeth raw (but clear) and out of control! If you wish to hear the uncensored version of These Boots, you'll need to consult your local music download site...it's out there, I have it. I think it's funny they put it on there censored because it's like the censored version of Metallica's &quot;So What&quot; cover...kind of like morse code.
6300181553|5.0|Fred Astaire once was asked who his favorite dance partner was in all his films, and half jokingly stated...Bing Crosby!  HOLIDAY INN was one of two movies the two stars made together and the chemistry between the two is evident in this film.  A basic Hollywood story (based on a concept by song writer extraordinaire Irving Berlin) of boy finds girl,boy loses girl, and boy wins back girl.  Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are two-thirds of a night club act trio in which their act is a song and dance routine of two guys vying for the affection of a girl. This night club routine is hilarious in which Bing Crosby croons that he could win a girl through his singing, and then Fred Astaire counteracts that he can win a girl through his dancing. This is a clever device because it sets up the whole basic premise of the film. Bing Crosby quits the act hoping to be a farmer.  However, it doesn't work out and then renovates the farm into a nightclub only opened on holidays.  Hence, the title of the film and nightclub HOLIDAY INN. Bing Crosby hires a girl to help him with his act (Marjorie Reynolds), then Fred Astaire steals her away...and Bing Crosby must find a way to win her back..etc. Great Irving Berlin  songs, great dance numbers (i.e. Fred Astaire's solo dance routine with firecrackers) and excellent comedic moments. One of the best musicals of the 40's.<br />Note: One downside scene in the film when one of the holidays being celebrated at the Inn is Abraham Lincoln's birthday. There is a &quot;blackface&quot; routine reminicient of the minstral shows of vaudeville. Bing Crosby and Marjorie Reynolds participate in blackface also.  Some may find this part of the film offensive.  During a revival of the film at a college a few years back, a friend of mine stated that some audience members booed the scene.  At the time this film was made, there was no harm intended.

0440219078|4.0|Lois Lowry, The Giver (Laurel-Leaf, 1993)<br /><br />There are a few books released every year that gain both wide-ranging critical acclaim and deep popular support. They are few and far between, and fewer still when the book in questions stirs up as much controversy as has The Giver. Personally, I don't see what all the controversy is about; everything in here that could possibly be seen as questionable is an echo of a canonized piece of science fiction (the two books that most come to mind are Logan's Run and Brave New World). Yet, as soon as you try to boil down Nolan or Huxley for the kidlit crowd, hackles get raised. I just don't get it.<br /><br />A distillation this may be, but it is in the same way that Things Fall Apart is a distillation of Greek tragedy; there's enough there for the author to have worn her heart on her sleeve, but the themes are places within a different framework of characters well-enough drawn that no one's ever going to be accusing Lois Lowry of plagiarism (one hopes). The story centers on Jonas, on the brink of turning twelve at the beginning of the novel, in a utopian society where there's no crime, no poverty, etc. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for the colony; he's something of an uber-consultant, the person to whom the ruling council turns when they come across something they have no way to understand. For Jonas, and those Receivers before him, store the collective memories of those things which their society has managed to forget over the time they've been apart from the rest of the world (never actually stated, but by the way the characters talk about the world previously, it's been hundreds, if not thousands, of years). Lowry sets things up exceptionally, and there's a wonderful revelation about halfway through the book that alone is worth the price of admission (when Jonas figures out what seeing-beyond really is-Lowry has managed throughout the beginning of the book to lull the reader into such a state that the reader hasn't even realized what it is that's missing). While that's the only real surprise here, the predictability of much of what comes after is forgivable enough. Lowry sets up a number of easy endings, none of which she takes, and the predictable pieces to the puzzle are all part of that setup. Just because the end result could have been done better doesn't mean it's not good as it stands. Highly recommended. ****he reader hasn't even realized what it is that's missing).

B0000020C4|5.0|The cast on this CD is wonderful for the most part, although I would never call it a &quot;dream cast.&quot; I just saw Les Miz on Broadway, and the only characters that are better performed on this CD are Fantine (by far) and probably Michael Ball as Marius. And I am a VERY intent listener. I know I'm going to upset a lot of people by saying this, but Colm Wilkerson's high range is ANNOYING. For those of you who think that he is the &quot;only&quot; Valjean, do yourself a favor and go see J. Mark McVey on Broadway. You will have a COMPLETELY different opinion on how Valjean should be sung and who sings Valjean best. Trust me. Phillip Quast is awesome on this CD. He was by far my favorite Javert until I saw the guy who's name I can't find because he's not in the cast anymore on broadway. He is the guy who before had played the lead in Jekyll and Hyde. He was better than Quast. The eponine on this CD is also very good. Diana Kaarina, who is on Broadway right now, was better also. I never liked &quot;On My Own,&quot; until I heard her do it. Anyway, its the best Les Mis recording there is, and I gave it 4 stars just for being the best musical in histroy, no matter who is singing it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok everyone....if you don't have this cd you need to go out and get this cd.  It is like the best CD there is.  The combination of rock mixed with rap give the band a unique and chill sound.  Come on, like everyone has at least heard a Linkin Park song- the best one is definitely &quot;In the End.&quot;  I knew that song would be a hit before it was released as a single.  But seriously, Linkin Park applies to a wide range of music interests, so EVERYONE needs to GO out and support the best band I've ever heard to date!
B00003CXA2|4.0|... I believe that it was made for us aging baby boomers. The film had outrageous explanations for everything from the smiley face (Have a nice day!) to \\"... Happens!\\" The world did indeed revolve around Forrest Gump. It was not political commentary or making fun of handicapped people..it was fairly obvious that she was supposed to have had one of the first cases and they had not developed the neat acronym yet.<br />Everyone is entitled to their opinion. If you like movie magic, are a baby boomer and have not seen this film, throw down your dough, make some popcorn, relax, turn up the TV... enjoy the story and music - just have a few hankies around - you will probably need them!
630382790X|5.0|Houston, we have a problem.  Those five words sent chills through the NASA space center in April, 1970.  Apollo 13 had just lifted off on its voyage to the moon.  On board were Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert. Approximately halfway through the voyage, an explosin rocks the ship.  One of the oxygen tanks  burst as it was being stirred. The explosion crippled the ship and left the astronauts unable to land on the moon, and put their return to earth in jeopardy.  Tom Hanks (Lovell), Bill Paxton (Haise), and Kevin Bacon (Swigert) give riveting performances as the astronauts, and Ed Harris gives an Oscar-caliber performance as Gene Kranz.  Gary Sinise is also excellent as Ken Mattingly, originally scheduled to be on the misson, but was kept off due to  exposue to the measles.  However, Mattingly still played an important role in bringing the astronauts back to earth by working in the simulator to develop a plan to conserve the engegy aboard the L.E.M. so the computers could be powered up for re-entry.  Ron Howard does an excellent job with state of the art special effects which bring this apollo mission to life. Combining excellent acting, historical correctness, and edge-of-your-seat excitement, Apollo 13 is worthy of inclusion in any video collection.
B000066NW0|5.0|Hey everyone! Avril Lavigne is the most awesome thing to happen to the world since Madonna started the Women's Movements of the 80's! Avril has the sassy voice of Alanis Morriset, with the soul-searching lyrics of Jewel and Michelle Branch. She is one of the only female-fronted rock groups out there. She is climbing up the charts everywhere. Everyone needs this CD if you are into any type of rock music! Avril Lavigne is alongside bands like Candy..., and soloist like Michelle Branch, Jewel, and Alanis Morriset! If you fit into this catergory, buy her CD: Let Go right now! Tracks that are my favorite are ''Things I'll Never Say'' and ''Nobody's Fool'' in which she does a tyte rap about conforming! Love you all, and buy her CD!<BR>Also recommended: NickleBack, New Found Glory, Brodie (a tyte punk rock group from Seattle), Metallica, Green Day, Incubus, Saves the Day, and on and on and on.
630575067X|5.0|I have been a Star Wars Fan since the first movie came out in 1977, and The Phantom Menace upholds the great tradition set forth in the earlier films.  This movie takes place 30 years before the original Star Wars.  The Federation has placed a blockade around the planet of Naboo.  Two Jedi knights, played by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, are sent to negotiate a peace betwen the Naboo and the Federation, but instead the Federation tries to kill the Jedi.  The Jedi, along with Queen Amidala and Jar Jar Binks are able to escape.  However, their ship develops problems with its hyperdrive, and they are forced to land on the planet of Tattooine.  It is here that Qui-Gon Jin, played by Neeson, discovers Anikin Skywalker.  Qui-Gon is convinced that this young boy has the power to become a Jedi.  However, they cannot leave Tattooine until their ship is repaired.  Anikin enters the pod races to try to win a bet Qui-Gon placed with Waddo, a trader who happens to have a hyperdrive.  Anikin wins the race and Waddo somewhat reluctantly releases Anikin from his slavery to the custody of Qui-gon.  With their ship now repaired, the group heads to Courissant, a planet-sized city.  Here, Queen Amidala pleads her case to the Senate.  Also unknown to the Jedi, A Sith, Darth Maul, has followed them as well.  The two Jedi eventually meet Maul in a fierce battle. In the climactic ending battle, the Naboo and Gungans join forces to repel the federation attack.  As is the case with most movies, this was much better on the big screen, but the video version is still worth watching, too.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I'm a fan of computer animated movies, and when I saw this one, I really got into it.  The first time I watched this movie, I was blown away.  I couldn't believe the accuracy of the characters, their face movements, the sound of their clothings, and surroundings.  Eddie Murphy did a really good job doing &quot;donkey.&quot;  He is really funny, the way he talks is incredible.  <BR>The movie is kind of based on the &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; beginning fairy tale, and has a lot of characters from all the fairy tales, like snow-white &amp; the 7 dwarfs, cinderella, and so on. <BR>It's very fun to watch.  Pay attention to the donkey's face while Shrek talks.  Pay attention to their voices and the movements of their faces &amp; expressions.  You'll be amazed.  Pay attention to the details.<BR>I love it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's cd is an all out amazing attempt at getting herself into the race of punk these days.  With competitors such as thursday, taking back sunday, something corprate, dashboard confessional ect. its mostly a man's world.  Avril is one of the first people I have seen to combine punk without making it pop.  Although it is becomming main stream, it is only because of the new population of today's listeners interested (finally) in some real music rather than boybands and pop divas.  Avril has ALOT of potential and is going to move up rather quickly!
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie is one of the all time greats.  It inspired me so much to become more than I am and that is rare in film making.  It is truely a passionate film with some very touching and some extremely violent scenes.  It is long but you would never no so by watching it.  The time just flies bye.  The score really gives it that extra push and the acting is superb.  Completely fantastic.
006441034X|5.0|Exciting, funny, and poignant in turn, this book is consistently charming - and there's never a dull moment.<BR>Sophie Hatter lives in the town of Market Chipping. She is the eldest of three daughters, and feels that this circumstance is certain to result in a boring life for her. How wrong she was! A curse is placed on Sophie by the Witch of the Waste, changing her from an eighteen year old girl to an old lady. Feeling that she has nothing to lose now, Sophie slips away from her hat shop and heads off to seek her fortune. Outside Market Chipping, she encounters a dog, a scarecrow . . . and Howl's castle. Howl is a mysterious wizard whose castle drifts about the hills outside the town. He is much feared by the peeople of Market Chipping, not least because he is said to devour the hearts of young girls. Sophie enters the castle and meets Howl's fire demon, Calcifer. Calcifer recognises that Sophie is under a curse, and offers to lift it from her if she finds a way to break his contract with Howl. Sophie agrees, and stays in the castle as Howl's cleaning lady so she can hunt for the information she needs. Then Sophie meets Howl . . . and gets drawn deeper and deeper into the lives of Howl, Calcifer, and Michael, Howl's apprentice. Howl, too, is under a curse from the Witch of the Waste. Can he avoid the curse? And what will happen to him and the kingdom of Ingary if the Witch cannot be defeated?<BR>The characters in Howl's Moving Castle are wonderful. Howl is vain and cowardly, a slob and a \\"slitherer-outer\\" - but as the book continues, we learn that he is far from being the evil wizard he would like everyone to believe he is. Much of the poignancy of the story comes from learning just why Howl is the way he is. Sophie is brave, determined, and kind, but capable of being very fierce. She is far from stupid, but she is rather naive at times. Her realisation of the freedom that being an old lady offers her is delightful. The lesser characters are all distinctive, and very enjoyable, particularly Calcifer.<BR>I found the setting very well done, with enough detail to allow you to imagine it all satisfactorily, but never getting bogged down in description. The plot is a lot of fun, though it may be too subtle in some parts for younger readers to appreciate fully. It is highly imaginative, and moves along at a good pace. It is far from predictable, too; but by the end, everything is resolved satisfactorily. The problems of Sophie and her sisters, Howl, Calcifer, the dog, the scarecrow, and the kingdom, are all solved, and I felt really happy for the characters that they were.<BR>If this book is not already considered a classic, it deserves to be - and it's just as much fun for adults as it is for children.
B00003CX9E|5.0|For years I regarded Citizen Kane as a good but not great film, and I never really understood why critics and serious film buffs kept putting it top of the list.  Now I understand, thanks mostly to the Roger Ebert commentary on this DVD, which focuses on the technical, production and compositional aspects of the film.  Ebert's commentary on this disc is simply the best I have ever seen on a DVD--time and again Ebert points out and explains brilliant touches and conceptions most of us wouldn't have noticed on our own, and he does it in an earnest, non-condescending, explanatory way.  Illuminating and insightful.  The Bogdanovich commentary is from a different perspective.  It's a little too in-groupy, \\"me and Orson,\\" for my tastes, but it doesn't merely duplicate Ebert, and adds to my understanding and enjoyment of the movie, even if it's not the eye-opener that Ebert's commentary is.<br />The companion DVD-Documentary is also illuminating.  Now for the first time I understand Welles's strange lack of success in Hollywood, despite his reputed (and undoubted) genius.<br />This is the kind of DVD that could turn an ordinary person who just likes old movies into a raving, drooling, film buff.<br />Highly recommended.
038533558X|2.0|And it doesn't hold up to \\"Tell No One.\\"  He crams red herrings and double crosses to the point of failing any suspension of disbelief.  Are we really supposed to believe a father would essentially sell his son off to prison for $5000, and that the son would turn out to be a ruthless killer (with a penchant for breaking noses)who ends up having a heart of gold?  It's light summer reading- - -fast and with some excitment, but ultimately as light and airless as a summer dessert.  Pick up \\"Tell No ONe\\" instead.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne bes herself! She doesnt care what others think about how she dresses n acts! I love the music she plays. She writes all her lyrics and music and the best part about it is that her lyrics relate to her life!The songs on her album &quot;Let Go&quot; aren't about Love and the normal stuff that those pop people write about. Her lyrics get stuck in your head and keep you rockin!! I think she is the best because she isnt the normal girl and I can relate to her and her lyrics! Her CD is off the hook and you should buy it cuz she is gonna b #1!!
0316666343|5.0|I am a writer and avid reader who found The Lovely Bones to be one of the most exquisitely rendered stories that I've ever read. This is a riveting, up-all-night book with characters who grow and mature and live and die in heartbreakingly real and beautiful ways. I can not give Alice Sebold's first novel high enough praise.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I loved this cd. I actually bought it for my sister, but when I heard it, I had to go out and get a copy for myself.  Every song is AWESOME. Pink really showed that she is a versitile singer with this cd.  I love the collaborations with Linda Perry and Steven Tyler.  There is absolutely no way to pick a favorite song because they are all so good. Pink rocks!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|This was an OK movie, however, not deserving of the best picture award.  The acting was really good.  If people out there want to see the great films of last year, check out Monsters Ball and Mulholland Drive.  This picture is definitely worth seeing but not buying.
B00005NKK8|4.0|This is one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to, and what makes it so unique is the variety of music from different decades: the late 50's, the 60's, the 70's, and the early 80's. The music that gets to my heart, mind, and soul is that of the 60's; it'll always be my favorite. I enjoy watching movies very much, and it is the music that makes &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; an enjoyable one indeed (yes, I know -  Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump made it enjoyable as well). But even if you haven't seen the movie, you are sure to like this soundtrack - there is something here for just about everyone. And it has a bit of just about everything, too: folk, Motown, soul, and of course, rock-n-roll. The only thing preventing me from giving it five stars is that there are no Beatles or Stones songs included -what's the 60's without them? And it has no disco songs from the late 70's (oh, I know - that's SO disappointing!). Otherwise, this is a must-have; you'll be listening to it over and over again. Enjoy!
B000001E3V|5.0|First off, I think Eric Clapton's career has been like the Sin Curve...there are ups, and there are downs.   This is CERTAINLY one of the ups...this 2 CD set surpasses the classic \\"In Concert\\"...especially \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad\\"...anyone who says that the one of \\"In Concert\\" is superior ought to be shot....from the wah-wah intro to the solo which goes EVERYWHERE, this is truly the superior version.    Though there were better Dominos Shows, this is one of the best.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is one of the best cd yet i love it its wicked kool and its got its own style. sk8erboi is one of the best songs on there besides complicated. i love the whole cd its just the best the cd rocks and i love it.
0316666343|3.0|Newspaper and magazine reviewers do no one a favor when they over-hype a small book like this one. This novel is okay, but I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd known less about it and hadn't been primed for some sort of major literary miracle.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Back when &quot;Star Wars&quot; first came out (before we started adding numbers and additional titles to the films) I was entranced.  Here was something that had not been made in years -- a bigger-than-life Saturday matinee action hero film with good guys and bad guys.  Oh, on top of that it had truly amazing special effects.  The acting was not the greatest and some of the lines truly hackneyed, but other acting made up for it and the plot was whopping great fun.<br />Fast forward to The Star Was Phenomenon.<br />I went to see this movie (Star Wars 1:  The Phantom Menace) twice on the big screen.  I only intended to go once, but I didn't have the heart to tell a friend I had already seen it because he was so excited.  Much like the original, there are some truly amazing special effects.  There are also a lot of things that go &quot;BOOM&quot;.  The fight scenes with the jedi look magnificent, although I can see why Liam Neeson has said he will never act in front of a blue screen again.<br />Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor -- I've seen all three in other films, all of them showing (particularly Neeson) that they can truly act.  Unfortunately they have been handed a script that would have been considered childish in comparison to the original if the two had been released at the same time.  <br />The film looks pretty (well, okay, the scruffy parts look scruffy -- in other words it seems to look right).  There are LOTS of whiz-bang special effects.  There is the return of R2D2 (who even gets his own profile close-up) and C3PO (sans skin).  Did I mention there are special effects?  Lots of aliens are shown, even ET as a senator.  Oh, and there are special effects.<br />There is no good acting.  There is a horrible plot.  There is Jar-jar Binks, who subtracts 2 stars from any film aimed at anyone above the &quot;we like Telitubbies&quot; level.  There are so many special effects that they become glaringly obvious and detract from any semblance of plot or acting.  Natalie Portman sounds like she is doing a cold read of her lines and Liam, O! Liam!, most of the time looks disgusted to be in front of the camera.  <br />Yet another deathstar is destoryed, this time totally on accident.  Yet another far-too-cute character is introduced (please, wipe him out before the next film!).  And overall the original tale is not advanced one jot or tiddle.  <br />George Lucas has shown supreme contempt for all reviewers.  That is fine, he is allowed to.  He has also shown extreme contempt for his fan base.  Did this film add significantly to the Star Wars canon?  No.  Did it detract from it?  Yes.<br />So why have faith in him for any future films?
B00000F169|1.0|I can't imagine what possesed me to buy this DVD.  From the reviews I was expecting something along the lines of Mel Brooks or Zucker.  This is a total waste of time and money.
6302787068|5.0|As ridiculous as it might sound, at age 14, I still delight in watching Aladdin.  It has been in my top ten favorite movies since I was four or five.  It's very entertaining, funny, gorgeously animated, and tolerable-if not enjoyable-for every family member.  One thing though, some parts may be too scary for very little ones.  Conclusively, it is my favorite Disney movie.
B00004UFYU|5.0|I personally don't own the first edition, I haven't even heard it, so I can't compare the two. But I got this Era 2 last year and at first, when I listened to it, I thought it was kind of scary - too mysterious, too spiritual, too deep. So I didn't listen to it very often. That was on the hi-fi. But later, I wanted something calming and I listened to it in my discman. That was the most thrilling music I have listened to so far. The spiritual base of the whole thing makes it even the more beautiful, with all the voices, creating something in your soul that stays there. It's not like listening to other popular music, like Britney Spears or Shakira, which are also good but it's only you listen to it and then nothing happens, you forget it. But this is more than just music - it's an experience. When you listen to it, it's so spiritual and deep that it leaves a kind of signature on your soul and you then listen to it every day - if not in reality, it keeps on playing in your head and you want to sing with it but can't because it's so complex. And when you listen to it after a year, you remember exactly the time when you were listening to it the year ago. When I listen to it now, I clearly remember the middle of last year when I got it. It's like an experience which stays with you more. The vocals together with thrilling spiritual music and a steady beat - almost like a pop rhythm - create an unusual musical environment which is hard to forget. Buy it - you definitely won't regret, plus you'll be enlightened, you will become a better, cleaner person just by listening to it! <BR>(P.S.: by the way, I recommend listening to it in your discman, top volume, with your eyes closed :-)
B000066NW0|2.0|Decent voice, yet her lyrics are meaningless and generic.
B000065U1N|2.0|This movie had no story line and it was extremely confusing to follow the charecters.  The effects looked pretty fake as well.  I was extremely surprised since it got good reviews, but overall i would not recomend it.
B00003XB8K|2.0|This album, like all the others that enigma has made is wonderful.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Just recently I saw The Strokes perform at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, Cali. The energy exerted by the band while performing was simply phenomenal and overall a life-changing experience. Julian's amazing lyrics and awesome voice were almost too good. These kids are going to be around for a long time to come. So you all you wanna-be underground rock connoisseurs can put the thesaurus' down and start to admit that The Strokes great. Thank you for your time.<br />Be sure to listen to Track 2- The Modern Age
B000063CPL|5.0|i love iron maiden they are awesome this 2 cds are full of energy iron maiden are legends.and for you all maiden fans<BR>please check out Tierra Santa this spanish band are right now the<BR>greatest metal band in the world they sound like iron maiden mixed with stratovarius and hammerfall with their own amazing metal sound it'll blow everybody's mind they sing in spanish but<BR>believe me metal cannot get any better than this when you listen<BR>to their latest cd \\"sangre de reyes\\" all you can say is wau!!!!<BR>this is awesome!!buy it you'll be so happy you did......
B00005JKCF|5.0|I recently saw the movie \\"Spider-Man\\" with a friend and let me tell you it was wonderful!!! Tobey Maguire plays mild-mannered Peter Parker, a high school newspaper photographer who is picked on by his classmates because he's skinny weak kid with glasses. One day while he is on school field trip at a lab he is accidentally bitten by an experimental spider that has escaped from its glass cage. Immediatly after returning home Peter falls to the floor and hours after passing out he awakens to notice that his body is now more muscular, he doesn't need glasses, and he's able to shoot webs from his wrists. The villain in this movie is also brilliantly played! Go see this film, you won't be dissappointed!!!
B000063DFQ|5.0|i love iron maiden you can never go wrong on buying an iron maiden cd my favorite song from this cd is \\"die with your boot's on\\" and for you all maiden fans check out Tierra Santa this is the greatest spanish metal band in the world they sound like iron<BR>maiden but with a more modern sound right now i could definetely<BR>say they're the best metal band in the world if you buy \\"sangre de reyes\\" their latest cd you will go crazy for this band i can be sure of that you will never regret it for sure....
B00005OAIE|1.0|I've heard a couple of songs off of this cd as well as seeing a few others performed on tv. I feel it's enough to form an adequate opinion,as if I had the cd in front of me I wouldn't be compelled to listen to anything more than that. First off,this guy is gonna be dogged by the Dave Matthews comparisons for as long as they are both relevant musicians. Get used to it.They DO bare a silmilarity and I can't see this guy doing anything interesting enough to get him out of somebody else's shadow, let alone create one of his own. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure thinking frat boys and high schoolers everywhere will flock to this slightly more sophisticated version of Hootie. While not as immediatly obnoxious as Matthews (the guys voice and phrasing has always annoyed me), Mayers is every bit as middle of the road and bland. The big break out song (which is so boring that I can't rememer it's title)is terribly unmoving and ready to be cranked by every 36 year old who thinks they really discovered the hip, next big thing (only after it was available close to the check out counter). It features a hook that reminds me of some long forgotten Joe Jackson song and nothing that made me want more. Still, I got it because he's being pushed as &quot;the alternative&quot; (to what?) by his label. You know,something new and special. Something different. All 4 songs I've heard tred a well worn path and feature little to satisfy those who seek adventure in their music. Mainstream all the way,though some people want to see more in it. Sorry... Just relax and sit back,he's part of the machine now. Raise a plastic cup of keg beer my friend, for the &quot;thinking man's&quot; Blowfish has arrived.
1573228737|5.0|\\"Affinity\\" is a wonderfully atmospheric novel, set amongst the dank prisons and fog shrouded streets of Victorian London. It is much more than that, though: it is a feminist tale with lesbian undertones, a thriller, and a supernatural shocker with a twist ending that delightfully turns on its ear endings like \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"The Others\\". (I read this for a book club, and NO ONE was expecting that ending.) There is a pathos to these characters lives -- it was not easy to be a woman in such a repressive society, especially a spirited one.<br />Highly recommended... there's something for everyone in this one.
B00004ZD69|5.0|I know that some people have been a fan of GYBE! since, say, the beginning. I've only been one for about 5 months now, but I can honestly tell you, I have been nothing but impressed with this ensemble since day one.<BR>Okay, let me just say Lift your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven is one of my all-time favorite records. It's epic, it's huge, and it's constant. It's heartfelt, it's emotional, it's intense, sometimes even frightening, yet beautiful. The sonic landscapes produced by GYBE! are increcible, original, and entertaining to listen to. I still get a huge grin on my face every time my CD player hits 14 minutes on the second track on the first disk.<BR>This album doesn't deserve 5 stars. It deserves 10.
B000066NW0|5.0|WOW!  Avril's cd is something you will listen to all the time and never get sick of.  She is credited with truly being herself, but this face really shines through on her first album.  She writes all her music herself, and you can tell because all the songs are so easy to relate to.  This is a cd that should be in everyone's music collection!
B000002HH2|3.0|Bjork's second album as a solo artist is possibly maybe a good album.  After coming off a high from Bjork's marvelous and energetic Debut album you would expect that her second release with Post would be even better.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  In my view Bjork scored much higher with Debut than she does here with Post.  The album disapppoints with a sluggish second half of the way.  Post starts off good.  The tracks Army of Me, Hyper Ballad, and Modern Things are good and have you at that all time Bjork high until Oh so quiet comes along.  The album picks up a little with the track Enjoy, but after that the album falls flat and leaves you hanging.  The first three songs of this album are the only good songs and the rest [are bad] with the exception of Enjoy. The song Enjoy is interesting just to listen to the unique instrumentation. The music for that track sounds more like a running motor of some sort with a bunch of noise.  Despite the flaws on the rest of the tracks, Post is still a good effort worth considering.  Buy this album, but be sure that you won't get the same musical quality as you did with Debut.
B000007492|4.0|OK sampler.  I tended to favor their earlier material and associate their later stuff as a bit too slick, too pop-like and written to score for the top 40 crowd.  They didn't &quot;sell out&quot; it just made good business sense after they demonstrated their ability to deliver stellar, cutting edge material for its day that still holds its own.  Their Crime of the Century and Crisis? What Crisis? LP's (CD's) were by far the best experience for my ears.  You can't go wrong with this &quot;Best of.&quot;  However,if you want the full treatment and the continuity of their two masterpiece albums, get the two mentioned above instead of or in addition to &quot;The Best of&quot;.  I can only hope that the production values  of the CD versions of these LP's are superior.  The LP's suffered from incredibly poor dynamics and were very flat for such potent material.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought Avril's cd the first day it came out, and It's my fave cd that I own. It's got a little bit of everything and I think it appeals to a wide range of people. My mum loves it and I think Avril's such a good role model. She's not showing all of her skin, and she doesnt pretend to be someone she's not. This cd is excellent and it should be bought by anyone that likes rock, pop, folk or even country music.
B00005JKED|5.0|If you are looking for the ultimate bad guy, you found it right here in this movie.  Denzel Washington definately knows how to play a bad guy and this movie is proof.
B000002OMN|2.0|After listening to the well crafted tunes on the original Bat Out Of Hell anyone would be starving for another helping of Meatloaf(and it was a sixteen year wait for seconds). But after listening to Bat Out of Hell II you discover that this album has the excessiveness of the original minus the quality songwriting. The opening track is the dramatic and energetic twelve minute song, \\"I'd Do Anything for Love\\"(one of the few solid songs on this album). The five minute radio version of this song flows much better and sounds more natural. Basically this is a five minute song trapped in a twelve minute body. Jim Steinman must have believed that stretching the length of this song out as long as possible would turn it into another \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" or \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\". The song \\"Life is A Lemon...\\" is extremely obnoxious and cheesy. The lyrics have the childish cynicism that is better suited to garage metal. \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come True\\" is a decent song with a good melody. The spoken part of \\"Wasted Youth\\" is just ridiculous and only succeeds in letting you know what a dork Steinman must have been in high-school. The rest of the album is pretty mediocre. This album has the all to familiar \\"sequal gone bad\\" feeling that is usually associated with movies. In the song \\"Objects in The Rear View Mirror..\\" you hear the lyrics \\"but it was long ago and it was far away\\" and cringe hoping the next part isn't \\"and it was so much better than it is today\\". This album just enforces that Meatloaf and Bat Out of Hell (the original) will always remain synonyms.
B00005NNT1|5.0|follows the classic fairy tale - has good animation. the characters r great and the cast 2.
0316666343|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've ever felt.  That's right...FELT.  You can't just read this book - you live it, experience it, and you feel it as the story unfolds.  I love it when this happens...when a story just peels off the pages and becomes less of a story, and more of a dream.  <BR>I read the first two chapters online ... and couldn't wait to get my copy of it.  Those who say it doesn't \\"live up to the hype\\" should stop paying attention TO hype, and trust the story for what it is.  Beautiful and haunting.  Comforting and unsettling.  Impossible and truthful.  The ending does not fold up \\"neatly\\" ...  <BR>Read it for yourself and see.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|its a good movie about the pinocchio tale. not my fav disney movie, but its good, good cast, well written, etc.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is awesome. I love Avril's voice throughout all of these songs, and its nice to know that she wrote all of them.
B000066NW0|5.0|there isnt much to be said about Avril Lavigne's new cd but that it rocks! this young new artist is my age and has the most beautiful voice i have ever heard! i can now say im a huge fan! i like the way she writes her own music and refuses to let anyone else write it for her. thats what being a singer is all about right? expressing your thoughts through music? i think it was a good idea that she turned that opertunity down to sing with Nick Carter from BSB ... she needs to be the unique indivisual that she is.
0064407667|5.0|A book where nothing ever comes out right. Horrible, you must think! Well, er, yes. The Series of Unfortunate Events is just that, but it's part of the appeal. These books are amusing horror stories geared toward children in elementary and middle school, and though at times terrible, they still manage to sustain a queer quality that attracts readers.
B000065U1N|3.0|Firstly this isn't some anti-american rant, I honestly don't know how the true story of this was reported in America when it happened but from news reports in the British media at the time, this film is far from accurate.  Ridley Scott has recreated the event itself with his usual eye for the smallest details (though as one ex-ranger reviewer says, there are some compromises for the audience's sake).  The sheer style and energy of the film is undeniable and the acting isn't all that bad (highest praise must go to australian Eric Bana).  Unfortunately the one thing it lacks is the slightest hint of why the citizens of Mogadishu hated the U.S. Rangers so much.  <br />The tribe which the Mogadishans belived the U.S. were trying to install to power were the same tribe which for years had commited genocide against other indiginous trides of Somalia.  The factor that really tipped the scales was that Blackhawk gunships, only the week before, were responsible for the strafing of unarmed civilians in the centre of Mogadishu.<br />If these thoughts had not been scratching away at the back of my mind whilst watching then this could have been a wonderful story of heroism against impossible odds (and in many ways it, and the event itself, really was).  Instead it is the kind of partiotic (the reviewer who advised people to watch Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now rather than this was probably being sarcastic, if not he is incredibly misguided) and fairly brave film-making that the later 'We Were Soldiers' can only hope to be.
0812550706|5.0|But also intersting on a whole other level. The psychology and motivations for the characters are complex, and aside from Ender's time at Battle school, the conversations and writings of Valentine and Peter are equally as interesting. Ender is a character which one can never forget. What more can I say? Orson Scott Card is a master of writing, and Ender's Game (as well as all of it's sequels) is proof of it, tracing the development of a taunted &quot;third&quot; to a military genius caught up in a giant scheme.
B00005YTFG|5.0|This film is genius! It's a spectacular story of love triumphing above all else. It was so touching and emotional, I just loved it! The music is wonderful and contributes so much to the overall story. I didn't really know what a great director Baz is or what great singers Ewan and Nicole are until I saw this movie. I can't say enough about this film. It's absolutely fantastic and if you only buy one film you'd better make it Moulin Rouge!
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore is an underrated genius. LOTR \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is an amazing masterpiece. Evil dark lords and heroic themes are depicted in \\"The Bridge of Kazad-Dum\\". Quiet peaceful music in track 8 \\"Flight to the Ford\\". This is a one of the best soundtracks out there along with \\"Star Wars\\" and Jurassic Park\\". These Music tracks are the Jewels among some thorns in Soundtracks today
B0000004V2|5.0|I bought this album in 1990, after seeing the video for &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot; on &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, the old MTV show which I and my friends watched religiously every Sunday. Twelve years later, &quot;Stone Roses&quot; remains in heavy rotation, resting imperiously atop a pile of disappointing lesser CD's with one or two good(ish) songs on them (Four Non-Blondes, I want my money back!). <br />This album has everything you could wish for in modern music. It's consistently funky, intelligent and chock full of the wrenching, visceral guitar work that any rock and roller must have. There is something to be said for a record that makes you want to boogie and play air guitar at the same time. John Squire, as so many other reviewers have mentioned, really was/is a new kind of guitar hero. His playing is enormously skillful but he never gives in to the temptation to take himself too seriously. His taste is seemingly infallible and despite the very grand sound of some of the songs (She Bangs The Drums, This Is The One), bombast is non-existent on this record.<br />Ian Brown's lyrics are intelligent and ironic and his singing style is perfect for them. He maintains a cool distance throughout, which is especially effective on the Oh-so-English &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;, a macabre little ditty set to the tune of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;. <br />On this side of the pond, we missed out on the &quot;second summer of love&quot; and the much-ballyhooed &quot;Madchester&quot; scene. I've since heard a lot of the music from that era e.g. Inspiral Carpets, Happy Mondays etc. and some of it is pretty good. However, the Stone Roses are the only band whose contribution transcends the genre and 13 years after its release this album sounds as fresh and inventive as it did when it first arrived.   <br />The American version of the album that I bought didn't have &quot;Fools Gold&quot; on it, and it was several years later that I finally got a copy of that track, coincidentally on a &quot;120 Minutes&quot; compilation CD. The inclusion of that funk masterpiece on the version that is for sale here only serves to further elevate a truly magnificent record. The bass line is as insanely catchy a piece of legitimate funk as anything Bootsy Collins ever dreamt of. John Squire shows that he's as much a master of funk-wah playing as he is of Townsendian power-chording. Bravo.<br />Now, if only they hadn't been such a lazy and difficult bunch of prima donnas, there might be a greater body of work to enjoy. Alas, Stone Roses, we hardly knew ye!
B000066F6H|4.0|In the fine tradition of rock n' roll, the Hives borrow heavily  from their predecessors.  The garage sounds of the late 60s come through loud and clear; if you close your eyes, the Hives sound just like the Sonics or MC5.  There are strains of Iggy Pop and the Kinks too.  <br />Nonetheless, it's old-school pop.  It's not terribly political: young men who want to get laid and hate the boss.  OK: that makes for some fun rock n' roll.  But, in a similar style, the Pixies are a LOT better at this type of thing. And so are Modest Mouse. <br />If you like the Hives and want to graduate to something just as rocking--but with deeper passion--try Bikini Kill, the Make-up, Fugazi, and Mission of Burma. After you've heard those bands, you'll see why the Hives are, in the end, just another foot-stompin' MTV band.
B00000ILDF|3.0|This movie focus' more on Ripley and how she feels about her family being dead. It starts out showing that an alien got on their ship and chose Ripley has it's host while her and the others where still cryogenically frozen. The alien caused the ship to catch on fire and it crashed on a planet at the edge of the solar system. The alien kept Ripley alive while the others were killed. The planet they crashed on was a jail where male prisoners lived. An alien got loose on the planet and started its killing spree. While Ripley is amune to the alien because she has one of them in her. And so began another battle between humans and aliens. This is a very good sequel to the alien series.
B000001F3C|1.0|How many times do they play this stuff over and over and over?<br />The music is so simple to begin with, we can only hope that they try and move into new areas.  Where are the discriminating listeners who should be demanding that they not rest on their laurels and start creating?

B000066NW0|5.0|How many 16-year-old females can say they experienced writing their own music and letting the whole world hear it? Not many. Avril Lavigne is an amazing artist who has accomplished those things and so much more.  Her debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; is total proof of that. The tracks on her album range from spunky, carefree, and in your face songs to slow ballads.  Avril's songs were not pre written for any artist who comes along.  They are genuinely truthful and represent everything that Avril believes in.  Avril definitely tells it like it is.  One thing is for sure...if u put a voice like Avril's to songs like &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; you will definitley feel exactly what Avril is all about...Being REAL!
B00004TA41|5.0|A lot of people for some reason hear turmoil in this recording but I hear peace, even when the music seems to some folks to be very dissonant.    <br />FACT: most folk music is dissonant, if you broaden your horizens to include the entire planet.<br />But dissonance is just a means to heat the music so it generates light and that is useful to lift the music into a Spiritual realm and that is why Trane's music is important to me.<br />It may take you some time, but when you finally reach this music, you will hear the joy.<br />If this music doesn't cause you to question life and ponder its mysteries, do not blame Mr John Coltrane or Mr. Rashied Ali.
B000066NW0|5.0|Lets say I love music, but I hate to buy Cd's bc I don't like every song on them. That's soooo not the case with Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot;. I love EVERY SINGLE song on it. If you haven't got the Cd yet..then you are crazy..it's awesome!
B00005ARDC|1.0|I was recommended this album because I like Monk.<br />Sorry, this is not for people who like Monk.<br />Too simplistic and superficial where as Monk is the genius of modern music.
B000002A3T|5.0|I  first listened to this album about five years ago when I was at a stereo shop buying some  new  speakers.  I had lost interest in Pink Floyd after &quot;The Wall&quot; being somewhat dissapointed with A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Final Cut.  I  ignored this recording when it came out around '94.  When the salesman at the store put on a CD to test the new speakers, the first thing I said was &quot;Wow...sounds pretty good, who is that?  Welcome back to the soundscapes that drew me to Pink Floyd to begin with back in &quot;69 with Ummagumma. If I want deep cryptic lyrics I listen to Dylan.  If I want sound scapes I listen to Pink Floyd.  I think this is their best album since 'The Wall&quot;.  O.K. I know Rogers Waters is missing but if you like spacey , dreamlike sound gardens, you have to put this one up there with their best, behind Dark Side...., Wish You Were Here and The Wall. Great head music!
B00005Q66T|1.0|I was recommended this because of my purchase of a recording by<br />Dizzy Gillespie.  Assuming this is not the result of a paylola scheme ... let me say that this is of no value to Dizzy Gillespie fans.<br />Therefore, I urge you to look further.<br />As for Madonna,..., she is done.  She never could sing in the first place.
B000066NW0|5.0|this cd is the best cd i have ever bought.  it has music for everyone. i know there's alot of news about her being a poser and all. but just to tell u, it isn't how u look, listen to the music and u can see for your self.  avril is excellent at what she does and if i could give her a 1000000 stars i would.  she is extremely unique, and knows, shows, what she feels.  the best thing is: SHE DOES WHAT SHE WANTS AND DOESN'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HER!!. 5 stars avril!! keep making music, and i'll for sure buy the next one that comes out<br />later <BR>shattered

B000002NHN|5.0|I don't know what to say about this woman. Let me begin with these words. What a voice! Her voice is one of the most distint and beautiful I have heard in a LONG time. To me it is full and deep and rich, but yet it is tender and sweet and light all at the same time. This album had me hooked from the first note. It IS a Celtic album to be sure but it has dashes of musical flavor from other cultures in it too to give it a unique sound and make it an even more compelling experience.<br />1- Prologue: This really doesn't have any words in it. It is basically Loreena singing a melody backed by drums and other instrumentation. The melody she sings here is simple and  beautiful, and with her angelic voice to give it life it sucks you right in, like you are being guided along in a dream to a place of wonder and awe. Her voice is the key that opens the door and pulls the shroud back.<BR>2- The Mummer's Dance: This is very nice and lively. Beautiful violin and drums with exotic strings and percussion.A sense of a story being told around a campfire while a party is in full swing.<BR>3- Skellig: A beautiful but tragic tale and musical portrait of an Irish priest coming home to tell his story and pass on his legacy to a friend. McKennitt's exquisite singing  makes you feel as if YOU are the one being told to carry on the poor man's tasks.<BR>4- Marco Polo: Drums, plucked strings and some Middle Eastern flavor mix with Loreena's voice (like the Prologue, no real words here, just a melody) to give you a sense of moving through a desert in the Middle East to someplace foreign and intriguing.<BR>5- The Highwayman: A beautiful, noble and tragic love story based on a poem of the same name written by Alfred Noyes. It is brought to vivid life by Lorena's beautiful, dignified and passionate singing, backed  by soft but adventurous  guitar and drums with a haunting violin melody.<BR>6- La Serenissima:Another mostly instrumental piece here, with Loreena singing a melody without lyrics. Nota very Celtic-sounding piece, but it is beautiful in it's own right.<BR>7- Night Ride Across The Caucasus: This is a great piece. Noble and adventurous guitar and drums carry this with what sounds like an accordion or some sort of exotic keyboard work. The effect is engaging and wistful. It DOES indeed sound like musical accompaniment to someone taking a long journey at night by horseback. Fairly quick and hearty BUT stately and dignified at the same time. The lyrics seem to tell of a person imploring their love not only to take a jorney with them but to take time to reflect on the things of an earlier age that they both knew  and loved. Also it seems to be a challege, for the lovers to be daring enough to explore the world around them. Just a guess but that's the impression I got from the words. You might hear it and feel something entirely difrrent or get something different out of it.<BR>8- Dante's Prayer: This is a beautiful mix of Loreena's lovely voice with what sounds like Gregorian chant in the beginning. Lovely piano work and other instruments are used too. This one is a WEEPER. Bring your Kleenex. The lyrics reinforce something that I think we all feel. We all pray for the courage to be open to love and the wonders and joy that love  can open to us. We all at times ask, or even beg someone we love to have the courage to love us back. And we all have the desire deep down to be remembered by those we love after we are gone.<br />In short, this is a beautiful piece of work. Very emotional, gripping and intense. It is heartbreakingly sad in some places, and terrifically joyful in others. It will reach out for your your heart and ask to carress it. It will break your heart AND soothe it, and lift it up in joy, if you have the courage to LET that heart be touched.
B0000025DV|5.0|i am 16 years old and recently came across out of the blue.  the songs are catchy and memorable; i fell in love with the album instantly.  i definietly recomend this, whether you are a new fan like me or you are and old fan looking to expand your collection.  in my opinion, out of the blue is second to only a new world record.
B000068QY7|4.0|I had a copy of this from early March, and thought that this is indeed better than their last two albums.  While that is not too hard, it seems that with the introduction of Gem and Andy the Mk 2 version is pumped up and ready to go.  And with Liam flexing his songwriting muscle it is more of an incentive for Noel to prove that he is better writer.  Stand out Tracks are Born On a Different cloud,  Stop Crying Your Heart Out.  All I have to say is this is their 5th Album, go and Buy it you will nor be disappointed
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is BY FAR the greatest heavy metal album of all time!!!!  Everything about this album rules...from the chainsaw-like guitar riffing from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, the evil/psychotic vocals of Tom Araya, to the blasting drum beats of Dave Lombardo, not to mention the superb, crisp production of the album...what more can one ask for?  This is exactly what METAL music should be and more.  This album makes the first three Metallica albums sound like Brittany Spears (of course...I'm not going to mention what I think of the newer Metallica stuff! puke!!!! LOL!!!!!!)!  If you don't like this album, you're a poser, bottom line!!!

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne. It's a name you better get familiar with. After taking off from her home town of Napanee, Ontario and eventually capturing the attention of record producer Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid, this new face in the crowd might have what it takes. With a video already making its way on MTV and a hook that is lodging itself into the brains of radio listeners, her first single \\"Complicated\\" is undeniable, flawless pop/rock. The first time I heard this song I immediately found myself unable to forget it. I was shocked when I saw the driving force behind this song was a mere slip of a seventeen year old. <br />Her voice definitely isn't typical. Combining admirable range with rough edges, Lavigne manages to carve out a distinctive niche from the other girls saturating the media currently. I have to say I am impressed with the newer batch of teen queens who at least can pick up an instrument, write their own songs and have something different to say. I think Lavigne shows her different direction in the savvy words to \\"Complicated\\" A nice wailing guitar sound combined with her youthful voice make a great combination. Giving a surprisingly insightful view into the guy who always has to pretend to be cool and unaffected, I can think back and relate to this song very easily. Managing to be charming yet effectively adult the songs just comes out about perfect. I personally love the line \\"take off all your preppy clothes\\". Because it reminds me of this guy in high school who was never really a prep but did his damn best to keep up the image. <br />The album opens with the rocking ballad \\"Losing Grip\\" and as she wails to her audience you immediately feel her words. She actually sounds faintly like Delores O' Rierdan from the Cranberries on this interesting composition. Definitely capturing the essence of anguish with this song, the song also has a great hook and makes for a great opener to the album. I am not sure it would make a great radio release but sometimes the best songs wouldn't. <br />\\"Sk8r Boi\\" is very punk oriented with the typical three-chord sound. Normally, I am not overly into this type of sound (although I did manage to get into a few songs by Green Day) but since her talent has already been established I view it more as a nice little novelty. A lot of girls are going to love this song and I can see my sister-n-law loving this song already. Definitely not as mature as the other tracks, but she's sure having fun. Basically it's about this girl who dumps a skater boy because her friends don't like him. Then he becomes a star and Lavigne is now dating him. The girl is sad because now all her friends think he's cool. <br />At this point in the album I am happy that every song has been so different. It's great to hear an album with such variety. \\"I'm With You\\" is really the first ballad on the album and I love the sound of it. I am not sure why but it actually recalls some of the early Bangles I loved so much when I was a teenager. I believe it's the melody and the way she carries it. Anyway, I like this song as well. The chorus of this song is really haunting and the words are simple but effective. <br />Another song I can see a lot of teenagers relating to is \\"Mobile\\". Talking about the world changing around her and being mobile within it, most teenagers will probably understand the feeling of a world that revolves around them and a world they revolve in. The music and melody to this song is a little more typical but it still works nicely. <br />\\"Anything But Ordinary\\" is another winner on the album with its laid back feel and honestly simple lyrics. There is a hint of Paula Cole in the way she soars on the vocal line in the chorus. Once again it's a song a lot of girls could relate to in a positive way and I am really impressed. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" is a nice little song and she talks about all the things she thinks about that she'll never say to her boyfriend. The song is catchy and the lyrics are so easy to relate to. I relate to it more looking back but many girls will be right in the moment. (I already said them and got my man!) <br />Avril Lavigne is definitely going to be a force to be reckoned with. She recalls flecks and pieces of writers ranging from Jann Arden to Lisa Loeb. Vocally she is like a cross between Delores O'Rierdan and Alanis Morrissette. I hope this girl has a long career and if you go out and buy this album, she'll get a good start. ...<br />Go ahead. Are you still here?
B00004XQ83|4.0|OK, OK, it's a pretty good CD. But from the reviews and word of mouth, I'd expect it to be the most wonderful CD in a millinium. It's not. Don't get me wrong, the music is classic. And it's very good. But did we need 4 versions of \\"Man of Constant Sorrows\\", an absolutely annoying track. The singer is way too nasal. The rest of the CD is pretty good though. I loved \\"Didn't leave Nobody\\" and \\"Down to the River\\" was just breath taking. I liked \\"I am Weary\\" also. But it's not an album I'll play non-stop, it's too repetitive, but I'd recommend you buy only if you like this kind of music, if you are buying it because it is such a hit, you'll be dissapointed.
B0000047EC|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who said &quot;this is not a jazz CD&quot;.  The music on this disc doesn't really fit neatly in any defined genres.  It is spare, haunting, sentimental, subtle, emotional.  Some have described it as mellow, but I think that word has too many bad lounge singer connotations to accurately describe this.  This music is as much about silence as it is about sound.  The spaces between the notes say as much as the notes themselves.  It makes me want to get in a car and drive across the midwest to have a nice long uninterrupted stretch to listen to the whole thing.
B000068QY7|5.0|When You want real rock in roll you know oasis is &quot;born on a different cloud&quot;.<br />Great rockin tracks like : The hindu times, hung in a bad place, better man, force of nature. Great Softies : Stop crying your heart out, little by little, and songbird.<br />Cheers
B000066NW0|5.0|I just got Avril Lavignes, &quot;Let Go&quot; a couple days ago and i havent put it down since! her cd is something so new since for the past few years i have been surrounded by Britney Spears and all that other pop music and she takes a big leap from that. Her music is so different and great that it is my favorite CD! If you dont have it yet you better get it soon!
B000066NW0|5.0|I was driving home one afternoon when on the radio came on this song. From the very first second I heard the song I immediately LOVED it. Which was amazing because usually with new songs I have to hear them 3 or 4 times before I really begin to like the song. But with this song.. I loved it as soon as I heard it. The sounds, the voice, the instruments, the lyrics..just everything! I had the radio blaring really loud. When the song was over I heard the D.J. come on the air and say &quot;That was the new song 'Complicated' by one of our very new artists, Avril Lavigne&quot; After I heard that song I knew I HAD to get the album as soon as it came out. I mean if I thought that song was so incredible the first time I heard it then I knew the rest of the songs on the album HAD to be very good too. So when the album came out on June 4th I ran to the nearest CD store and bought it. I even bought a couple of copies for my friends too. The minute I got home I opened it up and listened to. And WOW was the album AMAZING!! Every song had a meaning. Every song on the album talked about real life situations and feelings. The thing that makes the album so incredible and unique is that her songs werent just about love and relationships like most songs are today. They were about being yourself and being strong. And thats what makes the album so amazing. Everyone can relate to Avril's songs. Her songs have already affected me in a GREAT deal. After hearing her songs on her album they made me stronger. They also showed me my true self and the person I was hiding behind and pretending to be. &quot;Let Go&quot; is truley inspiring and can benefit for everyone. Not only are the lyrics powerful, but the music is incredible. Each song has its own sound and each sound touches you in a way that cant really be described. Also there are so many different sounds included in each song and they all come together to make such a wonderful song. I also love the mood of the album. The songs arent allthe same. There are some very loud and rock sort of songs and then there are some soft and slow songs and even the song &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; Is sort of an up beat kind of rap sounding song. So each song can fit everyone's music tastes. The great thing about Avril is shes not afraid to say how she feels and that really comes out in her songs as well. Shes not letting anyone tell her who she can and cant be and shes also showing people that they shouldnt pretend to be someone they're not and they shouldnt also tell other people how to be too. The whole album just inspires and changes you in so many ways its unbelievable. If you havent bought the album yet, you should. Trust me..Its Incredible. I have talked to so many people who have been changed by this album. Even the person at the cd store was telling me how amazing the album was while I was buying it. &quot;Let Go&quot; Is truley the best album there has ever been and will ever be. This album is &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;
B000066NW0|5.0|When I first saw Avril Lavignes 'Complicated' video on TRL i knew she had talent and was going to be very successful in the future. I bought her CD a couple of days ago and was not disappointed. She has a great voice which make her songs even better. Theres not one song on her cd that i havent listened too or disliked. Most of my friends dont even know who she is but here I am with and AOL icon and her lyrics everywhere. Avril's CD is always playing when im around and i even made a tape of it so i could listen to it in the car. And Avril if your reading this...YOUR AMAZING! I can't wait until I see her in concert which probably wont be long!!! To finish this review...Avril Lavigne is at the top and she WILL NOT be stopped!
B0000640VO|5.0|Theres only one problem with Amelie, it proves what dross we are forced into watching by corporate american studios.<BR>This is an amazing film, and definately Jeunets best, if you liked any of his other incredibly stylistic offerings, you will adore this.<BR>From the opening scene you know you are in for a treat, the editing and camera angles are mesmerising, and evry shot seems to have been composed with every possible thought, as Amalie herself says she enjoys spotting the litlle details in films that noone else notices, keep your eyes open.<BR>Audrey Tatou is incredible, shes plays Amelie like a dream, but every part in the film is so well played and the depth given to even minor characters makes the film come to life even more strogly.<BR>The story is funny and packed with insight and observation. <BR>This is why we love cinema
B00003CXI1|5.0|In the past few years Harry Potter and his band of friends have become a big part of my life.  It's hard not to enjoy the fun but complex writing of JK Rowling.  Harry, Ron, and yes, even Hermione, have become personal friends of mine through the books.  <br />That said, this movie is one of my favorites.  I usually find child actors annoying and unbarable to watch, but I've fallen in love with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson and the chemistry they have playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  <br />A well written screen play, as well as wonderful acting puts this movie into the five star range.

B00005YUNY|5.0|An absolutely gorgeous (sonically and visually) show by a band that can still blaze through the most powerful of epics, even thirty years after they wrote them! The mix between orchestra and band is crisp and balanced, Tom Brislin provides the PERFECT keyboard work for all of the songs (even some 'imitation' guitar work where Steve Howe probably wouldn't do too well with it), and, despite having played them more times than they could possibly count, Yes performs the best-ever versions of \\"Starship Trooper\\" and \\"And You And I\\" here, rising to the occasion for the camera (and trust me, I've HEARD these songs many times, in many different versions, and these two takes outdo them all)! 'House of Blues' was good, but this is better by a pretty long shot. Essential for the big Yes fans out there, and recommended even to those who are new to the band!

This is clearly perceptipble in his rendering of the Ringwraiths, when they are on screen, the movie is very intense.<br />Here in The frighteners we have a Horror-Comedy movie, and alike, it has very intense moments for a comedy, and original and terrible elements in a horror movie.<br />Michael J. Fox's character has to battle an evil spirit who is killing people indiscriminately, since he is psychic, he is the only one who sees it, and he gets help from ghosts he befriends;<BR>but soon he is the main suspect of the murders.<br />But no living person or dead is safe because the evil one can kill both and collect their souls.<br />Great special effects, great suspense, and story. This is Michael J. Fox's most thrilling movie since Back to the future part one.
B000009EAD|5.0|This is one of the best CDs by Iced Earth.. but if u think bout it... everything by Iced Earth is the best!<BR>I bought this CD like two weeks ago...i am 5 years late! but i didnt have any money.. since i am a new Iced Earth fan.. i wanna buy everything that was ever made by Iced Earth or any sound-like bands..<BR>I've heard alot about this CD..but i didnt belive anybody until i bought it..<BR>This is a real kick [behind] CD..If u ever wanna check out Iced Earth(if u dont know the band already) buy this CD first.. it will blow you away.. and i mean blow you away..<BR>The great thing about Iced Earth is that this band gives each one of it's albums a theme or a story.. the title of the album isnt only a song in the album.. but its more like a title of a book that you read about..only by music.. best examples for this is this album and Night of the Stormrider.<BR>So, steal it.. download it.. just get it..
0684800713|5.0|Some people tend to expect too much or over-analyze the book.  It is simply a story of loss and how we try to overcome it.  Be it unrequited love, being socially unaccepted, lost in a foreign land, or even your generation.  The book presents the questions and shows the struggles of finding meaning for our actions that Hemingway and all of us encounter.  He doesn't try to answer any questions but its reassuring that we are not alone.  Its beautifully staccoto style and troubled characters make this a true classic and a strong reccommendation to anyone feeling lost.
1878424114|5.0|I first came across this book in 1994, and since then I have never been without a copy.  Even if you are not a Chopra fan, I encourage you to read it - just give it a channce and you will understand why I like it so much.<br />It is like an easy reference book that reminds oneof some very basic, yet complex and at the same time fundamental principles of everyday living.  Many days when I feel unbalanced, I stick this little book into my pocketbook and I read in on the train on my way to work.  There is a very useful synopsis at the end of each chapter for easy reference.<br />I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have recommended this little gem.  Its one of my favorite gifts to give.  I hope you too can enjoy this work which is timeless in its value to those who want to lead a balanced and peaceful life.
B000066NW0|5.0|The small town girl from Nappanee, Ontario entered the music business with the extraordinary song called &quot;Complicated&quot;. Avril Lavigne's song was stuck in everyone's head only 2 weeks soon after it was released. Avril's punk attitude and superlative voice made everyone stoked for her astonishing album. With her strong voice, Avril connected to every one of her fans through all of her 13 songs which are filled with attitude, meaning and relate to teenage/life problems. This album deserves the five stars that I awarded it and I expect way more of Avril Lavigne in the future. I know she is defiently in MY WORLD.
6305971099|5.0|This follows directly from the events of \\"Halloween 4\\". I like the fact that they go deeper into Jamie's (Danielle Harris) character and how they portray the after effects of the killing of her foster-mother. Also it shows a bond, a psychic bond with Jamie and her uncle. The film portrays \\"The Shape\\" (Donald J. Shanks) as a silent but brutal killer, much a kin to the John Carpenter's portrayal of Michael Myers. With slight differences in movement and actions. The killings are more graphic than that of \\"Halloween 4\\" but at times are truly shocking!<br />The fact is this film has a teenage influence in the way of portrayal again the directer might of thought this idea would give a connection to the first \\"Halloween\\". On top of that they bring back Ellie Cornell as Jamie's step-sister in a short role this brings the roots of the previous \\"Halloween\\" back. Such as the loyal and powerful role of the late Donald Pleasence as Dr, Loomis really makes you think this is another excellent sequal to the \\"Halloween\\" Series. A must see for fans of the movies!
0142000655|4.0|I found East of Eden to be a great book, though the biblical allusions were rather obvious. I found Cathy Ames a frightening yet interesting character and kept attempting to figure her out. She doesn't seem to have a heart, yet at the end of the book, she shows a side of her that I hadn't expected and didn't know what to make of. I highly recommend this book.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Well...I've been a Britney fan since her first cd came out....I thought she was great then and I still do.  Personally, I think this cd is awesome!!  My friend and I are both HUGE Britney fans, and we went to her concert twice...the last time we had front row and sound check...and Britney was great.  I think this cd is really good, you can tell shes grown up alot since her first cds.  The songs are catchy and fun...very dance-able too!!  I recommend this cd very highly!!
B000002NE4|5.0|As always a treat for the soul and a constant inspiration.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avrils CD is amazing. I love it sooo much! It touches on the tihngs that are really important in life such as being yourself (Complicated), not judging others and getting to know them for who they are (Sk8r Boi), or living your life to the fullest (Anyhting But Ordinary). She is an awesome artist whose music really touched me and my life and i love her sound and style more than any artist ive heard yet. Avril is AwEsOMe!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|okay...my best friend is OBSESSED with cats and the video she has of it is like worn....it is in bad shape...and like I just saw it at her house today and her birthday is like in December and I CANNOT wait to like give her a DVD copy of it...anyway....it's an AWESOME musical...like THE BEST and...heh...there are so many different stories that you can get out of it if you like read it different ways...anyway....I would suggest this as like a &quot;must see&quot; musical.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This was one of the best movies to come along in a theater
B00005OCMR|5.0|Tron was another of those films that when I saw it in the theatre I walked out thinking this was a lot of fun. Extremely creative and the first of the films in a series of Disney films that would eventually use Computers and CGI, Tron would set the standard for computers in the industry to follow in the years ahead<br />At this time it was in the early stages, but the technology, although young, was a clear launching point for what would later be today's SHREK. The story is simple. Man verses Machine. Creator verses creation. Sound familiar?<br />Jeff Bridges leads the cast of a very young group of newcomer actors  - Bruce Boxlightner and Cindy Morgan up against some veteran performers like Bernard Hughs and England's very own David Warner (Star Trek V &amp; VI and Time Bandits). Jeff Bridges is outstanding!<br />The visuals are breath taking and the design is very unique. A look inside the computer and all its parts is what this film proposes. The Light cycles are the best. It has some \\"Disneyesque\\" points to it. There is Friendship and loyalty and even love. (Among programs!)<br />The DVD extras are definitely worth it. They put screen test, costume test and computer graphic tests on it. There are visuals and raw footage before the computer enhanced stuff.<br />This is a great addition to your science fiction collection of films. Check you some of my other reviews!
0345350499|5.0|WOW - Count on losing sleep over this one.  I was up many late nights reading, but it was worth it.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This has to be one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a depressed, medicated teen who is visited by the future killer of his girlfriend. The death was an accident, and the guy who was driving the car has come from another dimension in the future to try to make Donnie see what will happen if he doesn't figure out how to go into the past and change it.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely fabulous, hysterically funny and touching in his more depressing moments. I'm still a little fuzzy on the Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore characters. Did they know what was going on or were they just really overacting?  I'd put money on the latter.<br />All in all, I was impressed.
B00000I8UK|5.0|This is truly revolutionary music.  It was recorded in 1964 and it could have been recorded yesterday.  Everyone on this album is, or was, a giant star in the jazz world.  This is one of the great all-time classics in jazz.  As far as I'm concerned anyway.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Jingle jingle, jangle jangle, jingle jingle chord changes and some filtered trust fund moppy stickboy on the mic.  Take it away please, heard it all before.  Pass on this ridiculously hyped band and proceed to the source, namely the Velvets, who in their own way are also still riding the crest of a wave not so high or grand as reported.  The strumming is all Lou.  The Wedding Present, pushed along by a far more compelling singer, filtered this style with more charge, more urgency.  When that rich boy starts whining on \\"Barely Legal\\", you're looking to pull the plug.  Yes, a few catchy tunes -- and all ripped off. Female equivalent late night poseurs Elastica engaged in similar larceny.  Find some real rock n' roll somewhere else.
B000063DIR|2.0|I bought it even though you all warned me. Let me be brief.<BR>I can forgive the missed drumbeat during Randys solo in \\"Over the Mountain\\".  I can forgive the off-time bass and drums in \\"Flying High Again\\". But I cannot forgive Mr. Trujillo for adding his own bass lines to the beginning of \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\", how dare he think he can improve the playing on that song.  Bob Daisley never overplayed anything unless it fit the song well. I cringe when I hear those bass notes he decided to add to that song. ...<BR>The cd does sound great. Let's just put it back with the ORIGINAL musicians. HELLO???
B00005JLEU|5.0|fall into a world of gods and adventure that is totally beyond your imagination. \\"sen to chihiro no kamikakushi\\", or \\"spirited away\\", isn't an ordinary kid movie that breaks into song every few minutes or tries too much to make you laugh by doing stupid things. it has a very simple yet profound plot with fantasy and magic flavored into it. a simply breath-taking movie with an amazing flow that doesn't waste any minute (not even one second), with beautiful music that leaves you speechless, and with such original characters that you can't help loving, this is definitely one of a kind that will enchant audiences of both genders, all ages, and any race. <br />i don't think i have seen such good animated movies like this in such a long time. i absolutely loved this movie. and you know what? my guyfriends loved it even more than i did!<br />a movie you wouldn't want to miss and would never regret. thanx to miyasaki who keeps our dreams and imaginations alive. <br />yup, miyasaki's done it again. <based on theatrical release>
B000066NW0|5.0|Everyone should definitely go get a copy of Avril Lavigne's \\"Let Go.\\"  It has everything anyone could want...from the punk sound of \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" to the mellow mood of \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Naked,\\" and even to the smooth rap flow of \\"Nobody's Fool.\\"  This album fulfills everyone's need for downright \\"wicked cool\\" music.  Avril is definitely an inspiration for people of all ages.  Her uplifting music and positive messages allows us all to know that we're not alone in our struggles through life.  Its nice and refreshing to hear lyrics that aren't the typical bubble gum pops, such as Britney Spears and N'sync.  The words have genuine soul and meaning.  All I can say is don't blink, because this superstar is rising to the top whether we're ready for it or not!
B000066NW0|5.0|this album is one of the best albums ive ever heard.. i could really relate to the things Avril sing about like her song complicated.. which is about how ppl have to act liek someone else to be liked.. but ya you will surely like this album and you wont be able to stop listening to it.. it makes me happy when im down and it helps me with my stress.. there is no reason why you shouldnt buy this album :) trust me.. it's Great! :)
0743518136|4.0|I really liked much of the book and I enjoyed taking the test but I found the presentation of the results to be marketing of their services and the book kind of slipped up in the vary areas I expressed concerns about to Pathfinders.  ...
B000066NW0|5.0|I love Avril Lavigne's new cd, Let Go. It is very inspirational and uplifting. One of the reasons why I love it so much is that Avril is a sk8er and sings about alot of that kind of stuff and i think it is great for the sk8ers to have some one to look up to because in the past the music industry was over populated by Brittany Spears and Christina Agularas and it is so refereshing to have sum one like Avril to pop onto the music scene. I also love the cd because if your in a bad mood or your not feeeling well u can just put in the cd and you seem to forget everything else. One song that I praticularly like is &quot;My World&quot; because it has an awesum rhythem and also it gives some people sumthing to relate to. Another favortie of mine is &quot;Sk8 Boi&quot;, because it has a really good lesson in the end, not 2 judge people and not to care wut other ppl think and just be yourself and like who u want. I absolutely love all the songs on Avril's cd , and i dont even like that kind of music generally, i listen to punk, rock, heavy metal, things like those and very rarely listen to pop, and alot of my friends were supprised to find out my love of the new avril lavigne cd cuz thats just not the kind of music i listen to, but there r exeptions to every rule and avril is definentally one of those exceptions. I have a strong feeling that Avril is going 2 sweep the nation wit her rhythmic melodies because she can reach so many groups of people. I have had some troubles in the past in dealing with depression among other problems but with no word of a lie I bought this cd and listen to it a few times and I knew I would get over it and suddenly I felt better than I ever had before, and now I feel like I am on top of the world, and that is amazing how much a song or in this case cd can change things and how powerfull it can be. So for that i have to thank Avril for without knowing helping me through what I found the toughest point of my life and turning it around to one of thegreatest points in my life so thank you, Avril Lavigne. This cd is truly amazing and powerful, it is one of the best cds I have ever heard in my entire life. <BR>yours truly,<BR>Eryn McCulley
B000065U1N|5.0|Some view Black Hawk Down as just a great Friday night action film with lots of death and destruction.  They couldn't be more wrong. <BR> The film is based on the great book by Mark Bowden. At the beginning of the movie the audience is given a brief overview of the ongoing situation in Mogadishu, Somalia but here's a more detailed background... <BR>A majority of the film is devoted to the fighting and does a beautiful job of showing what war in those kind of situations is like.  They are more mentally challenging then physically challenging.  ...Action lovers will love gobble this tasty treat right up, however do realize that this event is very true and that 18 Americans and hundreds of Somalis died during this battle.    This is to be respected during a film that ranks high on the short list of great war movies.
B000002J20|5.0|This album is pretty much as direct as Yes ever were..not so much because they were making perfect sense, but the band seems to all be akin to what each other is talking about, musically speaking. Though Wakeman didnt care too much for this album, the keyboards DO NOT suffer. This is the album that Wakeman used the Mellotron most, and I am to believe that is the reason this album is soo peaceful. The fist song is really neat..the way it turns...the way the melodies just leap out. Its kind of the thing words cant put meaning to, you know? The second song is my Favorite. At exactly 2:58, it begins (Im listening to it right now). That insane weaving melody...scares the hell out of me. The most pure reason this song is so far gone. This very melody repeats itself 2 times in the beginning.. and makes a final appearance at the end of the song, to bring it to a climactic ending. Thats why Yes is so odd...when they find a REALLY good chord structure, they never use it too much. They like to tease you with it really. About the second song again...the chord structure at 15:48 is almost holy sounding. A VERY religious sounding album.<BR>The third song is great...a very neat tribal feeling to it really, and the pedal steel is really interesting. The acoustic section is pretty inspiring...and even dabbles in a bit of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (you guitarists know what I mean). Finally, the last song. Very very good, but not the best. Infact, that goes to show how much I like this album really. Fourth song is VERY good, yet it is my least favorite. Does that make sense? I think so. Buy it yourself...listen to it...be prepared...be spiritual.
B000066NW0|5.0|What ever you do dont let go of this cd. if your thinking about buying it stop thinking and buy it. you may have heard avril's single complicated if you liked that song youll love the cd. this cd is full of great songs like loseing grip and sk8er boi.Avril is a deep thinking artist and shows that in her lyrics. her songs are well thaught out and prove to be great because of that. p.s hi avril remember me ericmouseboy
B000065U1N|2.0|A little blood and guts goes a long way.  I tried to look at this film with an open mind and tried to see what the director was trying to get across to his audience. If he was going for &quot;shock value&quot;, than he did his job. If he was going for entertaining,,,,he failed.When i go to the movies or buy a DVD i like to be entertained. I'm a proud American and would do ANYTHING for my country. I don't need to see a film that has so much pain. Granted war is hell and i know what it is like to lose a friend(s) to war. But why do we have to be constantly reminded of this type of sadness throughout a movie.The acting is really well done and i don't say that lightly because if you read my reviews i'm pretty harsh on non-broadway trained actors. But the acting in this film was quite wonderful but the director could have gotten his point across without the terrible gore and pain. For acting i give this 5 stars, for directing i give it only 2. Sorry.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Every Sunday nite for the past three weeks (wow, what a streak) I rent movies. That's just procedure. I got Zoolander last Sunday along with They Call Me Trinity, which I have already submitted a review for.<br />Here's what I thought of Zoolander:<br />!) Ben Stiller is wonderfully original and funny as the equal opportunity idiot in his role as Zoolander.<br />2) Owen Wilson has fine style and is a wonderful actor.<br />3) Mugatu was just plain hideous to look at.<br />4) The \\"walk-off\\" segment of the movie was just plain stupid. Who proves anything coming down a runway? <br />5) What is with that pulling the underwear out of your pants thing? Ouch!<br />6) Matilda was fine in her role as the perky reporter type. And she's also hot.<br />To put it simply, Zoolander was a selection for Sunday nite that I did not expect to pan out. Thought I'd be watching The Practice or something instead. <br />I'd watch this movie again, but it only deserves four stars for horrid fashions and for the somewhat awkward scenes (the run-off) and for.....you guessed it.....MUGATU!<br />--teenlibrarian--
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I really enjoyed Donnie Darko. The movie intersects different people's lives and emotions in a very thought-provoking manner. It doesn't make in fun of paranoid schizophrenia, a disorder in which Donnie suffers from, but shows the depths of his degripping from reality and how it affects the people he loves, such as his family, his girlfriend, his friends, and his community/school. His intelligence also plays a key factor in how amazing and yet ironic Donnie is portrayed. The actors, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, etc, brilliantly showcased the anguish, pain, remote happiness that these characters dealt with. In most films,you never see the main character who has extraordinary intelligence, yet struggle with the same mind that gives them that same intelligence, plus the fact that he tries to find out more about what is making him have these visions of Frank, the demonic rabbit, is enduring. The concept of the end of the world/time travel is an amazing and original idea that I think, has never been captured so brilliantly in a film before. No one really talks about what would happen if we could go back in time and change what we did or said, or how we'd feel if the world suddenly ended. The fact that Donnie tried to find an explanation and then sacrifices his own life to give better ones to his girlfriend, family, etc. is touching. With the subject of the end of the world, it's wonderfuly projected how the people involved took time to give us Donnie's thoughts on what he thought about the world ending, how it made him feel, his conflictions w/ God, philosophy and simple everday life.Someone who isn't very interested in religion, philosophy, or science fiction,like myself, would have looked at this movie and been like, \\"This looks like crap\\", but I was fortunate enough to see the movie and see something different...original than what I have seen in movies today. A very warm, disturbing, yet original film that has inspired me not to take for granted the mental health I have, the family I have, the life I live. It is my best and all-time favorite movie in my life.

B000066NW0|5.0|Hey, I just wanted to say how much avril has inspired me! her songs are so real, and i can relate to them. she has inspired me to become a writter,singer and to even play the guitar! she is so real and awesome!! I mean, its hard to put into words on how much she has inspired me! I listen to her cd every day 24/7. she has changed me, and i am so greatful for that! I would love to meet her, even if i could only say hi. Im so glad that she isnt another brittney spears!! Avril is the real thing, and no one is better than her. when i heard the song lossing grip, i automaticly thought of my X-boyfriend. and that song is exactly how i felt. so everytime i think of him, i turn on that song. and the song naked, whoa i can relate to that one! gosh, i can relate to basicly every song, cuz they are so real!well, i am almost at the 1,000 word limit, so im going to stop typing.<br />Thank you Avril, for everything. you have changed me into a better person. i was going thru some very tough times, and ur music helped so much. thank u so much.<br />Love always &amp; forever,<BR>-Lauren
0812550706|5.0|Ender is a young boy who faces all kinds of demons in this book.  In the not so distant future, aliens have already attacked once, and are about to attack again.  Those in charge are scrambling to find someone to save the world against the aliens, and Ender is the one they find.<br />Ender's Game is entertaining and well written, but those who read it purely for entertainment value will also find something much greater.  This book forces you to think about some critical issues.<br />To put it simply, this book is one of the best there is.
B000009MF7|5.0|I have to admit that I came to this disk with some lack of enthusiasm.  First, Boulez can seem a bit to controlled and cold for my tastes at times (but lately he is changing my mind!) and though Zimmerman is a magnificent pianist, the G major concerto and the Concerto for the Left Hand is not often really played well.  I was after the orchestrations of the Valses nobles et sentimentales.<br />Well, the performance of the G major concerto won me over enough to listen a few more times.  I have to admit that I have become hooked on it and have come to understand why this is such a favorite.  It really is a wonderful composition.<br />The pieces I was after - the Valeses nobles et sentimentales - are exquisite and played here with utter beauty.  A joy to listen to over and over again.  Even if I still REALLY love the version for solo piano (being a prejudiced pianist).<br />The complete stunner on this disk is the Concerto for the Left Hand. It is almost unbelievable how well this is played.  Even with the score right in front of you as you follow along you can't believe this is actually being pulled off so cleanly and with such a thoroughgoing conception.  I can't help imagining cheers and waves of applause every time I hear this performance.  This disk is another treasure in my collection.
020161622X|5.0|This book is an excellent distillation of practical experience and advice covering all phases of software development. While it's written mainly for the software developer, project managers will get valuable insight from the book on effective software development practice. The strength of this book is that it draws heavily from the authors' experience. Rather that promote a methodology, it promotes attitudes, values, tools and proven practices that will help anyone become a better software developer and make the job of software development more creative and stimulating. It's especially good for new software developers as it contains many lessons that experienced developers only learn the hard way. The book is well organized in easily digestible segments, with a very good cross reference system that makes it handy for repeated use. The appendix presents many valuable resources that professional programmers will want to explore.

Finally, Julia Quinn has created a book about Penelope and shifts our view to the world of the Bridgerton's and of the antics of the ever charming third Bridgerton brother, Colin. <br />Julia Quinn has created yet another satisfying book that will again enchant her readers as well as help resolve  that little bit of mystery that has left her loyal readers pondering in frustration......who is  Lady Whistledown???
6303014100|5.0|i saw the movie before i read the excellent novel,however, i was not disapppointed by either. martin sheen to me is absoutely perfect as gen.lee and tom berenger steals the show with a low key preformance gen. longstreet(although jeff daniels has his moments as col. chamberlian) for anyone not familair with the actual battle this film will bring you up to speed in one viewing and entertain at the same time. in my opinion it gives very balanced view of not only the battle itself but the complex issues that both sides delt with as soldiers and most importantly as men. one side is never portryed as completely right or completely wrong. however what is captured on film is altogether completely human. ecellent flim!! recommened!!!
0966638328|5.0|I probably use Pantone's Guide to Communicating with Color more often than any other design resource book.  It's the first book I refer to when starting a new project if I'm the one to determine the color palette.  Not only does the book give a good overview of what different colors mean to a viewer, it includes more than 600 color palettes in 28 categories.  Each category lists the feeling that is evoked and provides Pantone numbers for each palette - a &quot;grab and go&quot; feature I've used on low-budget and/or rush jobs.<br />Finally, the book is full of outstanding real-world examples of projects using the palettes discussed.  Even if I'm working on a project with an already established color palette, I turn to this book for design inspiration.  <br />In my opinion, this is a must-have book for any designer.
B000065U1N|5.0|What's not to like about &quot;all shooting and explosions&quot;?  This is a war film.  What else do you watch war films for?  <br />I had seen the documentary with actual footage, but they missed a lot!  This is a true story and I had no idea what those guys went thru for the good, old U.S. of A.  All I can say is WOW!  <br />This is a must see for anyone who thinks the USA should be the world's police force.  It's a very dangerous position.  See it!
B000066NW0|5.0|i became an instant fan when i first saw Avril's &quot;Complicated&quot; video. when i got the album, i was totally blown away. this girl has got more talent than i have seen from anyone in a long time. on the down side (its small tho) her songs are a bit more pop-ish than i was expecting. from the way she talks in interviews and the way she is portrayed, you comes across as a singer who sings on the hard rock/punk side but most of her songs are pop-ish. but the CD is still wonderful tho!
0312265859|5.0|It's been 8 books and yet I still don't tire of the characters in Stephanie Plum's life.  Stephanie is still bumbling around and it's still fresh.  Ranger fans will love this book as well as he gets plenty of paper space (although never enough for me!).  Grandma isn't in this one as much which is a bit of a bummer as I so love the father's reaction to her.  My only regret is that once again I've read the book from front to back without stopping and I now have to wait until next year when the 9th one comes out.  I'll be waiting Janet!<br />If you haven't read any of Janet's books....do it now....and start where it all began, \\"One For the Money\\".  You'll enjoy the journey to Hard Eight.

0312265859|5.0|I'm a big fan of this wacky mystery series featuring Jersey bounty hunter babe Stephanie Plum and her bizarre family and super sexy love interests.  Evanovich's humor and moment by moment inventiveness don't fail in this eighth book in the series, which I highly recommend for a fun summer read.  Stacking it up to the rest, it's not my favorite, as there are some odd loose ends here - a rival bounty hunter babe in a leather catsuit, for example, who is never explored or paid off.  However it's worth the read just to see Stephanie and the mysterious Ranger finally get it on.  It's not five stars for literary merit, or even the best of her series,but even Evanovich at her less-than-best is way, way better than most.  Guaranteed fun!
B000001FKY|5.0|This is THE album for Def Leppard fans and anyone who is new to Def Leppard. This album released 7th of August 1987 has many hits.  The hits are &quot;Women&quot; hit Number 80, &quot;Hysteria&quot; Hit number 10, &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; hit Number 2, &quot;Love Bites&quot; the biggest song on this album and career so far hit Number 1 for 1 week, and &quot;Armageddon It&quot; which hit 3.  this album which stayed on the charts forever was 1 for 6 weeks and stayed in the top 40 for 96 weeks.  I recomend this album to anyone who likes rock music or just want to listen to something different.
B000007ODM|5.0|Well, what's not to say about this album?  It is somewhere between heaven and earth, between Enigma and Mythos, and yet neither.  Era quite comfortably creates its own unique niche with this album.  It has a European-Medieval flair while dancing on the fringes of New Age.  At the same time, there is some excellent guitar riffs, much like the great rock ballads of the past.  Tony MacAlpine immediately comes to mind.  The synthesizers mixed with the Latin Choir is strongly reminiscient of Enigma, sounding parallel and yet diagonal.<br />If you enjoy losing yourself in the rhythm and the emotional feel of music, then you will definitely enjoy this album.  Just sit back, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and drift into the choirs that will lift you to heaven and then dive into the oceanic lull of the rhythm that will swiftly return you to earth.<br />This music will definitely whisper to the ear of your heart.  Where it will take you depends on the openness of your soul.
0790731479|5.0|This movie is a very odd movie but I love it because it doesn't follow that Hollywood way to make a movie.  This movie stars Winona Ryder who plays Lydia Deitz, who is very sad and depressed.  The movie is about a couple who dies and a new family moves into the house and the couple doesn't want them there because the mother wants to redecorate the house.  this movie has an all-star cast Geena Davis, Alec baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey jones, and many others.  This movie was released the 30th of March 1988.  The DVD I think could have been so much better and they could have included deleted scenes and bloopers because you know there has to be some.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is truly one of the best books in the Young Adult Science Fiction category. I'm a bookworm and an especially great fan of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and I can honestly say that Sabriel is one of my all time favorite books. It has an exciting, intense plot, realistic characters, and an imaginative setting. If you want to read an action-filled and inventive novel, Sabriel would be one of the first books I'd recommend.
0140042520|5.0|Kerouac is now the book that should be in the hands of all the youth that want to have an orientation on life. Japhy Ryder is now the man, and Ray is the way to get through this pathetic world. <br />This author really came to give me a light in my sad life.
B000068QY7|5.0|nobody, and i mean nobody, writes songs like noel gallagher. Before telling you what this album is, I'll tell you what it isn't. it is not teen rage rock (limp bizkit, korn etc..). It is not angst-filled &quot;feel sorry for me&quot; music (nirvana, pearl jam etc..). And it is not amongst the Blink 182/Third eye Blind genre that all sounds alike, and gets tiring before you finish listening to their first song. With that established, I will tell you that while not their best (then again, no one, including U2, has had albums like Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory), this is a great album by the best band around. Little By  Little is a great song, Songbird, written by Liam, compares with some of Noel's better but not best songs, and The Hindu Times rocks in the same vain as Go Let it Out, D'ya know what I mean, and Roll With It. Oasis is the heir apparent in the long line of great British rock bands, starting with the Fab Four and continuing on with The Jam, and the Gallagher brothers have simply taken their rightful place
B00006690G|5.0|This new album certainly proves Marshall Mathers is no \\"one hit wonder\\", this CD is even better then the last.  All the songs have meaning, not like the normal rap that says nothing and means nothing.  You can't go wrong with this CD if your one of Slim's fans!!
0783226128|5.0|Al Pacino gives one of his Best performances Ever!!  His portrayal of Tony Montana,an early 80's cuban cocaine kingpin, was not only colorful, but if you spent any time in South Florida during that period, it was absolutely \\"true to life\\".   Brian DePalma's direction was accurate and entertaining. This movie tells a tale of a cuban refugee who makes his way from a \\"delivery boy\\" in Miami's 1980's coke scene to one of the most powerful men in the drug business. Drug hits, cartels, payoffs, police corruption, columbian drug lords and dirty politicians; this story is gritty, gutwrenching, gory, graphic and entertainment at its best.  A MUST SEE!!!
0312265859|5.0|This was the best Stephanie Plum Novel yet.  It had me guessing from the start, laughing all the way through, and left me wanting more.  Janet Evanovitch manages to pull you into the story and makes you, the reader, part of it.  It was wonderful and it has made me want to read them all again.
0380789035|2.0|I was very much looking forward to reading this book because I really enjoyed Neverwhere.  The premise and beginning of American Gods were great but the second half was terrible.  The &quot;plot twist&quot; and climax were very poorly thought out and not interesting in the least.  It seems like Gaiman got tired of writing this book half way through and just scribbled down some nonsense to finish it.  I'll think twice before reading another of his books.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|One of the coolest films ever made, DOnnie Darko is different fro manything else I've seen. The story is confusing and comples  and requires repeat viewings a visit to the website and the commentary track to understand. To some that may seem like overkill, \\"shouldn't the movie explain itself?\\". But personally I love the way it works out. You have to really explore and think about this film before you truly understand what has happeend by the time it ends. Visually the film is stunning. Filmed with very subtle camera moves and bright, yet wet looking colors it creates a perfect atmosphere. Everything looks normal, but it carries a slightly eerie feel to it. As far as acting goes, Gyllenhaal is fantastic as the lead. He shows little emotion when normal, however when he goes into his trances he gets this strange glazed look on his face. Great acting. The rest of the cast is very good as well, although I'll never be a big fan of Drew Barrymore. The movie seems very real. The family acts lie kany normal family would. It doesn't feel forced or faked. The teenagers seem like ttenagers, they arent exaggerations of teenage stereotypes. The film is very reminiscent of the real world. Overall this is a very intellectual film. THer is no straightout comedy or action, but the film is funny at times and is often exciting. It would be very hard to find a catagory to fit Donnie darko. Many people will find it confusing and dull, many others will think that it tries to hard to be an intellectual film. However if you enjoy having to think about your movies, or jsut strange movies in general, Donnie Darko is a great pick. Probobly not the best choice for the casual FilmGoer who is just in it for a good time. This movie has a very independent film feel to it, without getting too pretentuous or bogged down in drawn out dialogue. Darko is excellence in cinema.
0312265859|4.0|I sit eagerly awaiting the next Stephanie Plum book, so let me begin by saying that Hard Eight is not my favorite of the series. I loved the humor in this volume it had me laughing out loud (as I had hoped for). Stephanie's adventure with her newest sidekick Kloughn had me ready to scream because he kept tagging along, but actually I came to love the scenes with him. I'm not giving a lot away by saying the dryer scene alone makes Kloughn one of the highlights of this episode in the Stephanie Plum series.<br />I may be one of the few though who found the last 50 or so pages to be a non-stop rush of events that built from her heated flirting with Ranger to a blink of an eye event that made me go back to make sure I hadn't skipped over some pages. The book flashed over a scene between Stephanie and Ranger that made you think \\"Wait, What happened?\\" It was like a cliffhanger that wasn't because you knew the answer but none of the facts. Let me just say Stephanie and Ranger have had some of the hottest flirting through several of the previous books and Hard Eight let it hit straight ice water. Nothing to do with the books but fans keep saying \\"Oh Ranger couldn't be relationship material\\" and this book made gave in to those fans that have been waiting for that.  Why?  I love books with a mysterious hero who you don't know too much about but ends up being a good guy (which so far Ranger has been he cares for Stephanie).  Consistantly through this Volume 8 especially Ranger is there watching out for her making sure she's got security, has bullets in her gun and when she calls he is there without fail what's not to like?  If he is a bad guy how does why is he the \\"Primo\\" Bounty hunter and as mentioned through out the series the guy the cops want to be carrying a gun?  Ranger doesn't seem to be a thug and Hard Eight gave him a Hard Ride, now, he's not mysterious, but an \\"Opportunist\\" doesn't sound like the Ranger we've come to know and adore.  Abruzzi (the bad guy of the book) was scary and had me jumpy, but in only a few pages it was over.  And why aren't the cops doing anything about this guy?  Stephanie is the star of the series, but it looks like the bounty hunters (Stephanie/Ranger/Vinnie) take down more criminals than Joe (vice cop/homicide detective).<br />The book seemed to heavily edited or something. I love that Janet usually has the book full of Stephanies thoughts about everything that happens to her and in this book two rather major events went wham bam thank you ma'am fast without satisfying me. I'll read the book over and over because I love the series but it's not my favorite. The humor of the book held me though, so it is worth a try, but if you wonder like I did what happened in the ending you aren't alone...<br />The audio version is decent, but I was thrilled to discover that this time around CJ Critt was back with a version through Recorded Books.  After listening to her rendition of the book I was forced to raise my rating of 3 stars to 4 simply because there are things she brought to the story.<br />Unlike some I'll keep reading Janet as long as she keeps me laughing.  My complaint quit switching narrators on the audio versions Recorded Books is the company for quality and CJ is the narrator who brings Stephanie's story to it's full potential.was scary and had me jumpy, but in only a few pages it was over.

B00005N9CV|3.0|It's been done before. Julie London and Barney Kessel. Diana is very talented but she would be better off to develop her own unique style. Julie London hasn't been dead long enough for all of us to forget her.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I am so happy that I watched this movie, when it first came out I never wanted to go see it because it just looked boring.  But recently I went to rent the video and found out that that was the biggest mistake I had made.  It's fantastic! I had never really been a fan of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor, but this movie totally just changed my view towards them both.Now I am a total Ewan fan and am really happy to discover this.  I find him totally suitable for his character, very charming in doing his part and I love his voice, there are not many actors out there that can act well, AND sing well, but there's Ewan.  The story although is not original and the songs also but It blended together perfectly, Your Song, Come What May are my personal favorites, I'm always rewinding back just to listen to the songs and now I got them both on computer! I would totally recommand this film to those who have not seen it.

B000066NW0|5.0|The thing that really made me like Avril was that she was herself all the way. She didn't care if people liked her that much only if she got her message out to people. She is a skater/punk and totally cool! It is so nice to have someone who won't wear skimpy outfits and get implants just to be \\"cool.\\" I really like the music. She has rock in it but still shows her feminine side. I think of myself as like her. Everyone at school may make fun of the music I listen to, the clothes I wear, but I don't care. I really like her style too! The tie with wifebeater is totally awesome! If she gets really famous...I am sure she won't change just because she is famous. Also, if I hear any preppy people saying how much they like her I will just say, \\"Listen to her lyrics!\\" Because...in \\"Complicated,\\" one line she says...\\"Take off all your preppy clothes!\\" I mean COME ON!!!haha. Well, Avril Lavigne is my hero practically. She does what she loves, not just what other people want her to do!
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is tied for my favorite band with STP, but man this is a great cd.  From the head bangin opener Stinkfist to the classic Eulogy to the personal attack song ...(man that kid should go crawl in a dark hole and stay their forever) to the breathtaking 46 & 2, and to the melodic title track and H, These guys are pioneers, and this cd just builds on their reputation as the greatest metal act around.  ..., Tool is the best and will always be the best.  Every cd just keeps getting better with these guys, and I dont see a change in that staement ever coming.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne, a new artist, is so amazing. She writes her own songs whenever and wherever she feels like it. When you hear her songs you can tell she writes them herself because you can feel that that is how she feels, whats shes going through ,and just like her whole emotions put down on paper. She is the most awesome person I ever heard of. She doesn't need to dress,act,sing like someone else to get peoples attention because she is her own and she doesn't need anyone to make her change the way she looks like other singers just to be popular. Her album &quot;Let Go&quot; is so good. All her songs , I mean &quot;all&quot; her songs have deep feelings. That's all I have to say. You guys vote for her on Mtv,Trl. Keep her on the top countdown.
B000068QY7|4.0|(4 STARS)  I was hesitant in getting my hopes up with the release of Heathen Chemistry.  This is due to the previous 'Standing On The Shoulder's Of Gaints'.  Although it wasnt a bad album, it definitly didn't reach the olympic heights of the first two albums, or arguably the third album.  But to my suprise this is definitly a return to form in reference to melody, song structure, and song writing.  Although Heathen Chemistry doesnt stike you immediatlly, dont let that fool you into thinking it's a lack of quality material.  It doesnt have the over the top sound which came with 'Definitly Maybe' or 'Morning Glory', But does have substance.  Highlights would include 'Hindu Times', 'Little By Little', 'Songbird', 'Stop Crying Your Heart Out', 'All In The Mind', and 'She Is Love'.  The biggest suprise of the new album is the level in which Liam has grown in his songwriting skills.  Big difference between 'Little Jame' and 'Songbird' or 'Born On A Different Cloud'.  It will be intresting to see where this new discovered songwriting talent will take him.  I cant wait to see what he writes for the next album.  There are some weaker moments on the album but there overshadowed by the strong material.  If it only had one or two more strong singles, this album with rank up there with there best.  I would place this in a close third place with 'Be Here Now'.
B00006690H|5.0|I dont own this cd but my friend does its great! ive only heard 2 of the songs (without me & cleaing out my closet) but there great I want the cd but just havnt got to it yet but if you want this cd but arnt totally sure take it from me this is a GREAT cd its my fav cd it has my fav song it has a good price but its the clean version so I might not be getting this \\"version\\".
0792163710|5.0|This film has inspired every Western since. It is an all time classic. This is a smaller budget Western with a less known star then the Duke. Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider, is a remake to almost every point of this film. Shane holds a place in the hearts of many Western fans, as well as many film fans in general. It is one of the top American films of all time. The DVD is a beautiful and worthy edition of this classic. If you collect Westerns, this is as important,and needed as &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Paramount: great job on restoring this Western masterpiece!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is completely original and I totally respect her for being that way. She doesn't let the media or anybody else mold her into something she doesn't want to be. If only all the artists who are so increadibly talented could be the same way... She has an awesome voice and actually plays the guitar herself. She rocks!
B000002B1M|4.0|... It was written is a very good cd but nothing can beat stillmatic the only reason stillmatic is better though is because most of the songs are fast but on the cd it was written most of the songs are slow but if u have (or have heard) It was written u suggest you buy stillmatic the best song oon stillmatic is \\"Got Ur Self A...\\" (AKA Got Yourself A Gun) well get out there and buy some nas!!!
B000026C3T|5.0|The reason i bought this 2 cd collection was because of Stairway which by the way is overatted(but it's still an amazing song).<BR>I listened to the first side (69-71) and all the songs are great from hard rockers like &quot;Black Dog&quot; to a blues &quot;since ive been loving you&quot; and a beautiful mystical sort of track in &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot;. I think the second side is just about as good it includes their 10 minute epic &quot;Achilles last stand&quot;( Which i think is better then Stairway, because its flat out 10 minutes of rock and Bonzo smashes the drums like anything. It also includes Ballads like &quot;all my love&quot; and even reggae D'yer Maker&quot;. It shows how diverse led zeppelin were and that they could do more then just hard rock. So overall this is a great start for people new to Zepp.
B00006AL1G|5.0|I saw this movie last week and I was absolutely blown away.  It covers the whole history of scratch DJ'ing in hip-hop from the very beginning up to the present day.<br />Probably the best made documentary I have ever seen - fascinating content, presented in a way that really captures your attention, and funny too..<br />Excellent.
B0000026VZ|3.0|this is a pretty good CD but I'm not an obsessive fan either.  It has 2 or 3 major hits that they had that I play pretty often, mostly &quot;Africa&quot;.
B0000024JA|5.0|The Dirt. The Grimey, the basement beats and sound quality, the straight up RAWNESS.  This is the real Method Man.  The rough cat, the blunted, the crazy look, the dirty style, the charisma, theflow, the lyrics...oh my.  He gave Wu-Tang its first star.  Forget ODB, Forget Ghostface Killah, Forget The Rebel INS...When this album dropped he was the BEST member in Wu-Tang.  Who could forget M.E.T.H.O.D. Man?   <br />Tical was the second classic that had the W stamp on it.  Everything you love about the Wu could be found in here.  The Rugged beats, the street rhymes, the raw, the real anthems.  Low sound quality ( at times you can't even hear what he's saying) and all that is a straight fiyah classic from Wu-Tang's most known member ( other than ODB of course).  His flow is untouchable on this cd.  Non rehearsed, freestyle sessions no retakes this is where it's at.  The classics are here to... Bring Da Pain, All I Need, What The Blood Clot, Meth Vs. Chef, Release Yo Delf, Biscuits...the whole cd.  IF you don't have this I feel sorry for you.  Nothing else to say.  5 Stars.
B00005NWM3|1.0|...The vocals smell, the bass is shocking and the drums are just ridiculously bad...
B00005NWM3|1.0|This CD has been collecting dust since I bought it!  It was a complete waste of money because all the songs sound the same and the lead singer screams most of the time.  I love bands like Linkin Park and Staind, but Nickleback seems to just be an echo of groups like Nirvana.  I don't think they will last unless they find their own style of music.
B00005S8FC|4.0|Gotan Project's &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot; is the hottest new disk making the rounds of milongas internationally.  It is a controversial disk - people either love it or they take the position that &quot;it is not tango.&quot;    That controversy has had much play on the Tango-L listserv.  If we look to history, we see that even the tangos of Astor Piazzola were also greeted with controversy.<br />Tango is a phenomenon where the dance came first, and then was followed by the music.  It began with Argentine and Uruguayan folk music, then was expanded to include waltz, habanera, and jazz.  Why not bring tango into the 21st Century?  That is what Gotan Project has done, and with a great deal of success.  It is popular in milongas from Austin, Texas, to Montreal, Canada, and Paris, France, to Berlin, Germany.  You have a wide range of music on this disk, and my favorites include an arrangement of  &quot;Vuelva al Sur&quot; by Piazzola, &quot;Queremos Paz&quot; written by members of the Gotan Project, and &quot;Chunga's Revenge&quot; by Frank Zappa.  There is a reggae influence, and more than just a trace of samba.  In addition to the music of the traditional bandoneón, violin, guitar, contrabass, and vocals, Gotan Project also uses percussion and electronic keyboards.  <br />If there is a fusion of Argentine tango [performed by a Paris-based group] and the beats associated with contemporary music, so be it. Judge it yourself.  As for me, I will dance to it.
6300182355|4.0|\\"Flash Gordon\\" was the movie George Lucas originally wanted to make.  But, when he found out that uber-producer Dino De Laurentiis had purchased the rights to it, Lucas decided to make little movie of his own that made a minor splash in the box office.  I believe it was called \\"Star Wars\\"  ;-) heh heh.  Perhaps it's best that Lucas did not get to direct \\"Flash Gordon\\" because I doubt that even he could have made it any better than the minor Saturday serial it became.  Of course, \\"Flash Gordon\\" is not a bad movie.  At least, it isn't in the strictest interpretation of a bad movie.  It has all the elements of a really bad movie:  bad acting, laughable dialogue, cheesy special effects, and a rock musical score that just about deafens the audience.  Combine all of these elements together and you have a campy movie that is a hilariously good time.<BR>   The movie begins when the evil Emperor Ming of Mongo (played with scenery-chewing flair by Max Von Sydow) gets bored and decides to torture and destroy Earth for his own amusement.  This leads to some really cool shots of hurricanes blowing, volcanoes erupting, and hot hail (!) falling.  Alas, Ming made the unfortunate mistake of causing trouble for the plane carrying Flash Gordon and Dale Arden.  They crash into the laboratory of mad scientist Hans Zarkov, who tricks them into accompanying him in his rocket to travel to the source of the attack on Earth and stop it.  There is no doubt that Flash will do that, but, the ride is fun, nonetheless.  There are some fun planets in the Mongo universe, none of which seem to be constrained by the necessity for oxygen, laws of gravity, or plain common sense.  There is an entertaining scene early in the movie where Flash attacks Ming's guards (who seem to be an assemblage of mimes and pig-men) by running through them as though he were a fullback and hitting them in the head with items that look like a cross between a Faberge Egg and an iron football.  The acting in this movie will never come close to winning any awards other than a Razzie, but it fits perfectly for this movie.  Sam J. Jones and Melody Anderson both play Flash Gordon and Dale Arden as air-headed Ken and Barbie clones.  Ornella Muti is a particular treat for all hormone-charged males as she plays the sexually seductive daughter of Ming, Princess Aura.  There are even reputable actors like Timothy Dalton, Brian Blessed, and Topol (not to mention Von Sydow) who camp it up with the best of them.  Rock legends Queen also provide a rocking good time with theme song and the pounding soundtrack.<BR>   \\"Flash Gordon\\" will never achieve much more than minor hit status and cult favorite (and inspiration for more than a few drinking games).  Yet, it is still as much fun to watch on the 50th viewing as on the first.
6305622914|5.0|If this had been done by Hollywood they would have cast &quot;lookers&quot; instead of real/average blokes. It's the ability to relate to the guys in this film that makes it so memorable. <br />The premise seems silly but it works because the actors are so believable. Average guys who are out of work and needing money for a variety of reasons - child support, self-esteem, lifestyle, etc. They see women spending money to see a Chippendales show and  decide that they could make the money they need by doing their own show and offering &quot;the full monty&quot;. The rehearsals are great as are each man's struggles with the idea and reality of what they are facing.<br />I've recommended this film to several friends, all of whom loved it as much as I do. If you like to cheer for the underdog you should enjoy the movie as that's what it's all about.<br />I still can't see a garden gnome without getting the giggles. If this makes you curious check out The Full Monty!
B000002UVZ|5.0|One rock journalist, back when \\"Monster\\" was released, remarked on the hard rocking quality of that album, calling it the first departure of that sort in R.E.M.'s canon. If I'm to be heard, I would say that, before they were stars, back when they were still headlining at the 40 Watt Club and making indie-tuned ears swoon, R.E.M. had already made something as close to a hard rock album as they had gotten to that point in Document. <br />First, consider: R.E.M., by 1986-7, had made a name that would have persisted had they not taken the major label bait and become alternative-rock spokesmen. Lifes Rich Pageant was their fourth album, and their strongest to date. It was also their first Big Rock foray, setting the stage for the grinding Document of next year, the album that gave them a mainstream toehold. Lifes Rich Pageant was the primer, and Document the consummation of that whole \\"Rock Hard You've Already Altered History\\" phase they'd hit. It's one of the best albums from that halcyon period of college radio, indie rock, and DIY aesthetics.<br />The opener, Begin the Begin, is a burly foretaste of this new corridor the band had entered. Strong-shouldered and infectious, the song references a now offensive child's book and Longfellow (\\"Mile's Standish proud...\\") in an efoort to capture the turmoil of those hellish Reagan years. The song is also noteworthy, in my opinion, for having the most coherent lyrics of any R.E.M. song to that point, short of maybe \\"Driver 8\\". Remember, Stipe was notorious for his mumbled delivery.<br />\\"These Days\\", the next song, is a frenetic rocker with barbed-guitar hooks and another set of topical lyrics. The most worldly and political album R.E.M. had released in their indie days, next to Document, this political tone is carried further in \\"Fall On Me\\", a song bemoaning acid rain and pollution. \\"Cuyahoga\\" is a melancholy treatment of Native Americans (\\"This is where we walked/This is where we swam/Take a picture here/Take a souvenir.\\") The chirping uptempo wistfulness of \\"Believe\\" and the throwaway chaos of \\"Just A Touch\\" carry on the speedy rock of the first few songs, while \\"Swan Swan H\\" presents an odd historical aside, referencing \\"Johnny Reb\\", etc. Guess which period it treats...<br />A great album, and their first big rock effort, NOT Document or Monster.
B00004TJWE|5.0|The Pretty Things never sounded this good or experimental.  Even though &quot;Parachute&quot; was written up in Rolling Stone Magazine as &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, this is more interesting.  If you are a fan of British 60's psychedelic period, this is the CD you'll want. Think of Syd Barrett's version of Pink Floyd, Tomorrow, the Beatle's John Lennon and George Harrison songs on &quot;Revolver&quot; through &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; or the Rolling Stones &quot;Dandelion&quot; or &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, and you'll get the idea.  The mono version is good, but this version is better.
079073804X|4.0|It's hard to believe that this movie is twenty five years old.  It stands up to the test of time very well and sets a standard for a much maligned genre.  The story of a possessed child and the exercise to roust the devil from within is actually done with a bit of class.  The movie has been so imitated and misappropriated throughout the last quarter century that it's difficult not to know the plot and outcome already, that said, the film still scares the bejesus out of ya'.  In the anniversary edition you get a new scene that is quite possibly the scariest part of the movie, I skipped back to check it out again after the flick was done.  Highly recommended.

B000002U82|5.0|Ok, this album, if you don't like it the first time you hear it, will grow on you every time you hear it. The first time I heard it, The Great Gig In The Sky put me off. Now, after listening to it time and time again, it is one of my favorite pink floyd songs of all time. If you have heard Pink Floyd and are even the slightest bit interested in them, pick up this album ASAP. It will make you fall in love with the Floyd. This album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for over 20 years! I think that alone should be enough to get you to buy this bad boy. Pick it up, put it in, turn it up, turn off the lights, and let the music intoxicate you like large amounts of marijuana.
B000066NW0|5.0|I rarely buy music, except for one or two Cd's a year. When I saw Avril Lavigne's &quot;Complicated&quot; on MTV, I ran to the store to buy it! Her original voice, interesting lyrics, and fun music will make &quot;Let Go&quot; keep spinning in my CD player! Buy and enjoy!

B000068QY7|3.0|What can I say about the latest from the brothers Gallagher... Firstly they still haven't climbed to the heights that Definitely Maybe reached. It most be frustrating to Noel have peaked so early on. Anyway:<br />1. The Hindu Times - Good track. Made it out as single. 3 Stars<BR>2. Force of Nature - Getting there. Much better track. 3.5 Stars<BR>3. Hung In A Bad Place - Now we're getting somewhere. This track ROCKS! I must have hit the repeat button on my CD at least four times. 5 Stars<BR>4. Stop Crying Your Eyes Out - Second single released. Strangely compelling. Good track and the only song that could have followed Hung In A Bad Place. - 4 Stars<BR>5. Songbird - What the F**K! We were doing so well. Aviod like the plague. 1 Star<BR>6. Little By Little - Ahh, much better. Bypass 5 and go straight to 6. Great Noel song. This will be a great live song. 4 Stars<BR>7. A Quick Peep - Instrumental. OK. 'Nuff said. 2 Stars<BR>8. All In Tne Mind (Probably) - An OK song. It's no Hung In A Bad Place. 3 Stars<BR>9. She Is Love - Kinda Folky. I could see Noel in a &quot;turtle-neck&quot; sweater in a San Francisco flok club playing this. 3 Stars<BR>10. Born On A Different Cloud - Freaky, but OK. 2 Stars<BR>11. Better Man - 38 Minutes! I thought to myself that I was going to hear guitar, drums, etc. Instead 4 mintues followed by 30 minutes of F**King silence. But a great song. 4 Stars.<br />Overall recomendation - Buy It.
B00005YUNY|2.0|Definitivamente yo esperaba con mucha ansiedad este nuevo DVD de Yes, pero resulto ser una decepción; no entiendo como un grupo de la calidad de Yes pueda lanzar videos donde siempre tocan las mismas y las mismas canciones, y cuando se deciden a tocar canciones pocas veces vistas o escuchadas incluyen piezas extremadamente aburridas. <br />Considero que Magnification es un álbum excelente pero incluyeron en este DVD las canciones menos apropiadas, el sonido es bueno pero no de gran increíble calidad como otros dicen, la orquesta casi no se escucha, los arreglos orquestales son mínimos, el teclado y el bajo casi no se entienden; no comprendo tampoco como Chris Squire, un gran músico, pueda tocar con una gran virtuosidad y con muy buenos arreglos e ideas las canciones, pero al llegar el momento de el mismo para hacerse resaltar haciendo un solo de bajo pueda interpretar algo tan POBRE Y SIN ESTILO, que cualquiera con un mes de lecciones de bajo pueda tocar, no entiendo!!; (¿porque no incluye sus ideas del bajo en las canciones para hacer su solo?); también se ve la falta de seriedad en el concierto al incluir músicos jóvenes (esto no quiere decir que no sean buenos músicos). Steve Howe luce increíblemente aburrido, como que no quisiera haber estado allí. La parte de video si es muy buena y profesional. Sigo sin entender como Yes teniendo una gran cantidad de discos y canciones solo se decidan por tocar siempre las mismas, comprendo que son clásicos, pero Yes no necesita de tocar siempre lo mismo ya que no es un grupo comercial que solo es conocido por las mismas canciones.<br />En definitiva, un DVD que no era lo que yo esperaba, es un concierto aburrido, con un sonido pobre para ser DTS, con las mismas canciones que otros DVD's....SIMPLEMENTE  DECEPCIONANTE.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This film is Val Kilmer's best work by far.  Not only does he show off his talent as a vocalist, but this is his most believable role in any movie I have ever seen him in.  Fans will enjoy possibly the greatest backwards scene ever made and the non-stop comedy.  Definitely on my top five movies list.

0790729628|5.0|After enjoying this film, viewers should consider the great influcence Blade Runner has had on new releases, including AI, The Fifth Element, Star Wars Episode II, and others.  This film is a hallmark of successful scifi drama and suspense without the overuse of special effects and camera tricks.  The director's cut is a bit longer and includes a different ending than the original Blade Runner, however I find this Blade Runner to be the most enjoyable.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Just very simply put, on June 28,2002, was watching Good Morning<BR>America on ABC, and was lucky enough to catch their profiling of<BR>this soundtrack.  Fell in love with it immediately, and went out<BR>and bought it that same afternoon.<br />Trust me, if you like real old-timey tunes, then this is the cd<BR>for you.  I've been playing it all week on my car's cd player,and<BR>love to sing along.  You can't help but sing along, and beat time<BR>too.  <br />Really a fine compilation of tunes, and for once, you can have a<BR>real fine time singing along with it.<br />If you like bluegrass or old-timey songs, get this cd.

0792151712|5.0|This movie strikes me with awe everytime I see it. When I think about all the money and all the work that went into that whole movie, it is just amazing. Many people say that this movie is very sad, and I guess you could say that it is, if you are into the romance aspects. I personally am not, and although I have seen this movie probably more than 10 times, I have not yet cried once during the very romantic seen with Jack and Rose. The thing that hits me the most, really, about the whole movie, is that the Titanic WAS real! People actually had to go through that. None of us can really say exactly what it was like to be on the ship as it sank, but I can't really imagine it being much much different then as it was portrayed in the film. The women and children who were on the Titanic actually had to say good bye to their husbands and fathers knowing full-well that they were going to die and that it would be very painful and harsh. People actually did jump off the boat, and it really gave me the idea of what the actual chaos was really like. I can't begin to imagine what I would do if I were ever in a situation like those poor people. So, I thought this movie was very real. I am not much of the romance type of girl, so I didn't really care about the romance in the story.<br /> ... My favorite part of the movie was most definitely: BILLY ZANE!! ...I thought he played an incredible role in the movie... he somehow ALWAYS pulls off that villain role perfectly! Everyone who watches the movie learns to hate him...The things he says and the way he acts is perfect, and I don't think anyone could've pulled off that role better than my Billy. ... You will not be disappointed with this one!! ...<br />  So anyway, I do have to agree though that some of the acting wasn't that great. Some people were just better than others. I thought Kate Winslet was alright... Leo was pretty good... Kathy Bates was good... the guy who played Lovejoy was good... the guy who played Mr. Andrews was good... The Captain Smith guy was really good. I didn't really think that Gloria Stuart was that great. There was just something in the way she said \\"I would like to see my drawing!\\" that just seemed fake. But I really did think that the best performance out of the whole movie was from Billy Zane, ...I think he did a great job of getting people to hate him and he always seemed real.<br />   ...I think that every aspect of it was great. I forgot to add something else... the music was incredible! James Horner is a total genius and I think that the music was the perfect exclamation point to the entire movie! <br />   I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in for a movie that is excited, romantic, and fun all at the same time. I think that it can be appealing to both men and women. It is like a \\"chick flick\\" with the romantic story... but it can also appeal to men with its reality and excitement. You get attached to characters during the story and you watch to see if they make it in the end...buy it, rent it, whatever you want to do. I don't think you will be disappointed unless you are very picky about movies...
6303257844|5.0|One of the most highly charged action films since Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the 1994 film SPEED is a model for how action films with fairly realistic situations should be done.  Long-time cinematographer Jan DeBont (DIE HARD; THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER) got behind the director's chair for this hair-raising suspense thriller that has a high-tech look and a familiar flair to it.<br />Keanu Reeves is the L.A. police officer out to stop a deranged former Atlanta cop (Dennis Hopper) from detonating a bomb on a bus going from Santa Monica to Downtown Los Angeles.  Earlier, Reeves and his partner (Jeff Daniels) had stopped Hopper from killing people in an express elevator in a highrise and collecting on a $3 million ransom.<br />Now, Hopper has raised the stakes even further.  He has demanded $3.7 million.  Even worse, he has made his bomb so that it will blow the bus up if its speed drops under fifty miles per hour.  With the way L.A.'s freeways work, this will not prove easy.  And when the bus driver is shot by a frightened passenger, another passenger, Annie (Sandra Bullock) is forced to take the wheel and keep the bus moving.  The result is a series of hair-raising turns, twists, and edge-of-the-seat suspense that climaxes at LAX.<br />The fun doesn't end there, however.  Hopper kidnaps Bullock off the street near Pershing Square in Downtown L.A., and Reeves tracks him onto a Metrorail subway train.  He finally does away with Hopper; but with the train's brake system disabled, he and Bullock must survive the train jumping the tracks along Hollywood Boulevard.<br />Winner of two Oscars, for Sound and Sound Effects Editing, SPEED is genuinely solid suspense and action, two hours worth of bang for the buck.  But aside from being all that, it is also entertaining, with a fairly believable plot outline, and some truly jaw-dropping scenes, including the bus having to navigate its way over a fifty foot gap in the still-uncompleted Century Freeway.  Reeves and Bullockmake for an appealing pair who manage to fall in love somehow during this crazy ordeal.  And although this is a role that he could have done in his sleep (so could Jack Nicholson or Bruce Dern), Hopper is a plenty nasty villain who shows nothing but contempt for Reeves, Bullock, the police, and the bus passengers.<br />A lot of action films are all about explosions, profanity, violence, blood, and guts.  SPEED has some of that, but it is also a well-crafted film, with elements of DIE HARD, Spielberg's DUEL, and the 1974 classic THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE to liven things up.  It is a sure-fire winner.
B000001Y79|4.0|I have liked No Doubt ever since this CD came out.  This is very excellent music, and most of the CD is worth listening to.  There are a couple of songs that really get on my nerves, &quot;Different People&quot; being one of them.  That is the only reason it is not five stars.<br />Worth the buy, if you do not already have it.
B000066NW0|5.0|i think this is the best album out there right now, it is one of the only albums i own that i can listen to the entire album each and every song and not get sick of, i just went to the canada day jam and she was wicked she has a lot of energy, i think she will be around for along time. i hope she comes back to toronto soon.<br />                                            much love to u all <BR>                                              AVRIL RULES
B000066NW0|4.0|This is an excellent CD for this genre of music.  You can listen to the entire CD without skipping any tracks, which is a rarity most of the time.<br />The music is well done, for the most part.  Sometimes she edges towards punk music, as in &quot;Sk8er Boi.&quot;  Her lyrics are good for someone so young, but sometimes her age shows through.  Some of the lyrics are a bit immature, but what do you expect from a 17 year old?  This is not the case in all of her songs, and most of the songs are very strong lyrically.<br />My favorite track is &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; but like I said before, all of the songs are worth a listen.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's debut cd is one of the best I have heard, she brings much needed bluntness to subjects like rejection and having no one to depend on. Iam looking forward to anything she comes out with. She covers all angles happy, depressed,goofy and any other emotion you can think of on her cd Let Go. In my opinion she is a great writer and for a teeneager has the best music around. Do yourself a favor and either listen to the cd or buy. I guarantee once u listen to it you will want to buy it
B000066NW0|5.0|Sitting on the couch channel surfing is what I was doing when I first heard Avril Lavignes up beat rocking first single &quot;Complicated&quot;.Immediatley I was drawn to the tv and starting singing with whatever words I could catch onto.I instantly got online and did a complete search on this awesome girl named Avril..the obsession begins.<br />&quot;Let Go&quot; her debut album is the best 12 dollars I have spent in quite sometime.Not only full of hard core rockers that deal with everyday life as a teenager like &quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Losing Grip&quot; it also contains deep ballads about being comfortable with who you are like &quot;Naked&quot;.With this cd you are not getting one kind of music like rock, you are getting probably five including rock,folk,pop,punk and some weird awesome stuff you wont find anywhere else! <br />I think this cd from Avril will be one of many to come and I hope she stays here a while for us teenage girls to relate to.
B000002MY3|4.0|The '90s was a decade marked by good CDs from many female rockers, such as Sheryl Crow, Natalie Merchant, and Sarah McLachlan, but Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill is clearly one of the stickouts.  Moreover, among well-known '90s CDs, only Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten compare to \\"Pill\\" in intensity.  But Alanis's songwriting is more consistent track for track than Kurt Cobain's or Eddie Vedder's.  On this album, her introspective lyrics and riveting vocals are complemented by a smoking band featuring members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Any musical shortfall is made up for by the fire and panache of Alanis and her backers.  <br />Each cut on Pill is marked by sharp guitar riffs and clever lyrical hooks.  Interestingly, the songs seem to change tempo and intensity more often than the norm, moving between slow/soft and fast/loud, giving Alanis a chance to express her angst in different musical settings.  The rhythm guitar blasts in the choruses of \\"You Oughta Know,\\" \\"You Learn,\\" and \\"Ironic\\" are staples of FM radio, with intense and passionate vocals by Alanis.  In the slower moments she also sings well, softly beautiful or showing good range, as in \\"Mary Jane.\\"  In \\"Head Over Feet,\\" she demonstrates her ability to sing effectively in all the musical grooves. Opinions vary on this album--I have it coming barely short of five stars--but what I don't see at all is any shortfall in Alanis's vocals, which are superb.  You'll find many good songs and some great ones, and consistently strong performances by the lead singer.
B000066NW0|5.0|Wow! That's the first thing that goes through your mind after listening to `Let Go' by Avril Lavigne. The album is in a word extra-ordinary! From the moment the full power of her voice is let loose during the chorus of the opening track `Losing Grip' to the intensely personal concluding song `Naked' you are allowed into the life and mind of a young, and incredibly talented, singer/songwriter. For those out there who have prerequisites for so called `good' artists... Yes she does write her own songs...  Yes she can play the guitar... and Yes that is her own voice. (Note to all Britney fans: This is pure talent... not miming!!) She is by far the best new artist of 2002. At just 17-years-old we can only expect more from this young female artist. While there has been a wave of new female artists recently, Avril stands out well above them. Her amazing voice coupled with her simple, yet elegant songs should be more than enough to convince you that Avril is the `real deal.' Once you first listen to `Let Go' you will have a hard time dragging yourself away from it. You have to play it over and over again. It is addictive. It is brilliant. It is Avril Lavigne!
B000066NW0|4.0|A Canadian born skater punk prodigy, who's here to show the world that there's more to female singers than pop, singing Britneys. This 17-year-old, is defintely a one of a kind. With her off the edge vocals, impressive lyrics, and rock punk sound. Avril Lavigne is anything but ordinary. Hit songs like &quot;Complicated&quot; &quot;Sk8tr Boi&quot; and &quot;Losing Grip&quot; are just a few songs on her debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; that have thousands of females everywhere wanting to be like her, and thousands of males, wanting a girl like her. So move over Britney! Here comes Avril!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I wasn't privy to the great amount of hype everyone was talking about; I downloaded [err .. bought] the CD after hearing \\"Last Night\\" and a friend's recommendation. With that said, I can't remark on whether or not it lives up to the high expectations that others have referred to. The album IS great, though. Every song seems to be better than the previous, and it's easily playable numerous times in a row [especially considering its short length.]<br />Buy the album. Even if they don't happen to be the saviours of rock and roll, it's still extremely good.
B00005JKJA|5.0|what it's about; the ideal is in the suggestion...it don't need to be figured out to simply understand; take it in like something you've not had the pleasure of being somehow moved by.
B000068QY7|5.0|No one can deny the obvious connection between Oasis and the Beatles; therefore this album can be described in that way too.  This is Oasis' Revolver an album in search of creativity without trying to return completely to the world windstorm of previous glories.  Now that there are respectable tracks from 3 out of 5 of the members of the band one can say that Oasis are moving closer to becoming a full on band.  The Hindu times is lead and created out of an unmistakable riff that will sure to be a stadium killer and have the fans jumping out of their seats as soon as Noel plays the 8-9-8 8-9s10-8.  Force of nature is a hard driving single reminiscent of Noel's homage to T-Rex on Definitely Maybe or Iggy Pops The Passenger.  The first contribution from Gem, Hung in a Bad Place, is a great tune powered by Liam's snarl and good old-fashioned rock riffs.  Stop Crying Your Heart Out is possibly the best song on the album period.  The first of Liam's songs, Songbird, is a great sing-a-long song heavily laden with acoustic sounds and a Rhodes piano.  Little by little owes its influence to Pink Floyd's The Wall and transform into good old Oasis. The only complaint I have about this album is perfectly exemplified in All In The Mind, it is sometimes hard to hear Liam's Voice.  Noel's last song on the album She Is Love an obvious reference to his girlfriend Sarah, is a great acoustic song reminiscient of a faster You've Got to Hide Your Love away or a mature She's Electric.  Born on a Different Cloud, the second last track on the album and the sencond last track from Liam is another one of the big songs on the album and possibly single material. BOADC reminds me of John Lennon's Mind Games.  The last song, Better Man, is another John Lennon tribute, similar to Cold Turkey with its heavy distorted guitar influence, but once again it is hard to hear Liam's Voice.  Overall another stellar album from the self-proclaimed biggest band in the world, one more step towards to the AbbeyRoad and one more step towards joining the ranks of history's most influential bands.
B000068QY7|5.0|This album (as usual for this guys) Is terrific, amazing, incredible!!! no more words to this. They're back into the style from where they started their carrer (listen to Force of Nature to prove this) Heathen Chemistry is an album that sounds more like rock than SOTSOG, less dense, a lot more \\"edible\\" (easier to listen to). and of course, woth the money. This guys simply rock, there's NO ONE that can ever beat them.
B000009ED0|5.0|This cd is truly one of a kind! It is one of the only cds ever where every single song could be a hit single!
0930289234|5.0|If you've ever read anything with the title \\"Comics aren't just for kids anymore\\", you've probably heard about Watchmen. So, is it really that good?<br />  Oh god, yes.<br />  It's hard to review the collection without resorting to cliches -- and I'll employ one now. It gets better everytime I read it. I see new layers and depth.<br />  \\"God exists. And he's an American.\\" Most superhero comics take place in a world almost the same as our own. But surely, people running around in tights, people with god-like powers would make an impact. In Watchmen, they do. America won Vietnam -- thanks to a god-like hero. Electric cars exist. Classic comic books got cancelled when the real superheroes came along. Oh, and Richard Nixon is still president into the 1980s. (Too bad about those dead reporters, isn't it?)<br />  This is series a big ideas, human characters and personal moments. It looks at retired heroes (thanks to 1970s anti-superhero legislation) who investigate the death of one of their own. The book also features flashbacks, autobiography excerpts, comic book interludes and more.<br />  Truly engrossing writing by Alan Moore and art by Dave Gibbons.<br />  Oh, and comics aren't just for kids anymore. (g)
B00003CXI0|4.0|I've read the book two times (the four of them, in fact), and I love it.  The movie is faithful to the book and also most of the actors, especially Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore and Hagrid.  But I have to admit that the actor who played Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) wasn´t as good as I expected (altough he did look as I imagined Harry).<br />The backgrounds where great, and they did pay atention to details and that's what makes a movie magical.<br />In the end, I think it's a good movie, worth buying.
B00000K413|5.0|Tears for Fears was one of the best bands to come out of the 80's. There sound has not become old or tired over the years. They were light years lyrically ahead of their peers and it all started with this album. An extremely different direction lyrically even sonically then what was being played on modern radio at the time. Here you find an album that is based upon Primal Scream Therapy. I believe this to be part one of a trilogy based upon this therapy.<BR> The album has kind of atmosphere a depressed aura about it. The album as a whole deals with the pain from the wounds we collect over the years and how they affect us as we age. This album would seem just a pointles wine session if it wasn't for the fact that it was actually part of the therapy to get better and deal with the throws of life. So actually this album is about recognizing the pain, the hurt and start of the healing process. <BR> There really isn't any bad song on this album; all songs have something to say of meaning. The album plays songs that are catchy and poppy \\"Change\\",Watch Me Bleed\\". However there are sudden shifts were the band slows down about 3 notches from the previous song,such as \\"Ideas As Opiates\\" which may be hard for some people; and give the aappearance of a disjointed album. The best song on here is \\"Suffer the Children\\", a song that raises the question of single parenthood and why have kids if they are just going to be neglected.<BR> This album is a very focused cohesive piece of art. Well worth the money, the bonus cuts are remixed versions of songs already on the album, so mostly there for the dedicated fan. Listen to this album and you wont believe its from the early 80's. A timeless classic.
B000066NW0|5.0|Some people may think that Avril Lavigne is trying to be another Britney Spears knock off, but it is a mistake to think of her that way.  This 17 year old is more than that.  She keeps it real by writing all her own lyrics and they come straight from her soul.  Her phenomenal voice adds to the message she is trying to get a crossed in her lyrics.  She is a very talented and true songwriter/singer and will be in the music business for a long time. <BR> \\"Complicated\\", her first single off her first album, \\"Let Go\\", has more of a pop vibe.  It was good on her part to put this song out first because it has the ability to capture a large audience.  In the song she sings about how a person who changes themselves around everyone else.    Now everyone knows someone who is like that.  She tells it like it is and it has an awesome tune.  The video is also awesome, with its young and rebellious feel.  Avril rocks the television with her band mates. <BR> The songs that have the more alternative beats \\"Losing Grip\\", &quot;Mobile\\", &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot;, \\"Unwanted\\", and &quot;Naked&quot; show that she is not in the pop scene at all.  These songs can rock the house and have some awesome alternative beats.  She blasts through the speakers rocking out the emotions and events of her young life.<BR> \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" is more like \\"Complicated\\", with its catchy tunes.  She expresses that life should just be lived how you want it to be without all the complications of the world.  Many teenagers can relate to this song because they are still finding themselves out at that age.  <BR> The song, \\"My World\\", has an interesting story to it.  It kind of tells what is was like being Avril growing up. The more punky song, \\"Sk8er Boi\\", also has a story behind her wonderful voice.  It's the kind of song to rock out in your car too. Then in  \\"Nobody's Fool\\", Avril even busts out in a little rap!  You go Avril!     <BR> The songs &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; are beautiful lyrical songs on her behalf.  They are the more \\"slow\\" songs on the album that allow her to show how beautiful her voice is.  Her voice has so much soul and is well developed for a 17 year old and for her first album. I was blown away when I heard her voice on these songs.  <BR>  She does it all! Pop, alternative, punk,rap, and soulful.  You name it, Avril can do it and does on this album.  Avril is a very popular artist for her short time in the music scene and should be because she is the best artist at her age to come out in awhile. It is well deserved and I applaud her for her magnificent talent.  This is not the last we have seen from Avril.  She is a very talented songwriter and we will see more from her in the future.
B0000020C4|5.0|This is a really great recording. The philharmonic is as always incredibly solid and doesnt drown out the actors or steal the show. The cast was absolutely incredible:<br />Colm Wilkinson is Jean Valjean. His voice is really powerful and he portrays the character so well and is very faithful to the character in Victor Hugo's novel.<br />Philip Quast is a great Javert...Quast plays the firm, uptight, opinionated inspector to perfection...<br />Ruthie Henshall is my favorite performer on the CD. She plays Fantine like the ruined woman that she's meant to be. Her voice is so powerful. She performs \\"I dreamed a dreamed\\" so well. I was so depressed after hearing it... <br />Jenny Galloway is great as Mme Thenardier. She is funny as well as nasty. But I think that she and Armstrong are the weaker members of the cast.<br />Alun Armstrong isnt all that great as Thenardier. His accent is great, but his performance of \\"Dog Eats Dog\\" just isnt as great as the guy on the Broadway recording. He isnt as nasty and hateable as the Broadway Thenardier...<br />Lea Salonga was a good Eponine. I dont know if I prefer her or Frances Ruffelle... But Salongas voice is just so great, and her performance of \\"Little Fall of Rain\\" was breathtaking. It was so sad... <br />Michael Ball was amazing! He was so so good. In \\"Little Fall of Rain\\" he was incredible. I loved the way he says \\"grow\\" just after Eponine dies. He was so good at hitting the high and low notes and was the best Marius Ive ever heard...<br />Michael Maguire was good as Enjolras. Ive never really paid much attention to that character, but his voice blends in too much with the rest of the Students. His voice is very powerful though.<br />Judy Kuhn is much better on this recording then she is on the Broadway recording... Her voice has matured in this recording, and she fits in just right.<br />The songs are all great, but \\"One Day More\\" just doesnt sound right. Some of the voices are too far away, and everything seems to fall apart towards the end. The Thenariders ruin it. They dont sing theyre part like in the other recordings, but they break it up and sing lines every now and again. Marius and Valjean clash at the end. It wasnt all that bad, but I didnt fell like itdid the song justice. Also, some verses were missing from \\"Lovely Ladies\\" the prostitute never asks Fantine for her necklace, and the whole section in which the prostitute is asking Fantine why she thinks shes too good to be a prostitute is gone. Also, \\"Building the Barricade\\" is completely missing... I was pleased to see songs like \\"The Sewers\\" and \\"Fantines Arrest\\" on the album, because those were missing from the other recordings. I really wish \\"Death of Gavroche\\" was on the album, though.<br />...We miss the beginning of Mme Thenardiers' part in \\"Master of the House\\" because the audience is laughing. But its great to hear the audience cheering at the end of the finale. Also, because it is a live recording, we hear the actors acting. Salonga really made it sound like Eponine was dying in \\"Little Fall of Rain\\" (I mean that in every positive way). Micahels Ball's chuckling in \\"Red and Black\\" is great. The cast are a lot clearer in this one than in the Broadway recording...<br />Overall, this is my favorite recording, and a perfect CD for any Les Miz fan.
0425173755|5.0|\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is probably one of Agatha Christie's best known mysteries, thanks largely to the excellent movie based closely on the book, but it's also one of her best mysteries on its own.  Here is Hercule Poirot, the rotund Belgian detective, whom we meet in the restaurant car \\"trying to keep his mustaches out of the soup\\" as the Orient Express is about to begin its run across Central Europe.  Also on board are an English governess, a British colonel, an American pseudo-philanthropist and his multilingual secretary, a Russian grande dame, a Hungarian count, a garrulous American matron of certain age, and others representing various countries and nationalities.  During the night, one of the passengers is found murdered in his bed, and we learn the next morning that the victim was a vicious child kidnapper and murderer who richly deserved what he got.  But who gave it to him is the mystery to be solved.  It's the typical English parlor mystery transplanted to the exotic setting of the Orient Express, and it's a brilliant switch.  Enter Poirot, sifting through the facts, half-facts and outright inventions, until the mystery is unraveled and we find out not only whodunit, but also who Poirot's fellow passengers really are.  It's one of Christie's most satisfying novels, perfectly crafted, concisely written, and totally on target from first to last.

B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead takes the wintery/autumnal dissonance of Joy Division mixes it with the urban claustaphobia of Dr.Dre and adds the cold sensuality of 60's spy-noir films and creates Dummy. I must agree with another reviewer on here: if you are a fan of good music, you have to have Dummy in your collection.
B00003CWNR|5.0|I am not sure how I missed this fine movie; perhaps because I was not enthralled with John Irvings first novel and the film adaption that followed, and overlooked Irvings books and films since. I checked out Cider House Rules because Michael Caine was in it. Michael Caine gives a great performance and the step-back-from-the-action style of acting of Toby McGuire was appropriate for this film. <br />On the surface the film seems to be about abortion but in actuallity it is about choices. Michael Caine is the doctor at an orphanage and performs abortions for young ladies in distress. Toby McGuire is an orphan and the doctor's student. A student who does not agree with the teacher's choice to do these abortions. Of course, he will come to a turning point later when he must make a decision that he does not want to make. More than being a film about uncomfortable choices it is a film about human growth (Toby McGuire) and human frailties (Delroy Lindo). When a apparent decent person cannot rise above his weaknesses and be a responsible civilized being - there lies a story. Delroy Lindo plays his part so well that even when he does something so terrible you could not possibly forgive him, you still feel bad for him. <br />The film takes place during the early stages of the second world war when the depression years are still heavy on everyone's mind. The time period is well done in the actions and the faces of the people. If you appeciate a fine cast and enjoy a film that presents you with questions and doesn't always answer them, then this film is for you.
B00005JKO3|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made. Another great preformances by Charlton Heston.
0380820846|5.0|Probably a great many people will disagree with me when I say that prior to this book my favorite in the Bridgerton series was Viscount Who Loved Me.  I don't think a great many will disagree with me when I say that Romancing Mr. Bridgerton has replaced  Viscount as my favorite Julia Quinn novel and therfore my favorite romance novel, period. The dialouge between Penelope and Colin was even more snicker inducing than Viscount and this book had the added advantage of a slight mystery (Lady Whistledown's identity) to keep the reader entralled.  Colin, always my favorite Bridgerton brother, is finally characterized as something other than the easy going, charming third brother that he is pictured as in the other books and Penelope grows from a tongue-tied wallflower to a woman with enough spine to suit anyone. The characters in this book are believable, likable and at times downright laughable.   As for the identity of Lady W, never fear.  All is revealed, but to mention her name in this review would deprive readers of the pleasure of finding out for themselves. A note to those who haven't read any of the other Bridgerton novels I would suggest you do so prior to reading this one.  Not because it is vital to understand the story but because it will help you to understand the dynamic of the Bridgerton family and bsides, each of them is an excellent book well worth reading.
B0000025AI|5.0|Johnny Winter shines on this album.He is in fine voice as well as incredible musicianship. Nobody screams as well as Johnny.He also plays National Steel acoustic on two songs.What a slide player!!! He duets with Muddy Waters on Walkin' thru the Park.For me, Everybody's Blues is the killer on this one.He'll tear you heart out with his finesse and feeling on this one. I believe he even plays drums on this. An added treat is James Cotton on harp. Him and Johnny are priceless when they trade licks. What more can I say?It's a truly classic full of feelin' blues album.
B00005YW4H|4.0|if you don't already.  It's simply amazing- I picked it up on a whim about 4 months ago and have become addicted.  It's a smooth, mellow blend of jazz, folk and country styles.  Norah's voice is breathtakingly beautiful, and she really showcases it over the 14 tracks on this album.  My favorite song is her re-make of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart,&quot;- the bass line is so catchy, and she sings it with real spirit.  The title track is one of the most beautiful, simple and earnest love songs I have ever heard.  Additionally, I saw Norah in concert about a month ago in NY.  It was one of the best shows I have ever seen.  She is destined for great things- she has real talent.<br />To the reviewers that complain this album is too &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;boring&quot;- I can only assume they listened once or twice.  Mellow, yes.  Wistful, yes.  Boring- not a chance.  It's a relief to finally discover a new artist with true talent and a love for music.  Buy this album- you won't regret it!
1577311523|5.0|All you need to do is stop and be very still.  I am a university student, studying psychology.  I am always questoning my experience.  After exams, or when I have just handed in an assignment I have always noticed a strange peace which comes upon me.  Its as if the struggle is over, and we can start living now.  My perception of the outside world is also slightly diferent.  Things for some reason seem to glow a bit more, as if they are coming to life.  The shapes do not change, but the experience of them does.    <br />Athletes feel the same way.  It seems that we all have milder versions of what Tolle experienced;his was more complete.  The book is beutiful, a real gem.
B000068TPN|5.0|I would recommend that anyone that is under the age of 30 or anyone who only paid attention to newspaper and TV blurbs, Go see this movie. It's not about whose the best actor, or is this the best war film (i recommend to the gentleman who wrote that he wanted to slit his wrist, save the dying fo a good cause, he now has the oppurtunity to join the service and see the real thing) This is the unrecognized americas son's who went, served,loved, laughed, cried, and died for thier country. The old saying some gave all, all gave some is held true in this film. Nobody came home whole, it's time we seen and remembered and recognized what they did.
0380820846|5.0|Sometimes, when an authour gets tied to a series, the later books become formulaic and a little boring. Fortunately, this was not the case with Julia Quinn's latest romance novel, \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton.\\" This latest installment about the Bridgerton siblings was well worth the wait (I think that it took slightly more than a year for this novel to be published), and is, I think, the best book in the series so far. This novel is a wonderful mixture of romance, poignancy and whimsy. I fairly devoured the book, and was quite saddened to have finished it so quickly. I was also left with the fervent wish that there were more novels like this one out there for me to read.<br />Miss Penelope Featherington has been in love with her best friend's elder brother, Colin Bridgerton, ever since she was sixteen. Unfortunately, Penelope is not a raving beauty, or a gregarious, charming wit. Somewhat quiet and shy (and a little plump), Penelope is the sort of young lady that fades into the woodwork, and not at all the type to cause Colin's senses to swim. The years pass (about 12 to be exact) and Penelope has resigned herself to both remaining a spinster and having her love remain unrequited, when Colin Bridgerton, who has taken to traveling extensively in order to escape his managing mother's attempts to marry him off, returns from Cyprus. Now, Penelope sees Colin almost everyday, and at every social do. She discovers that she is as deeply in love with him now as she was all those years ago, and wishes fervently that she was the kind of woman who could ensnare his affections. However the Colin who came back is also slightly different -- restless, bored and a little discontented with the manner in which his life in unfolding. And while Penelope enjoys the time that they spend together, she cannot help but wonder how long she will be able to continue hiding her love for him? <br />After having spent so many years abroad, Colin Bridgerton returns to England, hoping to find somethingthat will chase this ennui away. Who would have believed that his thoughts would be full of shy, quiet Penelope Featherington?  And that he would enjoy her intelligence and dry wit to such an extent? Somehow, Penelope touches him in a manner that no other woman has before. And he finds himself wanting to protect her from the cruel and careless ways of the ton. His deep affection for Penelope, however soon begins to disturb him. Could he be falling in love with his sister's best friend? And does he even want to be in love?<br />Reading \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\" made me understand why so many other readers rave about Julia Quinn's talents. This was an entirely delightful and appealing read. I loved the manner in the authour made this novel to unfold. Julia Quinn took great pains to first allow for Penelope's and Colin's friendship to be reestablished by allowing them to have some really meaningful conversations, where they actually discuss things (like his boredom and her unhappiness over always being on the fringes of things), before she eased them into a romance. Ever so often, the hero and heroine barely share a thought before they begin their rather erotic encounters. So that it was a treat to have Penelope and Colin talk, and not about politics and social issues either. I also liked that although Penelope has loved Colin forever, she doesn't simply nod her head and agree with him on everything under the sun. Penelope has her own opinions. And even when she senses that her thoughts may not be the ones that Colin wants to hear, she doesn't shirk from sharing them with him. This is one romance that is, I think, really going to stand the test of time. <br />\\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\" was a truly wonderful read about unspoken dreams and love. Mostly, however, eventhough this is a Bridgerton novel, this is a book that is actually all about Penelope -- about what life is like for a spinster who never 'took' and about the dreams and desires she never expected to be fulfilled. I found this novel to be an outstanding one, and one that was definitely worth treasuring.
B000066NW0|5.0|Actually I don't give her 5 stars but actually i give her 10!! I think her cd is the best cd ever made and all her fans need to spread the word! All the songs rock and I cant wait to see her in concert next month!! I can't wait till her second cd comes out and the following ones after that! She is a great inspiration to me and has helped me become a pretty good singer! Thanks Avril! I hope all you other artists out there realize that she is the new madonna and will set her own catagory to beat! Nelly, Britney, Em, you all need to move aside cuz \\"Without her\\" this world would be empty. \\"Avril\\" sometimes a fan just needs her (get \\"Let Go\\")... \\"Its gettin hot in herre\\" so buy Avril's cd!!! You rock girl and never give up Hope you stay strong and I hope to see you soon! L8er!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne seems very wise beyond her years in her debut cd 'Let Go'.  Avril talks about true life events that all teenagers go through rejection, love, hate, etc.  When I bought gher cd I was blown away by how the lyrics are so real and that she wrote them all which is amazingly good for a girl of only 17 years.  'Complicated' is her first single off the album and it has a more pop vibe but her whole album is not this way.  'My World' shows a side of her growing up in a small town Nappanne, Ontario.  'Nobody's Fool' sends a message that you don't have to be like other people want you to be just be yourself.  My personal favorite on the cd would have to be 'Things I'll Never Say' it is about a girl being too shy to say things she wants to say to a guy.  The whole album is great and if you haven't already you should go and buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
0312265859|5.0|Stephanie Plum is pretty inept as a bounty hunter, but she is persistent and sometimes she gets lucky.  She is branching out in this episode to help a friend in trouble.  Others have said this is a darker story than Evanovich's previous novels.  I can't agree.  I burst out laughing after reading the first line in this book and the laughs continued through the whole story.  I keep expecting to hear that JE has branched out and is now doing stand up comedy.  The sexual tensions involving Ranger and Morelli continue.  Personally, I hope this never gets resolved...so much more fun this way.  A new character, Jeanne Ellen Burrows, was very intriguing.  It will be interesting to see if she returns in future stories.  I hope so.  I liked her.  The plot line in this story is a little weak, but that's not why I enjoy this series so much.  I like to laugh and Evanovich does it for me every time.
B00004U2A2|5.0|Although there are parts in this movie that are enough to startle you, this isn't really a horror film.  There may be decapitations, the Necronomicon Ex Mortis (translating roughly into The Book of Dead Names of the Dead), and copious amounts of blood (in various consistencies, ranging from water to paint), but this is essentially, a slapstick.  Through the entire Evil Dead series, Bruce Campbell (the handsome, valiant Ash) is thrown through a total of six bookcases.  This movie is terrific, and the scariest part, in my opinion, is the opening description and history of the Necronomicon Ex Mortis.
B00005176F|5.0|I never understood why Blur doesn't have a bigger following in the US.  Sure, Song 2 was popular, but that was about the only crossover hit for the band.  The album is full of such great music... from Coffee &amp; TV to Parklife to Girls &amp; Boys to Charmless Man, the album is full of songs that are full of life.  I'm excited at the prospect of a Blur tour of the USA, because I know it would be an amazing show at a small venue.  If enough people get their hands on this &quot;hits&quot; compolation, however, that may very well change.
B00003CX9E|3.0|The story of Charles Foster Kane.<br />I liked the story, but I didn't buy into the hype!<br />A nice story, but that's it.<br />I mean, this movie might have been important fifty years ago, but times have changed!<br />Everybody who had anything to do with this movie, the writer\director, the inspiration, dead.<br />One of the AFI's most important movies of th 20th century, 20th century!<br />We're diving headfirst into century number 21.<br />Time to put away the toys of yesteryear!
B0000041Z3|5.0|I absolutely ADORE the middle CD with 2 and 3 on it... so I usually overlisten to just that one. But while reading the book version of Star Trek V one day, I listened to all seven symphonies in a row. What fun! This is a really great recording. And I am superpicky b/c I like my romantics/postromantics to be just PERFECT, not too fast but not too lugubrious.<br />In short, this is a good bet for Sibbe ;-)
B00005JKNF|4.0|Patrick Doyle's score is simply stunning. His best work to date. The true gift of a film composer is to enhance the emotional arc of the picture while NOT interferring or calling too much attention to itself. This is really good film made excellent by a fantastic score.
0446310786|5.0|It's inarguable that this is a terrific book.  It tells the tale of just how evil racism can be, and shows the best (Atticus Finch) and worst men can be.  I also think it's interesting that Truman Capote was the model for the character Dill, since Capote and Lee were childhood friends.

0897500482|5.0|...ultimately means self-knowledge, according to Bruce. And if that is so, then a person can learn a lot about themselves by reading Bruce's notes. Here is proof that this man was amazing mentally as well as physically. Not only did he have the spirit of a dragon, he had its wisdom as well. (Please note: in Chinese culture the dragon is not looked upon as a threat, it is considered to be a symbol of strong will and high intellect.) These notes are only the tip of Lee's iceberg. All his years of training led to what was written in this book, and his techniques were still growing and improving right up until his untimely death. It's a shame he went so young, but like his widow Linda has said \\"he lived for 32 years and died on one day.\\" So do yourself a favor: pick up this book and pay attention to 31 years, 364 days of an amazing, triumphant life.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Well, I liked the movie.  I saw it on a plane with headphones on a tiny screen.  I didn't see the original or read H.G. Wells so I was not spoiled.  I am going to buy it for my family because it was good fun. And if you want an epic based on H.G. Wells, go sit in a bookstore but don't complain about this one.
B00003CY0V|1.0|If I could give this movie a rating of 0, I would.  This movie is so bad, although it could have been good if you consider the world of hacking and how people could go to extreme criminal lengths with it.  That has already been covered (and in much better ways) by other movies.  It's just Hugh Jackman receiving oral sex while hacking, John Travolta acting cool, and Halle Berry's breasts.  Her breasts were probably the best part of the movie.

The plot of the movee was the only good thing about it but they just didnt play it very good.This is one for drama fans if u like movees that try to make u cry but dont then ull love this piecew of [poo].i wouldnt even use this piece as target practice it stinx so much.Jim carrey never do a drama like this again its ok 2 do one like the truman show  that was an awesome moovvee but the majestic [stinks].God Bless America
B00006690H|4.0|This CD is pretty good. I think it's a lot better than The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. For one, there's a lot less unnecessary cussing (which I like). And the songs are much deeper. For instance, \\"Hailie's Song\\" (my favorite) is an ode to his daughter, and for those who have been hit close to home by divorce (as I have), this is a song that we all could relate to. \\"Without Me\\", while it disses plenty, as always, it also is a very fun party song and is a major hit. If you like hip-hop with a beat, humor and a message, this is the CD for you.
B000002C1W|1.0|this is my least favorite PINK FLOYD album. they tried too<br />hard to be mysterioso and wierd and FLOYD-ian...and they failed<br />miserably. to ensure it was a PF album, they designed the<br />WIERD cover, the complicated and mysterioso album title and<br />added lots of sound effects and speech fragments, for you can't<br />really have a FLOYD album without them! And the dangerous<br />song titles, like DOGS OF WAR! AAH! I'M SCARED! The songs them-<br />selves really don't grab me, even tho' DAVE GILMOUR is in good<br />vocal form and still shines on guitar. The best song here is<br />ONE SLIP! I LIKE THAT SONG! I really don't remember how the se-<br />cond half sounds; I don't listen to this album enough! I liked<br />DAVE GILMOUR's solo albums better than this!<br /> WUUFFF!! Some other observations: I think it's funny<br />how they inserted the picture of RICK WRIGHT inside, especially<br />since his photo didn't appear on the album originally! Also, did<br />you notice how downbeat and depressing the two post-WATERS PINK<br />FLOYD albums have been? WATERS was a great lyricist and brought<br />some wit and humour to PINK FLOYD, two things that are absent<br />on MOMENTARY and THE DIVISION BELL! Why are they so depressed?
B00005B36H|5.0|This album was the first Tool album I ever owned and I will never regret picking it up off of the shelve. The best way to describe the album is that it is peiced together like a epic story Climaxing at &quot;Lateralis&quot; the convex for the title and ending with the usual tool distrofusion of art. The album hits you like a thirty pound sledge and sends you into a journey of trancical music that you can't stop listening to if you try. If Tool had made this album one single track it would have been fine with me. The album moves with itself so fluidly it takes you with it. I find it more similar to the Flow that is represented in &quot;Undertow&quot; except the pattern of listening has been adapted for our listening pleasure. This is not a Cd of hit songs, but a masterpeice as a whole.
B00005QG9J|4.0|An excellent CD. A friend recommended Incubus to me and within a week of downloading Incubus mp3s from the net, I decided to buy the album. It's a great album. The only down side is that it *isn't* one of those albums which you can just carry on listening to. If you want one of those types of album, I suggest you take a look into Counting Crows or the Smashing Pumpkins. Anyway, I highly recommend this album. Buy it!
0609610570|3.0|I found the book very interesting but anecdotal.  I loved all the stories; of course the names were changed to protect the guilty.<br />I would have found the book more insightful if the methodology being proposed was laid out in a more academic manner.  I don't think the book itself will become a management pocket guide.<br />It's definitely worth reading, and it's an easy read at that.  The stories are riveting and wonderful.
B000006TRV|5.0|My brother JOHN and I got this album for Christmas back in<br />1979 and I remember thinking at the time what a great album it<br />was! Over 21 years later, I still think this is a great album!<br />PINK FLOYD had completely dropped their jazzy and psychedelic<br />influences and had moved on to simpler, more hard hitting and<br />accessible music. Never before on any PINK FLOYD album had the<br />sound effects and dialogue been so successfully mixed in with<br />the music. And there are so many great songs here! This album<br />has it's share of hard rockers, like IN THE FLESH(my favorite<br />song here), YOUNG LUST, RUN LIKE HELL and also has some lovely<br />melodic softer numbers, like COMFORTABLY NUMB, MOTHER, HEY YOU<br />and practically all of side three! The string arrangements are<br />a nice touch, the lyrics are brilliant, the singing is very<br />strong, this album has it all. At the time, this album was very<br />unique; there's never been a concept album like it! This is one<br />of the best albums ever made!
0380820846|4.0|Quinn proves again why she is currently one of the most gifted writers of Regency romances. Continuing the Bridgerton saga with a somewhat unusual heroine and hero, Quinn brings out humor and wit as well as the romance. I bought this book one afternoon, and before I put it down, I was about 75% of the way through it. Can't wait to see how it ends! Hopefully, Quinn will continue the series as there are still Bridgerton characters to explore.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie ranks next to Saving Private Ryan among my favorite war movies of all time! Josh Hartnett delivers a strong performance as Sergeant Matt Eversmann during the Battle of Mogadishu in October of 1993. The objective of the mission was to capture one of Aidid's top lieutenants. The movie didn't get boring, and it seemed like there was almost nonstop action. The movie did have some gory parts, but you have to read Mark Bowden's book to truly appreciate director Ridley Scott's masterpiece. The weapons were realistic and the movie follows the book's storyline very closely. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of war or action films.
0451191153|5.0|When Ayn Rand wrote, her primary purpose was to depict her vision of the perfect human.  She wanted to show a man who exhibited the ideals of her philosophy, Objectivism.  In her beliefs, Ayn Rand stresses the importance of individualism, reason, integrity, and selfishness. To exemplify these traits, she created Howard Roark, her projection of the ideal man, in her novel The Fountainhead.<BR> Roark represents man as he should and ought to be.  His depiction is something toward which I will strive every day.  Fully independent, needing no reason other than his own, Howard is perfection incarnate.  He lives his life exactly as he sees fit; he will not sacrifice himself for the cause of another, nor will he live by any moral code or standard other than his own.  He does not compromise with evil, because it is only evil that can benefit from the sacrifice of the good.  He is a man with ability, and uses it to produce great work in architecture.  He does so with integrity; he refuses to build when customers demand that he change his design for the sake of pleasing traditionalists.  I found myself excited as I read about this intransigent man who refuses to compromise, and I silently cheered as he won a trial with the world against him by using his own reason as his only defense.  The novel itself illustrates man as a heroic being, and ends with Roark standing alone atop the world's tallest building, a building that he built.  His triumph was mine, and I strive to live that life every day, a life where humanity exists as it was meant to exist.<BR> Read this book.  If nothing else, it will at least present you with another view on how life ought to be.  Rand's words and views are more popular today than they were more than fifty years ago when The Fountainhead was published.  Politically, I am a libertarian.  Nearly every other libertarian that I know finds a lot in common with Objectivism.  I will end with my favorite quotation from the novel.  The primary villain, Toohey, asks Howard one night for an honest opinion of him; he wants to know what Roark thinks of him.  Howard simply says, \\"I don't think of you,\\" and walks away.

B00005QXDD|5.0|Not only is this CD entertaining, but also a classic mixture of rhyme, wit and great rock 'n roll.  Jack Black has a talent for music - even if the lyrics are explicit - that keeps you asking for more.  \\"**** Her Gently\\" is by far the best example of this juxtaposition - very dirty and hilarious lyrics.  But there is an extrodinary and gifted quality to the vocals, with an almost operatic form.  In a nutshell, Tenacious D is a compilation of Queen, Johnny Cash, Van Morrison and Rent (yes, Rent the musical), all mixed into one....but with some very adult themes...
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is amazing.  I would definitely tell everyone to go buy this cd.  My favorite is &quot;She Will Be Loved,&quot; which will definitely be a HUGE single!
B000068QY7|5.0|Wow!! Not what expected!  As a big Oasis fan (obviously as I'm the first reviewer) I had high expections for this album.  The singles prior to the release of Heathen Chemistry...'Hindu Times' (great rocker) and 'Stop Crying Your Heart Out' (excellent power ballad) wet my appetite for some classic Oasis music.  But I must say my expections were met in ways I would've never dreamed.  Let me tell you this....LAIM SONGWRITING CARRIES THIS ALBUM.  You still there?!  Yes, snarls and all...this guy has talent and beyond that unique voice.  To date the Oasis magic has stemed from Noel's earnest songwriting which has been recently evolving into superstardom (reference: 'Carry Us All', 'Gas Panic', 'One Way Road', and 'Sunday Morning Call').<BR>But Liam's three contributions on this album have you listening intently like never before.  For example, take 'Songbird' a folk rock ditty that'll never end up on an Oasis Best Of but where did it come from.  Liam's only song credit to date has been 'Little James' a simplistic jam rememberable only for its addictive NA-NAs.   I guess I chose a round-a-bout way of saying Oasis is creating something creative unlike anywhere they've treaded before.  P.S.-Liam's other two tracks are atmospheric guitar driven rockers in case you're not into folk rock.  I guess that leads us to Noel's contributions.  Traditional Oasis to be sure, but he's not taking that eventual next level in his music.  His songs like 'Force of Nature' show a slight variation, but he seems preoccupied in throwing venom and distaste and his ex-wife Meg in the lyrical content.  Has the divorce ordeal swayed Noel from elevating his music?  Does he need a B-Side to do it?  A guest musician?  We are waiting because he is too good to keep pace with his earlier accomplishments.  Nonetheless, he doesn't disappoint on 'Little By Little' and the two singles to date.   To sum up, if you've followed Oasis for years this is not the time to walk away.  This album is Oasis through and through, apart from Liam's sweet curveballs which will definitely keep this CD in your heavy rotation.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is amazing, it's rare that you can listen to a whole cd through without skipping a track. Starting with the awesome some 'Losing Grip' with it's meaningful lyrics pulls you in, but it gets better. Avril has a wide variety of music, and it amazingly talented in every area. The world was surely blown away with her first hit off of Let go..\\"Complicated\\", with it's melow tune, bringing in many new fans, me being one of those, and sure can be meaningful to a lot of teens today, letting them know it's okay to be themselves. I think she proves a lot with this CD, you can't exaclt classify her music..from the 'Pop-like' 'My World', to 'punk' tunes of 'Skater Boi', and accoustics in 'Tomorrow' and 'Too much to ask', you can't help but be blown away by her amazing originality, she definately states that she's not 'Nobody's Fool', because this girl is surely 'Anything but Ordinary'. She is truly inspirational, being only 17, with this amazing talent, and putting herself out there for the world, I know we will be seeing many great things out of this artist in the future, I would DEFINATELY recommend buying this CD! Buy it today and be blown away! Watch out world, here comes Avril Lavigne!!!
B000068QY7|5.0|Heathen Chemistry is a great album.  The album starts off great with the song &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; and is a great album throughout.  Other standout tracks include &quot;All in the Mind&quot;, &quot;Little by Little&quot;, &quot;Stop Cryin Your Heart Out&quot;, and &quot;Songbird&quot;.  This may not be Oasis' best album, but its easily the album of the year and a step up from their previous efforts (though all are good).  This CD is highly recommended and is easiliy a 5 star effort.
B000053VAF|5.0|this movie really struck a chord with me because it i never expected kevin smith to have so much knowledge of the religions.  i being a catholic, know about how we think of our religion as boring and old (or at least i do), so this movie was so intriguing to me, its also one of the funniest.  not only to jay and silent bob light up the movie, but ben affleck and matt damon act as their counterparts, whether it be arguing over church law, or just cussing at eachother....the dvd also has so many extras! deleted scenes are funny, and hosted by kevin smith....a must buy for kevin smith fans...or even for catholics who dont like going to church
B000008H1Y|5.0|You really do have to own this one,if you already have<BR>AQUALUNG,THICK AS A BRICK,THIS WAS,STAND UP.<BR>It hurts me so much,to hear the new stuff,it's exactly the same<BR>as Dire Straits,and that is awful.<BR>This album kicks and bites,and never stops changing tempo.<BR>It's obvious Ian Anderson is the master,but the rest of the band<BR>must be nervous wrecks,with the ever changing moods.<BR>Hope Tull do another concept album like THICK AS A BRICK in the<BR>future,then kids today will realise,that people over the age of<BR>40,make the best musicians.Or maybe standards have dropped.<BR>Buy this CD,you will not regret it,far better than Heavy Horses.
B00004YA66|5.0|I saw this on the night it opened, and the theater was packed.   I'm not normally a science-fiction fan, so I was leery of going, but I had seen clips of the film at Shea Stadium, where Dennis Quaid came to promote it and to throw out the first pitch on &quot;Turn back the clock night.&quot;  My friend and I decided we simply had to see it.<br />To say &quot;we laughed, we cried&quot; doesn't quite capture the emotions this movie evokes. Quaid and Caviezel are both wonderful.  It is impressive that they could have so much chemistry while only appearing on screen together for a few seconds.  As a lifelong Mets fan, I love how they prove they're telling the truth by describing what happened in the 1969 World Series.  <br />I cannot say how much I loved this movie.  I call it a combination of Field of Dreams and Back to the Future.  It has baseball, parent/child bonding, and time travel. What more could you want?
B00005JL3A|2.0|This movie is about people trying to survive and escape an area infested with zombies, dogs, and mutants.  Sounds like the game, but is pretty much far from it.  The zombies in the movie seem to hiss and growl more like tigers than flesh eating zombies, the dogs seem to be easily taken down, and as for the mutants, what mutants?  Except for that ONE.  For any true horror fan, i'd suggest playing a resident evil game (try the one on gamecube or re 2) watch the movie and if you're impressed by the movie then hooray for you.  I can honestly say that i was greatly dissapointed by the movie.  I gave it an extra star only because I could see it as another movie other than Resident Evil.  The movie did not do the game any justice.  If you're thinking \\"oh this person is just an re fan\\" you're right.  I just don't think the movie should have been called Resident Evil.  If they weren't going to make it right, then they shouldn't have made it at all. If it was like the game, it would have totally and inevitably been a horror classic.  Garunteed<br />Now, even if i weren't a fan, then I would say that the zombies were too clean, there was nothing scary.  How can it?  Not with that soundtrack.  There were times when I wanted to yell out Mortal Kombat.  I didn't care if any of the characters survived or died.  When I saw all those people introduced into the movie I thought \\"Well at least I might get to see some gory mauling and death scenes with these people\\", BUT THEN they go into this laser room.  The computer seemed to be more deadly than anything else.  It was as if I were watching a sci-fi movie more than a horror movie.  Very disappointing indeed.  Rent it, don't buy.  Better yet, forget it even exists.
B000001ELR|3.0|By this point, Kiss as a band no longer existed, and basically consisted of Simmons, Stanley, and whatever hired hands they felt fit at the time. In 1982, after the failures of Unmasked and especially Music from the Elder, they decided it was time to get heavy again and regain their fanbase. What this meant is twofold: a heavy drum sound courtesy of Eric Carr and a heavy guitar sound courtesy of a variety of studio musicians. Carr certainly delivered on this album, giving it the heaviest drum sound of any Kiss album before or after. Musically, it no longer sounds like Kiss, of course, but rather like generic early 80's heavy metal. The guitar work is flashier and has quite a different  style than Frehley had, more like Van Halen. In general, Simmons' tracks fare better than Stanley's, as the latter suffer from heavy overproduction. Standout tracks include I Love it Loud and War Machine, probably the two heaviest songs ever recorded by KISS. These have a raw sound, demonic vocals by Simmons, the aforementioned heavy drumming and would please most hard rock fans. The title track is also quite good, somehow the production on this one enhances the song. Finally, Rock and Roll Hell is also pretty good, and also interesting as it may be about the departure of Ace Frehley. The album is worth purchasing on the basis of these 4 songs. As for the rest, it depends on how much you like early 80's metal, but they didn't make much impression on me.  Of course, this is also the last album by KISS that I like at all, so if you like 80's KISS you may like the rest more. Gets three stars.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is brilliant!!! How could any one do anything better? She speaks her mind and is getting popular doing so! She also adds hot music to make it so much better. She speaks freely, dresses freely, and has a beautiful voice. She is like the female version of Eminem (Only not so voilent and so obcene!) you may say \\"What are you talking about?\\" but in a way i feel they are similar. They both talk about what is going on in the world around us and about their world. Neither of them are just singin' about [stuff] They are telling us the truth, and that is why i love Avril's album \\"Let go\\", because it is so true and so pure! Nothing about it is fake! I am most impressed with \\"Anything But Ordinary\\". She shows her true self and tells every one that she has to live for herself and be herself. No body can change that. I think that this CD is brilliant, and that you should all go buy it now!!!
B000068QVN|5.0|Grand Funk...loved by fans and scorned by critics were always at their best onstage. They debuted at the 1969 Atlanta Pop Festival as relative unknowns and were superstars overnight;packing out concert halls and selling truckloads of records. Their power is here now for all to savor on this collection of performances from the spring and summer of 1971.<br />For those of you familar with the 1970 &quot;Live Album&quot;,you are in for the sonic ride of your lives! Not only are the recordings superior in sonic clarity to that album but what a difference a year of nonstop gigging made! Mark Farner working the stage like no other,his guitar playing making up in sheer energy and gut power what it may have lacked in technical perfection,Don Brewer, a vastly underrated drummer,driving the band with locomotive intensity,and Mel Schacher,diminutive in stature but mighty of sound with his overdriven,milkshake thick tone and deft bass lines.<br />They place their stamp on &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;,nearly making it their own,deliver a version of &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; that stands head and shoulders above any performances before or since,fashion a sweet medley of &quot;I'm Your Captain/Hooked On Love/Get It Together,and give us an early version of &quot;Footstompin'Music&quot;which had first been cut during the sessions for &quot;Survival&quot;,shelved and later recut on &quot;E PLuribus Funk&quot; later that year.Sure,several of the songs are LONG..we're talking 1971 here folks! Grand Funk Railroad ruled the concert stage and the proof is right here...Their influence was huge,if not always given its due credit.<br />Their power was absolute....listen and experience for yourself!
B000002KDG|5.0|Rendered on consummate trusses. And Young embraces the canon that the range surpasses the grasp. For adverse to ornate growth was melancholy and the conceptual. Hence bled the serene and the fervent. For the record the foremost purpose was the cartel of the decorous demeanour and the evanescent. And Rust Never Sleeps furthermore muses on the nature of welfare opulence furore and absolute repartee the tumour culture endorses. Moreover the countenance of cataclysm was mused upon throughout. Cerebral Palsy was thoroughly germane. For the record becomes as rancorous as sombre and chastely tender through the repose of the crescendos the tongue nonchalance. Thus Rust Never Sleeps was rendered to bare the soul and grace.
B000001ELP|1.0|KISS had been singing about Rock Bottom since the start of their career, and they finally hit it here. The only good thing about this album is that it did so badly that it forced them to get their butts in gear and put out the hard-rocking Creatures of the Night. If this is your first KISS album, it will be your last (even if you like it, trust me they never sounded like this before or again). A concept album of a half-baked idea for a movie that was never made. Really a no-star album.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is the example of how a cd must be, its has to be original and so far away from ordinary songs.... Avril has made it,and honestly i must say this is the best cd i had ever bought, in every song of the album you can feel everyword, every sound ..... this is a cd that u must not just listen but feel it ....well.. what more can i say??....
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe's performance in A Beautiful Mind is awe-inspiring. An actor is good when he's believable, but an actor is great when he makes you forget that he's acting. His performance helps make this movie one of my favorites of all time. But, it isn't just the acting. Everything about this movie is great. I was depressed at certain points but overjoyed at others. Every element of this movie works magnificent together, and the final result is remarkable. Throughout the whole movie, Dr. John Nash (Russell Crowe) tries to reason his whole way through life. Yet by the end of the movie, the lesson Dr. Nash (and I) learned is that the only thing he couldn't reason, the only thing that he couldn't figure out, is the only thing he ever needed: love. This deserved to win Best Picture of the year.
B00005JKNC|4.0|I guess you just can't please everyone. I'm sure most of the people that hated this movie, loved &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; and &quot;Me, Myself and Irene&quot;. Anyone that says that Jim Carrey should stick to comedy roles probably also missed some &quot;lousy&quot; dramatic movies with Robin Williams, Tom Hanks, Kevin Spacy...<br />This is a great family movie. Unfortunetly, because of some bonehead reviewers that usually means it will do poorly at the box-office. I doubt if there will be any Oscar's coming to The Majestic, but I give Jim Carrey high marks in this movie as I did in Dumb and Dumber.<br />My therapist said it's OK to watch a sappy movie sometimes.<BR>It was about 15 minutes too long. Eh, I went and got dessert in the middle.
B000001F46|3.0|Even though this one has the 4 original members, Kiss the band were over after Love Gun, and this one is effectively the 4 members acting as solo artists (look at the track credits). This one gets a lot of criticism because of the disco sound, and if you hate disco there's a lot to hate here. Paul Stanley has 3 songs on the album, and two of them fall solidly across the Disco line. For me, &quot;I Was Made for Loving You&quot; makes me smile, much the way hearing &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; does - it's just so obvious. Sure Know Something is also &quot;good&quot; in the same way. Magic Touch is generic late 70's rock but not too bad. A highlight of this album is that Ace Frehley contributes 3 tracks, and these are the 3 best of the album. His cover of &quot;2,000 Man&quot; is great, the autobiographical &quot;Hard Times&quot; is also very good, and &quot;Save Your Love&quot; rises above the botched production job (who the hell added the backing vocals?). Worth buying for these 3 songs if you like Frehley and his interesting vocal style. Simmons contributes 2 songs, and actually plays on very little of the whole album as Frehley and Stanley play their own bass parts. X-ray Eyes is pretty good, Charisma isn't really here or there. Finally, Peter Criss basically sings his resignation letter over a generic late 70's number, and is absent from the rest of the album. Three stars.

B00003CXTG|2.0|I was very eager to see Pearl Harbor. I wanted to see how one of the most tragic days in American history would be translated to film. I was sure I would be satisfied with it... but I wasn't. Pearl Harbor is big-budget garbage. It takes a depressing day in history and turns it into a ... love story with pretty special effects. The attack on Pearl Harbor was entertaining, but not nearly enough to save this movie. Even the historical backround in the movie is off at times. Pearl Harbor should have been made similiar to Saving Private Ryan: cold, dark, and bloody. An R-rating would have helped, but Disney must have been too set on making Pearl Harbor a family film. Don't waste your time with Pearl Harbor, watch Tora! Tora! Tora! for a good take on December 7, 1941.
B000068QY7|5.0|This record absolutely rocks!! Anyone looking for an album with great guitar, vocals, and songs should buy this immediately.  Every song is great and I expect this record will go down as one of the better Oasis works.  I have seen Oasis live and nobody rocks with the same style and balls out attitude.  Oasis is back!
B000068QY7|3.0|I own all their import singles, albums, bootlegs, etc...  But let me be honest here, this is not a huge step from their last album which was above average at best.  I was hoping for a huge difference in this album, something harking back to Definitly Maybe or Morning Glory, but only a few songs actually lived to expectations.<br />On the whole, most of the songs on the album take a few listens for you to appreciate (or get used to.)  This is unlike their earlier work where you knew the song was a hit from the first few chords.  The strongest songs on this album however (Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Songbird, Little by Little, the Hindu Times,) are top songs.  Yet, it's not enough to offset the forgettable other 5-6 songs.<br />I had some high hopes with this one knowing they aren't getting younger.  The only sign of hope for Oasis now is that Liam is writing some promising songs, and he can be a fresh source as Noel seems to be searching for a good tune when it came automatically for him in his earlier days.<br />This CD is recommended only for serious Oasis fans who probably own this as they read it.  If you're not really into Oasis, don't get this one.  Buy Definitly Maybe or Morning Glory.  Heathen Chemistry, unlike certain reports have stated, is not like those 2 classic albums.
B000066NW0|5.0|I had the CD before it even came out on sale... I got the songs from a downloading service on-line. But I still wanted the CD. My fe`ance bought me the CD for me for our year and a half anniversary. He's really sick of listening to it... I play it all the time. It's my favorite CD to drive to. I would have to say that my favorite song would be #8 Anything But Ordinary. But I love all of them. It's a great CD and it's about time that there was an artist that was just being herself...an individual.<BR>She seems like she would be really cool and fun to chill with.
B00003CWOL|3.0|Should have been a really funny film; the cast was terrific, particularly Alan Rickman. However, I must ask, is there no other word in the English language apart from f...??<BR>Most of it was unnecessary and made the funny dialog tedious. Surely people can express themselves without the f-overload. What a waste of a fantastic subject.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is the next CD of Britney Spears, called Oops! I Did It Again and I think this album rocks!!!! I don't know why ppl have to be so rude, to Britney. She is pretty, sings great, and has great dance moves!!! Even my Mom, doesn't like her cos of the way she dresses. I like her though. Below is my review of the tracks...<br />1. Oops...! I Did It Again - This song, is great! I love the music video to it.<br />2. Stronger - A very uptempo dance song, it's one of my faves!<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - A very how you call it song, I don't know how to say about it but you know. It's okay!<br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - I like this song.<br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - I love this song, it is my second favorite.<br />6.What U See (Is What U Get) - At first I said this song sounds like Oops!, when my friend was over, and we listened to her Oops! CD and she said yeah it does. So this song isn't great, but good!<br />7. Lucky - This song is great! But why does Britney play Lucky in the music video??? <br />8. One Kiss From You - This one is a good song..<br />9. WHere Are You Now - I love this song, fantastic!<br />1o. Can't Make You Love Me - Another uptempo dance song, tune. Great one!<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It - This song is fabulous, it is my third favorite.<br />12. Girl In The Mirror (Extra Track) - I got the European Version of this CD, from an online friend from Germany.. And I say this song is great.!<br />13. Dear Diary - I love this song, I don't see why ppl say it makes them throw up! <br />So now you see, what my review is like on this CD. As you can SEE that this CD is great and so if you're a fan (HUGE) of Brit, then buy this CD. 100%!!!!!!
6300184064|5.0|'Brazil entertains the heart the softly stands beneath an amber moon.  Brazil is the kiss of two loves, clung together.  And when love is miles away, with a million things to say, recalling the thrills shared under twilit skies, Brazil is the place it returns to.'<br />With any luck, the optimism of these thoughts will get you through the coming nights.  For if Terry Gilliam's movie \\"Brazil\\" is at all prophetic, your days will ultimately destroy you.<br />Owing obvious influence to George Orwell's \\"1984\\", \\"Brazil\\" is set in a dystopian society where subtle propaganda aims to control your mind (\\"Don't suspect a friend, report him\\" and \\"Loose Talk Is Noose Talk\\" being my favourite examples of the ever-present signage that marks the landscape), government workers have the ability to destroy your life with the touch of a button or the pressing of a rubber stamp, and a mighty brouhaha between the oppressors and the oppressed -- characterized by ever more frequent terrorist bombings -- is brewing.  It's a world where an innocuous act, such as a bug falling into a teletype machine, can cost a man his life.  Which is exactly what happens.<br />Despite what appears to be a violent regression in the advancement of technology, characterized by manual typewriters attached to monochromatic monitors that serve as personal computers, \\"Brazil\\" is probably the most realistic dystopian vision I can think of.  It lays out a possible future path that will not surprise anyone if it comes true.  If it hasn't already.  It's a hermetically sealed society where personal information is our most precious and destructive commodity, plastic surgeons promise happiness and deliver startling (in every sense of the word) results, and bureaucracy has run amok to the nth degree.<br />This last point gives the film some of its most uncomfortable laughs.  One early scene has a black-coated bureaucrat, having just legally abducted a woman's husband, offering her a \\"receipt for your husband\\", and then cheerily adding, \\"and this is my receipt for your receipt.\\"  At one point Sam Lowry, our most unlikely protagonist who's on his toes as ever, actually thwarts a malicious attempt to sabotage his air-conditioning... by demanding the appropriate form.  The boys from Central Servicing, obviously taught well, have no choice but to back off.<br />Terry Gilliam, director of such disturbing fare as \\"The Fisher King\\", \\"Time Bandits\\", and \\"Twelve Monkeys\\", once again plies the trades he learned during his time in Monty Python: the use of humour to point out society's ills (despite the bleak message, \\"Brazil\\" is nothing if not a mercilessly funny film), and a unique eye for sharp and evocative visuals.  The landscape he's created appears to be dominated by a duct motif.  The curious little pipes muss up the corner of every room, from floor to ceiling, creating a benign yet oppressive presence.  On the one hand, information and service is always at your fingertips; on the other hand, you're always at *their* fingertips.  Shudder.<br />The film opens with a bird's-eye-view trip through some clouds.  The song \\"Brazil\\", after which the film is intriguingly named (and whose lyrics I liberally pilfered to start my review), soars over the soundtrack.  It's the first appearance for a theme that's omnipresent throughout the film (It turns up in various guises; at one point Sam even whimsically whistles it).  It's like Big Brother, only this time instead of him watching you, you're listening to it.  In lieu of opening credits we instead get a couple of quick title cards marking time and location.  They reminded me of the similar opening moments of Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\", enamored with specificity (\\"8:49am\\"), but with the added attraction of being paradoxically unspecific (\\"Somewhere in the 20th century\\").  What follows is a film of harrowing emotion and terrifying ideas.<br />Jonathan Pryce, as Sam Lowry, is a perfect guide for the audience to follow through this strange world.  He beginsthe film as a cool customer; watch him ably assist his nervous manager, Mr. Kurtzmann (a delicious Ian Holm), in solving small crisis after small crisis with but a few taps at the computer terminal.  He's also a dreamer.  His multiple forays into a fantasy world where he's a winged warrior battling 20-foot tall samurais allows the film to flesh out the subtext.  Sam is an idealist, ill suited to a world hell bent on destroying his dreams.  So as he becomes entangled in the machinations of the plot, Pryce gets more and more frantic.  In what's essentially a button-down bureaucrat of a role, Pryce shows that he's wildly limber.  His physical comedy, which is helped out by his buggy eyeballs and lanky limbs, amounts for much of the comedy in the role.<br />Pryce is surrounded by a veritable who's who of British character actors.  Besides the aforementioned Holm, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, and Jim Broadbent all turn up in small but effective roles.  Gilliam even allows a couple of Americans to join in on the fun.  Katherine Helmond, as Sam's surgery obsessed mother, and Robert DeNiro, as a rogue handyman, appear to be having heaps of fun with their characters.  Kim Greist, as Jill, the fantasy object of Sam's desire, is less successful.  She's supposed to be the worthy Julia to Sam's Winston Smith, but Greist is stiff, unappealing, and unattractive.<br />The film's plot, often confusing, is most likely just a clothesline off of which Gilliam and Co. can hang big ideas.  And they do, with flair and humour intact.  Much credit should be given to screenwriters Gilliam, Charles McKeown, who also plays Sam's office mate Harvey Lime, and Tony award winning playwright Tom Stoppard (yay Tom!).<br />\\"Brazil\\" is just the latest in a long line of films I've seen recently that I can classify as 'revisionist'.  Not that the film itself makes new claims on old history.  It's more a case of me seeing a film for a second time, a film I detested after the first pass, with new eyes.  And loving it dearly.
B00005MAM2|4.0|I saw this movie after I saw the parody video of Aqua's Barbie Girl, The ugly Girls of anime, So after I saw the movie, I saw in the credits based upon the graphic novel. So for the past 6 to 7 months i have shelled out 200$ for the 6 volume Manga. I compared the movie to the manga. The movie is only 35 to 40 % tops of the manga. Clown is a bigger character than Takashi. All in all, buy this movie and then buy the manga.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is the Yes dvd to buy, with &quot;Yessongs&quot;. The orchestra works really well with the group, the choice of songs is the best since the mid-70's and the sound/video quality is top notch. It's a shame Tom Brislin, who was hired to play keyboards for the tour, will not be part of the next Yes album and tour because he was the best keyboard player they've had since Geoff Downes in 1980 (Yep, he's better than Wakeman right now). I watched this dvd twice already and I'm really impressed. I saw the tour last summer and this set recreates the magic of that show. If you like Yes, don't miss out on that one.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Before I begin, I have to admit I'm reviewing an older edition of this CD (without a live track or interview). From what I've heard and read elsewhere, the sound on this edition has been cleaned up considerably than the first edition CD I'm basing my review on. I'd also like to agree with another reviewer here that &quot;bonus&quot; material is best consigned to a second disc when dealing with an album presented like &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; is. That said ...<br />  In the hands of less skillful writers and artists, a 45 minute song could be an ordeal. When elements of epic poetry, English pastoral imagery, jazz and classical arrangements, and a tongue-in-cheek cover art (detailing a poem written by Gerald &quot;Little Milton&quot; Bostock) are added, the imagined results become even more cringeworthy. It's to Jethro Tull's credit that the results became the rock masterpiece &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and not a leaden, embarassing clunker (Yes' &quot;Tales Of Topographic Oceans&quot;).<br />  The deft interplay between delicate acoustic and frenzied prog rock segments within the song give the listener the feeling of watching a high wire act with no safety net. The progression is impeccable, save for an unfortunate (yet necessary for the LP format) break between the two sides of the album that disrupt the continuity somewhat. Guitarist Martin Barre, keyboardist John Evan, and of course, lead man Ian Anderson turn in the performances of a lifetime, flawlessly juggling the disparate elements that unite so satisfyingly as a whole. The melodies interspersed are catchy, alternately delicate and raucous. The lyrics also waver between the fanciful (&quot;make your will and testament/won't you join your local government?/we'll have Superman for president/let Robin save the day!&quot;) and pointedly obtuse. The end result, delightfully, leaves the listener free to make his own associations and conclusions without the hamfisted &quot;steering&quot; of the listener that has a tendency to plague ambitious projects like this (Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;, for example).<br />  While Jethro Tull released many fine albums after &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, this is undoubtedly one of their finest hours, and offers a glimpse of a band at the top of their game, and sadly, shows how far popular music has declined since 1972. In today's day and age, popular music like &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; would be impossible (can you imagine the meeting with the year 2000 record executives telling these shaggy, unkempt Englishmen that they don't hear a single or see a video for a 45 minute long song?).<br />  If I were to own only one Jethro Tull album, or progressive rock record for that matter, this would be the one. Listeners who are just discovering Jethro Tull will almost certainly find their previous album (&quot;Aqualung&quot;) more accessible as an appetizer, but &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; is a gourmet feast for the ears.t has a tendency to plague ambitious projects like this (Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;, for example).<br />   While Jethro Tull released many fine albums after &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, this is undoubtedly one of their finest hours, and offers a glimpse of a band at the top of their game, and sadly, shows how far popular music has declined since 1972.

B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Those are the 2 words that summarize that movie (and any Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer flick). To be honest, I only watched the first 2 hours, I was so bored I stopped the dvd. This is the usual junk that shows just how bad Hollywood blockbusters have become. All the money is put on visuals and special effects and the producers forget that you need *good actors* and *a good script* to make a movie. Historically, this movie is a farce. Avoid at all cost!! Rent (or buy) Tora! Tora! Tora! if you want to know what really happened on that day.
0312265859|5.0|Janet has done it again!!! I picked up a copy of Hard Eight today and could not put it down.  My son asked me why I was laughing so hard and of course it was because of the book.  The humor is still there as well as a more in depth plot.  I'm not to sure if I like the ending.  I will have to think about it while I wait for number 9.  For anyone who has not started the series I highly recommend that they do so.
0140120416|5.0|Unlike alot of the russian books, This one does not assume you already have a basic foundation in Russian. If you're just starting out and don't even know the cyrillic alphabet yet, this book will help you alot, at least it helped me.
6304493681|4.0|The graphic was wonderful.  I love the quality of pictures!  It was just amazing.  In DVD version, they talk about how they made the pictures and it's worth to see.  Especially, I love the fighting scene.  They fight on the water.  The shadow, lightening make up all the beautiful pictures.    <br /> Ghost in the Shell was made in 1996.  I say, it wasn't quite successful from the money perspective in Japan, however, it was more successful in the US.  <br /> I thought the story was too complicated.  One of the voice actors said \\"you should see this movie from your heart\\" or something.  I think that is very right.  I tried to understand what was going on there, but it was just too complicated; I guess I need the booklet to read the story setting etc.  I was thinking \\"why were Japanese government people in Chinese city (you can assume that city is probably in Hong Kong by the writings and houses etc)??\\"  Also, in some part, the main character says some phrase from the Christian Bible.  The voice was so low that I couldn't understand what she was saying.  Even if I could hear, I wouldn't know that was from the Bible.  I think if you have some knowledge about the Bible, you might be able to see something in the story other can't see. <BR> <BR> The theme music was made base on Shinto music.  Shinto is the Japanese religion, basically believe in spirit everywhere.  However, it is more emersed in people's daily lives.  So that, most of the people don't know they are practicing Shintoism.  Anyways, the music was very mysterious and I think it fits to the movie very well.  <br /> Well well well, I hope my review helps.  When you get DVD, I recommend to see the appendix part talking about how they made the movie.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine says it best, &quot;Lynch's Mulholland Drive is...a haunting, selfish masterpiece that literalizes the theory of surrealism as perpetual dream-state.&quot;<br />Amazingly, Mulholland Drive was originally a pilot for an ABC TV series that never got picked up. What a series it could have been! Viewers would have been scratching their heads from week to week and still kept coming back for more. ABC deemed it too controversal, and lacked some all-around faith. It seem's the censor's are sleeping nowaday's, so it was an amazing move, considering.<br />Mulholland star's: Naomi Watts, Laura Harring and Justin Theroux. All of whom were terrific. There were some scenes, such as &quot;The introduction to Adam&quot;, and &quot;The Audition&quot; that would have alone been worth buying the disk. To me anyways.<br />Remember that most of what you see has a symbolism around things that happen in the ending subplot. This won't make sense until you have seen it. Flak Magazine does a wonderful job decifering all of the in's and out's. If you want a full fledged, interpretation, go there. Even though I understood most of the movie, after I read his review it made me feel a little stupid.<br />Mulholland Dr. is a rare, crazy-eyed vision of a woman's life, her desires and her failures. It was meant for open minded viewers who enjoy simple movies as much as the do complicated film's. ~s.a.o.s.~

This woman is eventually going to make it and make it big!<br />Her voice and style are unique.  I cannot stop listening to this CD.  I keep looking for more by her.<br />The quality of the recording is excellent and the style of music is a cross between country and jazz, but with the signature that will not permit imitation.<br />Buy this CD...
1558908455|1.0|A promising beginning quickly gives way to shameful exploitation and excesses that are unworthy of the participants involved, and even the most adept rationalization will not excuse them from taking part in a project that is so blatantly devoid of anything even remotely close to possessing any redeeming aspects or qualities whatsoever.  Screenwriter Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez had apparently attained the kind of stature within the right kind of circles that gave them free reign going into the production of \\"From Dusk Till Dawn,\\" and the results are something akin to what happens when you turn a couple of undisciplined youngsters loose in a toy store and then refuse to hold them accountable for the mess they make.  The thing is, the people involved here are artists, who collectively and individually, have proven themselves capable of achievements beyond the norm; and as an audience-- collectively and individually-- that is what we have come to expect from them.  And that's not saying that every time out Tarantino has to give us a \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" or that Clooney or Keitel are expected to turn in an Academy Award worthy performance.  But given their credentials, it is not out of line to expect them to deliver a product that includes at least some semblance of dignity, integrity and quality.  And, unfortunately, none of the above are to be found anywhere in this \\"B-\\" schlock Rodriguez and Co. have fostered upon an unsuspecting public.<br />The degradations begin when the morally bankrupt Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino), go on a spree of murder and robbery on their way to Mexico, where they're to meet up with a colleague who will provide them with a safe haven-- for a price, of course.  Near the border, to facilitate their crossing, they kidnap a minister, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu).  Seth sees the motor home Jacob is driving as the perfect vehicle to get them to their destination, and the recently widowed Jacob-- who is currently struggling with his faith-- sees no choice but to go along with the demands of his captors.  What Jacob cannot know, however, is that he will be taking them to a rendezvous that will deposit them all veritably at the gates of Hell.<br />In the opening scene, a Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), walks into a somewhat secluded liquor store where he has a conversation with the young clerk, during which they discuss the news of the Gecko brothers.  Of course, Seth and Richie are already at hand, and the ensuing violence sets the stage for all that follows.  And right up to the part at which the first shots are fired, courtesy of a riveting, if all too brief, performance by Parks (this is actually the film's best scene), it's actually a good beginning to a very bad movie.  At this point, the film has had it's moment, and it's all downhill from there.<br />With this screenplay, Tarantino-- who made a name for himself (and rightly so) with \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Reservoir Dogs,\\"-- developed a blueprint for excessive (even for him) violence and moral abasement, then handed it over to Rodriguez, who took the ball and ran with it.  Straight down into the ground.  The characters and situations created in this film give a negative value to human life and propriety, even taken within the broadest cinematic terms of expression.  And the use of advanced technology and F/X by Rodriguez toward such an end as this is contemptible.  Totally without redeeming value, this film appeals to nothing more than the basest instincts of the infantile mind, and is an embarrassment to the craft of filmmaking.<br />If you bother to sift through the detritus of this visual and psychological malady, you will actually find a decent performance by Clooney, though given the context in which it exists, it will take an extremely objective eye to discern it at all.  Seeking out a good performance here is like attempting to remedy the stench of a pig sty with a can of air freshener.  And it's tough watching someone you admire as an artist wallow (and willingly yet) in such claptrap as this.<br />As far as the participation of Harvey Keitel in this, one can only wonder what could have prompted such a decision.  In fact, one can speculate that Jacob Fuller's loss of faith occurred after he read this script.<br />The supporting cast includes Salma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium), Cheech Marin (in three roles), Danny Trejo (Razor Charlie), Fred Williamson (Frost) and Kelly Preston (Newscaster Kelly Houge).  A disaster that should never have been allowed to see the light of day, \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" will no doubt find it's own niche in the \\"cult film\\" Hall of Fame, and unfortunately there are those who will embrace this nonsense out-of-hand.  If made by amateurs or an aspiring filmmaker who simply did not know better, the existence of this film would at least be understandable and acceptable within the context of those given terms and conditions.  But with the names and talents of the likes of Tarantino, Clooney, Rodriguez, Keitel and Lewis attached, there is no excuse for it; no excuse whatsoever.  In the final analysis, this is nothing more than a demonstration of the blatant misuse of the magic that is the movies.
B00005JKL8|3.0|This film is one of those that in six months my wife will be stopping me in the aisle of the video store asking me, &quot;Did we see this?&quot;  I hope it's not one that I rent again, only to recall too late, &quot;Oops, we sure did see this.&quot;  Other than the spooky scene with the dead bodies, there really wasn't so much gore.  The editing was good with lots of modernistic cuts and flashes as the plane takes off.  The DVD version doesn't offer much over the video.  There are no deleted scenes in the bonus materials, simply extended edits of several of the other scenes and commentary.  It would have been nice to have a few more women in the picture.  The only one I can recall is the Bosnian girl in the truck with the coca cola.  She did a nice job of looking tired.  I enjoy watching Owen Wilson.  Royal Tannenbaums was entertaining.  However, there wasn't a huge amount of depth here.  If he'd had a picture of his girl back home that he kept pulling out to inspire him to escape, we could have seen some levels.  But this guy was pretty much a navy bachelor.  BEL isn't brilliant, isn't awful, and is a pleasant enough way to spend the evening -- once.  Eat the jello.
B00004C4KZ|5.0|Back in the early 1970s in England I had two friends who shared a similar interest who both, at the same time, introduced me to it. Both Mick Clarke (and Pat) and Polli were interested in the new sounds coming from Germany. As a DJ in the Locarno ballroom in Sunderland, I was very interested in new developments in the psychedelic and/or progressive rock field and thus began my induction into the world of Krautrock.<br />Tangerine Dream were, with Can and Ash Ra Tempel, my personal favourites although I was very partial to a number of other German bands. There was a burgeoning scene in the European sounds, especially after the demise of bands like Quicksilver Messenger Service etc. Electronic Meditation, Alpha Centauri and the incredible Zeit built up an incredible reputation for Tangerine Dream as a serious, musically experimental entity pushing the envelope regardless of the current trend. For me personally they went in the direction that I had hoped the Pink Floyd would go in but alas, under the direction of Roger Waters they would deteriorate into the Dark Side of the Moon and the depths of the Wall but that is another story.<br />Whereas Zeit was dark and serious, the next album, Atem was lighter and clearly more geared up to a populist market. This was a major change of direction by the band which ultimately led to the change in label and Phaedra. On a side note, I was fortunate enough to see Tangerine Dream, literally, on their first UK tour. I say literally because I was right at the front, they came on and left in the dark and their light show precluded sightings of the band.<br />Nevertheless this is an excellent album, ethereal and celebral, haunting and free. The textures are incredible and reflects the summer and hope. The child on the cover says it all. Lift your head and lift your heart, such is the effect of this last great album of Tangerine Dream.
079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist is one of those rare finds.  It is a superbly crafted film with a great story and top-notch acting and it also manages to scare the &quot;you know what&quot; right out of you. The thought of the demonic posession of a pre-teen girl is too much for most people to ponder rationally.  Yet somehow, William Friedkin (making the movie from the gripping page-turner written by William Peter Blatty) presents this tale in a straight forward manner that doesn't flinch in it's ability to deal with this horrifying subject matter.  Contrary to what some people have mentioned the special effects are NOT dated.  They are still some of the best effects created in Hollywood. (Perhaps minimalist by todays standards which make them even more incredible).<BR>Highlights of the DVD are the soundtrack, which you'll be scrambling to turn down if you have a home theater system, and the documentary about the making of the film which highlights the many challenges the crew encountered and some of the eerie things that took place during the filming. Look for the infamous &quot;Spider Walk&quot; scene which was left cut on the editor's floor.<BR>Some people I know still refuse to watch this film on its reputation alone.  Don't be one of them.  You'll be missing one of the best films made in the 70's and without a doubt the greatest horror movie of all time.
B00005NTNM|5.0|Personally I think that this is an excellent movie but not for the reasons that you might think.<br />This is not the best action Dirty Harry movie, nor is it the best for reasons that other reviewers have reiterated elsewhere.<br />As an entertainment piece it is watchable and even fun, but for me the best thing about the movie is the jibes at the whole politically correct movement.<br />From the outset at the liquor store, Callahan, although affecting the requires result, does so in a way which costs the city money and which is feared will undermine mayoral initiatives.<br />Reassigned to Personnel Harry shows up at a promotion board and immediately crosses swords with the mayor's representative who is to supervise proceedings to ensure that there is diversity. The scenario worsens when Officer Moore (Tyne Daly) enters the picture. Callahan is concerned that the job of Inspector is dangerous and politically correct decisions may result in loss of life.<br />The movie attacks other aspects of life where others fear to tread. The priest who supports revolutionary causes, believing that no-one ought to be killed comes to see the error of his ways, and the search for a key witness sees Harry in the brothel undercover (pardon the pun) discovering the delights of rubber dollies and a reality of the sex industry where punters paying for sex through the mail receive letters signed by elderly women some without teeth.<br />All told the movie really is a rather vicious attack on the values of our society in the face of a violent reality whether it be from organised crime or from so-called revolutionary groups. It also casts doubt on the so-called principles of such groups, basically viewing them as just another way to get money much like the group in 'Die Hard'.<br />From that point of view it is an extremely interesting movie and where else to portray such an attack? San Francisco, the capital city of liberal politics. On a final note, the movie really does not have much time for career politicians either, presenting the mayor as being concerned only with image, trying to succour the votes of minorities by playing to their sensibilities rather than coming up with real solutions to real problems and being more concerned with poll findings to determine his direction rather than having a strong character.ime for career politicians either, presenting the mayor as being concerned only with image, trying to succour the votes of minorities by playing to their sensibilities rather than coming up with real solutions to real problems and being more concerned with poll findings to determine his direction rather than having a strong character.
0316776963|5.0|One day I happened to walk into an overcrowded bookstore where some unknown-to-me author was doing a signing.  &quot;What's all the fuss,&quot; I asked my daughter and with my interest aroused I listened to this quirky little man doing some readings.  Soon I was screaming with laughter along with the crowd and my now favorite author had been discovered.  His outlook on life and stories about friends and family (especially zany sister Amy - one of David Letterman's best continuously returning guests) just holds the readers' interest until forced to put down the book.  I was recently in an airport and noticed a lady reading &quot;Me Talk...&quot;, and everytime she laughed I did also trying to picture where she might be.  The only problem with David is: he hasn't written enough material.  I can't wait for the next release.
B000002NBY|5.0|When I was five or six, every time I got into the car with my parents, I would yell for Paul Simon. Not just any Paul Simon album, mind you, but \\"Graceland.\\" Then, for a tragic period of ten years without \\"Graceland,\\" I have rediscovered it at the tender age of 17.  I popped the old tape back into the cassette player and was blown away. The opening accordian riff and lines got me listening intently right away. (\\"It was a slow day, and the sun was beating on the soldiers by the side of the road, there was a bright light, a shattering of shop windows, the bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio\\").  The album shifts styles continuously throughout the album.  Ladysmith Black Mambazo adds the South African flavor in songs such as \\"Homeless\\" and \\"Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\\" (Paul performed a fantastic rendition of the latter on Saturday Night Live).  Other standout songs include the title track, \\"You Can Call Me Al,\\" whose video features a hilarious cameo by Chevy Chase, and \\"Under African Skies.\\" \\"Graceland\\" is easily one of the best albums to come out of the otherwise dismal 80's, and a must-have for most music fans.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Where I come from, this is considered troo rock music.  The guy who compared Nickelback to a watered down 38-Special type band is a complete fool.  <br />Nickelback is whack!!!<br />Chad Kroeger has a kind of gritty voice that will leave you hangin' on his every syllable.  In fact, his ballad \\"Hero\\" from the excellent \\"Spiderman\\" cd is proof of that.  He is kind of a mixture of Eddie Vedder and Chris Cornell, though he possesses much more talent than those two washed-out has-beens.  Basically, if you dig grunge music, you're going to love this band.<br />The future of rock IS Nickelback.<br />PEACE OUT!!
B0000025T6|5.0|With his album &quot;Nebraska,&quot; Springsteen explored the dark side of America. Bruce takes us around the United States, from Nebraska itself to New Jersey, giving us haunting stories of American life. The name itself, &quot;Nebraska,&quot; couldn't be beter. The state of Nebraska is a physical representation of this album, both musically and lyrically. The only instruments heard here are Bruce's guitar, harmonica, and voice. This fits the album well, because it reflects the bleakness of the stories he tells here. The title track tells of a shooting rampage across the midwest. &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; relates the story of a police officer who is at odds with his brother because of his criminal tendencies. The closer, &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; wraps up the album nicely because though people may go experience all the troubles Springsteen sings of in his songs, still &quot;people find some reason to believe.&quot;  A beautiful, if depressing, album.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Folks, sex sells...and it appears America is buying - and why not!!  This is undoubtedly the best Britney yet.  Her vocals are chirpy, her moves are sexy, and her style is irresistable.  I only hope the she and Justin T. can work thing out before it's too late (know what I mean!!).  But anyways, \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\" is destined for Britney lore.  I mean, it's totally better than the original one!!<br />Well, that's all I had to say.  Hope you enjoyed my review.<br />See ya' later!!
B00000064G|5.0|Of all the places to discover Nick Drake, I had to discover him in, yes, the Volkswagen commercial.  Despite this method of discovery, I am thrilled to have been able to discover Drake. His music can be dark and moody, but it is always beautiful, and always original. His lyrics, though sometimes non-sensical, fit the music well. They are mysterious and cryptic. The songs on &quot;Pink Moon&quot; are unforgettable. There is the bluesy &quot;Know,&quot; the elegant &quot;From the Morning,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Horn.&quot; Horn is a sparce instrumental track. Drake creates an atmosphere with this song that I have yet to see paralleled. My only quam with this album is that it is over far too quickly. With each listen, I am left wanting another half hour of music. Despite this shortcoming, I would classify this album as a true &quot;classic&quot; and would recommend it to music fans everywhere.
B000000XB9|5.0|Sure they looked shaggy and had facial hair that was a little ragged, but don't forget, it was the 70's, man!!  Everyone was doing it!!  <br />As for the actual music, this band couldn't be beat.  I wish these guys would sit down with some of today's tone deaf artists and teach them how to write a genuine melody.  Or maybe that can't be taught. Well, if not, then at least show them a good guitar hook or two.  <br />CCR just had everything:  a bear of a singer, catchy tunes that are in no way too poppish, and a sort of folksy electric guitar that seemed to go with the flow.  Just listen to the album and see how many fun rock songs you recognize.    <br />Hey, they may have been hippies, but you shouldn't hold that against them!!!  Like I said, it was the 70's - everyone acted that way!!<br />Long live CCR, a band that makes Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young look like total stoners!!<br />HAVE A GOOD ONE!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is unbelievable. I cant get over the fact that I doubted it was worth the buy. I honestly can say that i have never spent a better 13$. The music is soulful, and moody with a great heartfelt message behind each song. Mayer wirtes simple lyrics that pack quite a punch. I havent heard music like this since Dave Matthews' Chrash. Id recommend this album to anyone, its just simply great music. Buy one, heck buy two....
B000002J09|2.0|...Besides the fairly pleasant sounds of \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" I really don't get the hype lavished on this strange band.  I don't think Led Zeppelin has a troo future making music.  They come nowhere close to the unbelievably fresh sounds of Nickelback, Limp Bizkit (step off Fred Durst), Staind, Puddle of Mudd, and the awesome Default.  To me, Led Zeppelin is boring brand rock, corporate and too drawn out.  The guitar player stretches out his over-the-top solos way too long, the singer sounds like he has pliers clenching his English gonads, and the drummer is way off time.  <br />In short, avoid this band like the plague, and stick with troo metal muscle like Bizkit and Staind.  Like I said, \\"Stairway\\" is a truly good song...
B00005T30L|5.0|Alright When you watch the movie it doesn't seem funny but the sarcasm that's there is so prominent that you can't help but laugh. This movie doesn't have so much a substance issue but it shows not every story has a faerie tale ending. It's a movie whose point is to have no point. It shows that not everyone can improve their life situation even if they want to. Its a simple movie about a girl who is unhappy with her life and ultimately goes to find her &quot;Ghost World&quot;

0380820846|5.0|Romancing Mister Bridgerton is probably the most highly anticipated book in the Bridgerton series.  Like everyone else, I have been antsy waiting for Colin and Penelope's story.<br />I am happy to report that it was well worth the wait!! Julia Quinn weaves a very mature and romantic story of the handsome, witty third Bridgerton brother and the wallflower who has adored him all her life.<br />As you read this tale, you will quickly see that there is a lot more to Colin and Penelope than anyone ever thought or suspected. Both of them possess secrets that will surprise and shock the other, as well as bond them in a way that is beyond either of their dreams. <br />To top that off, Lady Whistledown is at it again. But has her day of reckoning come? And, will we finally get to unmask the ton's worst nemesis?<br />I feel this book is for all the \\"unattractive\\" girls who got looked over because no one could see beneath the surface. And, it makes one believe that unrequited love can be fulfilled. <br />This is the best in the Bridgerton series so far. With 3 more unmarried Bridgertons and 1 widowed, I am sure Ms. Quinn will allow us to visit this prolific, warm, and loving family once again.  I can't wait to find out where Eloise runs off to.
0064407667|4.0|A quick, fun read that even a thirtysomething can enjoy. The packaging is beautiful, the illustrations are nicely drawn, and the story is dark and dastardly as can be. Though slight, \\"A Bad Beginning\\" is the perfect read for a rainy afternoon or a lazy summer day. Not quite up to par with JK Rowling or Philip Pullman, but nevertheless another worthwhile effort in a string of novels aimed for children but with more than enough appeal for imaginative adults of all ages.
0380820846|5.0|This book was fantastic!!  I've read all of the books in the Bridgerton series, so when I saw this novel on the shelf in my local Wal-Mart, I promptly bought it, went home, and read for the next three hours.  I couldn't have enjoyed my time more.  Although the other books in the series were good, I think this latest installment was pure perfection.  If Julia Quinn can top this novel, I'll be camped outside my local Wal-Mart for the next release!!  <br />I would like to warn would-be readers, that although the author does a good job of making this a stand alone story, I think you'll have a lot more fun reading this book if you've read the rest of the books in the series.  Ms. Quinn does a wonderful job of seamlessly fitting in characters from previous books, and it's a shame not to know their backgrounds before you read this book.

B000001FA4|5.0|This is without a doubt the best U2 album.  I own all of their albums and while they are all very good, this is the one that never sits in the back of my collection gathering dust.  I've owned it since it came out in 1984 and I've never tired of it.  The album slowly picks up momentum until it hits the monumental &quot;Bad,&quot; then swirls you down into a melodic dream state until the final song, &quot;MLK,&quot; lullabies you off to sleep.<br />It's rare that you find an album where, instead of skipping around to find the good songs, every song perfectly flows together.  This is one of those rare gems. <br />It is also interesting that Bono wrote the songs while riding across America in their tourbus during I believe his first, and U2s first, visit to America before they were so famous

0738206679|3.0|\\"Linked\\" presents a reasonable overview of what was done<br />by physicists these last years in the field<br />of networks. However, this book is very subjective<br />and the author essentially cites his own work<br />without almost no reference to previous important work.<br />In particular, sociologists, mathematicians and other<br />physicists worked on networks before 1999 (when Barbasi<br />published his first paper in the field) and the<br />poor bibliography does not give credit to them.<br />In addition, the author falls short on application<br />of the theory: apart from some trivial conclusions<br />the theory is not yet ready to help people finding a job,<br />improving their business or understanding<br />a terrorists network !

I read the books and was hooked with this fantastic world. <BR>I have played the movie to people my age and older (34+) and they have run to buy the books. <BR>For those of you who think that the movie could not be better than or come close to the book...you are in for a surprise.<br />The movie(s) will never be like the book(s). If they were the same it would be called a &quot;MINISERIES&quot;.<br />Great imagination, superb scenarios, decent effects...who cares about the acting?...this is pure enterntainment.

0553274503|5.0|I'm not a sentimental person. But this book really made me understan some important things in life. Like how we treat each other. As you read this book you will understand how cruel human beings can be- and they take out their anger on people who do not deserve it- people like Charlie. (main character of this book). All Charlie wanted was to be treated like a human being- not an expieriment. It's all everyone really wants- is to be treated normally. And to be accepted. Charlie didn't understand lots of things- and no one would explain them. It makes you think twice about helping someone, or doing something more important with your life. I reccommend this book to everyone. It was excellent. I give it 5 stars!
B000066NW0|5.0|I just want everyone to know that Avril is no ordinary girl. She is someone that grew up in a small town but made it big in the music buisness. She will be more famous then i will ever be. Let me get to the point...i was having a bad day and thinking about hurting myself. I decided to turn on mtv and when i did, i saw Avril's video &quot;Complicated&quot;. Right when i turned mtv on, my whole life changed around. I went out and bought her new cd. All of her songs on Let Go relate to me. Its almost scary because the way Avril expresses herself, is they way i would express myself. Whenever i feel let down, or sad i just turn her cd on. Its the only good cd i own. I just want people out in the world to know and experience what i have experienced. She is my hero.
B00005RHGK|1.0|The plot is stupid, it's a low budget movie and there is nothing special about it. Don't waste your time.
B000066NW0|5.0|She's so gorgeous! First time my friend Hay told me to download the song \\"Complicated,\\" I fell in love with it! So I decided to go out and get the CD... I thought the rest of the CD would be kinda lame and sound the same as the first song! But I couldn't stop listening to it! Every song described what was happening in my life, and it really helped me just get through... I got so into the music that I learned a couple of the songs on my guitar! If you don't have this CD- Get out to your local CD store and buy it! You won't regret it!!
B00005QDW1|5.0|First off, I'm an &quot;old fart&quot; compared to most No Doubt fans.  I'm 40.  <br />I notice that some big fans of their old stuff don't like the new stuff.  But I only moderately liked their old stuff.  Most of their previous hits were pretty good, but most of the rest of the stuff on the other CD's came across as filler to me.  There just ain't no filler on this CD.  It rocks.
B00005OAIE|5.0|On of the best CDs I have purchased in a long while.  During a time when music is dominated by mind-numbing songs that offer nothing more than a catchy tune, John Mayer's music is bluntly honest and melodically original.  The poetic lyrics offer a window right into the singer/songwriter's mind, thoughts, and experiences.  Music as it was meant to be appreciated!
0060926317|5.0|Wow, people either love it or hate it......so if the books message is about love and acceptance then thoes that dislike it and are so critical and petty must be haters and the ones who like it must be lovers......When I read the book some of the things could have been made up but how could she have made up the things like the telepathy head to head talk with animals and people? I found more REAL spiritual lessons in this book than all the sunday school ive ever had to sit through...... As I type this some fake looking actress making the WORST forced grin is staring at me from the cover of a people magazine...... anyways this is what im talking about.......of couse people didnt like this book....because alot of it tells us to be REAL and who the hell is real in the mutant world? ive met VERY few....from bosses to girlfriends to friends and aquainences in general.<BR>Most of what I read everday that is said to be REAL reads like fiction to me while Marlo's fiction sounds alot more like fact......this WOULD happen if you were abducted by Aborigineese......And I like what the aboriginese say , things like animals were not originally used as food by humans coincides with some eastern religions ive researched (Taoisim).  And we ARE destroying our planet if you havent noticed.....bet they didnt have polluted skies 200-300 yrs ago...as well as everyone haveing a valuble place in the tribe weather you were a tool maker or a tribal chieftan. I really liked the PART ABOUT OUR BUSINESS ETHICS, it was soooo right on what the Ooota fellow said about it. ANd to answer some idiot a few reviews back ,who cares if Oota is spelled with upper or lower case letters , its probably niether since his name is a sound or thought that cant be properly expressed in our language,lower that nose a little you may be scareing the sun away....it seems that EVERYONE was needed for survival and included even the extremely old.....and growing old was not seen as negative in the tribal culture......andis it really? to live a long time seems in our culture to be punished rather than celebrated......look at that poor old man/lady or \\"oh hes just a little kid whats he good for\\" mentality...... well the human race is gonna pay and pay BIG very soon, hell, America already has gotten its karmic debit repaid (september 11th) mark my words ladies and germs.....for what it does to itself and everything else it comes in contact with........we are not alone in this universe..... even that can be almost proven....its only a matter of time when someone spills the beans on the truth behind \\"aliens\\" too....
0790729725|5.0|\\"Ever since I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster!\\" These are the words spoken by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)! Hill started to work with the mob when he was a teenager and by the time he hit his 20's, he was 'part of a group' as he liked to call it. So begin's the adventure of Hill, even though it has some funny moments, even one's that seem like there heartwarming. But as quickly as they come, they go. The violent part of the life always takes over. Along for the ride is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance)! Tommy is a very quick tempered man, who uses anything around him to get what he wants or needs. Last but not least is Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" Conway (Robert De Niro) who is half Irish half Italian, just like Hill! These men although they run their own little business, answer to one man, that is Pauly (Paul Sorvino)! The man who runs the show. But Hill, DeVito and Conway all in all work for him taking over airports, night clubs. Anyone who needs protection but can't go to the cops. They come and see Pauly! Along the way Hill meets Karen (Lorraine Bracco in her Oscar Nominated role) who will be with him all the way. But along the way Hill gets into drugs and seals his own future. No one ever really showed an adict like Martin Scorsese does in this film, never sugar coating anything. This would be the role of a lifetime for both Liotta and Bracco! The film never really slows down, the character development is outstanding, as is the entire supporting cast. With a great director, cast, screenplay and cinematography this film is a sure winner. As always Robert De Niro proved to be a treat, but the real surprise was Joe Pesci! Who was and never has been better than he was in this film! If any film during the 1990's was robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture (other than Saving Private Ryan) it was this film! It should have won for Best Director and Best Picture, but it didn't! You have to see this film to understand everything that has been said about it!It ranks up there with \\"The Godfather\\" yet never use's anything from the film, making the choice for which is better, very hard. See \\"Goodfellas\\" and realize that it is Martin Scorsese's best film and one of the best ever made! An Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor(Pesci)! Don't miss it! Grade:A
B000065U1N|2.0|Since Saving Private Ryan's opening D-Day scene hammered audiences five years ago, Hollywood has taken that movie's brutality a couple steps further with war films and miniseries (\\"Band of Brothers\\") that are, essentially, 2 hour battle sequences.  Certainly, it's important to show modern audiences just how horrific war can be.  But to do it to such numbing effect ends up having the reverse effect upon viewers.  We become desensitized to even the most shocking violence, and films that are meant to be anti-war are morphed into intensely graphic action films.<br />Nothing illustrates this point better than Black Hawk Down.  While Ridley Scott's film is masterful in its technical details, and its ability to illustrate the tactics of modern warfare and how they can fall apart, it fails to establish any real sense of character or story.  We concentrate on a cast of maybe 20 or 30 soldiers as they participate in the disastrous 1993 raid in Somalia.  But because there are so many characters, and because their introductions are so brief and indistinct, it's impossible to involve yourself in the personal stakes of the raid itself.<br />Of course, we knew nothing about the characters in Ryan before they went into battle, but we learned about them during the battle and had the added context of just what was at stake (namely, the free world itself).  Here, the purpose is somewhat questionable, and that works against the audience relating to the characters.<br />So, without any real attachment to any of the men involved, we watch for 90 minutes as they endure hell on Earth.  But keeping track of it all is so difficult that eventually you give up, and the resulting barrage of blank warfare feels like piling on.  There's really no point in watching it, unless you really enjoy watching warfare.  In that sense, you could call it Warnography, because it's war without context.  And that's too bad, because the story behind Black Hawk Down is extraordinarily compelling.  But that's losthere in a haze of gunfire.  Then again, that might be your thing.  <br />(Note: When the film is over, we see a screen telling us that 19 Americans died and that over 1,000 Somalis died.  How did the Somalis die?  Were they all killed by Americans?  Did warring factions kill each other?  It's critical information that's left out, and makes Black Hawk Down more frustrating as a result.)
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had been anticipating the arrival of the Harry Potter movie and all I can say is WOW!!!!!! Those six exclamation points say it all. I loved this movie. In fact, after you read this  go to the store and buy it if you don't have it yet. I am telling you. This was an absolute masterpiece.
B0000524CY|5.0|Wow, I've seen this movie 5 times, and let me tell you this is the scariest. The only bad thing is that the beginning is a little slow, but pay attention, it's even scarier when you listen to every word they say. They need to release a directors cut and add more seens of Regan possesed doing more digusting and dispicable things, and more of this demon face. That demon is the baddest film villian ever! ...This is better than the original version, so buy this one. The don't get scarier than this...
B0000542D2|5.0|I can add little to the legend that is \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". The movie epitomises the time it was made, the music in it, the culture it portrays and, of course, the Beatles in their historical context. <br />The DVD about to be released...is a long time coming but all the more welcome for that. The extras sound like they will themselves add considerably to a Beatles lovers colelction...

Anyone that tries comparing this to the old blues albums (muddy waters, buddy guy, bb king) is gonna sound like an [uneducated] because clapton isnt trying to be them.  He's simply putting out an ablum that is all blues.  I love this cd.  FIVE LONG YEARS is absolutely phenomnoenal.  Plenty of good electric tracks and plenty of good old slide acoustic songs.  Clapton is it.  He's been the best since the Derek and The Dominos.  Those who claim there is no soul here need to brush up on good music.

0451527712|5.0|As a high school student in an honors lit class we had to read this book as a required reading.  I was expecting it to be cheesy (sort of like those movies and for it to have a very simple plot line), well I was wrong.  Mary Shelly was only around 19 when she wrote this story and it was for a contest.  I wonder if she even realized how amazing Frankenstine actually is!<br /><br />  The story takes you on a nearly suspenseful journey that will have you questioning your true feeling on what is called the &quot;monster&quot;.  Sometimes Frankenstine's monster seems to be good with true feelings and well, other times the &quot;monster&quot; becomes the source of disaster for everything he holds dear.  During the story the inventor also makes a woman &quot;monster&quot; for his somewhat demented invention but all is not well and the woman's pieces are scattered throughout the ocean.  This is when the wrath of the &quot;monster&quot; is felt and the &quot;monster&quot; runs then off to cause disaster.  From then on Frankenstine trys to stop his invention before it's too late (and this is when the beginning of the story picks up---you will understand what I'm saying if you read the book :)<br />  The story is excellent and there is not a boring part in it!  Shelly builds up the suspence slowly and torments the readers  with a veriety of conflicting emotions.  It is the basis of todays horror, mystery, and thrillers.  It is a must read for ANYONE who enjoys a GREAT book----read it and I promise you will NOT forget it!
B000002UDB|5.0|While not a masterpiece like the albums that preceded it (Revolver, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper), Magical Mystery Tour is still a fine slice of psychaedelia, and sports some of Lennon and McCartney's best tunes. <br /> Nearly every song here is a gem, with the exception of Flying and Your Mother Should Know. McCartney is featured prominently here, and for the most part, does not disappoint. The Fool on the Hill is a fine ballad, and Hello Goodbye and the title track are pop perfection(Your Mother Should Know is not bad, it just simply isn't as good as everything else here). And Penny Lane is a terrific, somewhat underrated McCartney number that is one of my all-time favorites. Twisting lyrics, superb orchestration, and landmark production values highlight Strawberry Fields Forever and I Am the Walrus, which are easliy two of the best John ever did. All You Need is Love and Baby You're a Rich Man are delectable Lennon pieces as well. Harrison's sole contribution, Blue Jay Way, is another Indian-themed piece, and creates a fascinating atmosphere with the expert use of synthesizers.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is definitly the best cd I own.  All of the songs are great but I espically like Complicated and Sk8er Boi.  If you don't already have it YOU GOTTA GET IT!!!!!!!!!  I can't belive Let Go is her debut album `cause it's soooooo good. I can't stop listining to it!
B000062XM7|5.0|I like this movie. I like everything about it, its sweeping scale, its romance, its action, its musical score, its setting.<BR>Based on Cooper's novel, it tells the story of Nathan, a white raised by the Mohicans and his travails during the French-Indian War. <BR>The plot centers on Nathan during the siege of Ft. William and the aftermath. Nathan and his family rescue the Munroe sisters from an Huron ambush and agree to take them to their father, Col. Munroe, commandant of Ft. WIlliam. Upon arriving, they learn of the siege and the desparate situation. After the fort falls, the British are allowed to leave, only to be ambushed and slaughtered. Nathan again rescues the Munroe girls, he's fallen in love with Cora, the oldest and try to escape. The Hurons follow and capture the girls. Nathan follows and in the dramatic climax, rescues Cora but Alice kills herself, following Unkas, her love, into death. <BR>THe musical score is terrific and captures the haunting beauty of the landscape. SInce I live where the movie was filmed, I biased but the setting is gorgeous. <BR>THe roles of Nathan is played well by Lewis. It is a little melodramatic but very enjoyable.
B000068QY7|5.0|If you're an Oasis fan, erm, excuse me, if you're a fan of good simple music, go out and buy this album now. Noel Gallagher has proved once more to be one of the top song writers around and this album is destineed to be one of the best to be released this year. Noteable, is also Liam's songwritting effort. Fine songs, which prove a huge talent.<br />The songs are all great especially \\"Stop crying your heart out\\" which shines as a gem, with Liams great vocals (haven't been this good since 'What's the Stroy'), the brilliant harmonics and musical arrangements and the excellent, sad and melanchonic melody ... \\"Hold on / Don't be afraid / Just try not to worry ...\\". I'm sure these lyrics could serve as a soundtrack to anyone who has been passing through a difficut time lately. Other tracks that shine are : 'Probably All In The Mind' and 'Better Man', although as I said previously its hard to find a single track which should have been left out of this album. <br />Probably the album won't sell in the millions like 'What's the Story' did, but its still a hell of a good album with which Oasis have proved to the world that they have once again found their golden touch. Also, through this album one can note that Noel is still (and probably will be for life) heavily influenced by the Beatles, in particular by John Lennon in his song writing.<br />One thing which I haven't quite understood is the name of the album .... Heathen Chemistry, but anyway, who cares about the name? One suggestion. If you like good, simple music which is written and performed with passion, Heathen Chemistry is a MUST buy.<br />Whatever they write or say, Oasis are here to stay.
0140434143|4.0|Mansfield Park is the work of a mature Austen.  Compared to her earlier book, Pride and Prejudice, it features a particularly complex plot structure (complex for Austen, anyway) that works especially well in the first volume, and somewhat less well in the second.  The book also features Austen's characteristic nicety of interior character description, her really superior ability to follow the subtle nuances of thought and feeling.  This ability is raised to a whole new level, however, in Mansfield Park since the heroine, Fanny Price, is a particularly sensitive, selfless, and considerate girl.  Austen is up to the challenge, though, and develops stylistic techniques uniquely and perfectly suited to evoking all of Fanny's moral and emotional struggles.  It is simply a joy to follow Fanny through all her travails.<br />The weakness of the book is the structure of the third and last volume.  Here, Austen falls back a little to much on the technique of letter writing to move her story forward.  This weakness IS offset somewhat by the wonderful scenes in Fanny's hometown of Portsmouth - scenes that evoke one of Dickens' favorite themes, the impoverished family - but overall, the structure here is not up to the standards of the first two volumes.<br />Another weakness, though this is more a comment on Austen's style than on this book in particular, is the paucity of vivid imagery, of truly original metaphors or similes.  Compared to Dickens or Flaubert, two of her near contemporaries, Austen is decidedly inferior on this score.  Her strength really lies in her ability to describe the subtleties of the emotional and intellectual lives of her characters with a fidelity and clarity that I think is superior to Dickens and the equal of Flaubert.<br />Finally, a comment on Fanny's 'likeability'.  While I don't want to deny that a character's likeability can influence our enjoyment of a book, I also think that it should not be a consideration in our judgement of the book's meritas a work of art.  Madame Bovary, the book by Flaubert, is populated by unlikeable people and there isn't any one we can 'identify' with (or so we hope), yet that book is certainly a great work of art.  In the same way, our gut reaction to Fanny may not be favorable, but this should have nothing to do with our assessment of Fanny as a character or the book as a work of art.  The only consideration should be, 'did Austen succeed in creating the kind of character she set out to create?'; NOT, 'did I like Fanny Price as a person?', or, 'would I like to have Fanny Price as a friend?'.<br />Anyway, a good book, flawed only by the somewhat weak final volume.  Certainly one of Austen's best.
6302765536|5.0|Even funnier than 1 and three! If you like comedies buy all the homealones and especially this one! Kevin, the star of homealone1, gets on the wrong plane this time and goes to New York, unlike his family who're flying to Florida. He doesn't feel very sorry about it, though, because his brother Buzz had humiliated him earlier, and 'sides he's got his father's wallet, which is chock full of credit cards and cash! He signs into the plaza hotel, where he hires a limo to drive him to a toy store. The store's owner tells him that going to donate all the store's money to a children's hospital. Kevin's just settling in when his two enemies from homealone1 (Marv and Harry) bust out of jail and grab him. They tell him that they're going to rob the toy store. Kev escapes from them, and, feeling sorry for the hospital, booby-traps a house and lures Harry and Marv into it. Of course they fall for all the traps, which are MUCH more dangerous and gruesome than in homealone1. There's a suprising ending!<br />P.S. I only told a very small part of homealone2, so don't worry, it isn't spoiled for you!
B000056PWV|4.0|Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's most suspenseful films, and, I believe, the first to use a winning formula that he would repeat in some of his later films.  The formula combines a mystery with a love story with some minor subplots.  The mystery serves as the main storyline, the vehicle that creates the dramatic tension and suspence.  The love story is a secondary storyline and the affairs are always troubled in some way.  The resolution of the mystery decides the outcome of the love story - the couple either gets it together or they fall apart.  The subplots are carefully scripted to add commentary on the love story, to give dimensions to the love birds.<br />In RW, the mystery is 'did the Raymond Burr character kill his wife?'  This is the backbone of the film and it's in the ebb and flow of the solution of this mystery that suspence is created, built up, and sustained.  The love story is the affair between Stewart and Kelly.  It's troubled because these two couldn't be more unalike.  And in the beginning of the film, Stewart is convinced the differences are irreparable, and is ready to call of the whole thing.  As the mystery unfolds, however, Kelly is drawn into Stewart's world of suspicions, and by the end, she plays such an instrumental part in forcing the denouement that Stewart is forced to completely revise his opinion of her and their relationship.  In other words, the mystery saves the relationship.  Along the way, the lives of Stewart's neighbors (the subplots) act as a running commentary on Stewart and Kelly and their relationship.  The ups and downs of the unknowing neighbors also adds a lot of fun and humor.<br />This formula would be repeated in some of Hitchcock's later films.  Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds, and Marnie all share the same underlying structure.  In The Birds, for example, the mystery is 'what is up with them birds?', the love affair is between Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor, and the subplots are the jealousies between the womenin the film.  Same structure, just different characters and storylines.  <br />If the structures were the same, however, the results were quite different.  Rear Window, for example, is particularly successful at creating suspence.  I think the reason for this is that the mystery storyline is literally kept always before the viewers' eyes.  There are few moments when Stewart isn't peering out his window obsessing about the supposed murder, few moments when the characters aren't talking about the murder.  Compare this to The Birds when the only time the birds are really talked about is in that one restaurant scene.  Notice that that is also one of the most interesting scenes in the film.  So it's a case of 'out-of-sight, out-of-mind'.  In RW, we are never allowed to lose sight of the murder, it's ALWAYS in our minds, and as such, the mystery - and the suspense it engenders - the grows in stature.<br />On the whole, a good film.  The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star film is the confusion surrounding the movements in the murderer's apartment.  For example, we actually see a woman leave Burr's apartment early in the morning of the day after the crime was committed.  If Burr really killed his wife in the apartment, as Stewart claims, then who is that woman?  This is never explained.<br />A film worth seeing, and if you're a Hitchcock fan, even worth owning.
0380977788|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller.  His diction is perfect.  He does not waste words, but is not miserly with them either.  His descriptions never fail to rouse a knowing nod and smile from the reader.  Even when writing a quick throwaway piece in his journal...his style is impeccable.  <br />For this novel, Neil sets his eyes on another audience: young adults.  He gives children (or, as he has said, 'strange little girls of all ages and genders' - a nod to his friend Tori Amos and her 2001 \\"Strange Little Girls\\" album) a deliciously creepy novel about a girl, a new flat, and her other mother.  <br />Coraline (not Caroline, even though all of the adults who live in the other flats keep on saying it that way and ignoring her corrections) and her parents move into a new home.  One day, she pesters her father one too many times, so he sends her off on an expedition: find the water heater, count everything blue, count all the doors and windows.  She does so, and is shocked to find that there are 13 doors that open and one that doesn't.  She asks her mother what is behind the 14th door, and is told that it was bricked over when the house was broken up into flats.  Her mother unlocks the door to show her this, but doesn't lock it again.<br />Later, Coraline creeps back, and finds that the door opens into another flat.  It is just like her own, but not quite.  In her room (green and pink, not boring like her own), she finds the sorts of clothing that she thinks she would have if she could pick out her own wardrobe -- not a grey school skirt, but costumes.  In the kitchen, she finds her other parents -- not her real parents who work and don't play with her, but other parents who cook real food (not something from a \\"recipe\\" involving tarragon and butter beans) and dote upon her.  Coraline knows that this is not right, and returns to her own flat.<br />Thus begins Coraline's adventure.  The other mother steals Coraline's parents.  Coraline returns to the other flat to getthem back.  Along the way, she makes friends with the most sarcastic of cats and finds the ghosts of other children who were stolen away by the other mother.  <br />Gaiman's mastery of timing has never been shown so well than in this novel.  Just when things are getting really scary, he breaks in with a droll and dry line that makes the reader laugh.  This is a novel that is just begging to be read aloud -- as Neil Gaiman himself did on 02 July 2002 in Berkeley, California.  His audience, around 500 people, hung on his every word.  The adults in the audience were just as delighted as the children to have someone read such a delicious story to them.  If you dislike reading aloud, you can always buy the audio CD (complete, unabridged) version of this story.
0156711427|2.0|A Passage to India by EM Forster is about two women, Miss. Quested and Mrs. Moore who take a trip to India in order to have Miss. Quested married to Mrs. Moore's son.  When they get their Mrs. Moore meets a local doctor named Aziz, and the two strike up a friendship.  Their friendship however is criticized by the British in the area but they arrange to have a picnic in the caves near by.  In the caves Miss. Quested is seemingly assaulted and we see the full brunt of racialist thought in India.  <BR>    <BR>As entertainment, this novel was decent.  I wasn't compelled or bored, it was simply ok.  As a satire however it was fairly weak.  I found it unconvincing and a weak portrayal of an important subject.  The crime against Miss. Quested was ridiculious and it's hard to believe someone would be that hysterical.  <br />Technically I found the novel to be decent.  I wasn't blown away by Forsters writing even though he wrote it in obvious poetic undertones.  Overall I wasn't greatly impressed with this novel and I wouldn't call it a classic or any sort of statement about racism.  Read some Richard Wright or To Kill a Mockingbird for insight into racialist thought.
1878424319|1.0|I read this book because it was recommended to me by a therapist that I respect and admire.  I still admire the therapist, but this book was not for me at all.  I tried hard to understand and get some pearls of wisdom out of it, but it was work.  I could have spent my time in more useful ways.  Sure, the ideas are great . . . it's just that most human beings can't be that perfect.  In my opinion, to try to be would be completely unrealistic.
B000066NW0|5.0|Have you ever noticed that when you are in a certain mood that you want to listen to a certain kind of music? Avril Lavigne's CD &quot;Let Go&quot; is an awesome piece of work that has songs for when you're mad, happy, bummed about your break up...etc. The awesome part about these songs are that they are all written and preformed by the 17 year old Avril who is nothing short of a musical prodigy. Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see every single one of her songs on the radio sooner or later. However, instead of waiting to hear them there, go buy the CD already!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's Cd can be enjoyed by everyone because all her songs relate to real life situations. Her lyrics are a rare type because very few artists write their own songs and even if they do not all of them are written from the heart and have true meaning. Seeing that Avril's favorite Cd (as is mine) is \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" by Alanis Morisette we can see how the unique style of her writing comes about because alanis does the same thing original lyrics from the heart that everyone can relate to.....avril doesnt only share the relationships part of her life but just how she feels inside!  One of my favorite songs is \\"I'm With You\\" because i think everyone feels like that at some time or another....what i got from the songs is waiting for someone to come into your life even though u dont't know who they are  but you're with them and everyone has a fantasy boy/girl!!!! Well in conclusion to my review i just gotta say AVRIL LAVIGNE is AWESOME i recommend this Cd to everyone i know and although her first CD just came out i know the whole CD by heart and i just can't wait for her second album to come out!!!!!!!!
B000002J09|5.0|This is the greatest piece of music ever to be concieved through human creation. No matter who you are, what your opinion of music is, and what kind of music you like, any and every single man, women, or child on the planet earth should own this 8 track master work by the most talented four men ever to walk, known as the classic rock band Led Zeppelin. Every track from Black Dog until When The Levee Breaks is an extremely superb example of music, Led Zeppelin, and human kind at its best. Showing again and again the range and contrast ability of Led Zeppelin. There is no better first track than Black Dog, a fast and powerful blues inspired piece. Following after it is Rock and Roll, another fast paced awsome track, emphasizing on the supreme work of drummer John Henry Boham. The next track is my favorite song of all time. The Battle of Evermore, inspired in-part by none other than the climax of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, is an orgasmic flare of sweet guitar yet slower than the songs before, retaining a power and mistique equal in no other song. The fourth track is Stairway To Heaven, Led Zeppelin's most known song. It is a song near perfection itself with excellent work by all members of the band in a slow and sweet serenade ending in a powerful trip of a climax similar to a rain of fire. Track 5 is Misty Mountain Hop, another partailly LOTR inspired piece. It is powerful and contains great work by singer Robert Plant. Afterward is the song called Four Sticks because the drummer used four sticks for the song. It is a some what progressive song most likely headed by bassist John Paul Jones. Track 7 is Going To California. It holds a poetic-like shyness with the occasional boost of energy. Finally, When The Levee Breaks is a creative blues/folk song featuring harmonica and awsome work by the band. If you don't have the CD yet, then your behind.
B000063CPL|5.0|Do not overrate Janick Gers. At times, he sounds terrible. But, as I previously said, he's a great songwriter. Either side on the debate 'with or without Gers' is wrong. Anyway, he should be kept in the band.<br />I have no idea why one of my reviews was not published. May be a &quot;well-educated&quot; editor assumed that it was not relevant to the subject. That is complete ignorance and stupidity, an insult that the questioned editor completely deserves.
0451450523|5.0|I've now read this book twice, and I've started to read it a third time.  I never ever read books more than once, even when I think they are excellent.  This book never fails to make me cry, even though it seems to lack great tragedy.  This book is simply so beautiful that it makes you cry.  On the surface it is a child's story, but beneath the fairy tale exterior lies a testimonial to truth, love, life, and lost innocence.  Do not read this book and let the deeper meaning evade you.  If you enjoy this book I highly reccomend the animated movie version of it, which is also remarkably beautiful, while leaving out some important details.  Also, I'd like to inform other TLU lovers that a live action movie is in the making and will be released in Fall/Winter 2003.  This version will not be made after the original animated movie, but will be more thoroughly based on the book itself.  I, and other fans, are eagerly awaiting its arrival.
B00005JKG7|2.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and trust me I have seen many! Phantom pirates kill and mutilate people for a piece of driftwood!<BR>If you're a fan of the movie fine but at least be honest with unsuspecting buyers. If your looking for a great story and lots of chills this is NOT the movie you are looking for. If you want chills without the gore try The Others.<BR>If your searching for blood and guts watch the remake of House on haunted hill. Both movies are so much better than this one!<br />P.S. I gave it a second star ONLY for Jamie lee Curtis presence, and performance!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|The DVD of Ron's Howard's Oscar winner about troubled math genius John Nash tops the theatrical experience, despite some technical flaws. The video looks handsome in its scenes of Eastern academia, fall colors warm but a bit flat at times. The nightmarish cold war scenes impart a definite chill with midnight-rendezvous blacks and cobalt blues. True flesh tones help sell Greg Cannom's often terrific makeup work.<br />James Horner's swirling, math-inspired music sinks deep subwoofer roots via the Dolby Digital. The dialogue sounds muffled at times. Star Russell Crowe, in particular, seems to swallow more than a few lines, but it sounds like a mix or production issue. The problem can be mitigated by hiking your center speaker volume -- a fix that's a [bad] throwback to the early days of the DVD format. On Howard's commentary, the review disc's center track took a sudden leap in volume (at 1:49). Surround was OK but not much of a factor.<br /> In his commentary, Howard does not address the various controversies surrounding \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" and its many fictions, but he shares some of the internal debates over the film's tricky \\"delusional\\" scenes. He points out clues planted along the way for those working on the movie's mysteries, \\"wondering if we were going to get caught.\\" While Howard works hard at being a good host, his understated commentary does become hard to sit through as the movie passes two hours. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, whose adaptation won the Oscar, seems more at home with the commentary process. He does, however, repeat many of Howard's observations. The special features include some interesting shots of Crowe and Nash on the set, looking like bookends of a life. The section on makeup (the characters age a half century) is fascinating.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Probibly the most beautiful movie ever made.  I am talking about scenery, score, color, lighting and costume.  It is flawless.  The story is capturing too.  I just love the dragged out climax where you are dying for it to speed up but Stanley drags it out to its fullest potential.  Brilliant story telling.  There were no artificial lights used in this movie.  It was all done with a newly developed lense and candle light.  Innovative and spectacular.  A true work of art.  There is something about Stanely's movies where once you see a moment of his film, you can't turn away until it is over.  My uncle hates watching movies and this one is over 3 hours and he had to watch it till the end as he was so intregued.  That is saying something.
B00005JKNF|5.0|The master collaborator Robert Altman probably doesn't mind, but Julian Fellowes has done it again. The first-time film screenwriter, who walked away with &quot;Gosford Park's&quot; only Oscar in March, deftly steals the show with his commentary on the DVD version of the film. Fellowes is deeply knowledgeable about the English upper class's old traditions and serves as an entertaining guide into their curious world as it was in the 1930s -- the era depicted in &quot;Gosford.&quot; Hardly pausing for a breath or needing to collect his thoughts, the British writer-actor delivers one of the best DVD commentaries to date.<br />Altman, who appears on a separate commentary track, has his moments as well. The secret to his success? Altman gathers a great cast and then waits for them to make on-camera mistakes, thus hitting &quot;that truth button.&quot; Altman, amiable and alert, speaks in the tones of an expert witness at a malpractice trial. He's nudged along by his son, production designer Stephen Altman, and producer David Levy (both unidentified until the commentary is over). In a 20-minute section of deleted footage, Altman confidently gives the merits of each scene and then dismisses them (even Maggie Smith feels his ax).<br />The DVD comes in widescreen only, helping viewers track the comings and goings of Altman's 40 or so players. The picture looks OK; a bit soft and dark in places. The aspect ratio is about 2.27:1 with the 16x9 monitor enhancement. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound adds unexpected life to the proceedings, delivering great atmospherics. As with any Altman movie, conversations overlap willy-nilly, with lines coming from any direction, as they would in real life.
078324228X|5.0|It is one of the most inspirational movies off all time.  It is upsetting to know that it is a true story but that is what makes it so gripping.  Denzel should have one the best actor oscor for his portrail of Ruben Hurricane Carter but at least he was compinsated this year.   If you are a writer than see this movie as it has some very inspiring moments that will make you want to hit your keyboard immediately.
B00003CXTF|2.0|From up to its pretty exciting 15-minute sequence as the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, 'Pearl Harbor' is a lumbering, barely involving film, which gives us a love triangle between two hunkish World War II fighter pilots, Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck and pretty nurse Kate Beckinsale.<br />'Pearl Harbor' tries to capture the atmosphere and engaging set up of 1997's better \\"Titanic\\" by setting up three star-crossed lovers, instead of the usual two. It fails terribly, but it's mostly scripter Randall Wallace's fault, which tries to balance three to four subplots by compromising the film's integrity and intelligence.<br />This 3+ hour film is obviously meant as a tribute to the people who died December 7, 1942 and has pretty nice cinematography, but the film itself is a shoddy-made puzzle in which all the pieces don't quite fit together. <br />The characters wallow in sentimentality and the film unsuccessfully tries to create atmosphere, romance and humor, but the film's bottom drops out in the final third, not only to reveal a plot full of holes, but a incomprehensible story told in bad faith.<br />Sorry, Bruckheimer. Nice try but no cigar.
B0000683DH|5.0|This is a great movie.  Star trek fan or not, it is simply fantastic.  The dialouge was so wonderfully crafted and the score was incredible.  Ricardo Mantaban's rendition of Kahn/Ahab was brilliant.  It tied into the original series beautifully and it left the story open for two more chapters.  Even though The Voyage Home was not very good.  I loved it how they incorperated pieces of Moby Dick and A Tale of Two Cities into the story.  Two of my all time favorite books.  And we got a glimps of the damaging effect that Kirk's carreer had on his personal life.  Truely a step beyond what ever was or ever will be again in the Trek universe.
6305546789|5.0|In 1978, John Carpenter directed one of the most brilliant horror classics ever made.  This small budget film starred one of the first performances given by the wonderful and now immensely popular Jamie Lee Curtis, and was named 'Halloween'.  Over twenty years later, this film is still known as one of the best and scariest horror films ever produced.<br />The plot is very basic, but it manages to be very affective in what it sets out do, which is to scare and petrify its audience.  It managed to do so back in 1978, and it still manages to do so today.  Michael Myers, who killed his sister when he was just a child, is now older and much smater.  He escapes from the mental institution in which he had been kept imprisoned for many years and returns to his small hometown of Haddonfield to wreak havoc on unsuspecting babysitters on Halloween night.  The scenes are very eerie and creepy, and the chilling music score makes the movie even more terrifying.<br />Halloween has become a horror classic, and will remain so for an eternity.  Anchor Bay produces an excellent DVD with awesome, eye popping extras.  Never before has Halloween been so vividly clear with crystal clear audio.  The extras contained are trailers, tv and audio spots, a photo gallery, and a special feature called 'Halloween Unmasked 2000'.  This is a must own for any Michael Myers/horror fan.
0345423496|3.0|I really loved 2001.  And the next two were very good, but this conclusion did not have the same appeal to me.  It did have its moments of brilliance but they were few and far in between.  It did not spark the imagination they way I expected.  It was almost as if it was written by a different author.  I guess I had too high os standards after being so blown away by 2001.
0380820846|4.0|Finally, a book that was well worth the wait.  The story of Colin and Penelope was been waiting in the wings with each subsequent Bridgerton novel.  It seemed only fitting that Penelope should get this particular man.  Way to go Penelope.  Buy this book.  Read the entire Bridgerton series.  There are few authors whom have been able to keep up the high standards as they continue to write about the same family, each time featuring different members.  Heck, the only author I can think of who has truly pulled this off before is Johanna Lindsey with the Malory clan.  Well Julia Quinn you are in a class of your own with your amazing brand of humor and caring.  Oh, and for finally revealing the true identity of Lady Whistledown.  That is truly a moment to cherish.  This is a book to cherish and put on an often reached for shelf with all the other Bridgertons so that you can read them over and over again.
0393312836|5.0|This is an incredible book.  The author created a slang language in it that was a mix of cockney and russian slang.  The outcome is a funny yet disturbing piece of prose that at times reads like poetry.  It is vicious with a point.  The author is fighting a conflict between being evil or being good because you have no choice.  It reminded me of the Catholic religion and Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.  Are you being good because you are afraid of the consiquences of being bad or are you being good because it feels like it is the rite thing for you to do.  Living life as you see it should be lived.  You don't kill or rape because a Religious law tells you it is sin; instead you don't do these things because you know that they are wrong.  This is what Nietzsche called living beyond good and evil.  And it has neve being better protrayed than in this book.  A clock work orange.
B00000JCOV|3.0|If you like roaring and screaming and you hate society, this is definitely the CD for you. Coupled by eerie sounds and language you wouldn't want your parents to hear, this is the metal album to end all metal albums. I would definitley consider this album to be on top of the hardcore &quot;ladder.&quot; The lyrics were fairly decent and the music, or should I say sounds, weren't half bad. This would be great to listen to if you were throwing a temper tantrum. In one of the songs it goes &quot;you think about killing everyone, but you never do&quot; or something like that. Yeah, it really sort of packs a punch if you know what I mean. Anyway, if your taste in music meets the guidelines I discussed in the beggining, you'll have a blast with this.
B000065U1N|3.0|I struggled to watch this movie.  It was very well done and a good movie don't get me wrong, but what those boys were put through made me feel very indignant.  Why does the US military feel that it has to police every nation into treating its people better?  I feel that a nation needs to work things out for themselves so that when they achieve independance and freedom, they will know the struggles that it took to gain it and they wil use it productively.  imagine if during the time of American slavery, another more powerful nation came in and tried to fix it for them.  America would not be as great as they are today.  It is a long road to develop self determination for a nation and it must be developed on its own.  I know I am digressing from the movie topic but these are the thoughts that I had as I saw this movie.  The movie was very visual and very well directed.  a triumph yet stil, hard to watch.
038533558X|4.0|This is typically good Coben: a zippy pace, good characters, lots of twists and gentle humor. The plot unfolds like an origami creation, revealing more, then more, then more. The back story hinges on the murder, eleven years earlier, of hero Will's former girlfriend, Julie, and the disappearance of her killer--Will's roguish, bad-boy brother, Ken. Then there's the death of Will's new love, Sheila who works with Will and the wonderful character, Squares, at Covenant House. (Lots of good, true stuff about street kids.) The story gallops along at breathtaking speed and then, in the last fifteen or so pages, it gets resolved--but ... the machine goes Tilt. One problem is that the author has teenager Katy (younger sister of Julie) suddenly sounding like a middle-aged matron; in other words, she goes so far out of character that it's hard to buy. That aside, with disbelief suspended, things get wrapped up nicely.<br />Unfortunately, that bogus and absurd pop-word \\"closure\\" is used so often throughout the book that it becomes annoying. Coben's editor, or the copyeditor, should have caught this because it  diminishes the impact of the work. Nevertheless, Coben's story-telling skills remain in top form and this is a highly entertaining book.<BR>Recommended.
0679411585|4.0|This is a story that moved me deeply.  It is violent, gory and true.  It is amazing that the American president could have missmanaged a war to such an engrossing scale.  It is appalling.  This book shows what the troops of Viet Nam were.  Heros and victoms in equal measure.  They should give this book to kids to read at high school so they fully understand the perils that these men faced on the war field and at home.  It opened my eyes to a lot of differnt things about war.
0316666343|5.0|With the storyline of a girl being brutally murdered, one would think that this would be a depressing and sad book.  It is anything but.  A tender and poignant tale, Susie watches her family struggling to move on with their lives after her death.  Told with the sweet innocence of a 14 year old girl, it is one of the most touching, moving and incredible books I have read in a very long time.  Simply put, an absolutely wonderful book.
B00003CXAA|5.0|These three movies are incredible.  It was just recently that I first viewed them and I was utterly impressed.  Al Pacino gives such an incredible preformance in each episode and the supporting acting in sublime.  A story of a family's struggle to protect each other in the darkness of the American mofia.  It is filled with coflict, tragedy and remorse. A powerful story that you will never forget.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I wanted to buy this CD because I was thrilled by her first album and I bought her second album. I wanted to see her third album so I went into a shop and I listened to it there. In fact, at first I thought some of the songs weren't very rhythmical and melodic, I thought the vocals didn't fit in with the instrumental parts. ... And when I learnt the songs, I really started to like it and now I think that the music is really good, together with some catchy tunes and melodic beats. Britney's voice doesn't go very much in range, but those people who hate her should face the fact that she's got a very nice color to her voice and that's something a few people just can't bear. Anyway, I'll give you the list of the songs.<BR>1. Slave 4 U - an unusual beat that catches attention, together with some sexy base, makes it a really unique blend which you start liking after a few listenings.<BR>2. Overprotected - some typical Britney song, with good vocals and catchy tune. It has also got a sort of teen spirit in it.<BR>3. Lonely - the beginning makes me practice my low range :-) I really like the change in pitch because the verses are very low and suddenly, it goes to the chorus which is set on a higher pitch, creating a good contrast. I really like this song a lot.<BR>4. Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - from the movie Crossroads, I think it makes you think about yourself (if you're a girl that is), it makes you realize your true self and it's got a deeper meaning than the rest of the songs. Slow and steady, I think it's a good listening song if you feel like calming down or relaxing. <BR>5. Boys - this song is mainly sexy talk that fits some kind of rhythm and I don't listen to it very much because I mainly like singing along and I can't sing along with this one since it's more like talking. It's ok though.<BR>6. Anticipating - a fun-loving, easy-going song which has got really nice vocals, I like singing along with it, although it took more time to learn the pace. I really like it because it's got more like a \\"summer\\" base.<BR>7. I Love Rock n' Roll - good and also sexy, I like Britney's voice color in that song. I really like singing along with it, the music is funky and the beat is cool. <BR>8. Cinderella - I liked this song since the beginning, because it's got a typical likeable melody, the music is catchy and the vocals perfectly fit. One of my favorites on the album.<BR>9. Let Me Be - even though I got the CD for a long time now, I at first didn't sing or listen to this song at all - the beginning seemed to be a bit boring. But recently I decided to listen to it and I think it's awesome - almost the best song on the album, surprisingly. I love the whole concept - also contrast between slower, less rhythmic verse and melodic, beautiful chorus. I like singing along - I basically learnt it in three listenings! :-)<BR>10. Bombastic Love - I also liked this song since the very beginning - a typically catchy melody and verses, I like singing along. Also sort of \\"teen\\" style, with some flexible-voice parts so I liked singing those which develop voice flexibility - I think Britney does well in this song.<BR>11. That's Where You Take Me - a sweet gentle song, easy to sing along with, with not much vocal range. It's sort of flowy and is relaxing to listen to. Also a bit of fantasy base in it, kind of dreamy. I like it although I don't listen to it very often.<BR>12. When I Found You - a very beautiful song, with some high notes which develop your vocal range. I really like singing along with it, because it's so beautiful and challenging. Although Britney doesn't sing best the high notes (you can hear the vocalists covering up for her in there), she does have a very pretty voice all throughout the verses. It's melodic and at a slower pace.<BR>13. What It's Like To Be Me - typical N'Sync style song, I like that style (I like N'Sync as well) because it's similar to computerized songs - the rhythm and the beat. It's also very catchy, it sticks in your head. At some places a bit challenging not for the range but more for the \\"cool\\" style of the voice color - I think Britney sings it well, especially the coloring in \\"don't you wanna be my man\\" when she sings that. So a good song on the album, perfect to close it off. <BR>All in all I think this album was a major hit, I think it wasn't better than the first album (that was fantastic), but she improved from the second album which was sometimes boring or fake but also quite good. This album was better and I was surprised at that - the songs are really worthy of listening to, but some songs require your patience and you should spend more time listening to them so that you find the real taste of the whole thing. You won't be sorry you bought it, though. Check it out!
0060987464|5.0|The best thing about this book is that with very minimal knowledge of who the band, Marilyn Manson is, you can appreciate and fully enjoy the book.<br />Manson gives a very candid look into his life, starting from his childhood and continuing to his music career.  This includes disturbing stories from his grandfather's basement, his awkward teen years and his response to all the rumors circulating the goings-on at his concerts.  This is a very fast and enjoyable, yet disturbing read.<br />One may not think this book is true because of how outlandish some of the stories may seem.  But when Manson presents them, showing his weaknesses and describing very embarassing moments, this shows his truthfulness.<br />It is shocking, but that is to be expected, coming out of Marilyn Manson.  I enjoyed the book and have read it several times.  Be prepared to encounter some gross scenes and schocking tales, but also be prepared to read an excellent autobiography by a very talented writer.<br />You may not be a fan of his band or music, but after reading this book, you'll see a whole different side to Manson, a more human than freak show side.
B00002E23E|5.0|This DVD by far illustrates Led Zeppelin on there game.  It was one of the best music DVD's I have ever seen.  The music was phenomenal and the imagery was superb.    Classic Zeppelin hits like Black Dog and Since I've Been Lovin You sounded even better on the stage than in the studio.  Robert Plant was competely on his game, and gave us one of the best performances i've ever seen, in every song.  Stairway to Heaven was done wonderfully, with Jimmy Page giving us one of the best guitar solo's i've ever heard.  John Paul Jones was good on his bass, but even better on the keyboards, especially with No Quarter.  John Bonham delivered a powerfull, heartpounding drum solo (with his bare hands) on Moby Dick.  The only songs I have to critizize was the 30 minute long Dazed and Confused, which seemed to drag on forever, and Whole Lotta Love, which I believe was improvised too much.  Other than that, this is a killer rock video, and a must have for Zeppelin fans.
6304211740|4.0|This is an excellent movie with the exception if you have read the book. The original story was brilliantly written by Charlotte Bronte and was very sweet and a somewhat sad story. The movie, however did not really remain faithful to the book all the way through. The actors were very good, but i wasn't much for their appearances. They did leave out some great scenes from the books, but overall it was a very good film. I would suggest seeing it even though it wasn't a perfect movie. I think even the book readers still might take to it.
B000068QY7|2.0|'Heathen Chemistry' was being heralded as Oasis's reurn to form after their experimental and dissapointing album 'Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants.'  From the beginning of the album to the end (omitting the occassional apparition of Oasis's glorious past such as 'Stop crying your heart out), one feels that the band are trying to mask a lack of originality and weak song material with loud recording. Albums such as 'Whats the Story Morning Glory' introduced the World to a band that had the personality and the talent to ressurect Beatle influences and throw them back into the heavans of brilliant music; all with the rasp of origniality in Liam's voice. 'Heathen Chemistry' maybe the band's final ignominous slip into the shadows.
B00003CXXI|4.0|Like most people, I think \\"Shrek\\" is wonderfully animated, fun, and witty.  With its \\"updated and revised\\" fairy tale story, \\"Shrek\\" should appeal to audiences of all ages.<br />Like most fairy tales, it is a moralistic story and in \\"Shrek\\" the moral is: don't judge someone on their looks alone.  It's a good lesson for kids and a nice reminder for adults.  However, \\"Shrek\\" is a little hypocritical in applying this message because it does not seem to apply to people of short stature.  The film abounds with various \\"short\\" jokes, and thus the hypocrisy of fat and ugly is ok, but being short is not. Rather odd.<br />But \\"Shrek's\\" greatest weakness is not its convoluted message, but its soundtrack.  \\"Shrek's\\" soundtrack is filled with modern pop songs. Yes, that works now, but in a few years the soundtrack will date the movie to its detriment.  Don't believe me?  Ever see \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid?\\"  \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is a great movie, which unfortunately is nearly ruined by its dated and silly soundtrack.  (Maybe back in the late 60's people thought it was really cool to have BJ Thomas singing \\"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\\" and a Burt Bacharach montage in the middle of a western, but nowadays that stuff is pure cheese!)  I have a bad feeling that several decades from now many people will have the same reaction when they hear \\"Hey, now you're a rock star!\\" while watching \\"Shrek.\\"<br />Finally, am I the only one who thinks that poor, old Shrek gets ripped off in the end?  Oh well, I guess the message of the movie didn't exactly strike home with me entirely.
B000068QY7|5.0|What you have to understand about this album is that it really does let go of the chains of expectations. Noel Gallagher (cheif song writer for the band) has often been pressured into defining British Rock n Roll, like Oasis most definately did in the mid 90's. On certain albums of thiers you can feel that pressure holding back some truely simple and amazing songs. Much like the Beatles are capable of, Heathen Chemistry takes the Gallagher song writing skills and refrains from complicating them with awkward productions and meaningless filler. Thus the true Oasis rocker \\"the Hindu Times\\" and \\"Force of Nature\\" the albums first 2 tracks really kick it off spectacularly. Other stand out tunes would be all 3 of brother Liam's writing contributions; \\"Songbird\\", \\"Born on a Different Cloud\\" and \\"Better Man\\". Fix on lyrics suck as \\". .Loaded just like a gun You're the hero that's still unsung. . . \\" which is Liam on Lennon. Also Gem Archer's awesome stomper \\"Hung in a Bad Place\\" is raw and rockin. The album shines above other releases of this summer. With other sunny melodies and spectral awakenings such as \\"She is Love\\" and \\"(Probably) All in the Mind\\", Heathen Chemistry is truely a laid back and soulful rock n roll record by the most underappreciated band ever(in the US).
0380820846|5.0|As you may have figured out, in this installment of the Bridgerton series, we finally find out who is Lady Whistledown.  Although I would love to blurt it out, I will let you read the book yourself &lt;smile&gt;.  In the past 3 Bridgerton Books, you catch glimpses of Poor Penelope and all you can do is hope that someday she will get her man Colin Bridgerton.  Well finally she has her own book and indeed she gets her man. The only complaint that I could have with this book as that They barely spend much time together before Colin is falling in love.  I wish Quinn played the romancing part out a bit more. But it still was a great novel that I could not put down and in fact read in 1 and 1/2 days.  I really can't wait to read Eloise's story and I wonder where she disapeared to?
B00006690G|3.0|Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to like about \\"The Eminem Show.\\" Eminem is undoubtedly one of the most talented and clever rappers out there (I'd rank him second only to Jay-Z in terms of sheer talent on the microphone) and there are some great songs here, hence the three stars. However, the lyrics here don't generally seem as sharp as those on \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\" All the topics there (his race, his outcast status, his hatred for his mother, the media's attack on him, etc.) are all here, and it's feeling like a repeat. <br />Also, the production isn't as engaging as \\"Marshall Mathers\\" (remember the funky bass of \\"I'm Back\\" and the chilly piano and drums of \\"The Way I Am\\"?). Dr. Dre is only the producer of three tracks (\\"Business,\\" \\"Say What You Say,\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\"). Not surprisingly, they're fantastic. However, Eminem himself produces the remainder of the album, with mixed results. \\"Square Dance,\\" \\"Without Me,\\" and \\"When the Music Stops\\" are backed with well-crafted beats, but the rest of the album suffers. Eminem's production style is a lot like Dre's, but not as memorable, and the songs all follow a pattern: slow beats with minor-key melodies and a half-sung chorus. Why anybody would only give Dr. Dre, the most creative producer in all of hip-hop, such a marginal role is beyond me.<br />Still, there are some great songs here, the music is decent at worst and phenomenal at best, and Slim Shady is still the most engaging psychopathic persona in music. It's just a shame more of the album doesn't show the relentless creativity and talent that \\"Marshall Mathers\\" had in spades.
0553274503|5.0|I'm not really one of those sentimental people. But this book really touched me. It made me understand how Charly felt- when he was frusterated- it made me feel like that. It also made me realize how cruel we treat other human beings on Earth. All Charly wanted was to be treated as a person- not an expieriment. Thats all any of us want to be treated as- a person. This was a truly excellent book and I reccommend it for everyone.
B000023VR6|5.0|How many people in rap music have redefined the sound of hip-hop not once, not twice, but three times (NWA's &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, &quot;The Chronic&quot;, and here)? Dr. Dre's latest effort is not only a stunning album, it is an amazing affirmation of his talent.<br />In terms of the rapping, this is probably a step up from 1992's &quot;The Chronic.&quot; Snoop Dogg is as good as ever. Eminem unleashes two cuts that are as great as the very best of his solo work. Xzibit is fun to listen to, and while newcomer Hittman doesn't make much of an impression, he doesn't get left behind. The real surprise is Dre himself, who has graduated into a pretty effective rapper with a laid-back, socially conscious worldview. The rhymes aren't stunning, but they work well in context.<br />However, Dr. Dre confirms his musical genius on &quot;2001.&quot; The beats here are all, without exception, wonderfully catchy and composed brilliantly. He moves beyond the standard West Coast sound here (the beats are more minimal and more futuristic) but the elegance, funkiness, and sheer class remains. This album shows, without a doubt, that Dr. Dre is the best producer of our time (and really has been since the beginning of the '90s). Every song is a pleasure to listen to.<br />&quot;2001,&quot; then, is a triumphant return from one of the most talented producers in music. If you want to hear the future of music, look no further.
B00003CX95|5.0|If I had to choose absolutely one movie to own and live with for the rest of my life, this is it. Mel Gibson is William Wallace. Love to just watch it for entertainment.  Love to watch it for the beautiful film making.  Love to watch it to see Mel.
B00005QG9J|5.0|a refreshing tangent from their funk-metal years, Incubus explores new music grounds as well as different instruments to go along with their music. although this CD has more songs that sound like Stellar from Make Yourself (in other words, they don't rock as hard like Incubus's funk metal songs from their earlier albums), but some songs still sound like Take Me To Your Leader, or Pardon Me.<BR>overall, a really good album that's worth the money- i recommend this
B00003CXI1|4.0|First of all, my 3 year old loves this movie. The first time he saw it, he was scared a little.  The monster that looks like shrek is fascinating to him and ofcourse quidditch is exactly what all little boys want to see.  Flying in brooms playing sports and being a hero on the field.  I read the books and I expected the movie to fall short and I was very surprised that it was good.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD has by far out done any other CD I have ever bought. Never in my entire 17 years gone out and bought a CD the day it came out. I had downloaded all the songs after hearing &quot;complicated&quot; for the first time. That song had me in a daze for weeks. It really got me. I had to get it as soon as it came out. It was amazing. It has to be my all time favorite CD and I listen to it over and over and take it wherever I go. The lyrics are wonderful and inspiring. She has taken punk to a new level with her deep lyrics and awesome guitar playing. She is the best since, God, I don't know when. I am trying the best I can to get her out there and share her music with everyone I know. All I know is this has to be the best CD I have ever bought and I am not at all surprised. I can't wait for future albums in the future.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|It looks great, it sounds great, it does nothing for me at all. It goes nowhere, and it couldn't interest me in the characters at all. Cardboard cutouts have more personality. The storyline simply wasn't there. My ruler has more twists. Had I seen it in the theatre, I would have walked out and gone and seen whatever was playing in the next room. If you love musicals and are amused by rhe constant recyling of old pop music lyrics in a new context, by all means, you'll love this one, but before you buy it, rent it. It's very easy not to like. We hit stop with over an hour remaining, and I don't expect we'll put it back in the DVD player.
0553106635|5.0|Martin's epic continues to be excellent.  The characters are still some of the deepest that I have ever read, and they all continue to develop (those that are left).  As anyone who has read the first two books knows, Martin has a singular passion for killing off his leading characters.  But far from detracting from the story, this adds an entirely new feeling of excitement, one that most fantasy books, and indeed all books, do not possess.  For almost any novel you can be quite sure who is going to be alive at the end, such as in Lord of the Rings, where all but one member of the Fellowship survives to the end.  In Martin's book, there are a \\"realistic\\" number of deaths, and there is a certain satisfaction in knowing that no character is protected by divine providence (the author).<br />Martin has certainly left a lot of story to write.  As with his previous two books, he has unearthed more questions than he has answered, and the war continues to go badly for the Starks.  Daenerys has become a far more gratifying character to read, now that she has amassed some power.  Jaime and Davos enter the fray as new POVs in this book.  Jaime's sections are extremely well-written, while Davos' is slower, but significant to the story.<br />I only have two small complaints:  1.  There is simply so much double crossing and murdering going on that it stretches the limits of credibility, though only very slightly.  2.  Martin includes far too much explicit sex.  The sex does not need to be removed, but it SHOULD be more implicit.<br />This series, Song of Ice and Fire, is easily one of my all-time favorites.  Martin is already in with Tolkien, Jordan, and Eddings.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love avrils cd let go.  it hits so close to home with each word.  she has major talent.  you can listen to the cd straight through and over and over and still never get tired of it.  some song are more punk/rock like sk8er boi and unwanted and other songs are slower and calmer like tomorrow.  its great cuz it shows different sides to teens and herself.  im with you and naked show more inner feelings and make you think how most if not all of it is true.  every song has a message you wont soon forget.  of all the cd's i own its the only one that ever makes it into my cd player.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I'll keep this as simple as possible (I'm usually long winded/keyboard happy and forget you don't want a book to read while deciding whether to buy this movie or not):<br />In short, I rented A.I. and, naturally, watched it.  Cried at several intervals (usually don't -everyone says that, I know).  Ended on a very thought-provoking twist.  I immediately started the movie over to watch once again.  Watched it the next night.  Returned it; promptly bought it.  All the while never imagined it would generate such split reviews from 'the people'.<br />I've been to many review sites:  IMDb.com, the Guardian reviews, the user comments from Amazon; and so on.  One thing I've noticed is that people either passionately loved this movies or passionately hated it -with very little in between.  I think the master design of the director was to cause an affect, knowing full well that it would strike a chord with all; positive, as well as, negative.  I think to some its just not within them to relate to the circumstance Kubrick and Spielberg conjurred -so they say they hated it.  At the same time, those who can stretch their imagination and feelings to envelope a robotic child programmed with the ability to love; these are the ones that will just LOVE this film.<br />Direction was superb toward very talented -gifted- actors:  Haley J. Osment(esp.), Jude Law, and even Frances O'connor made me BELIEVE.  John Williams touching score still makes me misty-eyed.<BR>Thank you for your time.<BR>Skot
0452282152|5.0|In an ideal situation you would read this book in front of Vermeer's painting 'girl with a pearl earring'. Chevalier seems to inspire the reader to keep looking at the painting. She has managed to write, in a delightful way, about the development of a beautiful painting. <br />A love affair between painter, painting and subject. And now a love affair between reader and book.<br />Chevalier has created a magnificent document about love and the love for art. A must for everyone who likes the old Flemish paintings.<br />I found it hard to stay away from this book and was happy to  read Chevalier's second book, 'Falling angels'. Completely different but equaly exquisite.
B000066NW0|5.0|&quot;Let's Go&quot; is a a breath of fresh air. This album is one that teens can listen to and actually relate. The songs are actually written by a teen, unlike the countless number of other songs written by older songwriters, which usually fail to capture the teen spirit. Every one of the songs on this album is catchy, fun, and original. This is one album you can't miss!
B000066C1N|5.0|After I saw the movie, I just had to have the soundtrack and I bought it. My top 5 favorite songs on the soundtrack are:<BR>1) You Can't Take Me<BR>2) Sound The Bugle<BR>3) Don't Let Go<BR>4) Get Off My Back<BR>5) Here I Am<BR>You have to check out this soundtrack
B000065U1N|5.0|Do not expect the typical war film in which you are shown soldiers who have signed up to save the world. Do not expect a message about fighting for the right cause. This movie is simply about fighting and sacrifice. There's nothing too advanced here, because for the almost twenty hours that his battle took place, nothing really mattered except survival. This film covers what might be a single scene in the grander scheme of things, but it seeks to highlight the efforts of the modern U.S. soldier, who fights wherever and whenever called.

At least five times you used \\"lay\\" when the correct grammar is \\"lie.\\" And this was not in dialogue.

B000066NW0|5.0|Personally, this album is by far the best I've bought in the past month. This CD has a well blended mix of punky rock and sweet, slow songs that get you right there...>im pointing to my heart< Avril Lavigne's musical talent and awesome lyrics have truely touched me in a sentimental way. This sounds pretty weird, but to an aspiring musician/songwriter, its a good description of what I'm feeling. Lavinge's honest and down-to-earth lyrics have opened a new door for me in writing my own songs. She's really a remarkable artist and I seriously recommend this album to anybody - young, old; girl, guy, whatever. Avril Lavigne's music touces everyone on a personal basis weather they know it from the off or not. It might just be me because I'm a big fan of her's and I'm close to her age and can totally relate to the songs that she wrote about ex-boyfriends and what teenage life is like, but its more than that and if you want to experience the awesome \\"awakening\\" that I have, then this is a really great investment. BUY IT!!! IT'S REALLY WORTH IT!!!
B000021XS0|2.0|This album exhibits everything that [is bad] about progressive rock.  I cannot understand how anyone can claim that this album is a work of genius, as it has been called many times before.  I gave this album two stars because John Petrucci is an excellent guitaist and Jordan Rudess and Mike Portnoy are also very good musicians.  I really liked some of DT's earlier albums like Awake and A Change of Seasons but this album truly is overindulgent...that the band is trying to pass off as a work of true prog/concept genius.  Listening to \\"Through Her Eyes\\" seriously makes me almost vomit. <br />If you are a casual fan of modern metal or hard rock music, you might want to buy this, or if you are a fan of metal that would like to get into prog a little bit.  <br />If you have no progressive rock albums, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!! spare yourself.  try some real classic prog! like RUSH's HEMISPHERES or A FAREWELL TO KINGS or PERMANENT WAVES go out and buy YES - CLOSE TO THE EDGE or FRAGILE or THE YES ALBUM.  or even just stick to Pink Floyd! Wish You Were, Animals or the Wall should satisfy your progressive needs before you stoop to this level.<br />This album is not good.  People rave about it because it's a concept album and is done in several \\"scenes\\" or movements.  However, this album is just a watered down, poorly written and ill-contrived rip-off of good bands like Rush, Yes, Floyd, ELP or Crimson. <br />Post-Script: if you want to hear extremely proficient and meaningful Dream Theater-related music, buy Liquid Tension Experiment!

B00003CX95|2.0|This big budget historical epic, complete with the most explicit maimings ever captured on film, and Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of King Edward as a villian so foul you are surprised he does not cackle, is big, broad spectacle in the Cecil B. DeMille tradition.  Alas, it ultimately fails to give a reason for William Wallace's fight and fails to give its hero's cry of &quot;freedom!&quot; any real meaning.  Apparently, &quot;freedom&quot; means Scottish women would be abused and debauched only by Scottish men and not by English ones.  Wallace is definitely a figure worthy of a film like this, but I think this film misses the chance to explore the nature of Scottish nationalism, and it misses the chance to explore the remarkable example of a peasant who came to lead armies.  It misses the chance to explore the collision of a tribal culture and a feudal one.  It's a good movie, but nowhere near living up to the hype.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|I just finished watching \\"Memento\\", and it is definetly one of the most mindbending movies I have ever sceen. Just let me put it this way. The movies gose backwards. \\"Memento\\" seriously moves backwards. It tells the story of a man whos wife was raped and muder by the same guy who knocked him on the head and gave a disorder were he can't use his short term memorie at all. so has to find and kill the man who killed his wife using notes he takes on every little thing he dose. As well as trusting people who aren't very trust worthery. Like the guy who might have done the killing and is just trying to mess around with his poor mind. <BR>The movie starts off with the man killing the killer who killed his wife, and then it gose backwards from there. It is pretty easy for me to see were some people would hate the very original \\"Memento\\". Just getting up to go the restroom while watching \\"Memento\\" is not a good idea. You might get lost.
B00005R2BG|4.0|I think the main strength of this movie is definitely its scenery and costumes.  Both were amazingly atmospheric and beautiful, and unashamedly echoed the emotions acted out around them.  Kidman and McGregor were both really good as the two leads - I found them believable and they created strong chemistry between them.  I also enjoyed the music although I wish 'Lady Marmalade' had been performed straight through, not just as backing for Zidler.  Some of the love songs don't seem amazing at first but they grow on you, and the Hindi Sad Diamonds play, El Tango de Roxanne, and The Show Must Go On were three songs that sent shivers down my spine - the camera angles were excellent (although I agree that sometimes it all gets a bit carried away and I would have appreciated a little less madness from the filming.)  <BR>The weak point of the film is probably the characters, who are all pretty one-dimensional.  Normally this would constitute a major flaw, but in this I don't think it matters so much because what's important is the music and the atmosphere.  The actors are all doing their best with a rather weak script and that's good enough.<BR>I think this film would not be good if you were in a very cynical mood, if you hate musicals and/or high-camp glamour, or if you hate Nicole Kidman.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend it - even if you don't like it, it's different enough from most movies to make you think a little (even if it is only 'that's a perfect example of how not to make a movie'. ^_^) It's an original and exciting film and I don't regret seeing it for a moment!
079284131X|5.0|Good morning Chicago! The days till Christmas are almost here! This jolly Chritsmas get your child the best gift ever! A good guy doll! He moves! He walks! He talks! He says whole sentences! WOW!<br />Hard working mother(played by the talinted Catherine Hicks) listens to this T.V. offer, and so dose her son Andy. She dose not have the cash to buy her son a good guy doll at full price, so buys a used one for half off from a some homeless dude. Little dose she know that the cute little dolly has been possessed by the soul of killer who's into voodoo. Now he wants to exchange souls with the boy, Andy using a certain ritual to do it. When murders start happening all of the sudden a cop helps Hicks find out whats going on.<br />I have been a huge fan of horror movies since I was a little boy, and this movie was the one that got me into horror movies in the first place. If your a horror fan, but have seen this yet, get it now! If your worried about this movie being any good or not. Watch it as soon as you can and clear all dought out of your mind.
B000063T0T|4.0|This is a great thing to buy if you liked the MR movie because it has almost every song you could want.  Almost - there's a few songs (such as Kylie Minogue's appearance) that are omitted and I'd much rather have had them than the instrumentals provided on the second CD or the Lady Marmalade remix (I do like that song, but you can hear it too many times.)  Practically every song on this though is enjoyable and there's a nice range of different types of music.  Overall it's a rich and exciting selection and getting two CDs is a bargain.
0783232039|3.0|In this one Chuckys old time sweet hart/Goth chick. Jennifer Tilly finds the coped up doll in a bag in the back set of a cop car who's driver she just killed. She stiches him back together in one piece and uses the old voodoo ritual that chucky once used to bring him back to life. When she dose she trys to keep him a locked up in here trailer home. He of course busts out and then kills her and then transters her soul into a girl doll. There's alot more to the plot then that, but I won't give away too much.<br />When I was little I thought this entry in the Child's Play trilogy was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but now its my least favorite one in the trilogy, but I still think its good.<BR>The takes away from real classics and \\"The Bride of Freankinstein\\", and \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", so its not that it lacks cleaverness at all. Its just that the movie seems more willing to cash in on a goth image and a fabric that's different than the other Childs Play movies. I suggest that you watch the other ones first before you watch this one. If you have not seen the other ones all ready
0385335482|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Sophie did an excellent job creating such a lovable shopaholic (Becky Bloomwood).  I am anxious to read the sequel to this book!  It was a fun book all the way through and then the last third of the book got very climactic and interesting.  I couldn't read the last 100 pages fast enough and I even took it to work to finish it up more quickly (normally, I just read at home).  I highly suggest you read this if you enjoy shopping or even if you enjoyed a book like Bridget Jones' Diary.  Just like that book, I found myself rooting for the main character and I was right there with her during her emotional ups and downs.  Now, stop reading this and buy Confessions of a Shopaholic!
6304779356|5.0|And yes, it certainly is. As this is a movie I've loved utterly and completely since I was a mere 13 years old, I feel I've got a little authority to review it...although maybe not in a totally unbiased way. We start out with what is perhaps my favorite opening scene in a movie *ever*. David (played so perfectly by Kiefer Sutherland) and the boys (Dwayne, Paul, and Marko) making trouble with the Surf Nazis on Santa Carla's carousel. The security guard who breaks up the fight and kicks the Boys off the boardwalk is going to regret this later, as he becomes yet another face on a missing persons poster.<BR> But the story really centers around Michael and Sam Emerson (Jason Patric and Corey Haim), brothers who have come to Santa Carla to live with their grandfather because their mother has just gone through a divorce and is now 'flat broke.' Michael meets and falls for Star (Jami Gertz), a half-vampire who seems to have been involved with David at some point. David goads him into going to the vampires' lair and he ends up drinking some vampire blood, thereby making *him* a half-vampire. Meanwhile, Sam meets Edgar and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), two vampire hunters who have never actually hunted any vampires before. Sam finds out what his brother has become and enlists the Frog brothers' help in finding out who the head vampire is and restoring Michael to his former self. That's the basic premise. <BR>I think the reason I've always loved this movie so much is that the Lost Boys are just a great group of vampires. They love their existence and have complete fun with it. Other than that, I find it to be a good mix of horror and comedy, with some classic lines I still use to this day. Of course, I do have a couple of problems, but that could be because I have seen this movie over 100 times and have also read the novelization. There is obviously a day missing between when Michael becomes a half-vampire and when David takes him to the train tracks, and Ilike that day! It happens to be the day (evening) that Michael gets his ear pierced. <BR>The DVD transfer is pretty good, although it looks a little bit old. It is a lot better than the VHS, however, and it's widescreen. The extras are pretty much non-existant and what I wouldn't give for a special edition of this movie. Well, anyway, sleep all day, party all night, never grow old, never die. Of course it's fun to be a vampire!!
B00005R1N3|5.0|The film rocked. I was expecting a small horror film that would just end and I would forget it five minutes later. But no, it stayed with me for sometime. This was way before \\"When A Stranger Calls\\", before \\"Halloween\\", \\"Friday the 13th\\", \\"Nightmare On Elm St\\". In some ways it was better. It had mystery, and some slice and dice killings, and that ending had me jumping out of my seat.I haven't wathced it again, but I know I will only to figure out who the killer really was. I didn't find out due to me falling out my seat. I did the stupid thing of watching it in the dark, all my self with the television sound on loud. \\"WARNING!\\" Never watch horror films alone, it might be risky to your health. Especially with great seventy horror films, and some late sixties horror fims too. I thought Olivia Hussey was beautiful with her seventies style long hair. She was perfect for the role and smart to boot. Now why can't scream queens go back to be feminine and not be all karate fighting-wise-cracking-Sarah Connor-Ripley type heroine. I seriously don't think a regular girl being stalked by some madman would turn into a female fighting machine. I know there has to some out there in the real world, but in every horror movie so far she sure knows her karate , kickboxing, tae-boe or whatever you call it. I just don't feel sorry for the tough girl in in horror movies these days cause I know sooner or later she's going to kick... and the boogey is going down before the end credits. I want see Olivia Hussey run to save her life and use her brains, I want to see Jamie Lee Curtis scream her lungs out, and I want to see Marilyn Burns run, and run for her life. I want to really care for the girl and shout \\"run girl run, don't go back into the house, you dummy\\". And at the end of the film I want to feel glad she made it and say \\"that girl was smart, she used her brain and she fought hard and she made it.\\" Hey, in horror films the girls rule. Check out a chain smoking, sailor talking Margot Kidder. If you decide to watch this film and think it a bit sick because of the phone calls that \\"When a Stranger Calls\\" stole from, watch then only for Olivia Hussey seventies long beautiful hair. Byt the way watch her as Juliet in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", the role that capulated her to stardom worldwide. She was and still is the perfect girl who every played Juliet. Yeah , yeah I know I have a huge crush on Olivia Hussey. Like Duh!
B00005JHAD|5.0|Short and sweet, this is an amazing piece of work. A total roller-coaster with enough ups and downs, twists and turns to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The pace and camera work borders on frenetic, but never does the story lose it's focus and rhythm. Scared the pants off me and I may not be able to eat pork ever again because of it.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Hmm. Zombies, monsters and hardened commandos...oh my!<BR>When I heard Sony was doing a Resident Evil movie, I was excited and uneasy at the same time. Usually video game movies are[junk] (with the exceptions of Final Fantasy and Tomb Raider). I'm happy to say I was proven wrong. This movie delivers the thrills and horror that has made the game series so successful. It's not as gory as all those ridiculous war movies and such that are out these days...but it still manages to capture the true atmosphere and sense of helplessness that made gamers the world over fall in love with the series in the first place. The music, direction,acting and dialogue is incredibly good. And the best part is, you don't need in-depth knowledge of the series to understand the movie. As for the whiners complaining how it [copied] elements from other movies...give it up! 95% of movies have at least one thing they've taken from other flicks. It's not the first time a movie's done and it sure won't be the last. Bottom line is, this movie is good. If you love being scared, buy it when it comes out on DVD. I guarantee you you'll be sleeping with the night light on for weeks after.
B000062XMO|4.0|An entertaining little movie, with not bad acting from all involved. Gene Hackman is perhaps a little too understated in his performance and I can't really imagine any protocol allowing him to head into hostile territory for the final extraction but what the hell this is Hollywood ain't it. Scenery was great and the action shots exciting. I loved the camera work. This innovative style that seems to be infiltrating modern film-making is fantastic and breaks the monotony of conventional filming angles.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Why own this generic annoying rip off?  There is no good reason.  This is just no doubt trying to be a band they admire.  That band-The Faint.  This band has been doing what Rock Steady wants to do, for at least 2 albums now, and probably about 5 years.  If you want to listen to Rock Steady, and feel good about it, check out Blank Wave Arcade and Danse Macabre by The Faint, the albums are cheaper, more orginal, and way more worth your time.  Thank You.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's cd is the cd that I can relate to the most. Avril expresses through words what a teenager feels in very difficult times, and that is a very hard thing to accomplish. She has taken the words out of my head and written them down on paper, it's almost as if that she is reading the mind of every single teenager. The album is radio friendly while having some very edgy tunes, the hardest most likely being &quot;Unwanted&quot;. The cd is very diverse from edgier tunes to more pop like tunes. It is an inspirational thing to know that a young teenager could accomplish so much and write her intire album and take some control in the music industry without being half undressed. She brings forth a good message to all the younger children that you do not have to walk around in a bra to make it in the music industry and to be talented. She also sheds some hope to the teenagers that think that it is impossible to get a record deal, because she is living breathing proof that you can be young and still get a deal if you are determined enough to find it. This album is one were you can listen to, to get you through hard times or to just put on and sing to at the top of your lungs. I hope to see more of this new comer and desperately hoping that she comes to tour around this area. She is an inspiration and shouldn't be sold short because of her punk/sk8er apearance or her youth. A totally awesome cd for a totally awesome new comer.
0684833395|5.0|We read \\"Catch-22\\" in our \\"alternative\\" high school back in the 60's. It was just as the Viet Nam War was rising to its shocking crest, people were rioting in the streets, the young were questioning everything and rebelling, the draft was taking older brothers and friends, and it was a very crazy time. We asked the teacher who selected the novel and who had served in World War II \\"Is this an accurate representation of the madness of war?\\" He replied that, in his experience, it was.<br />After recently re-reading Heller's novel, I realized that this book wasn't, as we had studied it, just about the madness of war. Sure, that was foremost on our minds at the time the book was published. But Heller really caught the moral dilemma of an individual caught up in the mob hysteria of war, where the rules of civilization and laws are temporarily and deliberately suspended by the authorities.<br /><br />The key paragraph, for me, is: \\"Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.\\" In other words, Man is no more than meat and bone EXCEPT for a brief period when he is alive...and if he does something to preserve his soul. This is deep and perceptive.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Catch-22\\", Yossarian is faced with a tempting choice. He has, however, learned something from the horrors and insanity. His decision takes into account not only his personal safety, but goes beyond to the greater good. He has risen.<br /><br />For that reason, \\"Catch-22\\" is more than just an amusing novel, a bestseller and the novel that gave birth to M*A*SH*. Yossarian's moral dilemma is one each of us must ponder, whenever we choose to go to war. I think this is one of the best 100 American novels
B0000004F9|5.0|If you are looking for a true psychedellic/acid rock album masterpiece of the 60's look no further. Makes Sgt. Peppers, Satanic Majesties Request, Whiter Shade of Pale, &amp; Days of Future Past sound like Cowsills records.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K.'s music is so cool!  I listen to this CD constantly!  It is so much better than all the rest of rock right now XD
B000066NW0|5.0|All of the songs on her cd are so powerful and have a strong meaning that just hits you in the head when you listen to it. I love the way she expresses herself in all of her songs so easily. She's a great singer, a great writer, a great guitar player and has one of the greatest cds I've heard in a long time.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is a young talented artist who has so much potential. the reason that i love her music is because i can really relate to it of course being a teen ager and she also just speaks her mind. but probably the one thing that i like most about her is that she could care less what people think about her and she does what SHE wants not what anyone else wants!! she is an awsome singer. I love her!!!
B00003CXAY|5.0|In fifty years, if our world is still habitable, these works will be regarded as the classics of the late 1900.
038533558X|5.0|Will Klein's life was forever changed when his ex-girlfriend was strangled and his older brother, Ken, accused of the murder.  Ken fled and an international manhunt reported sightings in many countries but Will believed Ken was dead.  Eleven years later, he found unexpectedly found love with a fellow worker, Sheila, in Covenant House, a shelter for runaways in New York City. His world was rocked again at the deathbed of his mother when she told him that Ken was alive. Searching his mother's possessions after her death, he does find what seems to be a recent picture of his brother. The plot picks up when Sheila mysteriously disappears and her fingerprints are found at a murder scene in New Mexico. The police don't believe Will that he knows nothing of her disappearance or the whereabouts of his brother. Although the police are after him, the biggest threat to Will is the appearance of the \\"Ghost\\" a former childhood friend, now hired assassin, who is also looking for brother Ken.<br />I liked the fast paced plot but really enjoyed the quirky characters who befriended Ken. Squares, a volunteer at the shelter, is also a famous yogi, who sees through Ken's mental defense mechanisms and tells it like it is. Streetwalker and transvestite Raquel helps in the search for Sheila. Even the evil Ghost has some interesting secrets related to the 11 year old murder.<br />The ending is so full of plot twists you will think you have whiplash. But the plot evolves in a believable and satifying way that wraps up all the story lines. Recommended as very enjoyable vacation read.
B000002P2W|5.0|With John's recent death, I was inspired to break out this album. I couldn't find it so ended up listening to Who's Next. Nevertheless, when I did find it, By Numbers seemed a fitting coda to one of music's most underrated bassist, songwriters and sidemen.<br /><br />It's the simplicity, directness and honesty that makes By Numbers work. It's a stellar example of The Who still at the top of their game and willing to take risks; most fans and critics were unprepared for this midlife crisis album. It has aged amazing well (better than a lot of The Who catalog).<br /><br />Although John only has one song on the album, Success Story more than holds it's own with Pete Townshend's terrific songs. Daltry manages to breathe life into the minority of weak songs. Often critized by nonfans for his a lack of subtly, he turns in a sensitive and powerful performance. By Numbers is the last true masterpiece from the band. Although \\"Who Are You?\\" had its moments, that album seems to portray a band trying to catch its breath. Their final albums with Kenny Jones while far from complete disasters couldn't measure up to their classic work.  If this had been their last album, they would have gone out with an emotional bang.<br /><br />The remaster by John Astley sounds decent but I'd stick with the earlier version simply because the sound is better overall.
B00005NVT1|5.0|Wow. I bought this and was blown away.<br />OK, if you're expecting Homework all over again, you can forget it. If there's one thing I learned from this it's that when Daft Punk performs, they rip their stuff to shreds.<br />It starts off cheesey, give it until they start the real stuff, Da Funk and the Rollin' &amp; Scratchin' parts will get you moving. Personally, I think this is worth the money just for the last ~5 minutes of it, where Alive is performed. If you thought the album version was amazing, all I can say is brace yourself. There's also, a lot of improv. Nothing to be worried about, it's all well within the lines of Homework-quality house and techno beats.<br />Well, the cheers of the people during the performance say it all, each song they introduce gets whistles and cheers.
B00005YW4H|3.0|i bought this album jsut because of the hype, and while it lives up to some of it, there are some songs on the album that just sound like fillers.  dont know why, the radio single is a great song, and there are some other great gems on the album.  i found the album to be a bit bland, though, and while her voice is unique, its not the strongest ive ever heard.  the instrmentation throughout the tracks is mediocre at best and doesnt show her piano skills too much.  if you are just buying the album for the piano playing, skip it. plus, she only wrote 2 of the songs on the whole album.  she shows alot of promise though, and maybe she will get better as time progresses.
B000001OAA|5.0|I finally saw Garbage live the first time around at First Avenue back in May. I must say that their recordings don't really do the band's music any justice nevertheless the band's albums are great examples of the fusion of rock  and pop music with techno beats. I really can't pick a favorite Garbage album but I must say that of the three, I will have to say that \\"Garbage\\" doesn't have that sonic punch in the production that I hear on \\"Version 2.0\\" and \\"Beautiful Garbage\\". I consider Shirley Manson one of the best vocalists around. After seeing Garbage in concert, I will have to add that Shirley is the new Annie Lennox for the new millenium with her blonde hair. She has Annie's charisma as well as being equally talented. A lot of my favorite Garbage songs are on the band's self-titled album, particularly the singles that were highly popularized by MTV. \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" with its catchy melodies and self-deprecating lyrics really speaks to me. I consider that song my personal anthem. The same can be said about \\"Stupid Girl\\". I just love singing along to those two songs whenever I pop in \\"Garbage\\" in my stereo. As for the slower songs, I absolutely adore \\"Milk\\". The trip hop influence is quite evident in the song. I can hear the heartache and angst in Shirley's vocals. She simply wails on this song. I used to not like \\"Queer\\" but that was because it was played too death on the radio and MTV. Now that I have been listening to this album quite a bit, I absolutely love the song. As far as the songs that were not released as singles, I think I would have to say that \\"Not My Idea\\" and \\"A Stroke of Luck\\" are my favorite non-single tracks. I also dig the drum & bass-influenced  \\"As Heaven is Wide\\". Despite the muddled production on this album, \\"Garbage\\" is a modern classic although \\"Version 2.0\\" manages to surpass it artistically. As I listen to this album more and more, I continue to find myself amazed by the music. Not quite a decade old, this album still remains fresh as ever. Simply amazing.resh as ever. Simply amazing.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a very inspiring and original singer.  I first heard about Avril on mtv.  Her video was awesome!! She had this really good way of catching my attention.  Then I realised, she was just being her carefree self.  Always wanting to have fun, like me.  I think that Avril is a great role model and she inspires me to want to skateboard and play the guitar.  I love her cd, and can't wait for her next video.  I wonder...will she crash an amusement park?  hehe!
0812550706|5.0|This is the best Science Fiction Book i have ever read. It captivates the reader's interest and there are suprises and plot twists. It is a highly original plot and executed very well. The book has a good resolution and the very end was a nice lead-on to Speaker for the Dead...I am a girl and have no complaints about the book. Women arent allowed into battle in real life, so where's your complaint? And the training they were undergoing had almost everything to do with physical exercises as well as mental exercises. While i agree that girls couldve done everything that the boys did, it's a work of fiction...Good work Card

B000002JPA|5.0|I beleive this CD has permenantly embeded itself into my CD player. And get this......My CD player ONLY plays ONE disc at a Time!!!! This is one of my most treasured cd's in a collection that is too large to count. That explains it all. If you like musical virtuosos and music that throws you through dramatic modes and bizarre 6/8 time signatures, then this is for you. DT is the greatest progressive band on the planet. And possibly the best band period. Not because they have the best vocalist or the best guitar player (but trust me, they are quite excellent), it is because they blend their music together better than any other band I have ever heard. If you play the keyboards, bass, guitar, or any main-stream rock instrument. You HAVE TO have the CD. You will not be dissapointed in these master-musicians. This is NOT a one man band. All of the members are equally talented, giving their music that much more. This is a definite opus. BUY THE CD
0446677450|1.0|Have you noticed that many of the 5-star reviewers have been submitting MULTIPLE reviews?  Looks like they are trying to pad the statistics. If this book is so wonderful, why do they feel compelled to do this?<br />As the old saying goes, \\"things are seldom what they seem\\". That certainly applies to this book and its author. For example, the Honolulu Star-Telegram has been unable to verify the identity of Robert's alleged \\"rich dad\\". A person who transacted as much business as this person did is bound to have left some clues somewhere, yet no one can find any. This has led some critics to speculate that this person is a fictional character created by the author.<br />The bad advice contained in this book knows no bounds.  For example, he tells you to play by the rules.  Later on, he says \\"the reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the inside is because that is where the money is made\\".  This is insider trading, and it IS illegal.  Just ask Martha Stewart.  <br />Then there are the \\"deductions\\" he likes to talk about as one of the advantages of having your own corporation. The IRS is very clear about what kinds of expenses are business expenses. You won't be able to use your business to buy yourself a new Porsche, as he claims. <br />I am also concerned about the constant promotion of his games, seminars, tapes and books.  Shouldn't you be saving your money for your future investments?  The content of these seminars also leaves a lot to be desired.  I actually went so far as to find one of the \\"Cashflow Circles\\" that have formed in cities across the US and around the world. Most of the people that I met there appeared to be rather naive about finance and business. Kiyosaki takes full advantage of their naivety by encouraging them to use some rather questionable tactics to acquire real estate and start their own businesses. The basic concept is that you find someone who is desperate to sell their home and use their dire straits to force them to accept incredibly bad terms.<br />Keep in mind that this book was not selling very well until an Amway salesman discovered it. The Amway salesman began to push the book to his downline, and the rest is history. Perhaps this is the reason that Robert says (in \\"Cashflow Quadrant\\") that he has \\"changed his mind\\" about network marketing. <br />To be fair, he does occasionally give some good advice. He talks about the importance of staying out of debt and living beneath your means until you can increase your means. However, you can find this same advice in many other books. One that I have used is \\"Personal Finance for Dummies\\".<br />There is nothing wrong with being wealthy and successful, as long as you can do it without compromising your moral fiber. If you follow the advice of this book, you are likely to end up right along side Kenneth Lay, Bernard Ebbers and Edgar Bronfman. Buyer beware!
0380820846|5.0|Colin and Penelope....finally! I read this book in one day.  It was wonderful.  Penelope has always been one of my favorite characters in the Bridgerton series because she was so ordinary.  She wasn't a raving beauty or a duchess or countess(I never knew England had that many peers of the realm anyway!) but she went to the parties and muddled through, somehow.  She was the butt of many jokes by a nasty, mean-spirited girl that I know reminded everybody of someone they knew in school. If not then YOU probably were that girl(for shame).<br />I can't say much more without giving away some major plot twists. But the Lady Whistledown mystery is solved to my everlasting satisfaction.  Yeah!,  Wow!, I knew it all the time! This is a good book and if you like all the Bridgertons as much as I do, don't pass on this latest but probably not the last installment. Thanks Julia Quinn for another enjoyable read and I guess I'll have to wait until(ulp) 2003 until the next book comes out.
B000001FXT|5.0|None of the songs on the Survival album (as well as the Rastaman Vibration album) appear on Legend, the best-selling hits package for Bob Marley and the Wailers. However both these albums are just as good as Exodus of which five songs were chosen for Legend. *If you have Legend and are looking to buy another album, buy Survival and buy Rastaman Vibration and/or Babylon by Bus, their second live album which includes a few classic songs from Rastaman Vibration.*
B00000IN5G|5.0|This Children of Bodom album is full of good melodies and also good guitar riffs! Alexi Laiho (lead guitars, vocals) is better than Wylde, Malmsteen or anyone! This is the one of the greatest melodic Finnish black metal albums ever.
1563894696|5.0|Set early in Batman's career, The Long Halloween is a masterful tale. <BR>The story is about a crime wave that hits Gotham. A killer (killers?) are shooting up members of Gotham's various crime families. Batman is on the case, working together with Gotham City Police Captain Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to find out who the mysterious Holiday killer is. Dent is also having troubles at home, and he's being transformed. Batman fears that he's losing a friend. How right he may be. The story contains many of your favorite Batman villians, such as Joker, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and many more. And, it tells the origin of Two-Face beautifully. The ending will leave you surprised. I read all of this in one sitting and could not bring myself to put it down. This story is continued in Batman: Dark Victory, also by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale<BR>Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale are a match made in heaven. Loeb's gloomy style of storytelling fits in perfectly with Sale's artwork. Together, they weave a great tale of suspense for all Batman fans, and even fans of a good old murder mystery.
B0000636UN|4.0|I popped this CD into my car stereo three days ago and haven't taken it out since.  I must agree the songs aren't as deep as some of Crow's earlier efforts.  So what ?  What's wrong with a a performer making a CD full of fun songs that are great to play while cruising down a sun drenched summer highway ?  Sure, its not &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; or &quot;Ok Computer.&quot;  But it knocked &quot;The Best of the Beach Boys&quot; right outta my stereo and will probably reign supreme until the dog days of August have long passed.

0471413909|3.0|Since I reviewed this book here several months ago, I've surveyed a number of other nutritional guides and found that this one does not hold up so well. Several current diet books discuss saturated fats much more thoughtfully than Dr. Cordain does with his dismissive &quot;artery-clogging&quot; epithet. As he points out, animal fat today--at least in most commercially available meats--is not the nutritious animal fat that Paleolithic people ate, but his solution to this problem can create more problems. I tried restricting my meat consumption to eating only lean meats, as he recommends, and I lost too much weight. He also recommends range-fed/free-range animal foods (a better solution), but so do numerous other nutritional guides, most of which don't advise cutting the skin off poultry as Cordain does.<BR> Although this book's 20-page bibliography as well as its endorsements from authors of other diet books indicate that Cordain is not the mere exercise professor that Sally Fallon (in her review here) claims he is, he has not, in my view, presented a diet for everyone. His diet may help people who need to lose weight, but for improving one's health I've found better guides elsewhere. I'm sorry I rushed to recommend this book so highly in my first review; before I recommend any other diet book or nutritional guide, I'll wait until I've used it for a while.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Don't waste your money on this DVD.  It has no interviews and what's realy bad is that there are no chapter or scene breaks.  If you want to jump to a specific scene you can't.  You have to fast forward.  I can't believe they released it this way.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is pretty much a great CD. Except for the fact that some of the songs sound the same, the best ones are &quot;Get The Party Started&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;, and &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;.

They have problems with the Closed Captioning for the hearing impared being turned on by default (I verified this on two DVD players plus a PS2, problem occured on all three systems).  You can turn it of in the subtitles section, but it then proceeds to turn itself back on and off at random times during the movie.  During dialogue you are looking at very large text obscuring a large part of the screen.  This was overly distracting and rendered the movie unwatchable for me.  If you buy this DVD, be sure to check it soon.

B00005JKNF|5.0|I was (and am) enthralled by Gosford Park!  This film has such a fine cast and great dialogue, that I have watched it over and over and see something different everytime.  The nuances of each actor makes you want to watch this film many times, so you don't miss anything!  The production design and costumes are top notch, and Robert Altman once again lets his actors become the characters. And anyway, I love period films!  Why can't there be more movies like this?
B000003S0D|5.0|I've owned this music since about 1972, but it wasn't until the remasters came out that I finally realized what a masterpiece Lizard really was.  Fripp and Sinfield were floundering in the wake not of Posideon but Greg Lake and Ian McDonald, and after a near-great follow-up to ITCOCK, found themselves with an entirely new line-up of great musicians and total freedom of a kind. Lizard was the result, and if it has some moment that to some seem fey, that is because the listener hasn't really listened this music in one complete session.<br />The remastered CD allowed me, for the first time, to hear the album from start to finish, and the scales from away from my eyes. This music is too weird to be ignored, too powerful to be fey. In a way, it has a brittle feel to it, but that's part of the sonic world that Fripp and Sinfield created.<br />The music is really jazz and not rock at all, with Keith Tippett and Mel Collins taking most of the best musical moments here. Discordant pianos, howling saxophones, and skittering mellotrons create a sonic world that is imbued with nostalgia and dread, ancient and still quite modern.<br />Fripp had to move on to LTIA, etc, to a totally unbeautiful world, I understand and appreciate that, but Lizard is more than most KC fans will let be; Lizard is the lost masterpiece of English jazz rock.
0066620694|5.0|Christensen is a Karl Marx of change: \\"Innovators of the world, unite!\\" could easily be the subtitle of a very readable book.<BR> The thesis is that change comes as a surprise to those who have enjoyed success. The old business saying, \\"whom the gods would destroy, they first give 40 years of success,\\" applies here. High profits, and entrenched customer and supplier communities can thwart change, until it is too late.<BR> Using the disk drive industry as his first case study (because, he writes, like fruit flies, the average company life cycle is so short), Christensen examines how, when a new technology came along, the company housing the innovators failed to capitalize, with only the rarest exceptions. The paradigm discovered by Christensen is that of the value network. Companies have scarce resources for which there are alternate uses: Common sense dictates that they be directed to satisfying the demands of current, paying customers, and not be diverted to risky projects for markets that either do not yet exist, or which are low-profit. Research and development continue in their established courses and product cycles, and at some point, the product may have excess value - performance than the average user needs, but for which they must pay, if they but the product.<BR> The result of this eminently rational decision-making process is that when a new product establishes itself, it is usually the work of a start-up company, which has little to lose and is willing to accept lower profits than mainline companies will, or can. (Cost structure in bigger firms may make low-end products unprofitable.) At some point, the rising product becomes good enough to substitute for the established one. At this point, crisis looms. The expertise, experience, and momentum are with the upstarts. The replacement process is likened to a tornado, wherein only a few use the new product at first, but as its' capabilities cross the threshold of minimum utility for the mass market, a suddenwhirlwind of change happens, and seemingly overnight, the mainlines have lost control of the market. The mainline companies may choose to cede the bottom end of the market to their rivals, and focus on the upscale, highly profitable segments. This Christensen relates in telling of the rise of Nucor Steel and other minimills as challengers to US Steel and other giants of industry.<BR> The Nucors started out only working the bottom of the steel market: \\"Rebar\\" steel, low-tech and low-profit. As they advanced on the learning curve, they moved upmarket, into Big Sttel's remaining baliwicks. At each juncture, better business models and lower cost structure allowed innovative technology to help the upstarts capture market share. At each stage, Big Steel retreated, and by concentrating on only the highest-end, lucrative parts of the market, and masked their decline (even to themselves)with record profits. Only when the minimills came knocking on the door for their last market did they wake up and start playing serious catch-up.<BR> The lesson in all of this, retold in a page-turner style suitable for light summer reading, is that radical change is seldom accomplished by those on top - it comes from the outside. Vested interests, within and without the organization, will fight for their budgets, their turf, and for their status. Only top management buy-in, the continual dedication of resources, and, optimally, setting up a seperate entity to innovate the radical (as opposed to incremental) change process holds real hope for success. (GM setting up Saturn as a wholly-owned but otherwise independent company is an example.)<BR> One of the interesting points that the author makes is how, at some point, products may become commodities, and brand names lose influence, relative to price, in driving sales. Looking ahead, if this process begins to happen, one can expect that substitution with cheaper alternatives is not far away. (Linux' rise vis a vis Windows may be the beginning of this process in the PC Operating System market.)<BR> This model has application far outside the business world. One can think of many examples, such as generals preparing to fight the last war, while innovators, like Erwin Rommel or Billy Mitchell, develop the weapons and tactics that will win the next one. One can see it in politics, where major parties have ignored culture and immigration as issues, only to find Pat Buchannan, the late Pim Fortuyn, and others making it their signature issues. If Christensen's model applies, them the rise to power of third parties will follow, unless established ones move quickly to co-opt their issues, at the risk of offending their current constituencies. Gary North (linkable through lwerockwell.com) wrote a column that described the rise of Methodism and Baptist churches in early America. His explanation parallels what Christensen wrote regarding the disk drive, excavator, and steel industries: lower fixed costs (lay preachers vs. seminiary-trained ministers), an unexploited market (frontier settlements vs. back East), and a product that could be substituted for its extablished competitor (mainline churches), led to sudden growth and market capture. Other examples will occur to the reader, which is part of the electricity of this book - it stimulates the mind to apply its' teachings elsewhere.  \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" is well worth your time.<<BR>-Lloyd A. Conway
0684857219|5.0|What an excellent book. This is probably the best book on body building that one can buy. It covers a history of body building in the beginning, which is neat. It has plenty of illustrations and information on techniques for weight lifting; it shows techniques and different exercises for each muscle group or muscle. It has info on gyms, equip., diet, nutrition, injuries, etc. It has pictures of top body builders as well.     Reading this book will not only certainly educate you, but it will also motivate you. Every time I open it and dwelve into it, i feel like pumping weights, and sure enough hours later or the next day, I'm at the gym trying new exercises. It's like five books in one. Competition is talked about too. Arnold also gives pre set training programs for ones who cannot decide what muscles they wanna train on the same day. It's just an excellent choice.    Also, for real body builders, posing is also covered in this book.
B000068QY7|5.0|Yes its true, this really is the best oasis album so far .Far more consistant than Morning Glory. Every tune apart from the instrumental (pointless) is perfect. There is everything here, all out rockers, beautiful soaring ballads and anthems to fill the biggest stadia. I love this album, since Iv'e had it,its been on constant repeat. NO OTHER cd has been able to do that for me. Ignore the critics please and don't miss out. They can't see past the typical oasis baggage. IT really is THAT good.
B000066NW0|5.0|Once in a great while an artist will come along with the raw spunk and spontaneity that it takes to really make it-and keep it-in the music world: Madonna has it, Aerosmith has it; Avril Lavigne has it. With rawking, heart wrenching tracks like &quot;things i'll never say&quot; and &quot;naked&quot;, this 17-years-young girl from Canada has the songwriting and song singing abilities that have been all but lost with most recent &quot;pop&quot; sensations.<br />Which brings up a valid point: (though assisted on several tracks) Avril writes her own songs. I like this because the songs sound like a 17-year old girl writes them, and discuss topics important to 17-year old girls--a far cry from Brittney's new approach. And although I am a 22-year old man, I think teenage girls should be able to relate to Avril's topics:<br />Her first single &quot;Complicated&quot; touches on the subject of not being true to oneself and going along with the crowd . . . as does &quot;sk8er boi&quot;. Though the subject in the latter learns to regret her mistake. My favorite song is &quot;Things I'll never say&quot;. I like this one because she does just that: says exactly what's going on in the mind of a teenage girl. Teenage guys will be lining up to get ahold of that knowledge.<br />Overall, the reason I think Avril has staying power is that I feel that her lyrics (though often rudimentary) will grow up right along with her. If she is able to keep the honesty and cute brutality that she shows in her debut album, we can expect to see her around for some time.
B000059TEP|5.0|Read the reviews of others to find out about the movie itself, which I found simultaneoulsy gripping and humorous, albeit flawed. What I found absolutely outstanding was the commentary by writer Bruce Joel Rubin and director Jerry Zucker, especially the former.<br />Rubin begins by telling us a little of his personal history and how it led to the creation of this script. He traveled East, spent time in a Tibetan monestary studying mysticim, and came back to San Francisco in the Summer of Love. It was then another ten years before he got his break in Hollywood.<br />I gained great respect for Rubin and his metaphysics, which I agree makes the movie more than just another &quot;ghost&quot; genre love story. He's right when he says that the typical antics one finds in the ghost genre, where things like objects flying across a room in front of stunned mortals, are reserved only for the end. They cap the movie, not form its substance.<br />He talks how his Whoopie Goldberg character was at first not a charlatan but a genuine psychic. When he showed the script to some friends they laughed. This triggered in him the realization that there was great comedic tension caused by making her a charlatan who becomes genuine only when she finds haunted by Sam.<br />The essence of the story, Rubin says, is the idea of a person caught between two worlds, denizen of neither, but needing to come to grips with the past so he can move into the future (unlike the other ghost in the movie, the &quot;train ghost,&quot; who never learns the lessons necessary to move on). It's also about a man learning to say, &quot;I love you,&quot; to his significant other, as well as the value of life in general.<br />Rubin really hits the nail on the head with these points and other in his commentary. I think it's something I can listen to several times, and then periodically and gain something new each time.
B00005Q66T|5.0|No vogue is not included on this collection of madonna's work throughout the 90's. Most people had good things to say about this compilation and my review is absolutly no different.<br />However the people who had complaints about this album all basically had the same complaints. They all said they missed great hits such as RAIN, NOTHING REALLY MATTERS, THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND, BAD GIRL.<br />However songs that weren't such big hits such as DROWNED WORLD, POWER OF GOODBYE and BEDTIME STORY were favorites of madonna herself.<br />I was watching an interview of madonna and she was talking about this particular compilation and she said she handpicked every track on this album because they were songs SHE SAID SHE COULD LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER(over and over is a madonna song too)<br />Therefore by listening to this compilation we are listening to Madonna's best work to date not because they were played on the radio or television but because madonna claimed them as her hits. It is HER MUSIC therefore SHE should be the ONE to decide what her best is. Forget the critics for once people.<br />This compilation IS a GIFT from Madonna to her fans. Like it or leave it people. Madonna is the queen of pop music, NOT BRITNEY! Madonna has shown to express herself and not to repress herself(like britney)<br />Therefore if you do not like this compilation the truth is you do not like Madonna! She has been with us for two decades. Enjoy her while she lasts cause when shes gone, music is officially dead. WE'LL BE STUCK WITH BRITNEY AND NSYNC EW!
0671027344|5.0|When i first started reading it I didn't flow with it very well. Then after a friend loaned it to me I gave it an honest try and read the entire book in one sitting. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an absolutly profound story of adolescence. The main character is Charlie and the book is a collection of letters we writes to \\"a friend\\". You don't know who the friend is because its apparently someone he doesn't know either. Just somebody-told-me-you'd-understand. He writes each letter and reveals all of his secrets his passions, pain, guilt, and his soul. Its a remarkable book. Im amazed it hasn't gotten better aclaim. I think anyone who has ever grown up alone, an outsider, or soemone who struggles with their own inner emotions in that constant battle that plays out in private moments, would greatly benefit from this book. Stephen Chbosky does what few writers can: he pulls you along side the characters and you feel their pain and share their moments of joy... In a surprisingly short novel the reader will expirence about a year in the life of a young boy, a life that one some level, we can all relate to.<br />I am deeply moved by this book,
B000063S6Z|2.0|This is definitely Moby's most mellow, chill-out dance release yet.  I bought the album because I wanted to hear other songs that sound similiar to the  catchy, cool pop sound of \\"We are made of stars.\\"<br />Strangely, there were not any other Moby songs on the album that resemble it.  The mood and style of Moby's 18 is urban jazzy, slow tempo. The album's mood is basically for the listener to either relax, meditate, or fall to sleep to.  Just be prepared that if you decide on adding 18 to your collection, there isnt a part of this album that has any uptempo dance beats like Moby's last album \\"Play\\" contains.  My album summary:  Overall, Moby does'nt seem to create any inventive sounds, but it's competent music when anyone's in a laid-back mood.
B00004W221|5.0|This was the first movie I bought once I arrived at Notre Dame.  It came just in time for the first football game, and we watched it before the first pep rally.  We watched it again this year before football season started, and will likely continue to.  I'd like to add that my dad was in the crowd for the football stadium scenes and that I was one of like 6 people in the theater for it on opening night.<br />Back to the movie though.  Great movie, shows how perseverance and everything really can pay off in the end and how anybody can accomplish their dreams, no matter how big, if they just set their minds to it and work their butts off.  A great mix of drama and a little football to keep things interesting.  Great cinematography as well, shows off how gorgeous our school is.  The music's great, you can't help but get pumped up when they start playing the music in the &quot;Tryouts&quot; sequence and the final &quot;Ruu-dy! Ruu-dy!&quot; cheer has remained in sports culture, my high school team always picked the smallest kid and referred to him as Rudy.
B000066NW0|5.0|She catches your ear with her debute song &quot;Complicated&quot;, which gets you hooked to the Napanee band. With her easy listening songs such as &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot;, to more upbeat songs, &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, all the songs on the cd are good to listen. With lyrics that you can relate to, if you need a song to get your mood up, or just need a song to comfort you. When you listen to the cd, you just can't help to sing along to the songs. Although they took up the name of just Avril Lavigne, she doesn't forget about her band, which most artists do. This cd is proof that you can go from a small town band, and make it big. Avril Lavigne gives people hope that anything can happen. It's an awsome cd, my mom knows to, i asked and nagged untill I got it, and she hears it everyday, louder than she wants it. Its a fresh new sound that everyone should be listening to.
B00003CXXR|5.0|i love jurassic park 3! of course, i love all of them, but 3 has to be my favorite! it has soo much action, a few quirky lines, and, to me, most importantly, new and bloodthirtsy dinosaurs!! the acting is good, by Neill, Macy, Leoni, Nivola and Morgan, and the other not so main charecters, including Jeter and Dern. i don't think Joe Johnson made a pointless movie. i think it was all about survival of the fitess. i watch jurassic park 3 at least once a month or more. Some parts are scary, but thats what makes the movie so brilliant. and the spinosaur was AWESOME!! the graphics, cgi, whatever, are really good, and the pteradactlys in the birdcage give me chills when one turns to look at dr. grant (Neill)and Paul Kirby (Macy). alot of people won't agree with me on how good this movie is, but it does keep you on the edge of your chair. and i like how the end leaves it open for a jurassic park 4.....
B000005ILF|5.0|Well I'm no a HUGE sting fan, but I'm on my way after buying this album from a friend. It's marvelous, although very different from earlier of his works.<BR>Just listen to You Still Touch Me, Mercury Falling and 25 to midninght. There is just one song on this album that I don't like and that's Valparadiso the rest makes me want to sing, play the piano and just rock around the clock :)<BR>Listen to it more than twice, it will be worth your while. It's not a ordinary rock-pop album that catches you immideatelly you have to give it a chance! After listening to it for like 5-10 times you will start to love it as much as I do. So as the header says, give it another try!
0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is an outstanding novel.  I could not rate this book for anything less than five stars.  In Plath's personal life, she suffered with a mental breakdown and later committed suicide.  Sadly, because of her trouble, she was able to write a very detailed story.  <br />I could actually feel exactly what the character, Esther Greenwood, felt.  I was taken through each emotion, from happiness to sadness, during the process of Esther's mental breakdown.  It was interesting to see through the eyes of the very disturbed girl.  At times I found myself relating to Esther, but at other times I would think of how extremely nutty she was.<br />The Bell Jar was so well written, with a certain flow, that I could not put it down.  I was dissapointed to find myself at an end.  I most certainly recommend The Bell Jar, as I already have to many.
B00005NWM3|5.0|HEY i used to be into the pop wussy music and hey its good if your depressed. But now Nicklback Staind and Creed along W/ limp bisciut and Linkin Park these guys rock my cd case. If you are buying this cd for the too bad and How u remind me u are in for a rude awaknin. these guys are the grunge-metal-punk-slow- rock and they can bust a punk rock song as easy as a slow. So as my rewiew 5 STARS.<br />Excuse the spelling i can't type
6304071906|1.0|This is possibly one of the worst movies ever made. I kept pressing the forward botton on my remote because it was so slow. Also, it is very hard to follow. I could not understand the way the characters spoke. Many lines were in Polish with no subtitles. Thank god I bought the movie on sale. But guess what? I am planning on selling it back to a second hand store. I own hundreds of videos, but this one is not fit to lay on my shelf!!
B00005QDW1|1.0|This album is a disappointment. There really aren't any good songs. The album is very repetative and boring. I recomend Tragic Kingdom to first time listeners. And to the old fans of No Doubt...Remember the first album,self-titled, Maybe their next album will be better.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Central Station is the first movie to have make me cry in years . It tells the story of Dora , a bitter woman who gets paid for writting letters for people at the train station but afterwords doesn't care enough to send them to their receivers . Right after leaving the station , a woman to whom she just offered her services gets killed in an accident leaving her little son Josue all alone with nowone to support him . Dora , under the certain circumanstances , choses to take the kid under her wing and takes a long trip with him in order to find his father .  During their harsh journey we have the chance to see the many faces of Brazil : the religious one (in a small village people are praying for their sins ) , the humane one ( Dora's slow change from cold and self-centered to sensitive and caring ) , the inhumane and dark one ( initialy some people try to use Josue as a source of human organs for sale ) . Fernanda Montenegro gives the best female perfomance of that year while being perfectly paired with child-actor Vinicious de Oliveira . The final part of the film is full of genuin human emotion . It's one of these endings you never want to end .
B000063V8R|4.0|By it's third season, \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" was, undoubtedly, a great series.  Some of the series' finest episodes were made during this season and it is considered to be arguably the finest season of television the people of Star Trek have ever done.  That said, it's still a bit of a shame to see them not pull out all the stops for the DVD release - the format that's made for bells and whistles.<br />Aside from the twenty-six episodes of the series - for which there is little reason to go into detail here given the large number of other reviews that discuss the episodes in detail - the seventh disc of the set features four extra segments - a season overview, a look at the changes in the crew in Season Three, and two \\"Departmental Briefings\\": this time around focusing on episode production as well as the usual \\"Memorable Missions\\" segment.  They're all great segments and they do a great job of bringing the behind-the-scenes community to life.  These segments especially illuminate what Michael Piller - who would go on to be one of the most influential backstagers on \\"Next Generation\\", \\"Deep Space Nine\\" and \\"Voyager\\" - brought to the show when he signed on board that season.  Much of the interview footage was shot new for the episode and it highlights and gives anecdotes for many of the episodes.<br />All that said, though, the set - as with the previous two - seems to be missing something.  There are no episode commentaries, no scripts, no storyboards, no deleted scenes, and no TV ads.  While much of what would be covered in some episodes' commentaries is in the extras segments, it would still have been very nice to see a play-by-play analysis of \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" or \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" - or even \\"Who Watches the Watchers\\" by Executive Producer Rick Berman and the aforementioned Michael Piller - or by Michael Okuda or Jonathan Frakes or any of the other Trek actors and creators that make the show so great.  Likewise, there must be an absolute ton of material in the vaults - segments cut for time, episode promos, screen tests, etc. - that are still waiting to see the light of day.  To really wow us with a box set, it would have been nice to have more of that in here.<br />Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful DVD set and certainly worth owning - even by the casual Star Trek fan.  As many others have said, Season 3 was the breakout season for the show - it's worth having on DVD.
B00005K3O4|5.0|The klowns have landed... and they are here to stay! I first saw Killer Klowns From Outer Space when I was kid. I was  5 years old, watching a show that I had been waiting 2 months to see. Until my father called me into the other room to show me a movie that he was watvhing on the sci-fi channel. He said it was called Killer Klowns. I sat down and started to watch it. I had completely forgotten about my other show that I had waited so long to see! I was amaized by this movie about a space ship that looked liked a circus tent that lands in a forest, and inside are aliens that look like klowns that have guns that wrap people up into cotton candy cacoons, and popcorn that turns into snakes with clown heads that eat people. The klowns have so many creative ways of captering their victems. One of my favorite ways is when one of the klowns (who I found out is named slim) is at a bus stop full of peopl and startes to do huge shadow puppets on the brick builing behined them. Eventually the klown makes a t-rex shadow  which sworms down and gobbles up the crowd watching. It is up to 4 college kids to save the town from the killer klowns from outer space. This is one of my favorite movies. I have several different types of copies of it. This movie has it all. Near the end of the movie some corny things happen, but at the last few seconds something cool happends to make up fore it. I stongly urge everyone who enjoys a good sci-fi movie with comedy in it to buy this movie. The DVD of it is great! If your not sure about buying it then try and find it at a video store and rent it. Also when I was whatching the DVD I overhered the Chiodo Bros. say that their thinking about making a Killer Klowns sequel which would be one of the most happiest moments in my life! I hope my review has helped eneyone out on wheather they should check this movie out or not.
B000002UA2|3.0|Explaining the pleasures of early Pink Floyd to younger audiences (whose memories start with Dark Side even The Wall) is often difficult but worth the challenge.<br />This soundtrack set doesn't help that effort.  The songs are flat and predictable, as are the instrumental interludes, and the low points are cringe-worthy.  This could easily be the work of the Floyds' lesser 60's compatriots.  (Strawberry Alarm Clock, anyone?)<br />Those interested in off-the-beaten-track Pink Floyd from that era should investigate &quot;More,&quot; a more interesting soundtrack.  Also a little trippy and dated, its songs carry more of the fire and the brilliant quirkiness that has made the group special.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a great new artist!It is so easy to realate to her songs!Also this cd is not one of those you buy and there is like 3 good songs all the songs are terrific!I would recommend this cd to everyone interested!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I loved this movie - they've done a great job of bringing the comics<br />  onto the screen while also modernising it a bit. I also liked the way<br />  they highlighted the importance of Mary Jane by making it 'her story'<br />  in a way.<br />  Another standout aspect was the way they showed Peter Parker coming to<br />  terms with his new-found gifts and learning how best to utilize them.<br />  His transformation into a crime fighter is also shown in a realistic<br />  manner, rather than showing him as a guy who's always been geared to<br />  turn into Spiderman, and needs no 'breaking in' period or motivation.<br />  Toby Maguire turns in a winning performance as Peter Parker/ Spiderman,<br />  which should really turn him into a big, big star. Kirsten Dunst is<br />  attractive in a warm kind of way rather than ravishingly pretty. Willem<br />  Dafoe proves yet again that he's capable of fine villanious performances.<br />  The other support actors are good, too.<br />  A special word for Sam Raimi, who's done an exceedingly good job of<br />  adapting a popular superhero series for the silver screen, a feat not<br />  so easily achieved.<br />  The special effects, sets etc are all quite good and add to the impact.<br />  All in all, very well done indeed - i'll definitely watch the sequel !!
B00000J7JO|4.0|One nice morning in the year 2000 I put on the TV and got excited. A couple of minutes later I found out it was MTV playing<BR>Red Hot Chili Peppers' 'Around The World'. I didn't know anything<BR>about the band but it was already a good first impression. As I don't tend to buy CDs because of only one track, I kept enjoying <BR>'Around The World' on TV. Later I heard 'Otherside' and I was finally persuaded when I heard 'Scar Tissue'.<br />Finally I bought 'Californication' and it kept its promises. I was happy listening to all tracks and it was my favorite album for nearly 4 months. Then I bought 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' and it changed not only the universe(see my review of BSSM) but also my 'relationship' to 'Californication'. I don't listen to it very often and it doesn't fill me up with energy like BSSM always manages to do. Nevertheless, 'Californication' has a lot of good songs like 'Savior', 'Road Trippin' and 'This Velvet Glove'. I still like it very much cos it's the CD that got me into my favorite band.
B000002TQB|5.0|Hello I am the lead singer and guitarist of Locust, this Blur album has setimental value for since it ws the second album I ever bought, I grew up role modeling this album for my band and I have also recruited the renound Bass player Johnny Soper in it, anyway back to the album. Som of these songs have remained with me such as End Of A Century, Boys &amp; Girls and Parklife. I have always admired Damion for his songwritting and lyricists, he is 2nd onlt to guitarist and singer of Nirvana Kurt Cobain. Put it this way I suvivived the Britpop war with songs not unlike this. PS: Locusts new album Moonlight out soon! and thank you Kurt and thank you Damion
B00005OM4N|5.0|I admit it...i'm somewhat of a Britney fan. But i never really WAS a fan until i heard this album. I enjoyed her first album very much. They had good, fun lyrics and catchy tunes.<br />The second album however...at first listen, i thought was pretty good, but then after a while sounded more and more cheesy...and i just couldn't listen to it anymore.<br />Now, when i first heard 'I'm a Slave for You', i admit i didn't particularly care for it, but now i actually do. I went out and got it since the record store was on the way...i started listening to it...and after a few listens the songs sort of grew on me. They are very much different from her previous albums. But that's a good thing! you don't hear the same bubble gum pop sound on ALL the songs. People such as The Neptunes did their magic on 'I'm a Slave 4 U' and 'Boys' which gives the album it's r&b kind of vibe. Justin Timberlake and choreographer Wade J. Robson lending their skills on 'What it's like to be Me.' And the infamous Max Martin lending his talents on more of Britey's songs, as on her previous albums.<br />Songs such as 'Overprotected', 'Lonely', 'What it's like to be me' and 'Boys' make the CD worth the money.<br />~'I'm a Slave for you' caught my ear because of its appealing lyrics about a girl just wanting to dance and very original beats. I have to admit...it's one of my favorites. It makes me want to get up and dance.<br />~'Overprotected' is one of those feel good songs. It has a very catchy tune and just makes you want to sing along.<br />~'Lonely' was a song that i didn't care for at first, but now has become one of my favorites on the album. It's different than her other songs. The rockish vibe and powerful lyrics about a girl saying, 'that's it! We're done! I can't take you anymore! You're gone!' lol...it's a perfect song for 'girl dumping the guy scenario' Major props for Brit, for co-writing the song!<br />~'I'm not a girl not yet, not yet a woman' could have been SO much better. I still don't really like this song, but i have to admit it grows on you. After a while it makes you want to sing along...and in a way makes you feel good. It's like an anthem for teenage girls that just want to be heard. I wouldn't pick up the CD and immediately go to that song, but i wouldn't skip over it...most of the time.<br />~'Boys' is arguably one of the best songs on the album. It reminds you of dancing in a club and meeting that one night stand. It's got a very good beat in which while listening to the CD, it just jumps out at you. I watched that little thing Britney had on MTV, and Carson Daly even seems to think so.<br />~'Anticipating' is an alright song. I have to admit though...it's a happy song. :) It makes you feel good.<br />~'I love rock 'n' roll' i thought didn't fail to much as a cover. My friend who doesn't like Britney at all admited to me that it's the best song on the album. I disagreed but i don't hate this song.<br />~'Cinderella' is a...different song. The beat and tune is something totally different than what she would normally do. All in all...it's a pretty good song.<br />~'Let me Be' is another one of those songs that i didn't really care for. It just seems like one of those songs she sang on her previous album. I usually skip over this song.<br />~'Bombastic song' is something totally different. It's like 'I'm a Slave 4 U' in that the tune is very different. The chorus, to me, is VERY catchy. It makes me want to sing, but at the same time, laugh. :D<br />~'That's where you take me' is one of my favorites. It's very happy and up lifting. The awesome two step beat makes you want to dance and run to the man you love. :) More props for Britney for co-writing a great song!<br />~'What it's like to be me' is the last song on the album, which fits the phrase, \\"Save the best for last\\". I love this song! It's not only the best song ON the album, but it IS one of my favorite songs. With the help of Justin Timberlake and Wade J. Robson, this is definitely the best song on the album. It's raw sound and great lyrics make it the great song it is. Timberlake adding even more of his talents by singing the background vocals and beatboxing a little bit. After listening to it over and over,i got the same friend to change her opinion of which song was the best from 'I love Rock 'n' Roll' to 'What it's like to be me'.<br />All in all...its a pretty good album. Because of it, i can actually say I'm a Britney fan. Before she was just another singer in my CD collection.<br />Because of the great songs with her orignal voice, danceable beats and great lyrics i can say that this album is arguably her best album yet. Other than the fact that she still seems dependent on other people writing her songs, she did herself well by co-writing some of the songs. I just wish it was longer! The short album of a little bit over 30 minutes was dissappointing, but it's compromised with the great music. When she said she was trying a different style of music...she wasn't lying. The only catch was it was only on 3 or 4 songs. The other half was just the same as her old stuff. But i didn't mind too much. It kind of gives me a sense that she's making the transition slowly. By earning a few other fans, while taking her old fans with her.album. It's raw sound and great lyrics make it the great song it is.

B000001FS3|5.0|This album is amazing from stunning tunes like With Or Without You and Where The Streets Have No Name to solid beats like Bullet The Blue Sky, this is without a shaddow of a doubt up there with Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon, Meatloaf - Bat Out Hell, Guns 'N' Roses - Appatite For Destruction, Nirvana - Nevermind and of course Johnny Soper - Chain Of Command. Thank You Bono!
B00006690G|4.0|Being an owner of all 8 Eminem's CD's, Thats right folks, this ISN'T Eminem's 2nd cd for all you people that think he only existed after becoming the real slim shady, I have been able to completely observe all of eminem rap styles spanning 1995-2002.<BR>My Favourite Eminem CD's after \\"Infinite\\", \\"Slim Shady EP\\", \\"F''king crazy\\" and \\"The Eminem Show\\". I do however, enjoy all his other CD's, such as Slim Shady EP, Marshall Mathers LP, Devil's Night and Bad Wordz.<BR>Initially, I was a little dissapointed in this CD, after hearing only White America and Drips (the most abominable song on this CD), but after carefully listening to EVERY track, my faith was proven and I thought to myself, without a doubt, Eminem is the finest lyricist in this world to date. No other can compete in either form, imagination or flow. The Hilarious 'Business' SCREAMS Dre production and was equally entertaining and humerous as many songs on his previous efforts .... Cleaning out my closet is a rare masterpiece in then world of rap. I never thought Eminem would actually be able to legitimately put down his mother without just slagging her off, but I was wrong. Square dance is a bouncy song, but definately not the best on here. The Kiss and Soldier together together perfectly and you can feel the tension when Eminem gets out of the car and hear his running footsteps get louder and louder and the screams, while soldier rapid fire lyrics are perfect and Eminem's flow prove in this song that there is no equal to him in rap. Say Goodbye to Hollywood in another lacklustre, but still good song. I'm not going to praise Eminem and love every song even if I don't think his songs are any good, this song is only average and talks about why he'd leave stardom and how he'd tell the world. I won't even talk about drips, but for now, lets just say i'm NOT looking forward to Obie Trices first release on shady records. Without me, which is NOT my favourite song on the album, is catchy (naturally, as a single would be), but there are many other songs that capture Eminem spit-fire lyics so much better. Without Dr dre's production and the humerous music video, nobody would be paying much attention to this song. Sing for the moment is another gem on this CD, Eminem speaking partly from experience and partly storytelling the story of a brocken home and the only way outs through music, which has it's chorus sample from an Aerosmith song. Superman, a story of Eminem's \\"love\\" of girls and although he doesn't really like them, it won't stop him.... ummm.... you know what'ing them. Hailies song is another highlight, where he sings most of the song, but I don't think this is the real highlight. Yes, his voice is ok, but nothing special. I find the real treasure of this song his rap towards the end, which is almost perfect in it's form, rhymes and construct and also when he visits his old song 97' Bonnie and Clyde and renews his old promise to his daughter. After an amusing Skit involving Steve Berman, the CD REALLY gets started, with 4 awesome tracks featuring Dr Dre, D12 and Nate Dogg as well as Eminem's daughter. This four tracks all feature Eminem at his greatest lyrically and creatively. You can just sit there and listen to him without getting bored at all. Hell, I even think D12 sounded a bit better than they did on Devils Night. Dr Dre's song was listenable, though I think more effort could have gone into the production for Say What you Say, which I find a little grinding. Till I collapse, featuring Nate Dogg (the same who featured in Dr Dre's The Next Episode is on this track) for the chorus. I feel this is the most deserving song in the entire CD. Eminems aggressive battle hungry lyrics spit into the faces of everyone that's ever tried to put him down. The CD ends off with the child aimed, but still just as adult orientated, my dad's gone crazy, which is fun, but not a standout.<BR>Overall, I believe this to be Em's best CD in terms of originality, flow, rhymes and beats. Although Dre's Production is very good, Eminem's production, although blander is MUCH more hard hitting and really brings out Eminem's flow better than the cartoonish production of Dre, which is much better suited to, say Busta Rhymes. For examples of this, listen to Till I Collapse, Sing for the Moment and Soldier. Eminem has definately picked up on a strain better than Dre and I hope his production efforts continue. I just read in an article that Shady and Dr Dre both bought the rights to a rapper named 50 Cents. I looked forward to his releases from his new label as I have heard a limited amount of music from his underground cd's and he is easily better than any of the rappers in D12. <BR>This is Eminem's finest CD to date, and although i'm highly satisfied with this release, I cannot help to feel that I know he could've done a little better. But he now will certainly silence his critics and haters withint the industry , that lyrically no one can stand up to him.<BR>The finest MC.
B000003TA4|5.0|Hello I am the lead singer and guitarist of Locust and I have set my carear around this album it has mind blowing tunes like Smells Like Teen Spirit. The first ever proper song I learned to play was Come As You Are, my favorite song on there is Lithium closly followed by Something In The Way. I admire Kurt first for his guitar playing but also for his lyrics with such as 'the animals I trap all become my pets and its okay to eat fish cause' they don'y have any fellings, something in the way', I also like Polly because it has a catch tune but Drain You and Lounge Art are Similar but are both very good. Not only are there soft grunge tunes but heavy stuff like In Bloom. I also like Krist Novecelik for he is like my Bass player and they have very similar styles which is one of many reasons I recruited John Soper. I like all the tracks on this album and a word of advice if you don't already have it go out know and get it, it is the best album I have ever purchased. Thank You Kurt
B00000163G|5.0|If anyone ever says that Biggie is the greatest rapper of all-time, then they haven't heard \\"All Eyez On Me\\".  There is not one track that will keep you from bobbing your head and have you hanging on every one of 2Pac's words.  This quite possibly is the greatest hip-hop album of all time.  And what makes it even greater is the fact that it is a double-disk album.  There is something that you don't see everyday.<br />The album starts out with \\"Ambitionz az a Ridah\\", a song with a great beat and great flowing lyrics.  Some of the other gems on the first disk include \\"How do U want it\\", \\"Life Goes On\\", ahh forget it, they're all gems. <br />In my deepest opinion, there will never be another rapper that will put out an album that even comes close to \\"All Eyez On Me\\"...
B000000OF6|4.0|This hits album is of the highest standard shore its not Johnny Soper but what is, from Bohemium Rapsody to We Are The Champions onto the other side Radio Ga Ga it is pure genius, so many songs that will be remembered for years after the enevitable.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Not only are the Godfather movies thought of as some of the best films of all time, but now that they're all on DVD they are unstoppable.  In my opinion, The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time.  The Godfather part II is also in the top 5 greatest of all-time, while the third may be in the top 50.<br />The Godfather is clearly Francis Ford Coppola's best work along with Mario Puzo.  This movie displays an organized crime family like no other.  It starts out with a brilliant wedding scene and shows the Godfather, Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando), carrying out an old tradition of listening and agreeing to do favors for friends since it is the day of his daughter's wedding.  Later in the movie Vito is shot and nearly killed, which is when Micheal Corleone (Al Pacino) begins his journey to the top of his family.  The movie is full of great mob hits an there isn't a dull moment.  I really love when Micheal travels to Sicily and explores his roots.<br />The second film is set up in a different format, going back in forth from the past to the present.  In this film, a young Robert De Niro plays a young Vito Corleone.  Although this takes away a lot of Pacino's screen time it is brilliant.  Robert De Niro steals the screen playing young Vito and showing his rise to a mafia boss.  In this movie Micheal is almost killed which leads to him playing cat and mouse, trying to find out who did it.  Then there is the alternate story line with De Niro.  Over all this movie is just as good as the first.<br />Now we come to the third installment of the Godfather series.  This film is not nearly as strong or moving as the first two, but still very good.  It is hard to appreciate it after watching the first two Godfather movies since those two will make any movie look bad.  This movie is more slow-paced and depressing.  A much older Al Pacino returns to play Micheal Corleone.  Instead of dealing with other big bosses, drug deals, or casinos, Micheal chooses to get into business withthe Vatican.  What really hurts this movie is the relationship between Micheal's daughter and Micheal's former brother SOnny's bastard son.  This kind of grosses you out since you know there cousins but other than that everything is great.<br />There is a fifth disk in this collection with tons of extras, some of the best I've ever seen on a DVD.  There are hours of documentaries with all of the actors and crew.<br />If you are a movie fan and collector then you must have The Godfather DVD Collection.  I promise that you will not be disappointed.
B00003BDXG|4.0|The lowdown:<BR> <BR>Oliver Stone's Natural Bon Killers is one of the most controversial films that I know of, so it goes without saying that it outraged many. Yes, the movie was very violent, but what I think really got to the viewers, wasn't so much how violent it was, but rather the way it reacted to violence, and *that* was what was truly shocking to see. When I watch Natural Bon Killers, I see a film that shows us how obsessive the media can become, that shows us how big an impact they can have amongst the public and how they can easily blow things way outta proportions by making killers heroes. I also see a film that is meant as a warning as to where we may be heading and what might become of us in a world where violence is the number one interest, in a world where we are most fascinated with crime and mayhem more than anything else, whether in real-life events or in the movies. And, although it is a very violent film, when I watch it, I see a film that doesn't so much incite it but shows us the true nature of violence. For example: Stone displays rather haunting images on the background of the screen that are of both Mickey and Mallory's past experiences with their abusive parents as kids, that way showing us that they have since wounded them emotionally, and that they are the subconscious driving forces behind their violence. But this is not all we see. Stone gets deeper into this subject, so we really know the kind of pain they suffered... and still suffer. There is a nice trippy montage of Mickey's childhood, and an especially neat sequence in the film where Stone presented Mallory's basic everyday life under her parents' roof that I am sure relates to many's. The sequence was shot in the style of a TV sitcom, with mechanical laughter and everything, but there was nothing funny about it, as her piggish father insulted her and made lurid remarks about the way she dressed (\\"What are you wearing? A broomstick and a trash bag?\\" he gleefully asks her), touchedher in inappropriate ways and demanded she go upstairs to wash herself up so when he goes up there to see her \\"she won't see my face for an hour.\\"  <br /> I loved this film...I absolutely loved it. There are things about it that have me hooked from beginning-to-end, visuals that have my eyes glued to the screen, an overall exciting and invigorating feeling I experience whenever watching it, and that is caused by the frenetic pace, the many quick-cuts throughout, and rich cinematography, which ranges from eccentric multi-coloured camera angles to documentary-style black-&-white, from film to video, from sitcom-style parodies to newsreel parodies, and even animation. Stylistically, the film is an outstanding achievement. I have never seen anything like it before.<br /> Another were the performances by Robert Downy Jr. as Wayne Gale, an edgy, bloodthirsty journalist and host of a tabloid TV show who's immediately enthralled by Mickey & Mallory; Tom Sizemore as Jack Scagnetti, a corruptive detective who may be bent on catching Mickey & Mallory, but is nothing more than a poor excuse for a detective, as he gets thrills outta committing murder himself; and Tommy Lee Jones as Dwight McClusty, a sinister warden who believes that all criminals are scum, regardless as to how the media depict them as being. But naturally, the most notable of all were Woody Harrelson's and Juliette Lewis' as none other than the cold-blooded killers themselves whom everyone was making such a big deal outta. Harrelson and Lewis-the two ignited on screen, and fully engrossed me with their performances. They're capable of being both frightening, as they devoid of anything sympathy toward others, and pitiful, as we see that their childhood is still eating them up inside. Woody Harrelson is one of my favourite actors. You may remember him-no, chances are, you remember him as the dim-witted but warm-hearted and absolutely adorable bartender from the popular eighties TV sitcom, \\"Cheers.\\" He was the only one outta the gang to have a successful movie career, and with a film like Natural Born Killers, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out as to how he got that boost. No matter how drastic the change (oh, how it was ever), Harrelson handles his roll with perfection. But there's more to him than the performance as to why he was so perfect for this roll; he has this spark in his eyes that projects evil, a face that has the likeness of a killer. In a big-budget film like this, it is vital for the perfect casting job, it is vital to have actors who we can truly and sincerely believe... I was persuaded.<br /> When I first watched this film in its entirely, I was left breathless. I watch it now as an eighteen-year-old, and the film still has the same effect on me as it did when I first watched it, and that's because Oliver Stone is the sort of director who'll be willing to go beyond the limits and do anything to get his message across; that's what I value about him. His film is a masterpiece. It is an important piece of American culture that needs a second looking into for all those who criticized it.
B00004Z400|5.0|This cd is truly fantastic.   I wasn't really into this type of music before, until my brother introduced me to the Deftones.  They are my favorite band ever, and I can't wait until they create even more marvelous music.  I haven't got a single negative thing to say about this band.  They're the best.
B00005RHGK|1.0|i thought the movie was very boring and had a terrible ending.Not worth buying..
B000068QY7|4.0|I must admit that even though I was looking forward to getting a new album from Oasis, I was a little afraid that it might wind up being another 'Be here now' or possibly, worse.<BR>At first listen, I could tell that it was much better the 'BHN'. But the problem was that I wasn't very impressed. I did notice that the band was sounding much better, and I also noticed the lack of slurppy ballads and the consistant bad lyrics were generally missing, although there are a few bad lines found here and there.<BR>The album is growing on me. The better songs on this album include, &quot;The Hindu times&quot;, &quot;Songbird&quot;, &quot;She is love&quot;, and &quot;Better man&quot;. The only song on the album I don't like is &quot;Force of nature&quot;, when I hear the drum intro I want to sing &quot;Rock and roll pt. 2&quot; by Gary Glitter. &quot;Stop crying your heart out&quot; is the only slurrpy ballad here, it isn't that bad, but it's obviously added for the commercial appeal.<BR>Interesting fact here is that lead vocalist Liam Gallagher writes three songs on this album, and all three of them are good. Guitarist/vocalist Noel Gallagher takes the microphone on three songs as well, and both guitarist Gem Archer, and bassist Andy Bell contirbute one song each.<BR>What we do suffer here, is the 'hidden track' mumbo jumbo that bands tend to include nowadays. About an hour and half after &quot;Better man&quot; we get to hear a rather good sounding instrumental, which would have done better to the listener had they just included it as another track. Instead of the 'hidden mystery!' song.<BR>Overall, I find 'Heathen Chemisty' a rather pleasing album, and I am personally enjoying it more and more.
B000066NW0|5.0|I used to be a confirmed pop follower but now in my old age (only 14 but hey) I now like alternative.  Avril's music is refreshingly different from pop.  Whether or not she's another popstar is trivial, the important thing is her music is not popstar material.  The music's great which is always a biggie for me.  I love it.  I listen to Complicated over and over again and am driving my parents crazy.  But now even my mom is starting to like her.  Amazing since my mom hates most of my music.  Most amazing of all to me is that at such a young age she has made it into this buisness without being a popstar.  Most music stars this age only do pop, which I think is a shame.  Hopefully she continues with this venue and doesn't become a sell out like others.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This is undoubtably my best soundtrack that I own. The movie and Shore score worked so well together in that the movie had even more dept and this CD takes you on another trip to the movie.:-) My favorite tracks are: 1,2,8,12,13, and 17. If you like good movie soundtracks get this one( and not the latest Star Wars soundtrack!)
B000002JS0|3.0|This CD deserves a higher rating, but I can't give that.<br />THis album is, in true, a mix between the two first AC/DC albuns released in Australia: HIGH VOLTAGE (1975) and T.N.T. (1976).<br />It has only two songs from the first and six from the second.<br />ATLANTIC did that because they didn't trust AC/DC's real potential so far.
B00004TH83|5.0|All the songs are beautiful. It's the best cd of nowadays.
0385505833|4.0|A classic Grisham.  One of his best.  No lawyers, but a great, fast read.  Nothing happens the way it's supposed to.  X-Mas will just never be the same.  The plot is absolutely plausible, unfortunately our situation keeps going from bad to worse.  As soon as you think it can't get any worse for our hero, it does.  I laughed out loud and shook my head in disbelief.  I EVEN liked the ending to this one - something I rarely do from a Grisham book!
B000002UAX|5.0|This is THE best Beatles Cd since Sgt Pepper. Mainly because I have this in all formats: Cassette, CD, and yes even an LP. There are many rockin' tracks I adore on this album. Back in the USSR, Glass onion, Martha my dear, and my personal favorite: the slow dancing version of Revolution (1).Ok, so none of us knew what was going in John Lennon's mind when he chose to do it that way. Another favorite is Piggies by George Harrison as well as Savoy Truffle. Paul rocks with Helter Skelter and Honey Pie, and Ringo(aka Richard Starkey)contributes as a songwriter (Don't Pass Me By). The eerie thing ,however, is that listening to Revolution (9)is not the same to me. Lennon and Harrison are no longer with us and their voices are only one heard on this track and it sounds like a ghost story. Well that how I see it. But I still like the track. This CD is the ULTIMATE must-have...even if you have it in all formats like I do. And now it's time to say GOOD NIGHT..GOOD NIGHT SLEEP TIGHT.
B00005JKNF|1.0|I will preface my review by stating that I read lots and lots of books, many of them considered to be literature. I don't watch professional wrestling, reality television, or NASCAR. I hate Bruce Willis action movies. I comprehend all dialects of English (except ebonics) with little trouble, and my hearing is acute. However, this pretentious waste of film from the overrated Altman is a seemingly endless, shallow tale of a herd of useless, uninteresting rich people drinking tea and wearing clothes while a regiment of bitter, whining servants runs up and down stairs catering to their petty demands. As if this weren't soporific enough, it is a struggle to understand more than about one out of five words. The presence of British, Irish, and Scottish accents is complicated by overlapping dialogue, echoing rooms, lots of mumbling and whispering, and poor recording. There's just no excuse for this. Whether it was intentional on Altman's part or not, it's shoddy film making. After about an hour, I turned on the subtitles for the deaf, which solved that particular problem. Unfortunately, by then I just didn't really care any more. This movie is not \\"subtle\\", it's just pointless. Altman has made a lot of horrid junk (particularly the dreadful Nashville), and Gosford Park can be added to the list. If you feel you must see it, be sure to turn on the subtitles from the beginning.
B00006690G|5.0|Shady seems to get wizer with his lyrics ever album.  This album explodes with great lyrics, beats, and a tight production.  Dr. Dre and Eminem are the best duo.

Funny
B000068QY7|5.0|All I can say is thank God there is one band out there whose soul purpose is simple: Put together the best rock and roll album we possibly can. In an era where American Pop-Culture is dominated by hip-hop and teenybopper pop music, Oasis restores my faith in rock and roll. Seven years and three albums after &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, the boys from Manchester are back better than ever. At the peak of their form, Oasis combines the best elements of their previous four albums in the making of Heathen Chemistry. The raw rock sound of their debut album, Definitely Maybe, is present in such tunes as &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; and &quot;Hung in a Bad Place.&quot;  The great, slow sing-along anthems on What's the Story Morning Glory (Don't Look Back in Anger, Champagne Supernova) are now rivaled by such instant classics as &quot;Little by Little&quot; and &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out.&quot; The trippy, psychedelic sound of Be Here Now is evident in &quot;Born on a Different Cloud.&quot; And the maturity of Standing on the Shoulder of Giants is represented by light love tunes like &quot;Song Bird&quot; and &quot;She is Love.&quot; It's no secret the Oasis' popularity has fizzled out a bit in America, but this album, coupled by their upcoming North American tour, should put Oasis back at the top of the American Music Scene - which is right where they belong. In its simplest form, Heathen Chemistry is a great rock and roll album that will make a great addition to any music fan's collection.
B000063TNH|5.0|Steven Soderbergh tackles the drug trade of the United States through multiple storylines drawn from various points in the narcotics pipeline.  The US drug czar (Michael Douglas) tries to cope with a daughter (Erika Christensen) who is addicted to crack cocaine.  A Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) gets caught up in the machinations of a powerful general who wants to control the Mexican drug trade (Tomas Milian).  Two hardworking DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) try to convict a drug kingpin (Steven Bauer), whose wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) transforms from innocent to hardhearted economic realist while her husband sits in jail.  Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan are adept at weaving the various story lines together in a comprehensible and compelling fashion.  <br />For me, this film was very powerful because it dramatized a view of the War on Drugs that I happen to agree with.  The war as it is being fought is a failure.  The illegality of drugs like cocaine and marijuana serve as de facto price supports and do very little to limit their availability.  Some reviewers commend this film on its authenticity and declare it to be like a documentary.  I hope they bear in mind that it is not a documentary and that, however much they may trust Soderburgh's intent, they should learn about this issue from non-fictional sources.  Then they will be in a better position to judge the film's veracity.
B000002KO1|5.0|This debut and its consistently good songs helped steer The Pretenders into becoming the hottest band of the early 1980s.  The group is associated with the punk/new wave genre, toward which I have mixed feelings (worse if the slash and the following two words are deleted).  Someone once told me that punk is an attitude, it is not the music that is the key, and then described some pre-Sex Pistols groups and on an individual basis, Keith Richards and Jim Morrison.  After listening to \\"Precious,\\" ask yourself whether Chrissie Hynde has an attitude.<br />But even in the rawest songs, such as that remarkable opener and \\"The Wait,\\" it becomes clear that The Pretenders are a group of solid musicians.  Among the earlier songs on the CD, though, my favorites are \\"Tattooed Love Boys,\\" with its cool signature riff, and \\"Space Invaders,\\" an instrumental in which the group presents proof positive of its musical abilities with slick rhythm guitar chops and a solid bass line.   Some of the later songs show Chryssie and the group can also do the softer stuff well. As to \\"Brass In Pocket,\\" it still sounds great to me--I do not care how often they play it on the radio.  The Pretenders' version of \\"Stop Your Sobbing\\" is better than that of The Kinks and has a neat atmosphere.  \\"Kid\\"--great melody, plus lyrics and vocals from Chryssie.  \\"Mystery Achievement\\"--another nice one.  So as it sinks into me how strong these songs are, this CD gets my fifth star.

B000068QVN|5.0|The Grand Funk Railroad Live 1971 Tour album is a testament as to why Grand Funk ruled the concert arenas of the 1970's. Their sheer raw energy and power was unparalled by any other band of their era, plus GFR's musical abilities earned them a cult following which still survives to this day. Grand Funk is the people's band and in my opinion, the greatest rock band ever! <br />For many years, the GFR fanatics have been trying to get Grand Funk's historical concert at Shea stadium released, on both album and video. The new Live 1971 tour album includes four of Grand Funk's songs from Shea. I'm your captain, Hooked on love, Get it together and Gimme Shelter. I was real impressed by the sound quality of these songs. Of all the tunes on the album, they do sound the best. It's amazing too, when you figure that this was an outdoor concert with 55,000 screaming fans in the audience. Grand Funk's performance on these songs were flawless. Hopefully, the entire Shea concert will be released on both CD and video one day soon. <br />From the opening sound, the 2001 Space Odyssey theme (also known as Sprach Zarathustra) fills the air and builds to an apex as the Grand Funk fans are ready for a good rockin' time. <br />Are you ready was recorded at the Syndrome in Chicago. The band really pulled out the stops on this tune, as they always do. The sound quality of the recording is a bit rough, but Grand Funk kicks...royally! <br />Grand Funk's version of Footstompin' Music is a early rendition from their Survival tour. Recorded at Detroit's Cobo Hall, GFR boogied the house down. Mark does a double take of the chorus, \\"Does everybody want to...\\" and does two seperate solo's. Both Mel and Don rock on the song as well. It's definitly a fun song to hear live and real benefit to the fans who got to hear the song prior to the E Pluribus Funk album. <br />Paranoid is a bit more uptempo then GFR version on their first Live Album. Mark uses his fuzz tone along with a wah pedal to deliver anawsome sound that makes the hair on your neck stand up. The guitar solo isn't as -- In your face as their first Live Album, but the song is a true definition of the meaning, hard grinding blues. <br />GFR's live version of I'm your captain is truly remarkable. Both Mark and Don's harmonies on the song is the best I've ever heard on any live track. Mel also shines on the bass as only the God Of Thunder can. The only thing is, I wish the song was longer then it was. It's a real gem. <br />Both Hooked on love and Get it together are melody versions of the songs. Grand Funk breaks into Hooked on love towards the middle of the tune and kicks up a rhythm which dares you to stand still (It's impossible!) Then Mark fly's into an awsome solo, while Don and Mel rock your socks off. They come back with the chorus, Hooked on love...and then GFR kicks into, Get it together. The song starts off with a bang. Mark jamming on the keyboards with a fiery soul and Mel playing some of the best bass guitar you ever heard, all while Don keeps the song boogying along. The Funkettes then come in to join along with the harmony of Get it together. Excellant versions of two great GFR songs. <br />T.N.U.C is a drummers dream tune! Don Brewer performs the best drum solo I've ever heard on this version. It's 17 minutes of kick ass joy. The song is somewhat similer to the version Grand Funk did on their first live album, except it's even better and longer too. During the drum thang, Mark comes in on the timbales and Mel rocks the cowbell. Then Don goes into his, \\"I wanna take you higher\\" chant and breaks into a furious pace on the drums. The song finishes off with a thunder as Mark, Don and Mel break into their ending jam. Man, what a rocker! <br />Grand Funk's rendition of Inside Lookin'Out is close to their version on the Anthology album. It's the ultimate free form rock song and I doubt that GFR ever performed the tune the same way twice. The sound quality is better then the Anthology version,plus Mark's guitar is more clean. There are times in the song where Mark seems to lose track, but then comes right back into the groove of it all. Mel and Don drive the rhythm throught the song and then kick up the pace while Mark breaks into his harmonica solo and the fans get involved too. It's truly a crowd favorite and a really good rockin version. <br />Gimme Shelter is another song Grand Funk performed at their historical Shea Stadium gig. It features Don on lead vocals and he switches off with Mark during the tune. GFR gives the Rolling Stones a run for their money with this song. They play it harder, faster and more intense then the Stones could ever manage. They rocked the stadium down with this rendition! <br />Into the sun is a blast! If you like the version GFR did on the Grand Funk Live Album, you'll love this one! The sound quality is better and Mark's guitar is up-front throught the whole song. Don and Mel shine brightly on this version and show why their both the best at what they do. Don's drumming sounds like a freight train, while Mel drives his bass to incredible magnitudes. All while Mark stretches his Messenger axe to it's limits and makes it scream for mercy. They finish the song with an explosive frenzy and pure adulation of the fans. <br />This album is a must for any Grand Funk fan!

B000065U1N|5.0|This DVD is excellent. The sound is supreme, the acting is excellent, the action is nonstop and the story line is true. Great movie. In fact, there isn't a slow part in the whole movie.<br />I love America and the people who put their lives in harms way each and every day so that we may have our freedoms.
0312265859|5.0|I love Stephanie Plum! I laugh out loud during every one of the books in this series. I can't wait for the next one. Grandma Mazur, Lula, Bob & Ranger are the best sidekicks. It is light, easy reading with a little mystery and alot of humor. <BR>Janet Evanovich is the BEST!!
B0000035E7|5.0|the Music world today is worse than its ever been.Watered down bands like creed disgrace the radio station while rap and pop is on the television.I dont really listen to the radio or watch mtv but even the more \\"underground\\" bands today are pretty bad.Despite most brainwashed people's opinions,radiohead is a horrible band which adds more [stuff] to the realm of techno.Nirvana is just a faint memory on Vh1 documentaries now,but somehow it continues to inspire and gain new listeners in todays world of despair.This is nirvanas first albulm,The songs are a hard rock mix of almost metalish chords and aguished vocals.The songs on this cd are great,swap meet and love buzz are probably my favortites.In utero is probably the best easy to find nirvana albulm,but if u really like nirvana i suggest you buy \\"Outcesticide\\" blue moon version,a very rare collection of Bsides,live versions,and demos from all albulms in the past.It is hard to find though,so you might want to consider just getting bleach and others instead.
B00005JKJA|5.0|When I first watched it I didn't understand the movie at all. Then I watched it again and again and again.. Only when you understand what this movie is about it becomes REALLY scary.. Now I can't even sleep. My life won't be the same ever again. My advice - don't watch it. Whatever life you have is, it's better that it will be when you see this movie
B00005QK3W|5.0|One Excellent Album.<br />His best work in years. The album really reminds me a lot of The Beatles. <br />Buy this album, put the head phones on, listen to it and be happy!<br />Thanks Paul. You truely are one of the greatest people ever to grace our planet.
0316666343|5.0|This book is amazing: it confirms both our deepest fears and our greatest hopes about life and death, and in the end makes us deeply grateful for having read it.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is the first movie that I ever bought, and I continue to watch it now and again. Kevin Spacey is simply amazing (deserving of his Oscar), and the story is unique and funny in its own twisted way. The cast works very well together, and you grow attached to the characters-however messed up they may seem. If you want to see a movie that's unprecedented in its subject matter, and a four star quality flick (according to me and Roger Ebert), American Beauty is the way to go.
B000068QY7|5.0|Although I am yet to hear the album, its cover leads me to believe it is the best rock album of our time.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Well I have to admit. I wasn't a fan when the movie came out. You know, I went to parties and stayed up late playing..umm Code Veronica and whatnot. Not putting anythought into where the zombies came from or why the hell this chick was runnin' aroung an island with a lighter and a gun. Soo when this movie came out I dragged my best friend to it ( He was the one who held the party and the on I thought I would most enjoy it with . I have to say that I am not one to deal with scary stuff well at all. Even while playing the game I toss the copontroller to the nearest person whenever I open a door, wraped in a blanket. So we sat there watching the preveiws and muching on popcorn and then it started. From start to finish I dont think I let go of the chair's arm or hyperventalting. I screamed at certain parts and but I never closed my eyes once...I was so engrossed in it. So much so that since March or whenever it came out I have been doing anything from checking out the books to getting the re-make on Gamecube. At the time of the movie I had no-clue what anything was..from Umbrella to even who Alice was. But I loved it. Simply loved it. Soo now then that I understand everything more I find myself looking back at some scences of the flick, such as at the end when the man was put into the \\"Nemesis\\" Project thing. I finally understand. I gave it a four because at the time I didnt know what was happening so I was lost...lost but interested. Well I'm done telling you how I blow off my weekends but playing RE games soo yeaa.. o.o;;
B000002UB3|5.0|My all-time favorite album. Everything here is perfect. Great songs, very good taste arrangements,clever chords, everybody playing damn good. &quot;Come Together&quot; is a great opener, the unforgetable bass riff, the lennonic lyrics, full of images. &quot;Something&quot; is incredibly beautiful, the guitar solo is one of my favorites ever. George Harrison did his best here, with this song and &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;, a joyful song, with beautiful vocals. Now, McCartney singing Oh!Darling is just incredible, you gotta check this out. So much power on his voice! The medley is one of the finest piece of music IMHO. Just love &quot;The End&quot;. And &quot;I Want You&quot;...it's So Heavy! Perfect album.
0316666343|5.0|It has been way too long since I've felt this way about a book. An amazing, gently uplifting story narrated by someone who could be any 14 year old we know. I'm so happy to have read it. Two weeks later, I am still thinking of Susie.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I was struck by this soundtrack while watching the movie on French television. I just had to buy the CD which I managed to do via amazon.com (how could I survive without amazon!?).<BR>I really like the band version of \\"I'm a man of constant sorrow\\" and I've been searching for a CD of the Soggy Bottom Boys but without success! Also really great and swinging are \\"You are my sunshine\\", \\"On the sunny side of life\\" and \\"I'm weary\\" by the Cox family. Sincerely funny is the song \\"In the jailhouse now\\".<BR>It's hard to discuss tastes but I'm sure that anyone who even remotely enjoys listening to Country or Bluegrass will simply love this soundtrack! You'll be thrilled!
0671024256|5.0|Frankly, I have never read any of Mr. King's books.  A few years back, my sister did gave me two or three his books, but they have been sitting on the shelf since.<BR>I always wanted to become a writer.  The first part of the title &quot;On writing&quot; was more attractive to me than the second part &quot;A momoir of the craft&quot;.  I have the download version because I simply could not find time to read - I have a mile- long reading list yet to be finished.  The audio was read by Mr. King himself.  He was a wonder narrator.<BR>As a striving writer, it is encouraging to know that Mr. King was a nobody just like one of us.  He had reached success and fame not because he was lucky, but because he had never given up.  Mr. King gave hints and tips but did not intend to spoon-feed the aspiring writers.<BR>I had the chance to browse through the printed version in the bookstore and noticed there was a reading list at the end showing what kind of books Mr. King reads.  I feel this is a good suggestion for the want-to-be writers, not that they should read all these books, but that they could compare the choice as related to the genre they are interested.<BR>I am listening to the audio for the third time, and considering getting the printed version as well.

B00003CXI1|2.0|I won't review the movie like everyone else has. I have the same minor quibbles about the movie that everyone else has. I missed Peeves, and I missed the logic puzzle, and I missed Norbert's escape. But the movie isn't what's for sale here. The DVD is. I'm so disappointed in the quality of the DVD that I doubt I will ever watch it again. Not one of the special features works for me. My Sony DVD player will not show them at all, and the special features as well as the DVD-ROM-specific features have never worked on my computers. I'm no technophobe and no idiot; I've tried this DVD in three DVD-ROM drives on three computers, in at least four different pieces of DVD player software, and I have yet to get past Ollivander's without catastrophic crashes and multiple scripting errors. I'm considering buying this movie on VHS so that I can see the extra scenes; I know they're on the DVD, but they simply don't work.
B000003S0P|5.0|Over the years, this has become my favorite recording of all time. When I first discovered King Crimson \\"Red\\", in 1977, in a ... \\"cutout\\" bin, with the hole cut out of the corner, I took it home and immediately hated it. Luckily for me, I listened to it a 2nd time. This album sets some kind of unearthly standard that cannot be described and can never be met again. [The other King Crimson album that cannot be ignored is \\"Discipline\\", which contains all the same raw energy, but under the tight Discipline of the more evolved Fripp & Bruford.]
B00003CX5P|2.0|After seeing the original series I hated Episode I the first time around. The special effects were wonderful and so were the sets and many*** of the creatures who inhabited this world. But the characterizations were dull and the acting was wooden. The plot was darn near incomprehensible. <br />But when I saw Episode I for the second time, on PPV, I noticed the music and sound effects were overwhelming the dialogue, so I turned on closed-captioning and voila! I could understand both dialogue and plot. Unfortunately the newly decipherable story was pretty lame - way too 'talky' and far too long. I think Lucas could have cut this by 30 minutes without hurting it a bit, but then where would he have had a place to hang all the effects and new species?<br />***[Except for Jar-Jar Binks, who drove me nuts with that phony-Caribbean lingo and other affectations that would have been racist if this had been a human creature]
B000068QY7|4.0|You ever here the saying why is everyone always picking on me, that is how I perceive Oasis music the last couple of years. Everyone raves about their first two albums and understandably but Be Here Now was a great Rock album and Standing on The Shoulders of Giants 70 % of a great rock album. A person digs a an album because their at a certain place in time and for this reason we can't judge all albums the same. What is happening to Oasis music because of all the critics is the self fulfilling prophecy. You read enough reviews of how oasis are almost back to the top or they missed again and you can begin to become brainwashed, not me of course ha ha. The early 90's were a glorious time of the second big wave of rock and roll the first being 60's @ 70's. I'm glad we had bands like oasis, nirvana and pearl jam. If your a fan of oasis I believe you will like this album, some of the songs on this album are as good as any they've ever produced. If this was a debut album we'd be talking about it like the strokes etc. Long live rock and by the way Noel Liam's songs are awesome espesially Born on a different cloud and Song bird, Noels classics Hindu times and Stop crying your heart out.
B000068QY7|4.0|Everyone's favourite bickering, almost impossible to decipher brothers, are back with a decent album, a vast improvement over their last effort, the glooomy ' standing on the shoulder of giants'. i'll not give a synopsis of each song, you'll judge for yourself, but as a whole, it's a stronger, more confident record that starts out strongly but fades a bit down the stretch. the swaggering Oasis that i remember from their first 3 record ( i loved ' be here now ', although many consider it a disappointment ) only shows up sporadically on this new one. they at times sound like they are holding back. i was secretly hoping for a  Supersonic: part 2 type of song here, but no. don't get me wrong, there is some really good stuff here, and i'm pretty happy with it..but i still feel as if they are not quite in form. in today's musical climate, however, new Oasis tunes are a welcome relief. Oasis fans like me will buy it and dig it ok. Long live rock and roll!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love, love, love this cd. I have listened to it so many times that I'm suprised the cd isn't worn through... <br />Affirmation is a perfect blend of Darren's voice and some beautifully written songs. The lyrics are sweet, simple, humane, and easy to realate to. It's also such a great mix of songs. It's so mellow and yet danceable. I listen to this album whenever I'm having a bad day...it always cheers me up!<br />Recommended strongly!
6300214419|5.0|The acting that De Niro and Streep exercise within this film is truly exemplary, proving once again (The Deer Hunter) that the chemistry between the two is so powerful. They don't need to be talking in order to show it either. The amount of emotion that Streep and De Niro convey within a subtle face gesture is enormous. There remains no doubt within my mind that true lovers of the acting craft will appreciate their skill within this gem of a film. Everything about their acting makes this story so credible-- that extraordinary love can flourish and blossom among two everyday people who are currently living within two decent, good marriages. <BR>  No, this will not be the De Niro you may see in your hard core gangster filck, but that's just a sign of a great method actor! De Niro is man of many faces and emotions! He's not simply playing himself in all his roles, as opposed to many other actors. He pulls this role off brilliantly!<BR>   Bottom line: If you appreciate great acting, and are a romantic at heart, you will not be disappointed with this film. I hope that De Niro and Streep make another movie together!
0790732254|5.0|Edward Albee's \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" is one of the most important plays in the history of American Drama, representing a sort of merging of the psychological drama represented by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller with the existential plays of Samuel Becket and Eugene Ionesco.  After a faculty party George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) have invited a young professor, Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis), back for a few drinks.  What happens is ironically described as fun and games, which end up airing everyone's dirty laundry in a compelling death spiral of brutal confrontations.<br />All four players were nominated for Oscars, with both of the ladies winning in the finest ensemble performance since \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night.\\"  Burton lost to Paul Schofield in \\"A Man for All Seasons\\" and Segal to Walter Matthau in \\"The Fortune Cookie.\\"  Haskell Wexler also earned a richly deserved Oscar for Best Black-and-White Cinematography.  I think this is clearly Elizabeth Taylor's best film performance (Burton's too).  I remember someone asking Katharine Hepburn if she thought any other actress had ever shown a range comparable to herself and she mentioned Taylor.  It makes sense.  They have both done plays by William Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, and Albee.  Not even Meryl Streep can say that.<br />The film does have one major problem, which Albee himself has repeatedly pointed out, namely, it was a mistake director Mike Nichols to let the two couples leave the house and go to a roadhouse in the middle of Act II.  The play is a one set play, of course, and Albee consider the claustrophobia it produced part of its main effect.  By getting them away from the house, or even having George and Nick have their big talk from Act III out in the backyard, the idea that Nick and Honey are trapped with no way out.  But I think this is something that bothers people who have studied the play intimately more than fans of the cinema.<br />Most Romantic Lines: Yeah, right.  I think the nicest thing Martha says to George is \\"You make me puke,\\" and the most famous line from the play, \\"What a dump,\\" is taken from a Bette Davis movie (Yes, I know which one, but, no, I am not telling).<br />If you like \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #84 \\"Double Indemnity\\" and #48 \\"Last Tango in Paris.\\"  Why?  They are also tales of twisted love.<br />Most Romantic Lines: Yeah, right.

0380820846|5.0|I waited forever for this book because I've read all of the others in this series and have been dying to know who Lady Whistledown truly was.  You will find out if you read this book, but not from me!<br />Penelope Featherington has been in love with Colin Bridgerton since she was 16 and now she is heading towards spinsterhood at eight and twenty.  Colin has been abroad and has come home from his latest jaunt.  In that time, Penelope still loves Colin but has little hope that he will ever notice her as anything other than his sister Eloises' best friend.<br />Lady Whistledown can't seem to write columns without mentioning the very available and nice Colin Bridgerton - evidently nothing has changed since he left - or has it.  The girl who was like a part of his family, now haunts his dreams.  Could this be love?<br />This is one of Julia Quinn's classic love stories with her trademark humourous dialog.  A charming story, and the mystery of Lady Whistledown, finally revealed!  I never guessed it!
1556587864|2.0|Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone use sex as a weapon as Douglas's character investigates the shocking murder of one of Stone's lovers. More of an acquaintance she slept with than a lover, the aging rock star is repeatedly stabbed with an ice-pick, the same fate met by a fictitious rock star in a torrid novel Stone's character had written. The book so baldly links Stone's character to the murder that it's less a clue than an alibi. (Who would be crazy enough to commit a horrible crime and essentially confess by selling a ficionalized version of the gory event at $5.99 a-pop to beachgoers and frequent fliers?) Though Douglas, as \\"Nicky\\", pursues the case with an eye towards collaring Stone's Catherine Trammel, nobody else on his force will touch her - some are in awe of her as fans, or simply don't want to try pinning the murder based on her book.  It soon becomes clear that nobody really likes Nick - his partner, played by \\"Law & Order\\" alum George Dzunda, is one of his few friends on the force, but even he admits that he's in the minority; a former lover played by Jeanne Tripplehorn also has a rocky relationship to Nick -  she's also the PD psychiatrist, and Nicky's given her enough material to write a book of her own.  When Nick remains determined to get even closer to Trammel, we quickly learn that he has a history himself (Stone calls him \\"Nicky\\" like his ex-wife used to and, to really clue him in to his transparency, \\"Shooter\\"; it seems that Nicky has a rep for jumping to conclusions with his police 9mm), and Stone's Catherine Tramell turns his demons against him. Nevertheless, Tramell needs Nick - he's the perfect model for a character in one of her new books. They duel (mostly in bed) but the script tosses in some other players: Roxy - one of Catherine's lovers and Jeanne Tripplehorn (who may have a history of her own w/Trammel); and let's not forget a pre-Newman Wayne Knight as a chainsmoking detective in the infamous interrogation scene.<br />This movie generated a lot of controversy, but the biggest surprises aren't sexual at all - instead, the script repeatedly shocks with its unsublety, dropping hints like anvils - Tripplehorn's having known Trammel in HS, Trammel's telling Nick of having been stalked by a fellow classmate in college, a student who tried to assume Catherine's identity - as if we're too stupid or lazy to connect the dots before the last 1/2 hour!  As a mystery, \\"Instinct\\" is a total failure - dispensing with any of the remotely intelligent plot devices of mystery - as motive and opportunity - instead characters die almost at random (the murder victim himself is a cypher, an innocent bystander whose death was needed to get the story going and gets tossed once Nicky's on duty).  Even the sex isn't sexy - mostly it's just violent, less seductive than kinetic. For a flick about a sexual predator, \\"Basic Instinct\\" isn't remotely arousing.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The only way I can start this review is to say that this movie is amazing;  it may just be Besson's best.  Leon is the the story of lone \\"cleaner\\" Leon(Jean Reno) who forms a relationship with a twelve year-old girl Mathilda(Natalie Portman in her screen debut).  Mathilda and Leon come together after her entire family is murdered by a crooked DEA agent named Norman Stansfield(Gary Oldman).  Leon then teaches Mathilda some of the tricks of his trade.  Mathilda then falls in love with Leon.  In the end there is a thrilling shoot-out when Stansfield catches up with the two.  This is an excellent film with complex characters and great performances.  Natalie Portman is great, but Oldman is riveting as Stansfield.  This version of the film contains 24 minutes of footage never seen in the U.S.  The extra footage focuses mostly on Mathilda's training but a few scenes go a little deeper into the love story element.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great film.  5 stars for an outstanding movie.
0786860707|5.0|As any animation student or fan would know, this IS the book he or she would admires and stares for hours.  \\"The Illusion of Life\\" is not just a history book about the Disney studio, but it goes beyond the history and concept; it goes in deep into storytelling, character animation, background design, concept/script illustration, character design, and many more.  The greatest thing about this book is the author and writer, FRANK THOMAS and OLLIE JOHNSTON!!!  Two of the veteran and master of Disney animation.  They have been working with Disney since Sleeping Beauty and Peter Pan... the 40s and 50s!  The writing is also very descriptive and easy to understand.  Not only they get to the point, they also reveal several secrets and tricks in animation.  <br />I strongly suggest every animation fan and animator to get this book. It is expensive, but not rare to get.  It is one of a kind!  And do get it before it runs out of print!
B000068QY7|4.0|A lot of people are calling this album a &quot;return to form&quot; for Oasis. However, Heathen Chemistry is more of new beginning than a return to past glories. I would argue that this is their best album yet...by far. Heathen Chemistry, unlike their other albums (especially the last two) sounds like the work of the one of the best bands in the world...not mere posturing (which the Gallagher brothers have perfected to an art form). This album feels far more sincere than most of the material on their previous albums, and suprisingly, the best work comes from Liam. His songs (with the exception of &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out,&quot; which was penned by Noel), are the highlights of this album. With &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;Born On A Different Cloud,&quot; Liam, for the first time, feels as if he is channeling the power of Lennon rather than imitating it. With this album, Oasis have become their own band--they have finally grown up.
B000068QY7|4.0|Oasis have taken some stick for \\"borrowing\\" from the Beatles; put that cricket bat away, it's beside the point. Liam's writing tunes, and they're Fab while still being Gallagheresque: \\"Better Man\\" transmutes \\"Cold Turkey\\" and \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" by Lennon into Oasisville; \\"All In The Mind\\" takes the beat from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" into laddish 2002 trancepop; \\"Hindu Times\\" roars like a classic Oasis arena anthem should, sitar riff mutated into electric guitar. If Oasis use the Beatles as template, we shouldn't complain. Great earthy, analog guitar and keyboard sounds abound. No-one's writing power pop like this in the new century; give \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" a listen.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Pearl Harbor is a movie unlike many others.  Most films are fast and entertaining in the beginning and end, and slump in the middle.  At the end of Pearl Harbor, I was bored.  The best part of the movie occurs at about 90 minutes into this three hour monster.  The attack on Pearl Harbor is absolutely thrilling and fast-paced.  It will also bring out the patriotic soul in all of us.  The attack lasts for 45 minutes and is the best part of the film.  The problem with this movie is that the first 90 minutes and the last 45 minutes come no where near the excitement or involvement of the attack sequence.  The love story is filled with cliches and it monopolizes most of the film.  Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are fair, but Ben Affleck flounders.  Rent this movie;  do not buy it.
0790749815|5.0|North by Northwest is one of my all-time favorite movies. From start to finish, NxNW is a roller-coaster ride you'll want to watch again and again. It is thrilling, exciting and at times totally hilarious. Essentially, it's about Roger O. Thornhill, a confident and charming advertising executive, who is mistaken for a government agent and is consequently chased across the country. He is set on the road drunk, forced to hide in train compartments, crop-dusted (a classic sequence), trapped in auction, and finally chased across Mount Rushmore. Movies don't get any better than this.<br />As for the cast, it is excellent! Cary Grant gives a perfect performance as Roger O. Thornhill - and he is hilarious and charming, as ever! Eva Marie Saint is also very good, as the mysterious and glamorous girl Cary meets on the train. James Mason does a wonderful job playing the debonair but evil villian.<br />Directed by Hitchcock, this is a great comedy/thriller - in my opinion, it is Hitchcock's best movie! Additionally, it is a good idea to get the DVD, because the movie is astonishingly sharp and clear and there are plenty of special features. 100% worth your money! If you haven't seen this, by all means do, and if you have, get a DVD you can watch again and again!
B000002AP1|5.0|For only being a little more than half an hour long, this album really is a draining and exhilirating experience.  Each song packs its own wallop, and it seems to me that one has to really listen carefully to get the full effect of how successfully Iggy and the Stooges were able to capture total abandon on tape and still keep it coherent and memorable.  There are some incredible moments here where the splintering/shrapnel/barbed-wire guitars intersect with Iggy's yowling vocals to create the most hair-raising effects.  <br />Still, this is an abrasive bunch of songs and it needs to be handled with respect, like any other caustic, potentially toxic substance.  It is, after all, RAW POWER that we're talking about here.  And for such an audacious title, I would say that the product delivered completely lives up to the billing.

B000068QY7|4.0|Wihtouta doubt, Oasis is one of the best bands to hail from the land of Brits, but are not as commercially regognized as well as they should be here in the good ol U.S. of A. They have had thier sparse hits most notably including \\"Wonderwall\\", but you would be hard pressed to find many an american who could name a song or more that Oasis have craeted and played. All that is unfortunate as this is one oif my all time favorite bands and there are may people who rae missing out on what could be called old-fashioned rock n roll. Sure they may enjoy the Beatles and take an idea or few from them, but if you were to take an influence from aband why not one of the best if not best bands of all time. While I have yet to really find any of Oasis's albums to be sub-par, many others have, feeling that their only worth while albums are \\"Definitley Maybe\\" and \\"(What'a The Story)Morning Glory?\\" due to the fact that they were more radio accesible and commercially friendly aka Could be played on the radio two to three dozen times a day. With this new album \\"Heathen Chemistry\\", Oasis have created an album that harkens back to the two classic albums made in 1993 and 1995. Not only are the songs more passionate and radio friendly, they are honestly some of the best songs that Noel Gallagher(and even Liam now!)have ever written. \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" has to be one of the absolute best osi songs ever written, it has  chorus that just sticks in your head the same way as \\"Don't Go Away\\" from \\"Be Here Now\\" did. It's a beautiful song that makes me think of my girlfriend everytime. Another one of my favorites is the Liam Gallagher penned \\"Songbird\\", although short and sweet and with out drums, it is phenomenal. Obviously written about his current girlfriend(Nicole Appleton of the British Girl band All Saints), it has a very Revolverish sound to it but a good sound nonetheless. Overall theoir is not really a bd song on this album even though I am not fond of \\"Force of Nature\\". Fans of Liam's voice beware as he does not sing every song on the album, leaving three to be sung by brother Noel. That is not a bad thing to myslef seeing as i happen to like Noel's voice a great deal. For fans of Oasis, I need not tell you that this album should already be in your collection by now, as for those who were fans and are wary that the boys may not be what they used to be, i reccomend that you give them another shot, and fdor those who have never even heard of Oasis, I also reccomend that you give it a shot, you might find that Oasis are not as bad as people are making them out to be. Pick it Up, it's good.
B000068QY7|5.0|... is that people expect great things from you all the time. Oasis measures up significantly on this release, which I think is the third best album in their catalog. Definitely Maybe it's not, but it's close to Be Here Now in overall power. I loved the opening track, which sets the tone for the entire album. Oasis is routinely accused of being a Beatles tribute/imitator band and maybe they are; but when they use obvious references to the Fab Four they do it better than anybody else in the world of music. <br />The point is that it's easy to slam a band that has created some of the best music in an entire decade (the 90s), particularly when the expectations are so high for every release. I always find it amusing, however, that some critics decry the notion that Oasis borrows so much and at the same time moan when they go against type (i.e. Standing On The Shoulder of Giants). <br />If you appreciate the Oasis sound, it's back in full force on this gem. You will play it at least twice the first day you own it, it's just that good.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I must say, I am a huge Seinfeld fan, I've seen every episode...twice. I could write for hours about the episodes, but I won't. <BR>      I can not see any reason why Seinfeld hssn't been released on DVD, many others have (M.A.S.H.,Freinds). By not releasing Seinfeld on DVD, you're doing the show a huge injustice.

1559277246|4.0|I love the Stephanie Plum series and this one is just as fun as the first seven.  However, the narration doesn't do it justice.  Lorelei King's sing-songy style really detracts from the story.  I really miss the great treatment Janet E.'s book High Five got from narrator C.J. Critt.
0066620996|4.0|A huge and important research that provides interesting findings of great companies that applied common sense but yet difficult to implement concepts, made possible due to the participation of level 5 leadership. All concepts mentioned in the book can be used very well in turnaround a mediocre business or to enhance one, but not necessarily will work the same way for every company without a culture of discipline. I found that applying discipline to whatever one does is the key message of this book. Although I consider that forcing metaphors to work on a methodology was too much.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is the story of the World's cutest baby elephant, with the World's biggest pair of ears! Born into a circus life, Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants, with only his mother to provide love and protection. But when Dumbo's mother is carted away for protecting her baby from a mocking group of kids, the little elephant is left with no one. Not for long however, because soon Timothy Mouse comes along and befriends the little fellow. With the help of Timothy, and a local flock of crows, Dumbo develops self respect and self confidence, and learns that \\"the very things that held him down, are going to carry him up, and up, and up!\\" Dumbo becomes the world's first and only Flying Elephant!<br />  Dumbo is a true Disney classic! A wonderfully simply and charming tale, told with great music and expert animation! The DVD looks gorgeous, and carries some nice extras. The classic Silly Symphony shorts \\"Elmer Elephant,\\" (about a little elephant who is made fun of due to his nose while at a friend's birthday party, and yet manages to use that very nose to save the day when a fire breaks out), and \\"The Flying Mouse,\\" (about a little mouse who wants a pair of wings more than anything, but learns that you are better off the way you are), are included, along with a behind the scenes feature about Dumbo and some other nice treats.

6301978587|3.0|good parts:  a STRONG story - the premise of the film was excellent - someone who has to hide who they are to move forward in life - a universal message.  also, i found the character who played the male lead was excellent.  also, i loved the background - the setting, the culture portrayed, the clothes, etc.<br />and the stinky parts:<br />1)  barbra streisand:  god, she gets so annoying.  all her little useless singing asides.  it was like, at a certain point:  JUST SHUT UP!!!  and as an actress i find her poor.  melodramatic, cutesy, self-serving.  she just went way too far.  no surprise that she herself directed herself in this.  she needed someone honest to tell her, \\"enough barbra - the world doesn't revolve around YOU!\\"<br />2) at so many points the movie just dragged on and on.  they could have easily cut out a half an hour of movie.<br />3) the lies got to be too much for me.  i felt it entirely unnecessary that yentl marry the woman hadass.  there wasn't a real and positive reason for it, and on the negative side it had so much potential to hurt people - particularly hadass.<br />4)  real BS at the end where the guy softens to yentl just because she says she loves him.  yeah right.<br />5)  and annoying with all the homosexual (both gay and lesbian) symbolism.  not that i'm against that kind of imagery, but i felt they were doing it for no purpose other than to be simply provocative - to inject gay stuff \\"silently\\" into such a anti-gay environment.  it would have been far more powerful had they done it MORE SUBTLY.  i guess that's what i'm trying to say.  they didn't need to beat the audience over the head with it.
6305126062|4.0|I found this movie to be quite satifying.  The cinematography and scenery was breaktaking.  The storyline was fine, a bit drawn out with saddness at the beginning but the hope picked up as the viewer was able to see how hope was renewed in both animals and humans working together.  The romantic connections between Redford and the mother of the child was heartwarming yet alarming as she was already married, but do not miss this classic western romance...

038533558X|5.0|This is one of those books that you hate to put down - there isn't any good place to stop!  Almost every chapter ended with a (usually) unforeseen *twist,* and you just HAD to continue.  <br />I truly thought I knew what the ending would be, and I was surprised yet again!  I HATED to have this book end, because I know whatever I read next will be boring by comparison.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg has a well-earned place in our national memory. This film does the basic story a great justice. I saw it first in the theater eight years ago and watch parts of the film over and over. Scenes and people are realistic. People fighting for their &quot;rats&quot; (a Northerners misunderstanding of the Southern pronunciation of &quot;rights&quot;) offers an interpretation of the causes of the war.<br />For me, there are valuable illustrations of life today available in scenes from 'Gettysburg'.<br />When Lee disciplines Stuart for his absence, we see a perfectly executed reprimand. Leaders in business today can learn from Lee's excellent, effective use of punishment.<br />When Lee takes three minutes to tell Longstreet his vision for what we now refer to as &quot;Pickett's Charge&quot;, we learn how a clear, simple vision can also be the recipe for disaster, even if Pickett and his charges came within minutes or feet of carrying the day.<br />Chamberlain's speech to the mutinous troops at the onset of the film offers lessons on the power of persuasive speaking. And, immediately preceding the speech, we see how Chamberlain leads by example, as he starts his morning.<br />Living just down the road a piece from Pennsylvania and the national battlefield, I can appreciate just how close Lee came to winning the battle, the day, and, perhaps, the war. This a a great lesson in history with scenes worth waching and appreciating today.
0140186395|3.0|I must say that I'm truly in awe of John Steinbeck's uncanny ability to write such a masterful novel with so many intracies and fill six hundred pages with an engaging story without wasted words.<br />I know that the story is not supposed to be completely realistic, and it should have some mythical quality to it; however, the huge flaw with this book is the long and abundant philosophical dialogue.  The characters bring up abstract ideas by the dozens, and sometimes it is way too much for one novel.<br />One minor flaw is the exaggeration of a few personalities, such as Sam Hamilton.  He is exalted by the narrator in such a way that I grew tired of reading about his endless quirks and subtleties page after page.<br />The rest of the book makes up for these flaws, but not entirely.  Many of the relationships are gripping and interesting, especially between Charles and Adam, and Cal and Aron, two pairs of brothers from different generations.<br />Kate is the mythical character, acting like a serpent in the garden of Eden - she is probably the best and most interesting part of this book.<br />Characters Lee and Sam Hamilton should have been played down.  In the later pages of the book, John Steinbeck seems more concerned about surprising the reader with annoyingly unexpected philosophies on life instead of subtly driving in the themes of the story.<br />I also wish that the story of Cain and Able were not directly mentioned and stated by the characters.  We the readers should be allowed to discover or see the metaphors ourselves.  East of Eden became a less interesting metaphor as soon as Lee and Sam suggested naming two twin boys Cain and Abel.<br />Best line of the book: \\"Am I supposed to look after my brother?\\"
0812550706|4.0|Obviously, I must be pretty bored to sift through the majority of these reviews. I'm responding more towards the negative reviews, because there is no need for yet ANOTHER review praising Ender's Game and addressing its plot. (Nobody's gonna read it anyway). I've read Ender's Game in the course of two days, and I hadn't seen any flaws--reading these reviews though, very good points were brought up. Card's lack of literary gimmicks has been criticized. However, this was what made this book refreshing, the type of book you can pick up to read again and again. The prose was /very/ simple. My brother in 7th grade read it easily and without questions.<br />Neither do the readers receive descriptions about Ender's physical appearance, or, for that matter, his siblings'. I don't know about you, but this wasn't something I was preoccupied with. I was more embroiled in the mental conflicts.  There were also  several complaints about Ender's one-dimensional personality. This too, made me think. This technique has been effectively employed in other books: fleshing out a character solely through actions and speech. This makes Ender a difficult character. However, it does not make his experiences any less dramatic. On the contrary, the readers' attention is drawn towards the contrast between Ender's actions and thoughts. For an example, we see him cry, but we don't get an inside view of what's going on in his mind. This causes his actions to be all the more starkly vivid.<br />Another small error is that the entire time, we are set up for this huge battle with the Buggers, the supposed climax, but we never reach it. I can only excuse this with the possible fact that Card's main focus was the psychology of Ender's growth. Card has a very clear understanding of the way a human mind, be it a child's or an adult's, works.  The ending, although, was not surprising. It was, as mentioned in some of the reviews, a letdown, for the previously stated reason. By this point though, the reader focuses on the stress Ender and his commanders are under, rather than the actual battles. <br />All in all, this is a book everyone should pick up. It's definitely on my &quot;favorite books&quot; list. It requires a bit of a suspension of disbelief, but once you get past that, the rest is one enjoyable ride. A page-turner. I intend to start the companion series, the series about Bean.<br />One last note: The adult reviewers who say something along the lines of &quot;leaving this read for the teens&quot;, as if implying that only teens, severely lacking in intelligence, would enjoy Ender's Game, are patronizing. Gets on my (insert curse) nerves. The book may be simple in its prose, but it has a fairly good grasp of concepts and is far from &quot;See Spot Run&quot;. So please, for the love of God, /stop it/.
6305327084|5.0|The whole movie is really good.  It's got a wicked soundtrack and a wicked cast that was very well acted.  The characters are all very memorable and real.  They speak and act like real people and you really connect with them.  The gem of this movie is Natalie Portman.  The insightful chats she has with the Timothy Hutton character are the best moments in the movie.  She truly steals the show.  I think all guys should check this movie out.  It's not too sappy and all the main characters are guys so it's a fine buddy guy movie with a touch of sentiment.  It's got a lot to say about how men think and how women really are.<br />Good night sweet girl.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I totally loved this album.... That editor guy was really harsh. I saw John perform once in Atlanta with my cousin and fell in love. I like all the songs, my favourites are Love Song For No One and Your Body Is A Wonderland. I recommend this album to anyone who just wants something to listen to. All the songs are in some way relatable and are all amazing.<BR>Fans... make sure you check out JohnMayer.com for tour dates, he'll be in a town near you soon.
0783228317|3.0|Terry Gilliam's almost faithful adaptation of the gonzo journalism classic will probably most appeal to those who like the book and fans of strange cult movies. The film begins with a light, adventurous mood as HST's alter ego Raoul Duke (Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (del Torro) zoom across the desert with a trunkful of illegal substances and then stumble their way through a debauched Vegas in a pyschedelic haze. Depp's performance is incredible; he IS Thompson, capturing his mannerisms and speaking style (I didn't think his mumbling was that hard to understand; it grows on you.) But the second half of the film takes on a darker tone as their trip goes into the dark side of drug use, becoming at times difficult to watch. I found myself looking at the clock, wondering when it would be over. I was also disappointed that the movie omitted some essential parts of the story concerning their quest for the American Dream. Still, remarkable that someone even made a film of this unique book.
B0000029GA|4.0|What can I say? This album is packed with beats that are sure to impress you. I have to add, this was a great start for Nas. This album, like the rest of 'em, presents an East Coast beat and definately 'represents' the East Coast as well. Nas fan? Pick this album up for sure.

0452282152|4.0|The story is set in the 17th century.  A young woman, Griet, is an unassuming beauty who at the age of 16 is sent to be a maid in the house of Johannes Vermeer, an amazing painter who takes a liking to Griet.  There are numerous tensions already existing in the household and Griet adds to them.  The mother in law there, Maria Thins, knows that Griet is special and feels the trouble brewing.  What good can possibly come of a painter/master of a house and the maid who works there? To him she became more than just a servant.  She assisted him with his work and he taught his vision of the world to her.  To watch Griet's character grow and come to life is the best part of this book.  Her perceptions of things are wonderfully written.<br />Tracy Chevalier is a truly talented author.  Her look into the life of the working class versus the well-off, the religious differences that were so apparent at that time and the social injustices is what makes this novel shine.
B00005JKL8|2.0|The story was great, the plot was intriguing, and the action was well done.  However, the director goes for the Blair Witch shaky camera trick.  By the end of the film I had a severe case of motion sickness.  DO NOT watch this on a big screen TV.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Whether you like the movie or not you cannot deny that this is one of the best DVD's ever published. Other DVD's claim to offer you the most features; this DVD simply does without saying a word about it...  Fire it up for two or three times and closely watch the menu.  Watch the extra DVD with all the bonus material and prepare to be amazed with the different views they offer you; one track with the different drawings, others with animation, then the last one with computer animation.<br />If you are into Star Wars this is a must have. No doubt about it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne shows us that age knows no boundaries with her debut album &quot;Let Go&quot;.  She makes us think, &quot;what were we doing when we were 17?&quot;  Unlike many singers out there these days, Avril writes her own songs, and very well at that.  Her songs have versatility, and her lyrics show us that she isn't afraid to say what's on her mind.<br />Saying Avril is &quot;pop-punk&quot; would be doing her an injustice.  There are so many different styles of music on her album it would be impossible to fit her into one genre alone.  There is some hard rock; Losing Grip, Unwanted, pop rock; Mobile, Complicated, and even a rap-like song; Nobody's Fool.  It's no wonder her fan base is so strong and still growing.  Be a part of that fan base.  If you don't have this album yet, get it NOW.  NOW!
0345442989|4.0|I bought the paperback edition of this book the first week it was available, bought it on Thursday, and finished it by Sunday, it is a very quick read, its 344 pages were a breeze, it took me  a total of about 4 hours to finish it. The first 50 or so pages were the hardest for me to read, because they focused characters that are unfamiliar to Star Wars fans except Nute Gunray and Dofine everyone else is new.  However, all of the information given in those pages were vital to understanding the story, so even though they were plodding, they were also essential and couldn't have been omitted without making the later story incomprehensible. Once the action gets to Corusant, the pace picks up and it is a much quicker read. The background information on Palpatine and his manipulations of Chancellor Valorum, and Darth Sidious' plotting with the trade federation were very fun to read about.  The biggest problem with the book is the limitations under which it was produced, as a prequel to an already well know story, it is by necessity rather predictable, as you know where everything is going to end up, and he doesn't have the freedom to offer any major bombshells, like revealing that Palpatine and Darth Sidious are the same person.   But, none of this is the author's fault, it is the nature of the enterprise.<BR>   The flaws as, I see them, are: first, Darth Sidious/Palpatine seems a little too powerful. At times, the story strains credibility too much because it makes it appear that Sidious is in control of ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING in the galaxy.  He couldn't have possibly planned for EVERY possible contingency.  Yes, I know that he is an evil genius and that he spent years developing his master plan, but even a Sith Lord isn't omnipotent, which he seems to be in this book.  In the movies, it is very clearly established that Sidious is indeed fallible, he is very prone to make mistakes and miscalculations.  He didn't anticipate that Valorum would send Jedi to negotiate the blockade of Naboo, he didn't forsee that Amidala would attack rather than sign the treaty with the Trade Federation, he thought that Darth Maul would be able to defeat Obi Wan and Qui Gon, and most important, he failed to forsee that when he was forced to make the choice, Vader would be loyal to Luke rather than to himself.  Sidious isn't infallible!  Second, I don't agree with the books characterization of the relationship between Obi Wan and Qui Gon, is this book, Qui Gon seems way too critical of Obi Wan, constantly criticizing him and rebuking (almost like Obi Wan is with Anakin in AOTC) in my opinion, this goes against what we see in TPM, where Qui Gon doesn't feel the need to chastise Obi Wan except on a couple of occasions.  But then again, I suppose that one could argue that Obi Wan matured and developed between this book and TPM, so that Qui Gon didn't need to criticize him as much.  These minor flaws aside, I liked this book very much.  IMO, it is one of the better Star Wars novels.  Bottom line: if you liked TPM (and despite the whining you occasionaly hear from the malcontents, I think that TPM is a great Star Wars movie, a worthy successor to the original trilogy) then you will like Cloak of Deception also, as it adds to your understanding of the events in that film.
0316779237|3.0|I am a great fan of David Sedaris - but this book is sort of like expecting Frank Sinatra and listening to Frank Sinatra Junior instead.  Yeah, it's good, but it is not the same...<br />For long time readers of Sedaris, this is a reminder of how good he can be.  Nothing makes me laugh as hard as \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" and of course for those who have not discovered the author's stint as a Macy's Elf, you are really in for a treat.  <br />Let's just say that various nephews and nieces are now reading \\"Dinah\\" to their children, and I suppose that I need to find new material to redeem myself as the family curmudgeon.  (Note: I also read excerpts from \\"The Painted Bird\\" by Kosinski at Thanksgiving, so I am well known as the family downer.  But I digress...)<br />So why so few stars?  This material is available elsewhere, and the selection has a bitter tone -- even for me.  I was somehow hoping that there was something new that I had not seen yet.  For new Sedaris readers, this is gold.  For longtime fans, this is a rerun.

6304082428|3.0|Jane Austen's book is the story of 5 sisters (3 of which are well-developed) and their trials and tribulations in finding a husband.  In true Austen fashion, the girls are in poor financial straits, and their potential suitors are wealthy gentlemen for whom such a match would be unfavourable.  Throw in an improper mother, a sarcastic father, and a variety of colourful cousins, uncles, and friends, and you have an enjoyable farce.<br />This BBC/A&amp;E production of Pride and Prejudice is a very faithful adaptation of the book.  At 5 hours, it can afford the time to introduce the extended characters of Austen's work without being rushed or confusing.  In fact, it is a great credit to the director, the casting, and the performers that so many characters are juggled with no confusion.  Notable performances are put forth by Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett.  The rest of the cast is uniformly good with, unfortunately, the exception of the lead character played by Jennifer Ehle.  She portrays Elizabeth as too amused, too little affected by criticism, and too friendly compared to Austen's characterisation.  In fact, the personalities of the characters Jane and Elizabeth seem to be juxtaposed in this miniseries.  This is a minor quibble, and Ehle improves as the story moves along.<br />The sets and cimematography are also very nice.  The manor houses and grounds are lovingly photographed, without dwelling on them.  The action moves at a leisurely pace, appropriate for an Austen setting (and slower than modern movies tend to allow), which may put off some viewers.<br />My main criticism is that this film is unnecessary.  It is too true an adaptation, which begs the question, &quot;Why not read the book instead?&quot;  It is a film that lazy high school English students will love.  However, if you are looking for a live version of this Austen classic, you'll not find a more faithful adaptation or better made film than this.
0440219078|5.0|You can't improve upon perfection, and that is what Lowry has created in The Giver. This is one of the most universal novels I have ever read (and reread). Each time I read it, and as I get older, I find new meaning in the novel. This is not just a book for the young, as I believe it is recomended for, because the deeper meaning and some of the adult themes cannot be truly appreciated by a younger audiance. However, I for one read it when I was 10 for the first time and that is when I first fell in love with it. I continue to read it every couple of year, at least.<BR>--Some have addressed the fact that the story is simple and \\"scifiish\\". well, frankly, it is science fiction and it is a simple story. The language is simple, that is why the reading level is so low. And the facets that offend some adult readers will mostly pass by a child reader. And if not, they are not concepts that are not prevalent in life. This book won an award for a reason, because it is sound literature that proves many points about the society we live in. So in conclusion, I supose this book is not going to impress the conservative crowd, or those who think children need to be protechted from books. <BR>I for one am still in awe.

6300216802|2.0|Sadly, this first entry in the Star Trek feature film series is less than the sum of its parts.  Despite the reunion of the classic TV series' original cast, augmented by a pair of talented guest stars, the guiding hands of series creator Gene Roddenberry and legendary director Robert Wise, a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith, and a story concoted by great sci-fi author Alan Dean Foster, the film never rises above the mediocre.  The biggest flaw is the pacing, as exemplified by the absurdly long introduction of the Enterprise in spacedock, and the ship's later meandering journey through the internal world of V'ger.  The FX and sets are impressive, but never inspiring.  The script is built on an interesting premise, but one which never comes to life and finally disintegrates in a melodramatic but unmoving anti-climax.  The best parts of this film are the Mr. Spock subplot (in which the Vulcan sees V'ger as a kindred spirit and potential mentor), and the opening segment depicting V'ger's skirmish with a trio of Klingon battle cruisers.  There are worse films, even in the Star Trek saga (notably Generations), but this movie will probably only appeal to die-hard Trekkies.
0385503954|5.0|I've never read Ian McEwan before, but I will read everything of his I can get my hands on in the future. I found this book reeled me into its aura as though I were a fish on a line.<BR>The technique of having each of the four parts focus on a single pivotal day in the very long lives of the characters worked perfectly.<BR>When I read the last two pages, I burst into tears with no warning. I never saw the end coming.<BR>Also, there's a terrific sex scene beginning on p. 126...McEwan has nailed it!
B00005YW4H|5.0|For whatever reason, this album gets everything right including right place at the right time. Some may say there could be better arrangements, but in today's highly-produced music world I appreciate the simplicity of Norah's music. This album will spin for a long time in our CD player this year. This is good stuff. We love it!

B000005IS1|5.0|What an amazing album! The sound is good, and the added bonus of hearing the MC5 yell about the revolution makes this an album that needs to be live. If you're into the Stooges, definitely pick this up, it's like a punk-rock cross between the Stones and Iggy Pop and does indeed sound very powerful today. I can't believe the MC5 isn't more well-known. They rocked hard, and this is coming from an 18 yr old!
B000021YQV|1.0|A faint excuse for hard rock, in any case, would surpass System of a Down's awful music, and their CD &quot;Toxicity&quot; is no exception. The song that is the CD's namesake has no identifiable beat. Chop Suey is half-assed. Half of the remaining songs are worth little. There is not a track on Toxicity that is worth anyone's time. System of a Down, a bad band in any case, has not had much luck in displaying their apparently quasi-mystical musical talent, and it remains to be seen how anyone can enjoy System of a Down's music-that which lacks tone, feeling, or any sense of emotion.
B000060MY6|4.0|I have to say that I was surprised that so many people were confused by this film and that no one seemed to \\"get it.\\"<br />WARNING:  If you havent seen it and don't want to \\"know how it ends,\\" read no further!!!<br />First, there is not really a plot, but the gradual revealing of an event.  Thus, the forward impetus comes not from finding out \\"what happens next,\\" but from the gradual revelation of reality so that initially unrelated, confusing pieces are connected to form a complete whole.<br />The reality is revealed in the final sequence, which begins with Diane Selwyn being driven in the car, along Mulholland drive.  Everything from that point on is reality, which is this:  A woman named Diane Selwyn comes to Hollywood to become a movie star.  She auditions for a part at the same time as another actress, Camilla Rhodes.  The director, Adam Kesher, chooses Camilla, but there is an attraction betwen Diane and Camilla and they begin a lesbian affair.  (Camilla also gets Diane small parts in her movies.)  Then, one day, Camilla breaks off this affair (\\"We can't do this anymore\\") and Diane guesses, \\"It's him, isn't it?\\"  Meaning that Camilla has fallen in love with Adam.  Camilla then invites Diane to a dinner party and humiliates her by announcing the marriage to her in front of everyone and also blatantly kissing another female guest.  Seeking revent, Diane meets a hitman at a diner and hires him to kill Camilla.  He shows her a blue key and tells her that he will leave the key in a prearranged location as a signal that the job has been done.  Diane finds the key and, realizing that her ex-lover is dead, is so overcome with guilt and remorse that she shoots herself to rid herself of the demons in her head.<br />Everything that happens before the \\"final drive\\" are Diane's desperate re-imaginings of what has happened, to assuage her guilt -- so things are twisted around.  Diane becomes a sweet, innocent girl, who is immediately recognized as a brilliant actress.  Whereas, in reality, at the diner with the hitman, the waitress's nametag says \\"Betty,\\" in the re-imaging, the waitress becomes \\"Diane\\" and Diane is \\"Betty,\\" and she is with \\"Rita/Camilla,\\" trying to help her, instead of with a hitman, plotting to kill her.  The money in Diane's purse at the diner becomes money in \\"Rita's\\" purse.  Adam's mother, Coco, becomes a friendly landlady.  And so on as people and events get twisted in Diane's mind as she is driven to suicide.  And finally, the blue key meant to signal Rita's death becomes the key to a mysterious blue box.  When Rita opens the box, both \\"Betty\\" and \\"Rita\\" disappear as Rita looks into the box and sees... Diane, in the back seat of the car, and the beginning of the \\"real\\" events.<br />Hopefully, this will help those who were confused to appreciate - and enjoy -- the film more.eas, in reality, at the diner with the hitman, the waitress's nametag says \\"Betty,\\" in the re-imaging, the waitress becomes \\"Diane\\" and Diane is \\"Betty,\\" and she is with \\"Rita/Camilla,\\" trying to help her, instead of with a hitman, plotting to kill her.

B0000640SB|4.0|My family and I love this movie, it is funny with lots of action without.  It is good enough that the whole family can watch and everyone will get a great laugh out of it.  We have watched this show many many times and we never get tired of it. Men in Black II looks like it will also be just has good and cannot wait to see it. <BR>I also like the DVD extras, I love watching with the commentaries and hearing the stories behind each scene.
B000002ILG|4.0|White Lion was a very under-rated band. I never thought of them as a metal but as a hard rock. I considered Vito Bratta one the best guitarist to come onto scene since Eddie Van Halen. Throughout Pride his axe work is amazing. Pride was one of my favorite hard rock bands during the late 80s. Unfortunately, they got pigeoned holed into the &quot;cheese metal&quot; group because of their MTV friendly singles &quot;Wait&quot; and &quot;When the Children Cry&quot;. That was eventually their demise, too bad because I thought they had a future.
B000062TU1|4.0|Harry Potter is a simply charming, exciting, and wholesome old-fashioned entertainment for children and adults alike. Christians (especially fundamentalists) decried the books when they came out, and then the film, but such hysteria betrays utter ignorance of what Potter is about, and where its roots lie. It stands in an ancient tradition of story-telling, with the familiar imagery of monsters and magic being used to illustrate the struggle between good and evil. At its core is a message that is truly Christian in spirit.<br />Potter has humble beginnings, growing up with his aunt and uncle who reject and despise him, before on his 11th birthday discovering that invested in him are magical powers that most children only dream of. From there he is taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he must learn to use his powers responsibly and morally. Like Christ, Potter is faced at every turn with the temptation to misuse the powers he has been granted, to befriend evil and use his abilities for his own, selfish gain. His journey culminates in a final battle in which he faces evil head on and, in a fiery climax, laden with infernal imagery, he must decide whether to put his own desires (however legitimate and heartfelt they may be) above the good of others.<br />The virtues of self-sacrifice, honour, and love clearly (and predictably, of course, but that is not the point) emerge the victors in this oft-told story of war between good and evil. How shallow must one be not to be able to see, beneath the trappings of mythology, magic and folklore, that this is the kind of tale every child wants to hear, and ought to hear? Potter's pilgrimage is one that begins with childish fascination with magical powers, but goes on to show us that power is not merely a toy, but is a gift which carries with it responsibility and duty; power means nothing and is worth nothing when it is wielded apart from love. As St Paul wrote, 'If I have a faith that can move mountains, buthave not love, I am nothing' (1 Corinthians 13:2).<br />I asked myself what made Potter into such a hero. He is hardly any more interesting as a character than his peers: the presumptuous Hermoine Granger; Potter's unassuming best friend, Ron Weasley; and the dastardly Draco Malfoy. On the contrary, Potter is rather bland as a character, and there are far more curious traits to be found in others. He does, however, exemplify all that is good (even though he might be found ambiguous in some regards, but this is a staple of good story-telling). He is an underdog who, in finding that he has been given a precious gift, also finds justice and compensation for the way he has been treated. And it is a gift which he uses in the right way. The character of Harry Potter is no hazardous doorway into occultism and wizardry (as if Rowling's creation bore anything other than a very superficial resemblance to real witchcraft anyway); rather he is a role model in whom parents and teachers can have confidence. He is a hero, and his popularity is proof that goodness and virtue are still what people (children most of all) value, admire, and want to emulate.<br />The tale is told with great excitement, awe and invention. Amongst a wonderful cast, Alan Rickman stands out as the creepily disconcerting Snape. As an exhilarating and enchanting adventure, even aside from the positive message conveyed, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is marvellous.
0375410341|5.0|I told myself I needed to read this book because of the cross-marketing involved with author Danielewski's sister Poe's simply amazing CD &quot;Haunted&quot; (5 stars, easily)...&quot;House Of Leaves&quot; and &quot;Haunted&quot; are presented as companion pieces from diferrent media, but in truth there are very few parallels or even noticable similarities between the two works (&quot;Haunted&quot; having to do with the coming to terms with the relationship between a duaghter and a recently deceased father, whereas &quot;House Of Leaves&quot; is...well, like nothing I've ever read before).<br />&gt;<br />Having determined this to be the case, I was able to read &quot;House Of Leaves&quot; with an open mind and without any preconceived notions as to what the book itself offered.  I had read reviews (and heard some the book's text read in Poe's excellent &quot;Drive-By&quot; remix of &quot;Hey, Pretty&quot; from the re-release of &quot;Haunted&quot;), but none of that adequately prepared me for the challenge of this book.  And &quot;Challenging&quot; is the best word that fits the manner of reading that awaits anyone who picks it up.<br />&gt;<br />The sheer exhaustion that Danielewski had to have put himself through in the presentation by which the book is structured is enough to tire the reader...the structure of the book becomes more and more maze-like the more deeply involved the plot becomes.  Text is written upside-down, backwards, diagonally<br />...and that says nothing about the exhausting amount of footnotes, endnotes, even musical notes that accompany the text.  There are at all times at least three stories going on all at once, all of them with their own twists and turns, subtly connected but just as equally independent.  I'm convinced that this is one of the best books written in the last 10 years, but I'm also convinced that the author may well have become involved to the point that to a degree, his own &quot;house&quot; was compromised in a way he could not have foreseen before undertaking this incredible work, arguably the last great work of the 20th Century (or the first great work of the 21st Century, depending on how you feel about how the year 2000 fits).<br />&gt;<br />In short, challenge yourself to read this book...even if it's only to see how it ties in with the Poe CD...I promise you'll reward yourself for the effort.e foreseen before undertaking this incredible work, arguably the last great work of the 20th Century (or the first great work of the 21st Century, depending on how you feel about how the year 2000 fits).<BR>&gt;<BR>In short, challenge yourself to read this book...even if it's only to see how it ties in with the Poe CD...I promise you'll reward yourself for the effort.
6305165912|5.0|At his moment in the history of American film, I wonder if the Coen brothers aren't our most interesting filmmakers. Even their misses are more interesting than most other's hits. Of all their films, I personally believe that THE BIG LEBOWSKI is the finest film they have made yet.<br />If in MADAME BOVARY Flaubert attempted (and succeeded) at writing a novel without a heroine, in THE BIG LEBOWSKI the Coen brothers made a film without a hero. Jeff Bridges plays the title role of Jeff \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski, who isn't so much everyday as considerably below nondescript. He is poor, unambitious, unobtrusive, and unspectacular. His only goals in life appear to be bowling, smoking pot, and drinking White Russians. That \\"The Dude\\" could be the center of a motion picture seems spectacularly absurd. That the movie succeeds despite such humble assumptions is a testament both to the Coen brothers and Jeff Bridges. I have long considered Bridges to be one of the most underrated performers in the movies today. Interestingly, it may be the movie in which he was most playing himself. I saw a segment of BIOGRAPHY on A&E on Jeff Bridges, and his wife mentioned that in this film he was pretty much playing himself, and, in fact, wore the clothes he wears in everyday life in much of it. Gotta love that.<br />On one level, this movie is absurd. Intentionally absurd.  The various elements, in the hands of lesser individuals than the Coen brothers, might fall apart into something dumb. Instead, they meld it into something remarkable. John Goodman's diatribes about the boys in Vietnam, or his dedication to the Jewish Sabbath (despite not being Jewish), or the many jokes about Nihilists, or Goodman's awe at being in the semi-presence (the man is unconsicious and in an iron lung) of a man who wrote most of the episodes of the TV show BRANDED, or John Turturro's absolutely demented turn as a Hispanic bowler, or Philip Seymour Hoffman's marvelous turn as the personal assitant to multi-millionaire Jeff Lebowski, or Sam Elliot as the seemingly omniscient \\"The Stranger\\" all are elements that improbably blend together to make an absolute masterpiece. Bizarrely, the more absurd the Coen Bros become, the better the film becomes.<br />The cast is as good as one can possibly imagine. Jeff Bridges, has I mentioned, is just perfect in the lead. John Goodman and Steve Buscemsi are just as good as his bowling partners/best friends. Goodman's frequent blow-ups are among the best moments in the movie. Tara Reid has gone on to larger roles since this film, but she has never been better than in the small but crucial role of Bunny Lebowski. Peter Stormare (notable before this as the more insane of the two murderers in FARGO, the one Frances MacDormand catches trying to put the leg of Steve Buscemi into a pulping machine) is just incredible as the leader of the \\"Nihilists.\\" Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro, Ben Gazzara, and Juliane Moore all make a good movie even better. And Flea, of the Chilli Peppers, makes a small appearance as one of the Nihilists.<br />This is just a great film. It isn't just a must see, but a must see over and over. Few films of recent years have so many moments that I enjoy recalling as this one. And although OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU! and THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, the two films that have followed THE BIG LEBOWSKI, haven't been quite up to its level, I still look forward to a new Coen brothers film more than just about any other.<br />One other note. The music for this film is just incredible. One of the most striking moments occurs when the viewer is assaulted with a brutal version in Spanish of \\"Hotel California.\\" It is worth noting that the person responsible for assembling the songs for the sound track was none other than T-Bone Burnett. Although O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? was not a great movie, it did feature a spectacular soundtrack.

I've haven't heard anything this unique and refreshing since No Doubt's first album. AVRIL LAVIGNE will be remembered and recognized long after the rest of this garbage out nowadays has been forgotten.<br />This is one you want to buy.
B000068QY7|4.0|Oasis return from their unremarkable last album with a fiery, <br />multi-hued piece that doesn't drunkenly overdo it like Be Here <br />Now or rely too heavily on their carefree sentiment. <br />It opens with the galvanizing The Hindu Times and then Noel <br />Gallagher takes up <br />vocals on the piano thump of Force of Nature. Hung in a Bad <br />Place is a Gem Archer tune<br />gripped by the ragged row of Liam Gallagher's voice. Stop Crying <br />Your Heart Out gets carried away<br />by its glimmering guitars, strings, and hopeful feel. Songbird <br />is a minor classic penned by Liam,<br />his vocals beautifully restrained, and pushed gently by a fluid <br />music.<br />  Little by Little has Noel singing again, then there's Andy <br />Bell's easing shortcut (A Quick Peep) into<br />(Probably) All In My Mind, the fullest sounding song, and with <br />the best interplay by the band.<br />She Is Love is the third song sung by Noel, he wrote six on this <br />album (he usually writes all) and<br />it is pleasant enough, soon into beat-clapping. <br />  The next two songs have Liam writing again; the first doesn't <br />have its influences all<br />tucked in, with a kind of spacey undertow behind the slowly spun <br />out vocals.<br />The second takes advantage of Liam's guttural chewing of the <br />lyrics and his brother's<br />punctuations.<br />The hidden track, twenty some minutes afterward, shows the <br />band's capacity for subtle soundscapes.<br />  Overall, this is a very good album, pulled off with the <br />puncturing open of the band line-up; the new songwriting sources<br />adding a fresh cohesiveness, and Liam's vocals moving from his <br />abrasive all-consuming bray into<br />a wider territory, a more vulnerable, yet fearless one that <br />lilts up and around the always alert<br />musicianship.<br />MM,<BR>July 4/02
B00000JPHF|1.0|Hi! I'm your Movie Review Girl! Are you tired of real drama, good actors, and deep dialogue? Do you poop out at movie parties? Is your good taste unpopular? The answer to all your problems is in this little movie. Yes, Frankenstein. Frankenstein contains staged drama, stiff actors, parroted dialogue and lots of growling by an emotionless monster. With Frankenstein you can earn your status as a classy movie viewer. All you do is take five minutes after every Hitchcock movie. It's so tasteless, too. Just like dryer lint! So why don't you join the thousands of bright, misled people and buy a great big DVD of Frankenstein tomorrow? Remember that name! That's Frank-en-stein.
0385043805|5.0|Rebecca is one of my favorite suspense novels of all time. My older sister brought Rebecca home to read and couldn't put it down. I latched onto it when she was finished and I couldn't put it down, either. That was about 35 years ago! It's interesting how timeless this story is. I have read this book countless times through the years and as I've matured, I've gained deeper insight into the various characters' feelings and motives making it new all over again. I love the way Ms. Du Maurier weaves the fascinating tale of a vulnerable young woman filled with low self exteem and her evolution from victim to victorious in the midst of an environment filled with lies, deceit, treachery and malice. It's a powerfully good read.
B000021YQV|5.0|I said it before, and I will say it again....I love being a tur....oops...sorry. I Love this band!!! Toxcitity is a huge jump from their previous album. And once again they hit the scene hard with very powerful issues of government and drugs. Their is obviously more to this album than just that, but I am just getting started. First off, the \\"Prison Song\\", happens to be the first song on the album. It states that government is trying to imprison our society. (atleast how i feel) System of the down continues its reign as one of the most intruiging bands of this era in music. I can't wait to listen to their next album. I am sure that they are just going to keep getting better, and better, and so on. Enjoy!!!
B000060P79|5.0|Alright everybody stop what you are doing, and go and get Simple plan. There new cd \\"No helmets...no pads, just balls\\" has got to be one of my favorite cds out today. If you like Blink 182 or New found glory, you will most defenitly like Simple plan.Singing about the problems about a kid, to how you would do anything for that certain girl.This is a must so go now and get Simple plan.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of the down is by far one of the most intruiging bands of this time in music history.  One of my favorite things about this band is their freedom of expression, \\"obviously\\" given in their music.  They are not afraid to speak out on the flaws of society. (and believe me, their are alot)  System of the Down's music is very intense, and very serious.  Because of that System of the Down's music is good for many things.  You can use it for pure head banging pleasure.  You can use it for unwinding after a long day at work or school.  You can use it to get fired up!!!  And you can use it to just enjoy good music.  No matter what your need is or how many times you listen to it, you will always be in this state of \\"aww\\".  Their music carries so much power, that it should blow you away.  Enjoy!!!
B00005KHJV|4.0|This DVD probably made anybody who bought the original 2 DVD collector's edition a little miffed, because originally this was the supplemental disc in that collection.<br />What we have here is HALLOWEEN with 10 minutes of scenes added to pad it's network running time and make it fit better with HALLOWEEN 2.  The scenes don't add much to the movie, because the original 1978 theatrical cut of HALLOWEEN was deliriously well edited and timed out perfectly.  These scenes are a novelty and a curiosity for fans of the series.  The definitive version is still the original, but this is a nice addition to any collection.<br />The picture is just as sharp as the original cut's DVD, but the sound mix is not as aggressive.  No supplement either like the documentary on the original release.

0064407667|5.0|The first book of A Series of Unfortunate Events is called The Bad Beginning. As you will find out in the very first chapter, the Baudelaire children (Violet, Sunny, and Klaus) experience a very unfortunate event. I will not specifically tell you what happens because I don't want to ruin it. Besides, you'll find out soon enough! <BR>Because of this unfortunate event, Violet, Sunny, and Klaus are forced to live with a relative. Mr. Poe, a man that will utterly annoy you later in the series, helps find their relative. The Baudelaire children end up living with Count Olaf, a very, very, distant relative. I can't begin to describe what he looks like or what he acts like because it would hurt you both physically and mentally. It would also ruin the fun of this book.<BR>If you are interested in reading a popular series with humor and tragedy, I would highly suggest this series.

I get in this focused intense zone everytime I hear it...This disc should be in your collection...Go buy it ...Now...

B00004W5UA|5.0|This is definitely the most amazing movie I have ever seen, period. Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter and Brad Pitt put on great performances. I don't think I need to give a quick summary- plenty of others have done so already. The movie basically takes on what the results might be of our corporate society, and looks at a sort of anarchist club. The movie poses a lot of questions, and certainly is one of the most thought-provoking and gripping films I have seen in a long time. I didn't find the violence excessive at all, honestly. There was plenty, but I've seen a lot worse. Some people seem to think that this movie takes on rich white guys that are depressed- but I think it has little to do with race- more to do with the faceless corporate drones that are grown and produced in our society, and the problems with the mass conformity spawned by this. The movie does not glorify fighting or anything else- the fighting was a way for the men to feel alive, just feel after being numbed by corporate america. I think that many people did not wuite understand the message of the movie- rather, they picked on the themes of fighting and masculinity, while not understanding their purposes in the movie. Fight Club is a fantastic film, worth many viewings.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|Normally I really like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, but I found this movie almost unwatchable. I probably wouldn't have even finished watching it if anyone else had been in it. There was just not enough material to carry a feature length film. As expected the plot was pretty lame, and jokes just wore thin after a while. I like Stiller much better when he is not trying so hard to be funny, the same goes for Owen Wilson. They are both very funny naturally, and this attempt at extreme characters just did not work for me.
B000059XY7|5.0|THE REASON WHY SUPERMAN 2 IS A LITTLE BETTER THAN SUPERMAN THE MOVIE IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN THIS MOVIE.LIKE LEX BABY,ZOD AND THE TWO OTHERS MADE THIS MOVIE.I LIKE THE MUSIC IN THIS AND IS REALLY GOOD.PS 1,2 AND 4 ARE THE MOVIES TO WATCH.

Here are my favorites:<BR>Lady Marmalade<BR>Your Song (Ewan McGregor does a stunning version of this)<BR>One Day I'll Fly Away<BR>&amp; Come What May<BR>My only suggestion to purchasing this album is that whoever is considering buying it should really see the movie first, since no C.D. could possibly replace the real thing. Note: You will absolutely LOVE McGregor's version of Your Song. It's by far one of the best on the whole soundtrack! Who knew he could sing so well? (Nicole Kidman, too.)
B000002UJQ|5.0|Listen closely, this album is something that comes around every so often, rare like a solar eclipse. Comparable to modern art, where experimentation derived from influence creates something very pleasing to the eye. Such is the case with Radiohead, where the ear is what is pleased. Take the first track for example. \\"Airbag\\" - which has a DJ Shadow influence, which is so subtile to the ear, most won't even notice. Listen again. The next track, Paranoid Android, which people call the \\"Bohemian Rhapsody of the 90's\\" - not true, the only concept taken from that is the 3 parts to the song. Synthesized sounds leave the album with a sad emotion, where as, the guitars play more of a happy role, leaving the listener exposed to both the uplifting and depressing aspects of this album. What is even more brilliant, is how well the album flows together. This album shouldn't be downloaded by specific songs, but rather heard in CD quality, altogether, the entire album at once. \\"No Surprises\\" was actually intended to be the first single from OK computer, but instead rests appropriately towards the end of the album. The background? Is meant to put you asleep, the xylophones are relaxing, Yorke's vocals are light and happy. What is the song about. Mediocrity, death, and being content and accepting. I could go through each song, but I'd waste your time. Instead, buy this album and see if it hits you like it did me.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I will listen to the real album (not mp3s)before I make judgement.
B00005QIPH|4.0|OK, so the music isn't complex, the vocals are distorted, the riffs are simple, but the album is fun and catchy. It isn't deep, nor is it a musical masterpiece, but it's pretty damn clever. Lighten up people, there is no need for hatred, nor is there for complete praise. Get beyond LOVE/HATRED of this band, kick back and enjoy it for what it is.
B00005QDW1|1.0|..but where's the rest of the lyrics?!  Every song except for the one's obviously made for radio play (Hella Good and Hey Baby) is one 30 second chorus repeated over and over and over for 4-5 minutes each song.  It's so bad that each song fades in and fades out because there is no beginning or end.  Where is the musical genious in that?  My question is, who decides when to say &quot;OK, we've repeated this chorus 37 times, that's perfect! Not 38, that would make it too repeatative&quot;.  It seems to me that Gwen was too busy singing back up on hip-hop songs to spend the time needed to perform on this album, and it shows.  The bad thing is that every &quot;song&quot; is very catchy, and with a little bit of effort put towards more lyrics I would probably be giving Rock Steady 5 stars instead of 1.  I'll admit that I was never the biggest fan of this band, but this album has caused me to lose any interest in ever buying another release from them again. No doubt.
B00005B4GU|4.0|To say that this album are the left off tracks to the Kid A album is unfair, after all, OK Computer had some tracks reworked from originally being rejected from the Bends album. Radiohead have become perfectionists, and they would not put out an album where they know that it is not 100% their best effort. Unfortunately, what happened was that the masses were impatient with Radiohead, since Kid A was originally supposed to be a double CD. To expect Amnesiac to sound like Kid A was reasonable, but to tell you the truth, if Kid A and Amnesiac were sold together, as 2 CD's, I would have enjoyed Kid A much more. However, there are some real bright spots in this album. The opener is something we haven't heard from Radiohead before, where instrumentation is brought down to its bare minimum, almost like a Company Flow instrumental, with Yorke's vocals difficult to understand. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, has a changing piano melody, which sounds nice with the haunting vocals of Yorke. It seems like this album is about progression, and originality, but I think they tried a little to hard to make it sound different than Kid A, when in the end, it's more like Kid A than any other Radiohead effort, only in my opinion not as good.
0790733897|5.0|Great, tersely done thriller. Where are the Steve Mcqeen's today? We have wimps like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt and George Clooney. Pop this in your VCR or DVD player to see what a REAL leading man is!
B000024D4R|5.0|When one thinks of the most underrated albums in rock history, a few should automatically come to mind. One of those is Animals, a dark, moody, and ultimately spectacular effort by Pink Floyd. Although some are turned off by it's depressing themes and long arrangements, Animals is a true treat for those willing to hear it out. Spanning four songs on five tracks similar to Wish You Were Here, Animals affects the listener like very few albums can. All the tracks are essentials:<br />Pigs on the Wing (1&2)- Two short accoustical songs bookending the album. Both are very catchy and introduce as well as close Animals suitably.<br />Dogs- Arguably Floyd's greatest song, Dogs is 17 minutes of stunning musical perfection and awesome lyrics to boot. A very vicious song as well as the standout of the album.<br />Pigs- Another lengthy track with more great musical arrangements. The bass line throughout is one of Roger's best.<br />Sheep- The most well known, as well as the darkest, song on Animals. This surely ranks amongs high Floyd's most cynical, hard hitting work.If the beginning buildup and first few minutes don't freak you out, the menacing rendition of The 23rd psalm will.<br />Even among such giant achievements like Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall, Animals still remains of of Floyd's best offerings. As diehard a fan as I am, it still took me awhile to finally give in and get it. Now, I couldn't do without it. Anyone who does the same will surely agree. Pop Animals in, put on some headphones, turn out the lights, and prepare for a totally electrifying experience.
B00000AFHM|4.0|This release from Scotland's twee pop assemblage is less impressive than their previous two releases, 'Tigermilk' and 'If You're Feeling Sinister', but still a remarkably strong record in its subtlety. Most of the album is made up of sweet little nothings that are pleasant and poetic and comforting, but never really stick to you. The opener, &quot;It Could Have Been a Brilliant Career&quot; takes time to build up steam, setting the stage for the rest of the album. Once the first verse is completed, the piano comes in, harmonizing perfectly with Stuart Murdoch's voice, and that's it, you're stuck in this nice, cushy little twee world of strokes and smokes.<br />The dreary &quot;Seymour Stein&quot;, &quot;A Summer Wasting&quot; and &quot;Ease Your Feet in the Sea&quot; barely register, after you've listened to the album. Hooks are there, in the form of Murdoch's voice, but the catchy bits to Bellenseb are always more powerful when they belong to the orchestra of backup musicians. &quot;Sleep the Clock Around&quot; barely escapes this category, but for the circular woodwinds and keyboard chattering that redeems it. &quot;Is It Wicked Not to Care?&quot; (by a female member of the band --- Isabelle Campbell, if I'm not mistaken) and Stevie Jackson's &quot;A Space Boy Dream&quot; (basically a less-interesting take on VU's &quot;The Gift&quot;) interrupt the flow of the album, but are still interesting enough not to skip over.<br />The album hits its stride (almost too late) on the second half, with standout songs in the band's repertoire like &quot;Dirty Dream No. 2&quot;, &quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; and the perfect closer &quot;The Rollercoaster Ride&quot;. The ode to finding love in the NYC indie scene, &quot;Chickfactor&quot;, isn't especially memorable musically, but the lyrics are impeccable and sweet. <br />The whole of 'The Boy with the Arab Strap' is greater than the sum of its parts. Only a few songs here are as strong as those on the band's first twofull-length works, yet somehow that works to its advantage. It's an album of textured instrumentals and feather-light songs that takes time to appreciate. Sometimes this can be rewarding, but in other parts it can be a fairly fruitless endeavour. If you're a hardcore fan, this record is absolutely essential. Casual fans can preview a few tracks and decide for themselves.
B000002UB3|5.0|At the time of the production and release of Abbey Road, The Beatles were immersed in turmoil and dispute. You could never tell that from listening to it. The Beatle's last recorded album is nothing short of a masterpiece, and it's my personal favorite. The songwriting and musical arrangements on AR rival anything they ever did. Every Beatle has a hand in songwriting, making for some very diverse tracks. My personal favorites include the grotesquely comical Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Harrison's wonderful contributions Something and Here Comes the Sun, and the hypnotic Because. Few, if any, Fab Four offerings are as consistent and rewarding as AR is. It's nearly impossible to single out one Beatle's album as their best, but Abbey Road comes pretty damn close to that mark.
B000002U82|5.0|If I was going to start a band, they would probably be more similar to Pink Floyd than anyone else. <br />Simple song titles, powerful lyrics, and awesome(synthesized) music are what make Roger Waters and the rest of them great, at least on this album.<br />I don't care what anyone says, but \\"Time\\" is the greatest song ever made, and that's why its also first on the album. After that it goes on with \\"Money\\"(which is what we all care about most) and then proceeds onward. At one point you'll reach \\"Brain Damage,\\" which doesn't seem to meen anything in particular, but is still cool anyway.<br />To wrap this up I just want to say that Pink Floyd shows a wide range of musical talent and diversity in their songs, and they will live on for eternity in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I definitely think this CD is a must for any fan who is even slightly into Classic Rock, and knows what real music is and can identify the ones who started it all.
B00006690G|5.0|I think the eminem show ROCKS. Especialy number 19 and 20.(i think my dads gone crazy)is cool cause the little girl has a good part in the song. She pritty much discribes her dad very well for her age.hahaha. I think this album is so cool, and is a must to get.I listen to it every time i want to listen to some music.
B000068QY7|4.0|Oasis is back and with tunes that made them so beloved in the 90's. Much like the Dandy Warhols, the Strokes, &amp; Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Oasis have never hid their influences (in fact they wear them on their sleeve like a badge of honor). They embrace their rock heritage and heroes with songs that pay tribute to the past, while carving out a niche of their own here in the present, and solidifying their place in rock history for the future. The Gallaghers, along with not-so-new boys Andy Bell &amp; Gem Archer, deliver 11 tracks that take this way of making music to a new level. The Beatles, the Stone Roses, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Iggy Pop, the Stooges, the Charlatans, and even early Oasis (94 era) themselves all seem to find their way into 'Heathen Chemistry' with the highlights being the first two singles &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; &amp; &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;. The first being a 'Street Fighting Man' on speed shout-a-long and the second being the string and piano backed love ballad that only the Gallagher's can make you proud to sing out loud in public. The Noel Gallagher penned and sung tune &quot;Force of Nature&quot; makes you want to grab some 70's clothes and have a night out clubbing with Iggy Pop, while &quot;(Probably) All in the Mind&quot; harks to the days of 'Madchester' in the mid-late 80's with the Smiths and Stone Roses ruling the music scene. In fact, the Smiths Johnny Marr contributes guitar solos and backing vocals on a couple of tracks. But the biggest surprise is the song writing talents of younger brother Liam Gallagher. &quot;Songbird&quot; is a simple, yet lovely track that wouldn't be out of place in Lennon's later work, while \\"Born On A Different Cloud\\" and \\"Better Man\\" would make his idol pick up a guitar and jam along. The album begins with a bolter and gains momentum as it goes. You'll be going to the fridge for another pint song after song. Music that excites, music that makes you sing a long, music thatmakes you Mad Fer It! Enjoy &amp; live forever.
B00003CX8I|5.0|Wow. This is the BEST movie ever. It felt like they weren't mutans, but special people with great powers. My favorite character was Storm (I want those powers!). If you like the \\"cartoon\\" X-MEN, then you'll like this movie. I think it's so great that you'll watch it more than one time (I can't even count how many times I watched it). This movie was done very well and the special effects were really great. I don't know what else to say, but here are some things about stories of the characters.<br />Storm: is my favorite and she has the power to controll the weather and that is how she can levitate (by using the wind). In this movie she is played by Halle Berry. In the movie she was a teacher at the Xavier School for the Gifted (I think that was the name). She is just great. in the movie she uses her powers and that was why I re-watched it for countless times. The Beast really seems to hate her (you know the Beast that fights with Walverine and trys to brake Storm's neck). Storm is the best!<br />Cyclops: has the power to beam something out of his eyes and in the movie you don't even get to see his eyes. He has a problem with Walverine because Walverine likes his girlfriend (Jean). That's about all about his, and he was also one of the first students at the Xavier's school (including Jean and Storm).<br />Jean: has the power to move things with her mind and can also read minds. She is Cyclop's girlfriend and one of the first students at Xavier's school. She came close to danger of dieing when she tried to use Xavier's machine for finding new mutants. She is the one that Wolverine likes.<br />Wolverine: has the power to heal quickly and also has sharp metal coming out of his hands (not his mutant power but a result os an expiriment on mutants. He likes Jean and says some \\"bad\\" and funny things to Cyclops. He has a painful past that Jean sees when she trys to read his mind.<br />Rogue: has the power to steal powers and life essences of others. She is very close to Wolvarine (a father-daughter relationship). She is very powerful and Magneto trys to use her for his evil plan, that could indeed destroy lives. She is around 16 and 17 years old.<br />Xavier: he is not important but he has some helpful powers and he helps the other characters in this movie. He also has some problems with Magneto.<br />The Evil Mutants: Magneto is the leader and with him, there are four of them. Some of them also have interesting powers (especially Mystic).<br />Buy it, enjoy it, watch it countless times. This is such a great movie.
0375703861|3.0|I think Zadie Smith is an incredibly talented writer, a knack for fleshing out quirky and believeable characters and writing funny turns of phrases but...<BR>the ending is a bit of sad neglected fluff, it seems as if she needed to end the book and that was that...the plot meandered and went basically nowwhere...<BR>I can't wait for her sophmore effort, one could only hope she will improve...
0553103547|5.0|... We now have a book with an author that know exactly what he wants to do in his story, and knows exactly how he is going to get there.  And I love that in this series there is no clear boundary between good and evil(a few exceptions).  For instance, a bad guy like The Hound, or Bronn the sellsword, can actually become likeable characters later on.  The story focuses on two families, The Starks(likeable) the Lannisters(spoiled rich little punks) and the tidings of war.  These families better get their acts together or their they will lose more than their honor when the Others cross the wall.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|As action films go,this is pretty good.Unpack your intelect at the door,suspend all rational and fact and truth on the coat hanger then sit down with your popcorn and watch this good-old-action film.The reason why i missed a star is because,again,the americans cannot face facts.This is proved in so many films where America is the center of all things exciting-1)All aliens visit America. 2)No matter what happens in history,the Americans did it.How would Americans feel if we in England produced a film depicting England sending up Apollo 13 full of british astronaughts,and the first man on the moon was a brit? I can tell you-outcry! Nothing wrong in altering the truth a little for the sake of entertainment,but as something as important as ww2,where brave Americans and British people (amonst other nations)lost their lives,too much altering to this degree is insulting!What next? America beats the Agentinians for the Falklands? course not,its too recent.Ok,less of the grumbling-yep,its a great boy's own adventure,and worth a peek!

0316666343|5.0|Not often do I pick up a book and say, \\"Wow, I've never read anything like this.\\"  Alice Seabold gives us a piece of literature that blossoms like a summer rose.  It buds.  The fragrance of her words permeate each page.  As you move from chapter to chapter the story blooms.  I'm reminded of Our Town and To Kill and Mockingbird.  The Lovely Bones will become a classic.
0553282980|3.0|We`d recomment the movie, but not the book. If you`re reading<BR>the book you don`t really get the most important situations and now they`re meant.<BR>Reading the book is so boring, that the story doesn`t really touch your soul.

0316666343|4.0|Narrated by a very intelligent fourteen-year-old, Susie Salmon, this story opens with her violent death in a cornfield at the hands of a quietly deranged man, George Harvey. She narrates the story from heaven, a place that continually changes as she matures and watches her family's struggles and accomplishments on earth. Reeling from the grisly crime and not having closure to their daughter's death, Susie's parents have a difficult time coming to terms with this situation, and as a result, their marriage and relationships with their other two children suffer. <br />This story is compassionately told, and the reader quickly feels close to Susie and her family. All of the characters in this small town are interesting and add their own flavor to this intriguing story. Although there's a sad undertone throughout, there are also hints of humor, hope, and love. At times, this was a difficult book to stomach, because of the gruesome nature of George Harvey's life. But overall, it was an excellent book with memorable characters and a masterful plot. It's a quick, mesmerizing read, that leaves you wanting to learn more about Susie's life in her heaven--a mysterious and very interesting place. I'd recommend this book for its unique perspective and its honest look at the effect death has on the people a deceased person leaves behind on earth.
B00000I07P|5.0|THIS CD IS JUST AWESOME! THE LOVE SONGS SUCH AS \\"WITHOUT LOVE\\", \\"I'D DIE FOR YOU\\", AND \\"NEVER SAY GOODBYE\\" ARE JUST THE BEST! LYRICS AND STYLE OF SONGS ARE GREAT! \\"LIVIN' ON A PRAYER\\" IS ANOTHER OF MY FAV. YOU JUST CAN'T HELP TO SING ALONG WITH THIS SONG. THERE'S NOT ONE SONG ON THIS CD THAT'S NOT WORTH PLAYING.
B00000DD35|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BON JOVI CDS! \\"BAD MEDICINE\\" IS DEFINITELY A SONG TO TURN UP! \\"I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU\\" IS ONE OF HIS BEST LOVE SONGS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAV. OF MINE. 3 GREAT ONES THAT I ALWAYS END UP PLAYING A LOT ARE \\"BORN TO BE MY BABY\\", \\"LIVING IN SIN\\", AND \\"WILD IS THE WIND\\". ALL OF THESE SONGS ABSOLUTELY MAKE THIS CD! THEIR ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS, THEIR UPS AND THEIR DOWNS. \\"WILD IS THE WIND\\" IS A REMARKABLE SONG. A GUY LOVED HIS GIRLFRIEND AND WANTED TO GIVE HER HIS ALL, BUT HIS ALL WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HER... IT'S TRULY A SONG TO PLAY OVER AND OVER. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THAT. I'VE LISTENED TO THIS CD HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND OF ALL THE BON JOVI ALBUMS I HAVE, THIS ONE PROBABLY IS THE #1 GREATEST.
0064407667|5.0|Lemony Snicket (scared already?!), weaves a masterful tale of strife and woe in the first in a series of unfortunate events.  This book is lushly presented in a deluxe hard cover with gloriously thick pages.  Don't be fooled, this story is not just for children - but anyone who loves a little sorrow and misfortune in their bedtime reading.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is another of those amazingly talented kids (Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton -- ok, she's in her 20s) who have released an excellent debut album recently, and who can definitely write, sing and play their own music.  At this point, I like Avril's album the best, although the others are great, also.<br />Sure, the lyrics show their age, but that's exactly what heartfelt lyrics SHOULD show.  So let's knock that criticism out of the way once and for all.  As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing negative to say here.<br />Like the others, Avril has an excellent sense of melody, harmony, and great hooks that are extremely addicting.<br />Unlike the others, Avril has a streetwise sense, not unlike Pink, which is well beyond her years.  You can see it in her eyes and feel it in her performances, and is one of the things that put her at the top of the list for me.<br />With the incredible talent we've been hearing from this trio, I think we have FINALLY passed the Britney and boy band phase.  God, I hope we have...<br />Can't wait to hear her evolve over the next 20 years!
B000002I77|5.0|Almost 30 years after &quot;Spectrum&quot; was recorded, there still seems to be a youthful interest in &quot;funk jazz&quot; and &quot;fusion&quot;; especially now that digital sampling has exploded into the music<BR>world and e-musicans are trying to create music that is both dancible and sonically interesting. Moreover, &quot;Spectrum&quot; almost serves as a &quot;how to manual&quot; for making tasteful music from these genres. It features some very good musicians in Cobham, Jan Hammer, Tommy Bolin, Joe Farrell, Ron Carter, and others. I highly recommend it along with Jeff Beck's &quot;Blow by Blow&quot;. Admittedly I rarely listen to either much anymore, but that tends to happen after a few hundred listens.
6303212379|5.0|This movie was the best movie I've ever seen! I watch it over and over again and I'm still not tired of it. It has a ton of action, comedy and adventure, along with really unique characters. Also, the kids actually act like-- kids. Not like those movies like \\"Hey Arnold\\" where the elementary school kids act like middle schoolers and the sixth-graders act like high- school gyps, and the little kids and adults are just babyish. Well, not in here-- the kids are just like real life kids, and the adults speak in intelligent sentences-- like real life adults. It's just as funny as it is exciting. It's a non-stop roller coaster ride all through the film-- even the conversations have a hiliarious touch to them. And Chunk is the most HILARIOUS kid I've seen all my life! In the scenes with the Fratellis I couldn't stop laughing! Especially where he says all those things about the bad moments that happened in his life ...! And I love that scream he does whenever he sees a corpse. <BR>My little sister loved it, too-- she loved the part where they play that skeleton piano thing. And she loved the part with the dead body in the freezer. I loved every bit of it. <BR>All in all, I recommend the Goonies to anyone who loves humor, adventure and fun-- all built into one movie. ...
B000062Y98|5.0|This is truly a great record , if you can relate to<BR>Rhapsody, Stratovarius and Nightwish - then you're close.<BR>But this CD takes it many steps further. <BR>It's epic,technically advanced and absolutely unmatched by<BR>anything in the genre. Some might dislike the lack of<BR>short, catchy melodies in the style that Blind Guardian made<BR>in the mid nineties - but they must admit that the incredible variety on this piece still is able to hold ground in ones<BR>memory.

The track &quot; Battlefield &quot; is simple awesome.<br />as for spoof-boy below and others ; there is no way in heaven or hell that you can compare Maiden ( which is a good H.M band )<BR>to Blind Guardian. Maiden is a 1960 Dodge and Blind Guardian<BR>is a space shuttle in terms of advance/refinement. This is<BR>absolutely over the top stunningly ; from guitar to<BR>drumming to keys and choir section - and I would<BR>guess that only a true power metal fan can appreciate<BR>all the shifts and beauty in this massive blend.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is one of the best and well thought up movies ever made. Daniel Radcliffe was terrific.<BR> The movie is about a boy who finds out he has magical powerers and gets sent to a school called hogwarts.

It was one of the films that got me started in collection asian cinema.<br />This movie is a must have for anyone who like martial arts films.<br />Oh, and for you Jackie Chan fans, Jackie is one of the unnamed henchmen in this film, I believe he is the one who dramatically gets his neck broken by Lee in the underground base.
B000023X9W|5.0|This is a perfect album.  Like most albums I have come to adore, the first time I heard it I thought &quot;uh, its ok&quot;.  Second time &quot;yeah, its got some good ones&quot;.  After that though, it all sank in and all made sense.  i've read reviews of this album that have said its boring (and if you're looking for a rockin' good time, it is), but what Mr Young has achieve with this recording is perfection in album craftsmanship.  The album flows just like a late night conversation with a long lost best freind; easy, understanding, mellow and, oh, so rewarding.<br />The album is in the same vain as the mellowest from 'Harvest', and 'After the Gold Rush', but with a clarity of retrospect that will hit you in such a nice way.  Every song has it's place and (just like 'Harvest') they are all arranged to perfection.<br />The first track ('Good to See You') picks you up with all the glee of in the world and the last ('Without Rings') will linger with you in a place so perfect, you don't need to hear any more (like a silence associated with perfect understanding where no words are required).<br />I hope this album is the last thing i ever hear.
B00004X01U|5.0|If this album was so bad as paople claimed it to be Madonna wouldn't have even had it realeased. She has millions of dollars anyways she wouldn't need to put out a new album if she didn't have to, but this album is definatly a winner.<BR>It's almost like the old Madonna from the 80s has returned which is a treat. Sure, the spiritual Madonna is pleasant and has good messages to the music, but this is the Madonna everyone remembers from the 80s. WELCOME BACK MADONNA. <br />On top of this techno flavoured Music, Madonna's voice has improved so much from the girlie sounding voice to a real woman's voice which helps to indentify her age.<br />For those of you who are easily impressed by britney or christina this is the woman who will blow you away.<BR>It's only right that Madonna has a song called Music let alone name her album after it because Madonna is the one who DEFINES music.<br />For you people who liked the spiritual Madonna don't be disappointed because WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL, I DESERVE IT NOBODYS PERFECT AND PARADISE(NOT FOR ME) still have the spiritual meanings and flavour to them. But this is mainly a dance albumand a damn good one at that. In my eyes WAY better than RAY OF LIGHT. GO MADONNA YEE-HAH.
0440180295|3.0|The ideas and themes of this book are excellent and well thought-out.  However, the manner in which they are presented leaves something to be desired.  This being an anti-war novel, much of the book consists of war anecdotes condemning any kind of killing whatsoever.  The fictional planet of Tralfamadore is also present, displaying another world where war is accepted as an unavoidable force, and is ultimately ignored in time.  This represents a good descrpition of this book's ideals.  When the main character, Blly Pilgrim, lives different parts of his life throughout the book, is where the novel takes a rather unappealing turn.  It seems we read too much of his later life, and what we read gives no representation of who Billy Pilgrim actually is.  As another reviewer points out, Billy is treated as a pawn, with no real personality.  And because this book unremittingly goes against killing off any sort of life, in any capacity, it seems that treating Pilgrim as just another life is inappropriate.  Overall, I wasn't totally pleased with the book, but would still reccomend it nonetheless.
B000002NJS|4.0|This is one of the first Madonna albums I listened to in my whole life.(Im 16) My aunt a really big Madonna fan leant me this album to listen to because she was always telling me odd things about Madonna and the 80s and i began to asked questions related to Madonna so she thought I would like LISTENING TO MADONNA. <br />Well the truth is I LOVED the album when she leant it to me, my favorites then were DROWNED WORLD, FROZEN AND RAY OF LIGHT and i listened to the whole album but those were still the best.<br />Later on in my school year is was planning to buy the album however it ended up my friend had it and wanted to trade it for my Janet Jackson VELVET ROPE. Well obviously we made the trade because i don't like Janet Jackson that much and still don't to this day because Madonna is still the Master of Music.<br />I began to listen to that album every day and loved it, and Madonna related this to her own personal life.<br />NOW you wonder why i gave it 4 STARS instead of FIVE. Well the truth is I like Madonna in all but there's fewer UPBEAT songs than quiet sort of spiritual songs. Don't get me wrong this album is a work of art and still known as her best album to date but lets just say if you lidten to it often you'll easily become bored with it like myself.<br />All in all a WORTHY purchase and recomended definatly to fans of &quot;LIKE A PRAYER.&quot; GOOD WORK MADONNA, EROTICA ALMOST BROKE YOU!(In my eyes it made you)
B00005JKJA|5.0|Remarkably beautiful and insanely true to life. This is quite possibly the best Lynch movie to date. The compositions alone took my breath away. . . David has once again raised the bar in the world of filmmaking. Most out there will be confused by the story as always the case, but if you have an open mind this one is quite a treat, and makes more sense than ever. It's extremely sad, but a must see. . .
B000002LND|5.0|Im only sixteen and ive owned this album when i was fifteen. Madonna today is often overlooked by Britney Spears Nsync and all that [bad] poppy [music].<BR>Madonna is the true queen of pop.<BR>I cannot add anything because all of the other review said it all. This artwork is a masterpiece that will never die in the eyes of true music.<br /> The album is broken down into five previous albums including the two bonus tracks (which is why this album still is better than GHV2) and two movie songs.
0380820846|5.0|Alas, Julia Quinn has finally done it.  \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\" is the forth book in the Bridgerton brother series.  It would, in my opinion, be the best so far.  I have read the book about Anthony, which I found boring, but it kept me enough to want to find out what happens to Daphane.  As it turns out, Daphane's book was more exciting than Anthony's story.  And of course, after reading about Daphane, Quinn left a cliff hanger that I could not resist.      The story of plain Penelope and one of the most well-known bachelor, Colin Bridgerton.      This forth book was everything I had wanted to be.  The dialogues between Colin and Penelope were great.  It was witty and funny.  It kept me on my toes of who the infamous Lady Whistletown is.   It brings in the former characters in previous books and brings in new characters that I have come to laugh at (Lady D).  This is a book with some sensuality in it.  I suggest fans of the Bridgerton series read this book.  It leaves me wanting to read more about Colin and Penelope. Good Job Ms. Quinn~!
B00005OAIE|5.0|While Mayer may sound similar to Dave Matthews in many respects, I would like to comment on the accusation of his lyrics being bland.  As a writer, I have found myself continuously inspired by Mayer's words, particularly in songs like 3X5, Your Body Is A Wonderland, Neon, and the hit single No Such Thing.  In a musical society where we hear the cliched phrase &quot;drive me crazy&quot; in every other song, Mayer is able to come up with fresh and easily flowing lines (&quot;Today the skies are painted colors of the cowboy cliche, and strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky are next to mountains anyway&quot;).  I was thoroughly impressed at his ingenuity and clarity, and it sparked me to buy the album, which is something I seldom do in an era where burning a copy saves a music-lover lots of cash.
0060934913|5.0|As a kitchen professional who has worked in many kitchens on both coasts, this is the first book that really tells it like it is. The rush of making through the night is almost as good as some of the drugs that AB used.<br />The most interesting parts were his discussions of the types of kitchens that exist (serious vs. hyperactive) and his advise to those who want to enter the field. I've worked in both types of kitchens and have always enjoyed the hyperactive ones. AS for his advise, it's right on the money.<br />A must read for those who really want to know what life in the kitchen is really about.
1573226521|3.0|This is a book you will finish very fast...it is like lord of the flies, but not as good of a story.  The build-up to the ending was not detailed enough to make it completely believeable.  Worth spending an evening reading this versus watching the movie.
0684867184|1.0|Dr. Ambrose crossed a line with this particular book. I think that he wrote with good intentions and does cover some interesting data (which is in his other books) about Lewis and Clark, Nixon, Eisenhower and others, however, the therapy sessions about his childhood and his brothers/father leaves much to be desired and should be included in a self-help section and not to be mixed up with Dr. Ambrose's more serious work.<br />This book is part autobiography, part psycho-sociological theory and part therapy session.  Dr. Ambrose, while certainly an interesting character, should have let someone else write this book after he is gone or should have saved the text about himself for his children. I listened to this on CD and found it laborious to get through. Hats off to the reviewers that actually read this monolog.  The fact that he sold this under the title &quot;Comrades&quot; so as to put a facade of value and a hint that it might be a scholarly work into relationships formed under fire is completely misleading. Although I appreciated his comments about friendship, a better title for this book might be &quot;me and my Dad and what I did on summer vacation&quot;.
6305736650|3.0|This movie is so overrated.  Bogart is better in the African Queen than in this movie.  The filming is not great, see 'On the Waterfront', 'The Third Man', 'Citizen Cane', or numerous others for great camera work.  The dialog is ok but there is better in other movies.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I've only been a fan of Britney since Baby One More Time, 99. And I still am today! I love her OOPS I DID IT AGAIN CD. I'm trying to get into other singers' music, cos I'm tired of hearing the same Celine music everyday. And Britney is a great singer, I found that out and I also found that she has great dance moves by watching her pepsi commercial(s). She has 3 pepsi commercials...! Although nobody likes her at my school, and hardly no one else in this world. Even my mom, doesn't like her cos of the way she dresses,bla bla doesn't matter to me, I like the way she dresses. I don't see why ppl have to be so mean to Britney!! Except for her fans are the only ones who like her. Like ME! :-) hehe. Anyways, back to the CD. I just love the songs, Stronger, Lucky, One Kiss From You, Don't let me be the last to know, when your eyes say it, and where are you now. So... if you like good POP music, then I suggest you buy Britney's release of Oops..! I Did It Again.
B000066NW0|5.0|It's 2002. A charismatic, tie-wearing, guitar-smashing 17-year old called Avril Lavigne turns up on MTV and people aren't quite sure what to make of her. Is she a stereotype, a teenage pop icon for the 21st century? A mere Britney with a guitar? Or is she full-on skater-punk, with genuine musical talent and a voice to match?<br />\\"Let Go\\", her debut album, clearly suggests the latter. In my view, its release comes at a time when many contemporary artists struggle to fill an album with anything more than mediocre material, most of which is unable to stand up next to the one or two stand-out tracks they have released as singles. Not Avril. An eclectic mix of pop, rock and punk, \\"Let Go\\" is clever, well written and sharp, and at no time does it show the all-too familiar signs of lack of imagination. Every song is worthy of release, meaning that the \\"skip\\" button on my CD player has become temporarily redundant! <br />The balance on \\"Let Go\\" is just perfect. Whilst the opening song, wailing rock track \\"Losing Grip\\", will send shivers up the spine of any self-respecting music fan, the guitar-driven \\"Sk8r Boi\\" (somewhat reminiscent of No Doubt in their bizarre `Return of Saturn' days) will have them singing along and smiling at the simplicity of it's hidden message. The incredibly catchy \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" sees Avril yearning for the simple things in life, such as marriage, whilst the equally infectious \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" documents her desire to stand out from the crowd and live life to the fullest. Although it is inappropriate to attempt to generalise such a topically diverse collection of songs, I am still going to try. \\"Let Go\\" is all about living, loving, about having fun and, most importantly, about being yourself. This is perhaps most aptly illustrated by the witty and captivating debut single, \\"Complicated\\", and my personal favourite, the particularly likeable \\"My World\\".  It all draws to a close with two brilliantly written songs: the haunting \\"Too MuchTo Ask\\" and the emotive \\"Naked\\", and there you have it - an album that is different, moving and great fun to listen to. <br />Hardcore punk \\"Let Go\\" is not. But there is no question that Avril Lavigne is bound to become idol to thousands of teenaged skater-punks searching for a tune as well as a message amongst all that noise. Flawless.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Ahh, this CD is totally the best of Shakira. I love it! My favorite songs are Underneathe Your Clothes, and Whenever, Wherever... Buy this album today! It's worth every read cent!
B00005QG9J|5.0|As soon as i bought this cd i loved it. it has a great mixture of styles. some songs are slow and others are hard and there are some that are in between slow and hard. some of the best songs are nice to know you, wish you were here, under my umbrella, just a phase, and warning. but all the other songs are very good too. if you like groups like creed and bush you'll love this cd. so go out and buy it you won't be sorry.

1573225517|4.0|High Fidelity is a book that makes you smile, if you can identify yourself with the main character Rob in some ways. Maybe that identifying makes it easier to understand (if your native language is not Englisch).<BR>It`s very funny and interesting to read because it is written with  the typical British sense of humour. And often you can find a pleasant ironic aftertaste.<BR>Dick and Barry, the two guys who work together with Rob and who are his best friends, are two crazy characters. They behave in a more crazy way than Rob does.<BR>The music fits to the plot and to Rob's mood (it plays a central role). It explains him: blues and soul! So this guy often expresses his feelings while he uses music.<BR>At the beginning, I really hated this book and I did not want to go on because I hated the way he describes himself, his behavior. But as I thought about Rob's story and relationship, I started to like it very much.<BR>Rob has a \\"top five\\"- list for every situation, every girlfriend and his favourite musicians and songs. That makes the story quite interesting! It even shows how crazy this guy is. <BR>All in all it is written in a very great and funny way but there are chapters, too that are very serious. I think that the important things of life are expressed funnily and maybe exactly...
B00000J7RZ|5.0|J.LO's debut album, On the 6 is truely the best debut album that she released. I love her music!!! Her song Waiting For Tonight is the main reason I wanted to get this CD, cos it was my favorite song, by J.LO and still is! ... Anyhow, I urge you all to buy this CD. All songs are worth hearing! J.LO ROCKS.
0394492196|5.0|I?m a longtime Le Carr fan, but I realized recently that it had been nearly two decades since I read what is undoubtedly his best work -- the Smiley trilogy. Based loosely on the Kim Philby debacle, this one is about the realization that a Soviet mole has been busy for many years in the Circus -- the headquarters of the British espionage service -- and the recently sacked George Smiley, a victim himself of the mole?s machinations, is secretly brought in by a reluctant Whitehall to identify the culprit and clean house. It?s the old problem: Who will spy on the spies? Le Carr  is a master of the telling detail, even with minor supporting characters, and all the inhabitants of this novel are vividly realized. This isn?t a James Bond yarn, either, as the ?action? is mostly in the form of reading files, interviewing agents, and hard thinking. And Smiley, fat, middle-aged, and in secret agonies over his wife?s habitual infidelity, turns out to possess unexpectedly heroic stature. This novel, and the two that follow, make up the best spy story ever written in English.
B00005BKZJ|2.0|you know the story from the other reviewers..i had wanted to watch this for some time and finally did.  to my surprise, there is no story, only quirky characters coming together; as if....and i have lived in the desert as well as odd locations....yes, they become friends, and yes strange locations made for unusual friends, but this was a very long and uninteresting movie with the exception of the scenery.  save your time and spend it with your family.
B0000009OP|5.0|Dark, swinging and strangely happy underneath it all, Cure for Pain is an album on which every track is great. Each track works together and contributes to a larger whole. When it was new, I drank scotch and listened to it in my first-ever apartment; years later, the album still has the ability to make me feel oh-so-cosmopolitan. Highly recommended.
0066620694|4.0|Clayton Christensen finds an answer that many people have been looking for.  Why is it that big companies always seem to miss the wave for the next big thing in their business?  Why did IBM miss the minicomputer invasion?  Why did DEC miss the PC wave?  His answer seems simple but yet rings true.  The correct way for companies to handle sustaining technologies will cause them to fail when they meet what he calls disruptive technologies.  The right way to conduct business will cause them to miss the wave.  The author gives many empirical examples to justify his theory and then gives ideas for how to avoid the trap.  He also gives examples of companies who followed his advice and survived.<br />  The only question I was left with was how to determine if a new technology is disruptive or worthless?  Christensen describes how to behave once you have identified a disruptive technology but not how to identify it.  Still, this book is a must read for anyone who works at a big company.
B00000I3JD|5.0|Lauryn Hill is a genius and her music is a true reflection of this. Her album is a unique collection of surreal soul, distinguished by unrivalled lyrical craftmanship and surely the predominant reason we have ears. Ex-factor is healer and a killer. Owning this CD is a privilege(how else can you describe that &quot;lauryn feeling&quot;?)
B00005B36H|5.0|If you can appreciate art, or any kind of music for that matter, and you are an intelligent person you will love this album, even if not on your first listen. But even on your first listen it will be a journey unlike what you will ever experience in listening to other music.
0312955006|5.0|THE CONCRETE BLONDE is the third tale in Michael Connelley's Harry Bosch series. Four years ago, Harry shot and killed the man he believed was an L.A. serial killer nicknamed \\"The Dollmaker\\". Now, the man's widow and her high-powered lawyer are suing Harry and the LAPD for wrongful death. Just as the case opens in court, a new murder victim with all the characteristics of a \\"Dollmaker\\" kill turns up embedded in concrete. The location of the body has been tipped off by a note and the body is definitely not four years old. Did Harry shoot the wrong man?<br />This is another great story by Connelly. It's a page-turner and keeps you guessing right to the end. If gritty, contemporary mysteries are your forte, you've got to read this. In fact, I recommend it highly to anyone who isn't put off by the graphic realism of the details. Connelly has proved himself as a first-rate writer in this genre. His books are top-notch and this one is no exception. Buy a copy and get comfortable, because you won't want to put it down.
0385505833|4.0|In SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, author John Grisham abandons his usual storyline about lawyers in distress in favor of a short, comic, yuletide fable concerning social mores and pressures, and the hazards inherent to ignoring them.<br />Now that their daughter has flown the coop for Peru on a Peace Corps mission, Luther and Nora Krank are left to contemplate the imminent Christmas holidays on their own. A Scrooge in the making for some time, Luther finally snaps after calculating that the last Yule Season cost him a whopping sixty-one hundred dollars. With Nora's reluctant agreement, he decides that this year there'll be no tree, cards, gifts, party, charitable giving, or lawn displays. Only a cruise to the Caribbean. Bah humbug!<br />The going gets tough and the tough get going as the Kranks turn away the Boy Scouts selling Christmas trees, the police taking donations for a toys-for-deprived-tots campaign, and the firemen and medics selling fruitcakes to fund another of the same. Most antisocial of all is their decision not to mount an illuminated Frosty figure on the roof, something that all other residents along Hemlock Street do in the hope winning the local award for best street decoration. Talk about peer pressure! Despite much skeptical and disapproving shaking of heads by neighbors and co-workers, the Kranks actually appear to be on the brink of pulling it off, including losing weight and acquiring a tanning salon bronze in preparation for the lazy days aboard ship. Then comes the disastrous phone call on Christmas Eve morning.<br />Luther is a 54-year old apprentice curmudgeon. At 53, I can relate to the man's disenchantment with the Holiday Season, and would myself drop out of the festive occasion if my Better Half would let me get away with it. (Ha, fat chance!) In any case, I was cheering Luther on every step of his perilous way. Having betrayed my bias in the matter, the book's ending still satisfactorily illustrates the value of the support network presumably found in some long-established urban neighborhoods.<br />SKIPPING CHRISTMAS would, I think, make a terrific movie, perhaps starring Michael Keaton and Frances McDormand. My chief objection to the book is the big hardback price for a very small volume, which can be read in a couple of hours even by the most lethargic of readers. A better value would be to buy it used.found in some long-established urban neighborhoods. <br />SKIPPING CHRISTMAS would, I think, make a terrific movie, perhaps starring Michael Keaton and Frances McDormand.

0800141660|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in a while, but I want to buy it for my collection because I know that it is one I will want to watch again and again. It is a great love story.
0790729725|5.0|Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that this DVD leaves something to be desired. Much lesser films have been given the gift box treatment, and the 10th anniversary of this epic work came and went without so much as an upgrade with some extras. However, I cannot say enough about how much I love this film. I wish I could return to the autumn of 1990 and see it for the first time all over again. Such exquisite storytelling! Such compelling acting and brilliant dialogue! And what an OUTRAGE that it was not handed best film and best director oscars on a silver platter instead of a very good but very inferior \\"Dances With Wolves\\"! Deniro and Pesci deliver some of their best work ever, and all of the bit players who fill out the \\"crew\\" are just perfect. The settings - the cheesy nightclubs with the tacky decor, the even tackier Hill home in the 70s (\\"Watch the wall with the rock\\"), the music - you hear George Harrison's \\"What is Life\\" during the cocaine-fueled copter chase and it works - the frantic editing, all of it clicks perfectly. What's sad is the realization that Scorese will probably never be able to top it, though I have my fingers crossed. This is, to me, the best movie made in the last 20 years and surely one of the best ever made, and AFI should have placed it in the all-time top 10!
0312265859|4.0|My good friend Stephanie Plum is back, and I missed her. Despite some who may say that she is getting predictable, I still love her.  The Burg is a familar place I can return to, where the characters are loveable and laughable. The bad guys got a little more creative in this story with the homicidal bunny, and I enjoyed Ranger's more up front role in this story.  The expansion of the standard plot to parental kidnapping was believable, but the final resolution of the mystery left me disappointed in its simplicity and, in my mind, lame motive. But Stephanie's insecurites and antics still made the trip worthwhile.
B00005MP58|5.0|Whether you love Jane Austen or have never heard of her before, this movie is sure to delight and entice.  The dialogue from the book was painstakingly created with brilliant characterization from the actors.  <br />I've seen the famous Sir Lawrence Olivier play Mr. Darcy but (I hate to admit this) his portrayal pales in comparison to Colin Firth's.  Perhaps it was the superior handling of the material or the excellent directing; nevertheless, every nuance and change in Mr. Darcy's character is captured eloquently by Firth. Jennifer Ehle was also a delight as Elizabeth Bennett. She gave life to the wit and fire of Lizzie.<br />I highly recommend this dvd.  Of my family and friends who've seen it they all loved it.  Believe me, when you see it it does not feel like 6 hours at all.
B000051ZST|3.0|Road Trip, while having quite a handful of hilarious scenes and being entertaining leaves me a bit lukewarm mainly because of the basic premise of the movie...<br />THE STORY:<br />Josh (Breckin Meyer) succumbs to temptation and has a one-night stand with a lovely classmate who's had the hots for him, Beth (Amy Smart), an encounter that they taped.  When Josh's sex tape is accidentally mailed to his near lifelong girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), Josh and his posse of dorm buddies (lech E.L., nerd Kyle and stoner Rubin) pack up for a Road Trip to intercept the tape before Tiffany receives it.<br />THE ANALYSIS:<br />The movie is full of humorous (and some quite disturbing) moments.  The clear star of the movie for me was Seann \\"Stifler\\" William Scott who portrayed Josh's best bud E.L. who single-handedly had THE BEST SCENE in the movie at the \\"donor clinic.\\"  The humor value is right up there with most other movies in the \\"teen comedy\\" genre as of late, ...<br />The main problem that I have with the movie though is actually the basic plot of the movie.  Call me old-fashioned but I find it disturbing that the movie is basically about a guy who cheats on his girlfriend and goes to ANY and ALL lengths (including using and abusing a \\"friend\\" to aid him, lying, stealing, etc.) to cover his tracks.  It further bothers me that he actually has friends willing to back him up on it.<br />Equally disturbing was Tom Green's character and his maniacal obsession with killing mice.  Where's the humor/entertainment value in that???<br />Aside from those two criticism's the movie was pretty funny and entertaining.  The many misadventures that the crew encounters as they travel from Ithaca, NY to Austin, Texas are pretty hilarious and should keep you laughing and amused.<br />...THE VERDICT:<br />Again, the film was hilarious and entertaining ..., but still the overall plot and Tom Green's character may leave you with a bit of a bad taste...<br />(Mildly) Recommended
B00000DFSK|4.0|I bought this album about a month ago now and since then I have never looked back. My version doesn't include the B-Sides but I still feel that this holds a high place amongst the rest of my CD collection. I have been a fan of U2 for a while now but really hadn't heard much of their stuff passed the obvious singles that they play on the Radio. Although I feel that When Love Comes To town is a unworthy entry in this collection (They could have maybe included Gloria or Bullet The Blue Sky) the rest of the album is pure class, except for I will Follow but I realise that they had to include something from Boy.<BR>Heres a rundown<BR>1. Pride (I The Name Of Love) - *** A distintive ring at the start but I feel that this song lacks some of the classic U2 atmosphere<BR>2. New Years Day - **** A very moody piece that make me feel all types of emotion<BR>3. With Or Without You - ***** The Greatest U2 song and one of my favourite all time songs. This song has a passion that U2 have yet the recreate to the same extent<BR>4. Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - ***** Another Classic. Not as powerful as With Or Without You but still holds it own nevertheless<BR>5.Sunday Bloody Sunday - ***** The landmark U2 protest. Bono displays all areas of his voice and the whole band pull it off in style<BR>6. Bad - **** A song I hadn't heared before but was instantly smitten with. Bono voices crawls right into your heart when he lets loose on \\"I'm Wide Awake\\"<BR>7. Where The Streets HAve No Name - **** Possibly U2's most popular song but I feel that it gets a little to repetitive. I love the intro however<BR>8.I Will Follow - ** A disaster in my opinion. But they had to include something from Boy I guess<BR>9. The Unforgettable Fire - *** Good atmosphere and feels almost Symphony Driven<BR>10. The Sweetest Thing - **** A catchy number. Short and Sweet<BR>11. Desire - *** Good but I dislike the chorus. Proberly had to be in this album for its reputation.<BR>12. When Love Comes To Town -** Whoever make the decision to record a single with BB King made a big mistake. Two clashing styles result in a mess. This one could have been dropped.<BR>13. Angel Of Harlem - **** I love the horn parts and the whole song almost has a sort of christams feel to it.<BR>14. All I Want Is You - ***** A hidden masterpiece. I didn't expect such a simple song to have such an affect on me. I could listen to this song for hours on end and wouldn't get tired of it. I'm not sure what it is about it but one day I'm sure I'll know.(Keep listening past the end of this one)<br />In a whole this album in a excellant investment for a diehard U2 fan or newcomer
1573225517|2.0|The book \\"High Fidelity\\" is about a guy called Rob, who talkes about his girlfriends and ex-girlfriends through the whole book. It's also a little bit philosophical, because he talks about death.<BR>I didn't like the book very much, because there's only a simple, short plot, and a lot of thinking passages. The story wasn't that interesting, but Rob's attitude towards and thoughts about philosophical themes were sometimes really interesting. <BR>Because these good and boring passages exchange I would give the book two stars.<br />**

You will gladly remain under arrest until you're through with the last page. Very few books generate such electromagnetic induction.<BR>Emotive, exuberant, and exhilarating, \\"Long Walk To Freedom\\" is a story of victory: triumph over hardship; over fear; and over man-inhumanity-to-man. It is a mirror through which a generation viewed their world.
6305127689|5.0|I love this movie.  It stars Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis.  The story is about Maverick (Tom Cruise) going to The Top Gun School and falling in love with Charlie (Kelly McGillis).  This movie was released on the 16th of May 1986 and it grossed 176 million dollars, It was the Top movie of 1986.  The DVD however is pretty bad, there are no extras and the translation to Widescreen sounds bad but the screen quality is good.  I think they should come out with a much better version with deleted scenes and Music Videos etc.  Buy this if you love Top Gun but write to the studios for a better version.
B0000062Y2|3.0|If I could, I would give this recording 2 and a half stars, but that option isn't available. 2 stars seems too low and yet three stars seems too high. This  Jesus Christ Superstar (of the many) is the 1973 movie soundtrack. Bluntly, it kinda [stinks] Like the some of the other reviewers, I admire the originality of it, becuase Norman Jewison is an excellent director, but many things are wrong with it. First of all, there was absolutely no need to add EXTRA \\"dramatic\\" music to the score. And absolutely no reason at all to add the stupid, boring song \\"We Are Decided\\", which can only be found on this movie recording (as evidence that everybody else thought the song [stunk] too). Ted Neeley as Jesus is raspy, doesn't have that great of a voice, doesn't take many risks with his voice and talks his lines way too much. And the sound quality of this recording is just terrible. It sounds like everything is through a tin can covered by a sock. The original Broadway version from 1972 has better sound quality (though not better over all). Peter, though a very small role, didn't give any emotion to the music at all and just kinda sings it, and not all that well at that. Some songs just lack all emotion and sound really BAD. Such as \\"Trial Before Pilate\\", \\"Peter's Denial\\", and \\"Then We Are Decided\\". But there are some good things to this (thus earning it it's three stars). Carl Anderson as Judas is just awesome! He really doesn't deserve to be in this recording. He deserves to be in better. His intensity gives so much life to the role and his voice is just awesome. Sometimes it doesn't seem like he even struggles with notes like high B's. Yvonne Elliman is a nice, neutral Mary. Though not all that emotional, a good mix of everything. Barry Dennen wasn't as good as he usually is as Pilate, and was kinda weird in this reording (he is also Pilate in the concept album, 1970, and the original Broadway, 1972). Larry T. Marshall as Simon is hysterical in the movie, and that kinda comes across in the music, so he is an okay choice. Overall, though, it isn't one that I really can enjoy all that much. If you are looking for a good example of 70's music in theatre and stuff, this is a good recording. Buit don't judge the wonderful musical Jesus Christ Superstar by this recording. It has no \\"umph\\" to it besides the wonderful Judas. But he alone cannot save this.across in the music, so he is an okay choice. Overall, though, it isn't one that I really can enjoy all that much. If you are looking for a good example of 70's music in theatre and stuff, this is a good recording.

B00005QIPH|1.0|The Strokes is the worst band since The Beatles. The music is really slow and POP, dont buy it, or ill be sorry.
B000056VJ7|1.0|I was really disappointed. I wanted the EXACT same album I had on my cassette. However, they messed it up by putting some new cuts on it and they had terrible themes that I found really distasteful.<br />The first Bat Out of Hell is one of my all time favorites, so needless to say, I was not happy.
6305090564|5.0|never can stop bragging about this movie.  what a damn good movie!  has one of the coolest creatures of all time in a movie in my opinion too.  great acting and one of the most entertaining films of all time.  one of my fav.<BR>if you havn't seen this one then your definitely missing out!
0312243022|5.0|The Hours is delicious, exhilarating &amp; heartbreaking all at the same time.  Easily, the best book I've read in a very long time.  Mr. Cunningham, you're a master.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Anthony Hopkins exudes creepyness in this sequel. While not superior to Lambs in the storyline department, it's better directed. Ridley Scott really knows how to direct a flick. Julianne Moore's Clarice is good. The story is good but it's Hopkins show, he moves his character from villan to anti-hero.
B000066C6Z|5.0|The best genre spoof of all time!  The jokes and sight gags are even funnier and more clever than the ones in \\"Airplane\\" (the bookshop scene, the underwater saloon barfight, etc.)...
B000068IEU|3.0|This is a flick that ranks up there with \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" and \\"Kids\\". While the two movies I just mentioned were in completely different genres of film. And are two far superior flicks, they all do the same thing. They scare you. But they don't scare you with shocks and boogeymen, they scare you by showing the [messed] up things humans are capable of doing.<br />This film is scary because it looks too real. It's a warning to people, don't trust anyone. The 2 girls go to some guys house to buy some smoke. They get kidnapped, raped, tortured, and it's a mess from there.<br />In regards to the way the film looked, some say sloppy, amaturish, the filming looks just like \\"The Evil Dead.\\" But the gore effects in this movie look real. The film is really violent. I think Wes Craven knew this when he was making the film, thats why hecut the violent scenes with stupid ones about two bumbling cops. The comedic interludes don't work because you are still reeling from the scenes of violence that preceded them.<br />I think you have to be disturbed to find this flick boring, stupid, or funny. It's not. It shows that there are people out there you a completely {messed] up.<br />Can this movie be viewed over and over? I really don't think so. This DVD is pretty much for the completest horror fans who need every \\"Good\\" horror DVD in their collection. But then again the... price tag won't break your bank. Buy it, watch it once and place it next to your copy of \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\"
B00003CXTF|2.0|Maybe I'm missing something, but I felt as though Pearl Harbor was totally overrated. It was filled with a cheesy love subplot (if you want to go see a recent love movie this long, go rent Titanic) that was so cliche that I couldn't believe it was actually not editted from the movie. I was hoping to see a movie that dealt with the Pearl Harbor incident and didn't focus so much on relationships and love, but what should I expect with a &quot;blockbuster&quot; hit that Hollywood produces. Some of the points in the plot, particularily towards the end (don't want to give anything away) were so unrealistic that it almost seemed comical.I'm not knocking movies that deal with relationships because I do like them, but this movie was really a boring movie. There are many movies that never make it to the show that are far better in realism and expression than this. It's just another Hollywood attempt to throw some big stars on screen and cash in some bucks. Well it worked; too bad the movie didn't.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T.... I remember my first encounter with this little alien. I was two years old at the time and I was at Universal Studios Florida and my mom took me on E.T. Adventure. After the ride, I was scared to death by any sight of E.T. But, finally in the year 2002, I mustured up my strength and saw E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial:The 20th Anniversery...And I was awe-stircken, dazzled, razzled, and nervous when I saw one of the best movies ever made. I couldn't get enough of the little thing, I got the Pez and everything! The plot is entrancing, the actors belivability was incredible throughout the entire film. I'm surprised they didn't go off to do bigger and better and things in their life(excluding Drew Barrymore). Thanks to Steven Speilberg, his creation became an enormous masterpiece that most of the world could enjoy anywhere and anytime.My grade:A+ because of the phenominal acting, the irrestibal alien character, the extraordinray director, and a grat script! Little known fact: Original working title for E.T. was A Boy's Life(Don't ask me why).
B00005V1Z5|3.0|Okay, this wasn't a very good movie, I'll admit. However, I still feel that Ben Stiller's humor is enough to catapolt this up to at least 3 stars. The humor is a little ...well...stupid, but most comedies are. If you like break dance fighting and Frankie goes to Hollywood, this might be for you.  The humor comes in making fun of the fashion industry and Hollywood, and I'm all for that.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD perfectly fit me, and I think the songs relate to most people.  I haven't listened to any other CD since I bought this.  Here's a breakdown of the songs:<BR>Losing Grip- an angry and fast paced start.  I love to get lost in this song<BR>Complicated- the popular single.  After two times, I loved this song and had memorized the lyrics.<BR>Sk8er Boi- a light-hearted song that will make you believe in karma<BR>I'm With You- a soft, lonely song.  I love this song.  Enough said.<BR>Mobile- an upbeat tale.  I like the feeling of independence.<BR>Unwanted- another amazing angry song.  This is for anypne who has been the victim of unrequited love.<BR>Tomorrow- sorrowful yet hopeful song.  I think this is about a cheating boyfriend.  It's good.<BR>Anything But Ordinary- a cry to be unique.  This song described what I want from my life.<BR>Things I'll Never Say- a song about unspoken love.  I love this because I also can never disclose my crushes.<BR>My World- a self defining ode. Let's you into her world, like the title says.<BR>Nobody's Fool- rebellion at its best.  Warning: after listening to this, you may not  be able to compromise.<BR>Too Much Too Ask- story of a soul that couldn't be saved.  Again, a song from my life.<BR>Naked- someonebreaks the hard exterior.  After all the anger and frustration, you go full circle and hear about meeting someone who makes you unable hide or pretend.<BR>Happy listening!

B000068QY7|5.0|Oasis have been on the American musical backburner since 1995. However, with the release of Heathen Chemistry, Oasis may be headed for a musical Rennaisance. With Standout tracks like &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; and &quot;The Hindu Times&quot;, Oasis may be able to recapture some of their past glory in America. The album as a whole is incredibly solid- ranging from pop, to classic rock, to acoustic, even touching a bit on folk at times. The best songs, however, come from an unlikely source- Liam Gallagher. Liam's second songwriting outing proved to be for the better, displaying talent no one could have ever expected. &quot;Songbird&quot; is love as simply put as you can, &quot;Better Man&quot; is a groove that seems almost out of character for Liam, and &quot;Born on a Different Cloud&quot; sounds as if Liam was summoning the ghost of John Lennon for one more song. Overall, Heathen Chemistry is an album you can't afford to miss. If you have ever longed for better music, this is the best place to look.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this album. It is great driving music.

B000068QVN|5.0|Back in the 70's Grand Funk Railroad was a favorite.  They were a favorite of the fans who universally loved them, they were a favorite target of the critics who consistently berated them.  Some facts stand for themselves, though. Facts such as their record-breaking sold out performance at Shea Stadium and their string of gold and platinum selling recordings.  But how could a band be simultaneously loved by fans and hated by critics?  The answer lies in their live performances. Grand Funk was (and is) first and foremost a live band.  Critics who reviewed them based on their studio recordings and who never attended a live show have no clue what this band is about.  They are about raw, gut wrenching power and spine tingling emotion.  Like no other band in history, Grand Funk connects with an audience and draws them into the music.  The band feeds off the energy from the crowd, takes it in, amplifies it ten-fold, and gives it back through the music only to begin the cycle again.  This isn't the sort of thing that can be evaluated and appreciated over headphones from the recliner in your den, it has to be experienced live.  There simply is no other way.  Undoubtedly, the critics who never 'got it' back in the early days will not 'get it' now any more than they did then.  For those of us who have loved Grand Funk since the very beginning in 1969, 'Live: The 1971 Tour' is a tribute to the live experience.  For those of us who don't now and who never have needed anyone else to explain to us what we should and should not enjoy in our music, this recording comes closer to capturing the power and emotion of Grand Funk Railroad live than has any previous recording.  David Tedds and his partners have done a tremendous job in applying current technology to the circa 1971 master tapes.  This is not a CD to be played softly while sipping a glass of iced tea.  This CD is meant to be played LOUD - lease-breaking shake-the-pictures-on-the-wall set-off-your-neighbors-car-alarm LOUD.You'll have tears in your eyes if you ever were a Grand Funk Railroad fan.  If you don't, then you may never understand.
6304698658|5.0|Every Christmas Eve I put the presents under the tree, straighten the stockings, and never forget to watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswald and gives his funniest performance yet.  Beverly D'Angelo is also back as Ellen, and not to mention Randy Quaid has also returned to play good old Uncle Eddy.  This movie will have you laughing the whole time.  The DVD could have a better selection of extra's but trust me, the movie is satisfying enough. <br />What makes this movie different from the rest of the Vacation movies is the fact that the Griswalds don't actually take a vacation.  Instead they stay home and invite the in-laws to join them for the holidays.  One of the greatest moments in the movie would have to be when Eddy kidnaps Clark's boss to fufill Clark's Christmas wish.  <br />Forget &quot;The Santa Clause&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, and &quot;A Miracle on 34th Street&quot;.  Christmas Vacation is the new Christmas DVD classic!
0452282152|5.0|All I can say is...Wow!  Girl With a Pearl Earring is a positively stunning novel, and one that I will remember for a long time to come.  The historical detail quickly pulls the reader into another world, and the sparkling prose breathes new life into artist Johannes Vermeer, his family and most especially Griet, the girl hired as maid to the Vermeer household.<br />Set in 17th century Delft, Girl With a Pearl Earring begins with 16-year-old Griet chopping vegetables in her mother's kitchen.  Griet's family has fallen on some hardships, and her mother has informed her she is to become a maid in order to help support them.  Vermeer and his wife, Catharina, agree that Griet will make a fine maid, and with that quick decision comes a fate that Griet could have never imagined...a world of color and symmetry, secrets and passions, and one in which could spell her ruin.<br />Author Tracy Chevalier has created a magnificient fictional account about what could have been, the inspiration behind one of Vermeer's most celebrated works.  Truly a masterpiece and one history, romance and art lovers will enjoy.  Girl With a Pearl Earring starts as a fever and rises and flourishes with each turning page.  I highly recommend this beautiful, eloquent, evocative tale.  Readers will find themselves lost in the world of Vermeer and Griet; this atmospheric novel will have nothing less to offer.
B000002UA9|5.0|This is a great album, and a terrific first effort.<br />Some of the songs are not The Beatles' best: There's A Place and Misery are aptly named, I think! But there are some great originals here, including the attention-getting I Saw Her Standing There which opens the album, Please, Please Me and Ask Me Why.<br />The covers are all good:<br />Lennon's simple performance of Arthur Alexander's Anna<br />A charming rendition of Burt Bacharach's Baby, It's You<br />The Goffin-King song Chains is sung in perfect 3 part harmony<br />Ringo gives a rousing rendition of Boys, first recorded by The Shirelles.<br />The Beatles' distinctive version of  Twist and Shout closes the album as arrestingly as it was opened.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Ok Resident Evil has been poorly rated.. and this has me confused. Overall I think that this movie deserved 5 stars. It had everything, espically two very beautiful lead characters Michelle Rodriguez(Girlfight, The Fast and The Furious, Blue Crush) and Milla Jovovich(The Fifth Element, Dazed and Confused, The Million Doller Hotel.) who are I think perfect for the parts of this move... Buy this movie!  <BR>Hope This Helps
B000002UAF|5.0|Seven great performances from John Lennon: <BR>A Hard Day's Night<BR>I Should Have Known Better<BR>If I Fell<BR>Tell Me Why<BR>Any Time At All<BR>You Can't do That<BR>I'll Be Back<br />McCartney also has 3 terrific solos:<BR>And I Love Her<BR>Can't Buy Me Love<BR>Things We Said Today<br />There is. of course, some great vocal harmony supporting these songs.<br />In this album, both Lennon and McCartney have given us some interesting songs which waver between minor and major tonalities:<BR>And I Love Her and If I Fell begin minor, but end up major. However the McCartney song Things We Said Today and the Lennon song I'll Be Back hover intriguingly between minor and major  keys throughout.<br />Tell Me Why may be one of the most jazz-influenced Beatles song: the chords and melody owe quite a bit to that genre. Can't Buy Me Love also has a jazzy tinge.<br />Acoustic guitars [including the 12 stringed variety] are prominent and sound terrific.<br />Highly recommended
B00005OWEG|5.0|Besides the extra footage, there should be more extras on this disc! Where's the \\"making of\\" featurette??? That would've made this DVD absolutely wonderful. I've seen it before, and needless to say that it adds such a broader perspective to the film.<br />The extra footage...nothing to write home about. It adds little to the story, and detracts more than it helps. The guy who did the editing on the cutting room floor was a genius.  Though seeing the French Plantation scene was a bit interesting. It added a perspective of Vietnam that wasn't there before in the previous cut of the film or in other Vietnam films. It's still a great movie though.
B000002UAC|5.0|Obviously modelled on the first album [compare the opening and closing songs of each], With The Beatles begins with a bang and contains some excellent songs, but also a few duds. The opener, It Won't Be Long, has a great Lennon vocal, and a subtle countermelody. But Don't Bother Me is only interesting because it is the first recorded Harrison song [if you exclude the terrific McCartney-Harrison instrumental Cry For A Shadow]. I Wanna Be Your Man has vitality, but not much else.<br />Hold Me Tight is more interesting, and features an unusual chord progression, but in places it sounds a bit desafinado ... slightly out of tune! Not Paul's best vocal effort. But all is forgiven with the acoustic, tender version of Meredith Willson's Till There Was You. Paul's vocal is terrific, as is the subtle arrangement and guitar solo. <br />All My Loving contains the first of many interesting McCartney bass lines. <br />This album contains more great covers, including Smokey Robinson's You Really Got A Hold On Me. I never tire of listening to the raw singing in 4ths!<br />George Harrison gives us a stirring version of Chuck Berry's Roll Over Beethoven, rivalling its creator's own original.<br />Please Mister Postman and Money give us John at his raucous best.<br />Highly recommended
0380820846|4.0|While this book is as well written as all of the &quot;Bridgerton&quot; series, it lacks the &quot;momentum event&quot; that propells the others (that is, a couple suddenly thrown together under exciting and/or mysterious circumstances).  It's a straight-forward, &quot;he-finally-notices-she&quot; romance, and it takes a good fifty pages to warm up and get moving.  If you already know these characters, you'll find those first few pages tedious.  Apart from that, I can't fault the quality of the book - Julia Quinn's are the most reliably well-written romances I buy.  I purchased this the day it came out: and I look forward to Eloise Bridgerton's romance, which comes next in the series. She is, potentially, a much more dynamic heroine than Penelope, featured here.  Penelope's long-unrequited love for Colin Bridgerton and submission to the put-downs and manipulation by her mother frankly, make her come across as a bit of a doormat/drip and is inconsistent with the otherwise clever and intelligence aspects of her nature.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|I've owned this CD for about  4 months now, and I still can't get enough of it! Starting with David Bowie's mysterious and intriguing song &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, and ending with an Indian remixed song with Nicole Kidman in &quot;Hindi Diamonds&quot;, it feels like you are experiencing the movie all over again! You can sense the richness and intensity of the movie in one CD! If you like the movie, I guarantee you will love the Moulin Rouge Soundtrack!
0767817478|5.0|Underated flick which recalls not only the original Gojira54 movie in certain scenes, but 50's monster movies in general, one of which was the inspiration to the Japanese Gojira. The creature is one of the most detailed monster creations in recent memory. Fast paced, good action set pieces, and shot with a nice pulp-noir look.
B000003TAB|5.0|With NEVERmind getting too big for me, incesticide is the best nirvana cd out there, sliver, mollys lips, mexican seafood, son of a gun, dive, I mean the songs are so awesome its underated and thats fine with me, i used to like nevermind to the core but i think the lighhearted feel of this album can be greatly respected
B000059HAI|4.0|To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and as a collector of films with a WW2 genre, I purchased both Tora Tora Tora and Pearl Harbor. While the former was released in 1970, and did not have the luxury of computerized graphics, it told an extremely accurate and very real account of the attack. Completely void of a useless love story, it concentrated solely on historical facts. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, on the other hand, was pure junk with its opening 55 minutes, which made the film almost laughable and totally forgettable. The unnecessary addition of the Doolittle raid on Tokyo was another poor excuse to show off the use of computerized graphics. Tora Tora Tora, put a luster on the &quot;Pearl&quot;  while Pearl Harbor, the movie, left it faded and blurred.
0380820846|4.0|Another great read from Julia Quinn just in time for summer reading! As always, I love the characters with their usual humor and engaging dialogue.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I love this movie.  Although it is frighteningly weird at first, by the end you'll be in tears.  It's brilliant cast and wonderful music make this DVD a gem.  With 6 hours of extras, there is always tons to enjoy.  I have watched this over a dozen times and now can sing any song, tell you what any character is wearing at any time, anything.  Call me obsessed, but it truly is one of the best movies of all time.
1573225517|2.0|I would give &quot;High Fidelity&quot; two Stars. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; has not such an innovative and fascinating plot that you could give it more than two stars. But the plot is not so bad  that you would have to give less than two stars. I think it is a middle good book. And because of that I give it two stars. I would not say that it is a must to read it, but you could read it if you like lovestorys and storys in which a character changes.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Although blink's old stuff was a lot better. This is one great cd. Mostly all the songs are really great and it's a cd you can listen to strait through without having to skip around the songs you dont like! Blink went a little bit lighter when they made this one, buts it still great! I recommend it to anyone who likes good punk rock!
B00005NY2O|4.0|Enigma's latest release, LoveSensualityDevotion (LSD), is an amazing mix of pensive lyrics and awesome music from all of their album releases.  It's kind of like a \\"greatest hits\\" album.  I had heard of Enigma because I own Pure Moods and thought that their music was like nothing I had heard before.  A local retailer was selling LSD for a very inexpensive price, so I figured that I could afford to drop a few dollars for something to listen to.<BR>I was amazed at how wonderful the album was.  There are many different styles of music with awesome beats so that everyone can find at least one song that they like.  The lyrics don't overpower the music, so it is easy to clean to as well as fall asleep to.<BR>There is one song in particular that exhibits the wonderful lyrics and the powerful music, which is called The Gravity of Love.  I get goosebumps when I hear it because it is so moving.  Beyond the Invisible is a song that demonstrates the wonderful lyrics that Michael Cretu and others are able to come up with.  The song that I believe has the best music would have to be Smell of Desire.
B000001GH9|5.0|The Berg recording is better, by far, than the Perlman/Ozawa disc which was the best I had heard up to now.  I was amazed at the emotional depth this violinist brought to this concerto, which is a masterpiece of the highest inspiration. I was literally about to come off the edge of my chair listening for the first time to this performance.  This is definitely the \\"one to have\\".  But it is only for the Berg.  Sadly, the Rihm pieces written especially for Ms. Mutter are not the transcendant experience of the concerto.
B000021YQV|2.0|i was wanting to buy this cd but im glad i diddnt i burned it from my cousins. After hearing toxicity and chop suey the rest of the songs are horrible. i think that all the procides for this cd is going to terrorsim. WARNING: DONT BUY THIS CD
B000062Y98|5.0|At last. It has been awhile but Blind Gauridan has not only matched but surpassed Imaginations of the Other Side. This is as close to perfection one can achieve. Everything here is amazing; the guitars, the drums, the vocals, the arraggement. My only gripe is the lack of any instrumental, but anyway I can hope for next time. In this album, BG has 10 songs (11 if you are count the medocre miels del dolor. The first 2 songs dont do too much for me, though i tried to like precious jerusalem.Theer are two other weak songs (soulforged and miels del door) Here are scores for each song.<BR>1.Precious Jerusalem 8/10. loud and entertaining chorus. <BR>2.Battlefield 7/10. another loud one. not too great<BR>3.Under the Ice 9/10. Now BG gets hot. Awesome song. chorus could be longer.<BR>4.Sadly sings desiny. Another sweet song. gotta love the chorus.<BR>5.Maiden and Minstrel. 9/10. took me a while to like it. great song.<BR>6.Wait for an Answer. 10/10. OMG. I love this song. Best song on CD. Awesome riffs, drums, vocals, chorus. Perfection.<BR>7.Soulforged. 7/10. Another weak but decent song.<BR>8.Age of False Innocence. 10/10. Anohter fantastic song. Again Kursh and co. are just great. Perfection again.<BR>9.Punishment Divine. 9/10. Another lovely song<BR>10.And then there was silence. 10/10. Epic, Great, Masterpiece. Tied for best song. This is BG at thier peak. Like Maiden (Rime of ancient mariner) and Iced earth (Dante inferno), BG has crafted a song that has defined what real metal is, not the [stuff]called nu-metal that we get on MTV and VH-1.<BR>11.Miels Del dolor. 7/10 sung in spanish. dont really care<br />Overall this album surpasses the great Nightfall in Middle Earth (which i think is a tad bit over-rated), and matches the excellent Imaginations of the Otherside (BG's previous best album).
B000065U1N|4.0|...It sets out to narrate true events without resorting to the usual hollywood cliches.  ...It does romanticize certain certain aspects, but this is to be expected.  The script is tight, without extraneous information.  The fates of the various soldiers are easy to follow.  The audience is always aware of why things are happening, unlike many movies, where plotless action scenes are just loosely bound together in a movie.  One complaint that I do have is that the DVD does no have a lot of extra features.  I would have liked to see a featurette on the special effects utilized in the film, especially those concerning the helicopter crash.  Also interesting would have been some extra information on the situation in Somalia, going over some of the political/military subtleties that influenced the American mission there.  But oh well.  The movie is still worth it.  Before I conclude, I would like to mention the great cinematography in the film.  It is crisp and realistic, and it seems as if the composition of every shot has been impeccably planned.  In conclusion, a worthwhile film.
B00000IP3S|5.0|No doubt about it, This album was BG best until NATO (night of the opera). I dont see how people claim that Nightfall is better than this. Nightfall is great but it ranks third behind NATO and Imaginations. Imagimnations is classic and symphonic metal all wrapped up in one mega package. the only thing missing is a full bred instrumental piece (C'mon BG, something like Gandalf Rebirth or Gandalf the magician wouldnt hurt). Anyway here is a ranking of the songs.<BR>1.Imaginations of the Other Side. 9/10. great song. booming chorus, makes me wanna scream it out. <BR>2.I am alive. 9/10. amother lovely loud song. sweet.<BR>3.A past and future secret. 9/10. change of pace. melodic and low tempo. best use of Kursch vocals.<BR>4.Script of my Requiem. 9/10. One of my first Bg songs. great and fantastic chorus.<BR>5.Modred Song. 9/10. For the love of ..., can BG make a bad song!<BR>6.Born in a mourning hall 8/10. good song, not as good as the first five.<BR>7.Bright Eyes. 9/10. Another awesome song. I love the riff right at the beginning and the middle. <BR>8.Another Holy War 8/10. another above avergae song. good chorus.<BR>9. And the Story ends. 9/10. What a climax, possible the best song to end an album. this is possible my best song after a hard debate.<BR>As you can see, this album is ranked highly by me. I feel that  NATO only surpasses it in that there are songs in NATO, that are better than the best of Imaginations. Nonetheless, Imaginations is a better overall package. Advice to you. Buy this and NATO. And then if you have some change buy Nightfall. All three albums are the triforce or trifecta or trinity of BG.
0151008116|5.0|I ordered this book in part because I needed a break from my usual fare of spiritual readings, Oprah picks, and National Public Radio. Yawn, I needed some adventure! \\"Life of Pi\\" beckoned me to the lost hours of storytales from childhood, secluded in my bedroom on a hot summer day, wonderful stolen hours. Such was yesterday...a book about a boy, a boat, a tiger and God. What more could I want? There are priceless scenes I will undoubtedly return to time and again, particularly the \\"accidental\\" intersection of Pi's three wise men comprised of a priest, an imam and a pandit. A hilarious, yet truthful bird's eye view of boy meets dogma. <br />Martel's writing of the sea, animal behavior and his apparent lust for life, meaning and irony are a feast to be savored. Richard Parker would have been impressed --- I left not a morsel. <br />If you want a rollicking summer read without compromising your spirit of seeking, this one's the pick of the litter.

0380789035|2.0|Gaiman is an intriguing talent. While the ideas which drive his writing remain inventive and interesting, his ability to capitalize on these ideas is lacking. This results in books which appear interesting in brief plot reviews and back covers, but are unsatisfying when read as books. American Gods suffers from poor characterizations, bad dialogue, and ideas which are never explored past the superficiality of the back cover. Indeed, the main plot consists mainly of creating a world which could be fairly interesting, but then spending the latter half of the book destroying it with slapdash plotting. The poor plotting makes it seem as though Gaiman was merely trying to get the book out on time by throwing things into the book and resolving any problems by deus ex machina. On the other hand, I found one of the subplots to be fairly compelling. In all, though American Gods is full of ideas which could be interesting if explored, this book never reaches its potential.
1573225517|3.0|I like the book High Fidelity because it isn`t an ordinary book.<BR>Most of the books in school are very boring, but High Fidelity isn`t boring because ist describes the development of a life of a crazy young man. It is interesting for teenagers besause we also have problems with love and relationships and so on.<BR>I think that a few teenagers could understand Rob, the mail character, and his problems.
B00005UW7V|4.0|Steven Spielberg outdone himself with this one. I started out viewing it with no preconcieved notions about the film. When I finished, I found that the film stayed with me. It is an excellent story that has many surprises. I recommend that everyone see it and try to understand the underlying message (don't want to give the story away).
B000068QY7|5.0|Great album, but then again I believe Oasis the one of the best bands in the world.  Take a listen and wisk away to the brit isle.<br />Oasis rules!
B00005JKHP|4.0|I consider myself a true Trekker. I have always loved the Star Trek movies except for the original motion picture. I was always a little hesitant to watch it since it contained scenes that I thought were drawn out and unecessary. Well, I believe the director's cut has changed that. I watched the director's cut version and was much more interested in the feature than ever before. The picture and audio is much clearer, some new CGI imagery and all the filler is gone. Good move for Paramount.
6304711905|5.0|'Tombstone' is one of my favorite movies for a variety of reasons.  <br />First, despite the growing trend to rewrite history showing that the good guys were really the bad guys, this movie clearly shows that the Earps were the good guys and the Clantons were the bad guys.  Don't pay any attention to the revisionists who say otherwise.<br />Second, it's a great action-filled movie.<br />Third, Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp plays the part in a way that makes you think he IS Wyatt Earp.  From the photographs I've seen of Wyatt, you'd have to say the Russell is a mirror image of the immortal and legendary Earp.  The lean, hard 6 foot body, the sweeping handlebar mustache, the blue eyes, the cold look... Russell was magnificent as Mr. Earp.<br />Fourth, Val Kilmer played a fantastic role as Doc Holliday (who may have been my illegitimate great-grandfather; we'll never really know).  Kilmer's body size is too large to mistake him physically for Doc, but his portrayal negates that problem.  What a wonderful interpretation of Doc he gave.  The meanest dude in town.... he was the ultimate \\"You don't mess with Doc Holliday\\" character.  Incidently, I thought that Quaid in \\"Wyatt Earp\\" was a better physical representation of Doc than Val Kilmer.<br />Fifth, Powers Booth was a great Curly Bill.  From pictures of the real Curly, you'd think that Booth and he were twins.  He was wonderful in the part.  Wyatt really killed Curly Bill in a gunfight that was reasonably well depicted in the movie. <br />Sixth, the setting and the location shots seemed to be right on target... southeastern Arizona.  Nice to see that authenticity.<br />From the history endpoint, much was so accurate.  County Sherrif Behan was in cahoots with the rustlers (My own reading and study have led me to believe that he was not only a supporter of them, but in fact, their leader).  Despicable Ike Clanton was a crude and totally distasteful individual, though not as ignorant as he was played in the movie.  Texas Jack Vermillion and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson were real people, and friends of Wyatt.  Although Michael Biehn played well as Johnny Ringo, and brooded much as Ringo did, he was too dirty looking to fit the image I have of Ringo.  When Doc Holliday died in the sanitarium in Colorado, he was visited by a priest as shown in the movie (where he really converted to the Catholic faith because of his long past love of someone who was Catholic), and he supposedly really said \\"This is funny\\" just before he died.  Wyatt really married Josie and spent the rest of his life traveling the West with her at his side.  Jason Priestly's portrayal of Billy Breckenridge as a homosexual was accurate.<br />Ok, now for some \\"complaints\\"...  mostly with historical facts.  I didn't like Bill Paxton's protrayal of Morgan Earp... his character was much too geeky to have been the real Morgan.  Also, Morgan and Doc were quite close, but the movie didn't get into that.  The one glaring historical fact which no one disputes was incorrect was the shootings of Morgan and Virgil.  The movie had Morgan killed and Virgil shot on the same night.  This, in fact, is far from factual.... Virgil was shot just after Christmas in 1881, while Morgan was murderd in March of 1882 (in a pool hall as shown in the flick).  There was great tension in Tombstone between the dates of the two shootings which was not evident in the movie.  Few people realize that in Tombstone prior to the time of all this trouble, Bat Masterson and Luke Short were in town and were allied with Wyatt; they had their reasons for departing before the OK Corral.  Another place where the movie wasn't as accurate as it could have been was the relationship between Wyatt and John Clum, the editor of the Epitaph.  They were actually quite close and Clum supported Earp totally.<br />  The movie had Doc killing Ringo in a shootout.  It's true that Ringo was killed in June of 1882, but there isn't hard evidence who cut him down.  It's possible it was Doc, who absolutely HATED Ringo, especially for his part in Morgan's murder.  Ringo was killed after Wyatt and Doc left Arizona to go to Colorado, because of a warrant against them.  It's possible they came back to finish Ringo, who most certainly had a hand in murdering Morgan.  According to Mrs. Earp, it was Wyatt who really terminated Ringo.  There is so much debate about his death.  The \\"official\\" coroner's report says suicide, but too many details refute this.  My opinion is that Earp went back into Arizona and took care of Ringo.<br />  My primary objection to the historical authenticity revolves around WHY the battle took place.  The full reasons never came out in the movie, or in any other movie about Wyatt Earp.... Wyatt's dealings with Behan in the agreement they made which Behan reniged on, the Benson stage incident, the shootings at Skeleton Canyon, Ike Clanton's deal with Wyatt to turn over his friends who had killed Bud Philpot during the Benson stage robbery for the purpose of the reward money, the resentment the Clanton Gang had for the way that Earp throttled their evil empire, etc.  The movie made it seem that these people were just angry with each other... they were, but there was so much that led up to the fight that wasn't shown in any of the movies.<br />  I would like to have seen much more of the trial of the Earps, in which they were correctly acquitted, rather than just Judge Welles Spicer's final ruling.  You might be interested in reading the transcript of the trial and read the words of Wyatt, Ike Clanton and so many others, which will convince you that the verdict was correct.  (See \\"The OK Corral Inquest\\" by Alford E. Turner, from Creative Publishing Company, College Station, TX)<br />  Despite all the historical omissions, and they did take away from the movie for me, I'd still have to say this was a GREAT movie.  I watch it over and over again, and will continue to do so.  Even if you're not into the history of the period, you'll enjoy a great action movie, excellent music, and some terrific acting.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|This has got to be the raunchiest, sexiest TV-series ever. I didn't even know you could show that stuff on TV until QAF came along. I know now!<br />QAF is a rattling good story, with characters you can believe in, even if they're larger than life sometimes. (I did wonder how Stuart was able to stick to his high-paid job when all he could think about was SEX, SEX, SEX!) And the laughs come hard and often, even if they're laced with cruelty sometimes.<br />Much of the enjoyment comes from the couterie surrounding the three main guys: Vince's slutty mother, Alexander, the lesbian couple, and the various tricks that turn up at Stuart's loft. <br />Whether straight audiences will run for the hills after watching this display of in-your-face gay lib, well I couldn't care less. I love QAF!
B000001FKY|1.0|Def Leppard records their two first albuns, ON THROUGH THE NIGHT and HIGH N DRY. THe two of them are hard rock at its best. Then they release PYROMANI. Already utterly commercial, but still a sdtrong album. THen they hit the jackpot with the worst album so far, HYSTERIA. Go figure... An album filled with flat drumming, commercial production, sugary and awful ballads, the worst possible ingredients from hair-metal....
B000007UA4|4.0|Kylie grows up and mellows down on her fourth album, which has less of the high energy grooves and more mid-tempo, r&b-lite slices of pop. \\"The Word Is Out\\" is a lightweight new jack swing number that sounds way different from everything Kylie has done before. Also good are the Chic-like \\"Too Much of a Good Thing\\" and the underrated \\"Finer Things.\\" Interestingly, Kylie's worst singles are her covers, but she finally pulls it off on \\"Give Me Just a Little More Time.\\" But fear not; the disc's closer, \\"I Like it Like That,\\" is the high energy romp we've come to expect from this singer. \\"Let's Get to It\\" is a departure for not only Minogue, but for Stock Aitken Waterman, who are known to write very similiar neo-disco songs. But here, they show a little range and take chances. Looks like those chances paid off pretty well.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather movies are the stuff of cinematic legend.  Godfather's I and II are two of the finest movies ever made and both rank as #1 and #3, respectively, in the IMDB Top 250 All-Time list.  Godfather III is a lesser film and confusing to watch if you have not seen the first two.  But, it is still a compelling chapter in the Godfather legacy.  The release of the Godfather DVD collection has been long-awaited and the result is very rewarding.  In addition to getting the digitally remastered prints of each movie, there is an entirely separate CD that is packed with a cornucopia of extras about Godfather Trilogy.  The extras are simply wonderful.  There is the obligatory 'making of' documentary (which is supposed to be very good, but I have no seen yet), clips from the 1973 and 1975 Academy Awards where each movie took home best Oscar from the previous year, and family tree that shows how all members of the Corleone Family are connected (with brief biographies of each).  The true gem, however, is the deleted scenes section.  It makes sense that, in the interest of running time and story continuity, these scenes were left out.  However, the deleted scenes do not contradict anything from the movies and actually provide compelling background and side stories.  Among the list of deleted scenes is one where Michael Corleone tracks down and orders the hit on his bodyguard that was responsible for the death of his first wife 10 years earlier and another scene where Vito Corleone exacts revenge on all the men responsible for his family's death in turn of the century Sicily (not just Don Ciccio).  Even if you own all the Godfather movies on VHS and have seen each of them many times, the Godfather DVD collection is still a 'must-have'.  It broadens and expands the already mesmerizing world of the Corleone Family.
B00004S8X5|4.0|This is the debut album from Kylie Minogue. Although it barely went gold in the US, it racked up multiplatinum sales in the UK, where it was one of the biggest selling albums of 1988. Minogue dropped her acting gig from the Aussie soap \\"Neighbours\\" to launch a career with producers Stock Aitken Waterman, and the result is a debut album full of innocent, simple, well-crafted pop. If you're looking for an album of social commentary or deep lyrical content, go somewhere else. \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" and \\"Got to Be Certain\\" are singles that have strong hooks, memorable choruses, and are undeniably catchy. While the rest of the album shines with gems such as \\"Turn it to Love,\\" and \\"It's No Secret,\\" Minogue's sole cringeworthy moment is her terrible cover of \\"The Locomotion,\\" which sounds even cheesier by today's standards. But no matter. This debut album is great for those who want fun, bright dance pop.
B000068QVN|5.0|The critics and the nay-sayers should take note; \\"Grand Funk Railroad-The 1971 Tour\\" was not made for them. This one is purely for the FANS. Originally, it was intended to be a CD of their historic Shea Stadium concert in July of 1971. We the fans had been asking for this for quite a while. (We've been asking for a CONCERT VIDEO for a long time too, so how 'bout it, Capitol Records?!!) It was later decided that better versions of some songs were recorded at other shows, thus the CD \\"The 1971 Tour\\" came to be. Four of the tracks came from the Shea Stadium concert, five from the Cobo Hall in Detroit, and the opening song, \\"Are You Ready\\" (track two after the the track one introduction) came from the Syndrome in Chicago. This was representive of the set list they were playing at the time.    Compilation producer David K. Tedds definately has earned the right to be labeled \\"The Miracle Worker\\" for the fine job he did restoring the sound from the old tapes to make this recording. The sound clearly captures the absolutely RAW edge of Grand Funk Railroad in their Power Trio days.    Throughout the entire CD, they don't let up for a second. Then they come back for TWO encores. The first encore, \\"Gimme Shelter\\", was more powerful than the Rolling Stones could EVER be in their wildest dreams! The second encore, \\"Into the Sun\\", the band can only perform after an enthusiastic fan returns a foot pedal belonging to guitarist Mark Farner. And when it's over, you wish they would do just ONE more.    Mark Farner's guitar sizzles, Don Brewer's drum-work (the best in the history of Rock & Roll!!) gets you on your feet and won't let you sit back down, and Mel Shacher's bass earns him the title \\"The God Of Thunder\\". You may want to back off on the old bass knob on your stereo if you're driving through fault zones --just to be safe!    If you are, or ever were, a fan of Grand Funk Railroad, then BUY IT!!! You will NOT be dissapointed!!
B0000024JN|4.0|Way back when Eminem was bully bait during his school years, three Jewish dudes called the Beastie Boys released this impressive debut that made them the first (and, in my opinion, best) white rappers in hip hop.  But make no mistake, \\"License to Ill\\" is rude, obnoxious, and sometimes offensive by today's PC standards, but if you can take it with a grain of salt, it's also fun to listen to.  \\"The New Style\\" is undeniably funky and has the Boys in top form.  \\"Paul Revere\\" is also pretty good with its drum machine played in reverse, and \\"No Sleep Til Brooklyn\\" is a fine melange of amped-up guitars and hip hop beats.  \\"Fight For Your Right\\" was the group's biggest hit, but it pales in comparison to the rest of the album.  \\"License to Ill\\" was all about drugs, women, and disrespecting any and all figures of authority.  However, these guys eventually matured by phasing out of their juvenile lyrics and releasing even better albums, including the now-classic \\"Paul's Boutique.\\"  All in all, a promising debut that's aged well over the years.
B000002AP1|4.0|This album's title is an accurate description of what you find inside.  It is the third Stooges album, but does not fully represent a continuation.  Members of the band had gone their own ways, but Iggy had a new guitar partner in James Williamson and after deciding to give it another try re-roped the Asheton Brothers.  This time Ron was primarily on bass or second fiddle to Williamson, whose rough guitar dominates the music.  Still, Raw Power can be seen to represent somewhat of an advance over Fun House, as that album did over the Stooges' debut.  The rhythm guitar worksmanship is better, the sound more balanced musically.  I also like Williamson's blistering outpourings of heavy metal soloing more than Ron Asheton's previous stuff, which was limited in scope.  As to the best songs, I think it's interesting to hear vibraphones in a Stooges song (\\"Penetration\\"), but my choices are those most-intense and faster blasters, \\"Search and Destroy\\" and \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell,\\" which I believe are also the musically strongest (and boy, does Iggy sound evil).
B000065U1N|3.0|I saw this film at an advance screening and found myself confused at who was who, who died, who survived, etc... FACT: Ridley Scott is not and has never been a good action director. He has a nice, slick, Hollywood style, but he cannot direct action scenes very well. The battles come off as just random acts of violence with choppy editing and confusing characters that all look alike... Black Hawk Down is overproduced and lacks any heart at all... PS: Black Hawk Down- I will give credit where it's due and there are some cool shots of the choppers coming into to city before the assault...
B00006690G|5.0|First of all, this is an amazing album. Every track is at least above-average (save for the weird,  'Say What You Say') and a lot are outstanding. Very radio-friendly cd, which means, sharp lyrics combined with catchy choruses and background music. Em has surpassed Dre and is the best rapper today. I challenge anyone to find someone better. As for the music, Eminnem shows that he's grown up. This is a more introspective album. I really appreciate the fact that he's not always into the bling-bling, as 99% of rappers are. Instead, he's honest about his failures and shortcomings. Lucky for us, the rage in his music is still there. He is the best artist at making his listeners feel [mad] at the world, and we get plenty of that here. But again, it's his honesty that makes him the most 'real' rapper out there today. And its one of the reasons why he's so popular. This album is the best hip-hop cd to come out this year. You're missing out if you don't get this one.
1573225517|4.0|The novel \\"High Fidelity\\" by Nick Hornby tells the story of a man called Rob in his midthirties, who tries to get over his ex-girlfriends by meeting his former girlfriends from his top-5-list of most painful split-ups.<BR>I liked the book very much, because it is written in a very funny and clever way. Reading about Rob's feelings and thoughts is interesting, because he discribes them in a very honest way, although he nobody else about them.<BR>The difference between what he thinks and what he says makes the dialogues funny to read.One thing I liked about \\"High Fidelity\\", too, is that not only the main characters are described in a very detailed way, but also the minor characters (Barry and Dick rule!), what makes the plot appear credible.<BR>I gave the novel four stars, because it's a brilliant book, but the ending is a bit disappointing.
B000002MFN|4.0|I must admit,seeing how the media and much of the music-buying public turned on Madonna after her notorious \\"Sex\\" book and <BR>\\"Erotica\\" album in 1992,I thought that this album would be... Madonna' low point.<br />Boy was I wrong! I recently took a listen to \\"Erotica\\" and the total opposite of what I thought it'd be.Altough the critics gravitate towards 1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\",I wouldn't argue to say that \\"Erotica\\" might be Madonna's best album.It's dark,moody,and scorned.  Cuts like the trancey title track and the stomping post-disco burner \\"Deeper And Deeper\\",the scorned<BR>\\"Bad Girl\\",and the lithing ballad \\"Rain\\" are way more intriguing<BR>and a more honest look inside Madonna's much publicized celebrity skin.<br />Among the real standouts on \\"Erotica\\" is \\"Waiting\\"(great beat,<BR>love the way her vocals are arranged),\\"Words\\"(ditto \\"Waiting\\"),<BR>\\"Thief Of Hearts\\",and \\"Did You Do It?\\".Plus there's the jazzy <BR>\\"Secret Garden\\" and the socially consious \\"In This Life\\".<BR>All very intriguing stuff.<BR>Since Madonna is more of a singles artist,I didn't really expect any of her albums to really have poigant songs.But I was wrong.My misrepresation of this album has proved to me that you should go and listen to things yourself instead of going by what the media says.
B00004TR2G|5.0|John William's score for Steven Spielberg's classic tale of a shark terrorising the people of Amity Island is not only his best musical score ever, but it is also, THE best soundtrack ever composed. And there is much more than the classic &quot;Der-der, Der, der&quot; of the &quot;Main Title&quot;, as the simple yet effective track eases into the terrifying &quot;First Victim&quot;. This is impressive stuff, especially one of the most difficult tracks for Williams to complete: &quot;The Shark Cage Fugue&quot;, which is nothing short of brilliant. The classical and frightning &quot;Shark Attack&quot; is vintage Williams, and it is this track which seamlessly blends through to a series of masterful strokes, with the eerie yet somehow etheral &quot;Ben Gardner's Boat&quot; and the high-spirited &quot;Montage&quot;. Williams brings all of his best work to the fore to slowly build up to a barnstorming finish, with &quot;The Great Shark Chase&quot;, &quot;Three Barrels Under&quot;, &quot;Between Attacks&quot; and &quot;The Shark Approaches&quot;. This amazing soundtrack is better than ever, with previously unreleased additional notes, creating a much more fufilling score which is complemented by the excelent sound quality. This is quintessential Williams.
B000065V1V|5.0|An awesome trip by David Bowie.  His first full-length CD since Hours, which was released in 2000 (I believe).  This CD reminds me of a mix between Hours and Scary Monsters.  Simply brilliant!  The songs are very cool, especially Slow Burn and I Would Be Your Slave.  I can't wait for the next one.  I just hope he doesn't wait so long this time!  He also does a couple really cool covers on this CD.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie, equipped with the movie industry's best, steals the hearts and minds of all who watch. Russell Crowe captivates the audience as he portrays the brilliant Dr. John Nash. He brings to life the essence of Nash's character, making it seem almost realistic, bringing the audience to believe he really is the famous Nobel winner. Lest we forget the Oscar-winning performance by Jennifer Connelly, who portrays Alicia Nash, John Nash's wife and number one supporter. Also receiving recognition is the director, who has come a long way since his years as Opie on the Andy Griffith Show. Ron Howard truly bested himself with this wonderful film. I encourage all to see this movie about a truly misunderstood genius.
B00003CXI1|3.0|After all the,(Oh this movie is the best!, best thing I have ever seen!) I was really let down. Yes the special effects were great (that's the only reason it got 3 stars from me!)but as far as \\"the greatest story ever put to film\\" is quite the miss quote.

6305364648|4.0|James Cameron reteamed with Schwarzenegger in one of the big man's last good action films of late, where Arnie is secret agent Harry Tasker with Jamie Lee Curtis as his unassuming wife who thinks he's a sale rep. This isn't one of Cameron's best, but it's still a cracking action film that has enough stunts, explosions and witty one-liners to fill a dozen Bond films.<br />The film, based on the french film \\"Le Totale!\\", is Cameron easing up on his usual gung-ho heroics and bringing some humour hirthero unseen in the Cameron cannon. The pairing of witty Tom Arnold and Arnie is great, and the halarious Bill Paxton as the under-endowed used-car salesman who tricks Tasker's wife (Curtis) into going on a \\"mission\\" with him. And of course, the buxom Curtis, who brings a leval of sexyness to the whole thing, has one of her best roles since the old slasher films she starred in in the 80's.<br />The action ante is impressive, and near the end we see Cameron's M.O resurface, with some incredible explosions and the big man's increasingly large arsenal along the way. It's very fun, very cool, and a must-have for any action fan. Dissapointing DVD extras with only a trailer, one hopes a re-release will come along soon...
B000002B7U|4.0|For some reason, nobody gives Jake E Lee the credit he deserves as one of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists.  He's better than Randy Rhoads, although not by much, and he's much better than Zakk Wylde (who is also good).  Jake E Lee's playing is at its best on this album. All of the songs are really good.  The best tracks on this album are Ultimate Sin, Lightning Strikes, and Shot In The Dark, but \\"Killer of Giants\\", \\"Secret Loser\\", \\"Thank God For The Bomb\\" and \\"Never Know Why\\" are also good.  The weakest track on the album is \\"Never\\", but it isn't bad.  This is still Ozzy's best album.  It ties with Blizzard of Ozz.
B00003CX5P|5.0|THIS MOVIE BEAT TITANIC.  I love this film because it shows the love bond in between Anakin &amp; Padme.  Congrats George Lucas.
B000065U1N|5.0|This was a touching movie on a subject that not a lot of people know about. This movie is a great war movie. It shows not only what happened to the Americans but also the Somalis. It also shows the brotherhood of the rangers and Delta Force. Everyone should go out and rent this great movie.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is the fastest thing you have ever heard! (Once you've heard it, anyway).  Both guitarists, Kerry King, who I personally believe is the world's greatest LIVING guitarist, and Jeff Hannemann, who is almost as good as King, speed out the gates at the speed of light with \\"Angel of Death\\", which is a terrifying and brutal song about the Holocaust and it's victims, and don't ever stop.  The speed is so fast, many people will need an accquired taste to this breed of speed metal to enjoy it.  Kerry King reveals the most breathtaking solos anyone has ever made, ranking behind only one person, and that is Jimi Hendrix.  Bassist/vocalist Tom Araya makes great snarls and roars, sometimes even freaked-out screams about horror, blood, brutality, hell, and all that other stuff that would scare [some people].  Drummer Dave Lombardo (who is no longer in Slayer) beats on the snare drum at about 100 times per minute in \\"Angel of Death\\", and plays his double bass drums just as quickly as Joey Jordison from Slipknot.  This is definitely Slayer's defient album, showcasing their shout-at-the-devil attitude, blurring riffs, light-speed drumming, and earthshaking-yet-faded bass.  This is not only Slayer's best, but one of the best metal albums of all time, recommended to metal fans all over.
0312265859|4.0|The latest in the Stephanie Plum series Hard Eight,is a fun read. It was a pleasant surprise to read this one and find our character finally moving forward somewhat. Yes it has the same formula, madcap situations, ongoing lovelife problems, but there is also an interesting story unfolding. Plot wise Hard eight is perhaps one of Evanovichs best. Of course the secondary story, Stephanie's love life continues to unfold. Yes, Stephanie finally succumbs to Rangers charms. However, after all the hype the relationship has received in previous books, fans will be disappointed in the skimpy couple of paragraphs devoted to the tryst. It seems the author wanted to focus on the plot rather than the characters.  Too bad,with a little more attention to character development Hard Eight could have been Great!
B00000JG4N|4.0|In 1989, Motley Crue put out a very good album in Dr. Feelgood.  Overall, it's not nearly as good as 1987's &quot;Girls Girls Girls&quot;, but Mick Mars' playing is better on this than on any of their other albums.  Almost all the songs are good on this album, the best being the title track, S.O.S, and Kickstart My Heart.  For some reason, out of two ballads on this album, the bad one was the hit single.  &quot;Without You&quot; is nowhere near as good as &quot;Time for Change&quot;.  W/O U drags on and is uninteresting while Change has a good guitar solo, a good melody, and better than usual vocals.  If you've got several Crue albums, buy this.  If you haven't purchased any Motley Crue albums before, don't start with this one.  Get &quot;Girls Girls Girls&quot; first.  It's much better than this, but this is a close second.
0312265859|5.0|I can not begin to tell you how pleased I am at this last book. The 2 before this was beginning to get me on the trend of waiting for it to come out in Paperback. But Alas.... I enjoyed this one. Yeah she still writes in those quirky-borderline-stupid secondary characters that I have felt for the past two books were beginning to annoy me. But the story actually makes up for it this case she is working on does get a bit hairy at times and of course the whole Joe vs. Ranger thing is still a primary storyline. You will not be dissapointed.. or at least I wasn't.<br />Stephanie is Stephanie and Lulu is Lulu the only character growth I saw in this one was................ \\"REX\\" and \\"BOB\\" LOL so don't pick it up expecting to see some major growth from anyone else.<br />Happy Reading
B000065U1N|5.0|This was a touching movie on a subject that not a lot of people know about. This movie is a great war movie. It shows not only what happened to the Americans but also the Somalis. It also shows the brotherhood of the rangers and Delta Force. Everyone should go out and rent this great movie.
B0000669JL|5.0|Everyone knows all the great songs from the great man. This reissue has improved and great sound, all the lyics and a good essay on Bob, and 2 new &quot;bonus&quot; tracks that emphasize good time party Bob. But the single best reason to toss your old Legend and buy this one is that it has, at last, the full length version of Exodus. There was never an excuse for having the shorter version of this great song on CD and it always took away from the album for me. Now Legend is the perfect CD.

B0000033K2|5.0|This is a great period of Coltrane, where he was still using forms fairly close to song forms, as opposed to a few years later where he used more extended modal forms. Even when the tunes are modal, they still are with song forms.<br />Giant Steps, of course, is a jazz classic, and probably represents the endgame of this approach. These are the so-called Trane Changes. What is cool is when his arrangement to Body and Soul sneaks them in on the bridge. But yet, it is sort of a modal tune, alternating the minor chord with the augmented. A very interesting loosening up of this approach.<br />My Favorite Things was a tune that he performed much in the later period I mention. Here it is presented pure and simple: it is at the beginning. You will follow Trane and hear him do wonderful versions later at Newport and at the Village Vanguard again.<br />I like how they put all of the extra takes on a separate disk, not like those annoying Verve boxes with Charlie Parker. It is great to hear some of the things they tried in making some of the arrangements to these tunes.<br />Many people say Trane was self-indulgent. But consider that Trane was by nature a searcher, he had to go the extra mile to get \\"to the crux\\" as he put it. If this is hard to understand, Gary Giddins had excellent commentary about this in Ken Burns JAZZ series, which otherwise was a fiasco.<br />This is music that will stick to you for your entire life.
6305428298|5.0|I think the people play a good part in the movie. Everyone in the movie act out in the real world like real people.Bravo for (Michael Chine) for the best performace in the moive. At the end of the movie (Micheal Chine)express the anger that I never seen before or any other moives. I like (Jane Horrocks) she does the great and the funny voices that I heard before pretty good. She gives a good performace. The mother (Brenda Blethyn) gives a good performace. In the moive I never saw a mother act like that well, just in the moive. (Ewan McGregor) play a good part and a well Actor in the movie little voice. The director (Mark Herman) did a good job on the moive. The cast did a great job too.
6305078181|5.0|of all the dracular movies seen by me this one portrayed by Frank Langella is the best. He's good looking, sexy , stronge and very much in love. Lucy portrayed by  Kate Nelligan is a stronge woman figure. What a great match. How disappointing that this movie did not get the high acclaime it deserved. I was hoping for a Dracular 11 with the same actors, to live forever in love  {feeding on them} what better plot than that.  Who says Dracular has to be ugly and repulsive looking I don't agree. I've been a fan of Lanfella since this movie. I'm ready of more of the same.
B000002UAX|5.0|Better known as \\"The White Album\\", this is undoubtably \\"The Beatles\\" most mature and diverse album. Clocking in at ninety minutes (considered to be monumentally long upon release in 1968) every track is a gem.<br /> But how \\"The Beatles\\" were holding it all together at this time remains a complete mystery, with all this talent and the massive ego's they had developed, it's a wonder that any songs were recorded by the whole band at all, to come out with an album of such brilliance is nothing short of miraculous.<br /> Each song spotlights one member of the band, with obviously Lennon and McCartney supplying the bulk of the material, although by now it was quite clear that that they were writing separately. Listen to the diversity on this album, from the cynism of Lennon, \\"Yer Blues\\", McCartney's natural sense of pop on \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", Ringo's whimsical take on country rock in \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" to George Harrison's sublime \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (with a young Eric Clapton questing on lead guitar, and simply lighting up the song with his sublime soloing) with four such different characters in a band, how on earth could anything be boring, and let me assure you it doesn't get that way.<br /> \\"The Beatles\\" really rocked as well, with such classics as \\"Birthday\\", \\"Back In The U.S.S.R\\" (since when, this has become the perfunctionary encore for any rock band playing in the Soviet Union) and \\"Helter Skelter\\". \\"Helter Skelter\\" became a live staple for many major rock bands including Aerosmith, Motley Crue, and Ian Gillan, but none of them could match the amazing performance by Paul McCartney, his vocals on this track leaving you wondering how he ever uttered another syllable, mind you the same could be said of his hilarious \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\".<br /> Of course you then had the other end of the scale with some powerful ballads, like Lennon's tribute to his mother in \\"Julia\\" probably the most moving track amongst this collection, or McCartney's acoustic \\"Blackbird\\", then taking it into another realm, there Lennon's very Avant Gaude \\"Revolution 9\\", not really a song more a collection of sound bites, but not only a forerunner of things to come, but it's amazing how well this fits in with the other songs here.<br /> George Harrison really come of age during the recording of this album, not only for his guitar playing, but also his song writing abilities, his searching \\"Long Long Long\\" is possibly the most underated and memorable track here, his contribution was all the more remarkable considering he left \\"The Beatles\\" during the recording sessions, of course he came back again, leaving it up to Paul McCartney to do the dirty deed to the Fab Four two years later.<br /> Sadly as \\"The Beatles\\" no longer did live concerts, none of the songs were ever played live by the band themselves, which giving them a live concert outlet, might of kept them together for a while longer, and who knows where that might of led. As after they broke up, although some of their solo work was nothing short of brilliant (Lennon's \\"Imagine\\", McCartney \\"Band On The Run\\" and Harrison's \\"All Thing Must Past\\", sorry Ringo no mention for \\"Thomas The Tank Engine\\") they were never destined to reach these dizzying heights again.<br /> From Beach Boy knock offs to reggae and the unknown this has it all, if you're only allowed one album on your desert island make sure this is it.

B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD never ceases to enchant me. John Mayer's lyrics are so easy to connect with. I find it fun to listen to someone who feels he never quite fit in with anyone. Everything he sings about is very humble & true to life, which is refreshing from all the rap [stuff] that seems to haunt every radio station, telling women they're worthless & praising the playas. In addition, this is no Milli Vanilli. It is obvious throughout the CD that Mayer is an excellent guitar player & his voice sounds so real & from the heart. I definitely reccommend this CD!
B00003W8NM|5.0|After having refused to watch the film because of comments about how Brad Pitt is cute, I accidentally flipped channels when it was starting. I sat still through the whole thing, from the opening credits in the cerebral cortex to The Pixie's &quot;Where is my mind&quot; in the end. <br />I must say it was one of the few movies I have seen that has captured my undivided attention for so long - that made me go to the video store pick up the DVD only hours after watching it for the first time.<br />The dialogs are incredible and you will be blown away by how seemingly small and even funny remarks can sum up deeper concepts. Beware - if you have psychotic inclinations, I'd rather you didn't watch it because it can be, well, encouraging.<br />The glorious Helena Bohem-Carter hits the perfect tone playing Marla Singer and Edward Norton's performance is worthy of awards and standing ovations. I cannot believe how neglected this film was in regards to how the actors portrayed their characters. I was completely immersed in the story and feel the same every time I watch it.<br />The film's editing is also worthy of attention, because it managed to bring the story together without destroying the director's great work. A really successful cinematic acheievment. <br />I highly recommend it; try and find the Tyler Durden in you.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril has an amazing voice, and wonderful taste in music.  The only thing she lacks is good lyrics.  She has great potential, I just feel that she lacks experience at 17.  I still love the CD nonetheless.  It is definately something different, and it's about time.
B000063UR2|5.0|A glowing, phantasmal gem of a movie, \\"Legend\\" reminds you that unicorns are cool. <br />Ridley Scott's masterfully slow pace lets your breathe this movie in, almost smelling the wisps of summer flowers he so beautifully photographed. The soft focus imbues every shot with an ethereal quality of transcendence, whisking the viewer away from the humdrum lucidity of more realistic films.<br />Tangerine Dream's score is haunting, yet comforting, like a half-remembered favorite childhood dream. Tom Cruise masterfully embodies the rogue spirit of the hero, a more cunning Peter Pan. Mia Sara (even more lovely than her appearance in \\"Time Cop\\") captures the wide-eyed sweetness of the maiden, who marvels at the splendor<BR>of her world. Tim Currey's portrayal of the Dark Lord juxtaposes this well, like finding a horrid black spider lurking in a treasured heirloom.<br />It's difficult to believe the same director would go on to create the clanking, bloated \\"Gladiator.\\" \\"Legend\\" has no need for cruel violence, or a flawed hero on an empty quest for vengeance. Magnificent fantasy!
0345404475|1.0|From page one: \\"Friendlily, because he felt well-disposed toward the world...he patted her bare, pale shoulder.\\"<br />This guy writes lovelily, doesn't he? Aspiring science-fiction authors take note: Avoid turning adjectives that already end with \\"ly\\" into adverbs. Someone is bound to try to pronounce your prose aloud, trip over himself, and sue you. In any case, the \\"friendlily\\" in the above example is superfluous: ALL shoulder patting is friendly (this is the meaning of the gesture). A simple \\"He patted her shoulder\\" would have been much more effective.<br />From page two: \\"After a hurried breakfast - he had lost time due to the discussion with his wife - he ascended clad for venturing out, including his Ajax model Mountibank Lead Codpiece, to the covered roof pasture whereon his electric sheep grazed. Whereon it, sophisticated piece of hardware that it was, chomped away in simulated contentment, bamboozling the other tenants of the building.\\"<br />\\"He ascended clad for venturing out\\" is awkward and amateurish. \\"Clad\\", \\"whereon\\", \\"that it was\\", and \\"bamboozling\\" are affected. The nested \\"whereon\\"s are confusing. The colloquial \\"bamboozled\\" is inconsistent with the formal \\"clad\\" and \\"whereon\\". <br />In short, anyone with any literary discrimination at all will find this book unreadable.
B00005U16N|5.0|After reading the mixed reviews on this movie, I watched it with a high level of skepticism, but was quickly impressed by this movie, except I do have to say that Penelope Lopez's character got under my skin pretty quickly....perhaps another actress could have brought more depth to the role...?  Anyway, it kind of reminded me of watching Miami Vice, only from the other side and it was fascinating to watch how a small time drug dealer came to have one of the largest drug empires in U.S. History in such a short period of time.  I especially like one of the first scenes when they show cocaine being made in Columbia....leaves are ground up, turned into a paste, spread out on a table to dry, thus turning it into a powder firm which is then measured out to be distributed. It also causes you to feel for the Columbian people who are poor, and thus reliant on exporting this drug for economic survival....makes for a complicated political/moral situation.  I even felt myself feeling a little sorry for George Jung towards the end, but I could have felt more so if he had displayed more emotion throughout the film. It was sad to see his friends of all those years suddenly turn on him in order to save themselves from the Feds.  Just goes to show you what a ruthless business drug dealing is and like his dad said in the begining \\"money isn't all that important....it only seems like it is\\"...this could also be seen when he lost nearly all his money when his foreign bank was taken over by the new government. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that the movie wasn't as overly violent as it could have been given the subject matter...I think only two people were shot during the entire movie. Just goes to show you that a movie doesn't have to rely on violence and gore to be good...a good storyline can support it alone.....other movies today could learn from this.  The only thing I couldn't understand is why Johnny Depp bleached his hair blonde for the role when according to the photo shown at the end, the real George Jung was a brunette....?
B00005QDW1|1.0|Okay. I bought this CD thinking it would be the best thing in the world. Tragic Kindom and Return of Saturn kick [butt]...Sorry to say but...Rock Steady really stinks! It sounds all regae and jamacan and the sound is sooooo annoying! It's like \\"beep bop boop weenie weenie\\". It sounds like a freaking video game! This CD may be okay to play at a big party when no one is paying attention to the music. When I heard \\"Hey Baby\\", I liked it but it gets annoying after awhile and so do all of the other songs on the CD. \\"Hey Baby\\" is the best song on the CD but I don't recommend buying this. You'd be better off downloading it. Don't waste your money--you will be very disappointed. If you really want the CD, you should hear it first. ::gag:: I feel bad trashing No Doubt's CD because they totally rock! Sorry!
B00003CXI1|3.0|I must admit right up front that I have never read the J.K. Rowling novel on which \\"Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone\\" is based.  As a result, I come to the movie \\"cold\\" as it were, being neither a full-fledged aficionado nor an inveterate denigrator of this phenomenally popular book series that, in the past few years, has taken the literary world by storm.  Thus, I will not be able to say to what degree Chris Columbus' handsomely designed film adaptation does or does not do justice to its source.  All I can say is how the film struck someone like myself who comes to the material fresh and without expectations of any kind. Well, the verdict, I must say, is a decidedly mixed one, so please allow me to elaborate.<br />Let me state, at the outset, that the movie starts off splendidly.  We are introduced to the infant Harry Potter as he is mysteriously dropped off one night at the home of his maternal aunt and uncle in suburban England.  We quickly move ahead in time to find Harry, now aged 11, living a sort of male Cinderella existence, mistreated and overlooked by both his surrogate parents and Harry's precocious, spoiled brat cousin, appropriately named Dudley.  In the early stretches, the film does a superb job subtly injecting the excitement of magic into a real world setting.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor as Harry begins to slowly awaken to the fact that he has these strange and inexplicable powers to manipulate the elements of his world to his own advantage.  The film retains its spirit of fun as Harry, led by the mysterious but lovably burly Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid, journeys to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the tools of the trade towards which his eccentric destiny is leading him (his parents were also witches, killed by the evil wizard, Voldemort, who obviously has designs on Potter himself).  The preparations for Harry's enrollment in school (i.e. purchasing a magic wand) and the attempt to find his way to this magic hidden land are executed with fine, deft strokes, and Columbus keeps the movie blithely bouncing along at just the right momentum and speed.  Harry's introduction to the school itself is well done as well, as he meets an assortment of colorful characters (both faculty members and schoolmates) and boggles at the amusement park-like atmosphere he finds there, with an imaginative surprise seemingly lurking around ever corner.<br />Yet not too long after we hit the school, something seems to go out of \\"Harry Potter.\\"  Perhaps the anticipation raised by the first half of the film leads us to expect too much, but, if the truth be told, the storytellers don't seem to have thought much about what to do with Harry once they get him to his destination.  Though we like Potter's two chums, Ron and Hermione, and a number of the faculty members, the adventures Harry ends up encountering while at the school seem rather tame, bland and ordinary when you get right down to it.  The monsters the writers have dreamed up for him to conquer aren't particularly interesting or intriguing and the plotting itself lacks excitement and suspense.  In fact, structurally, the film seems more like a series of elaborate set pieces designed more to show off the special effects than to provide a unified narrative that builds and grows to a cumulative impact.  Even worse is that much of the ribald humor of the earlier part disappears as well.  Had more of that dry British wit we are treated to in the initial stages been carried all the way through the film, \\"Harry Potter\\" might not have come across as quite so flat and attenuated as it does.<br />On the positive side, Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance as Harry, capturing the innate goodness, wide-eyed innocence, and no-nonsense practicality of the character he's been called upon to play.  He makes of Harry a very real, very recognizable and very likable young boy.  Radcliffe is more than matched in performance by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, Harry's two finely drawn companions in adventure.  It's a pleasure, too, to see the wonderful Maggie Smith doing her Miss Jean Brodie bit again after all these years.  No one can convey the brittle starchiness of the English schoolmarm better than she.<br />\\"Harry Potter\\" is also a beautiful looking film, thanks to outstanding cinematography, production design and art direction.<br />So there you have it:  as I said earlier, a decidedly mixed bag of virtues and drawbacks.  Those already enamored of little Harry Potter will probably balk at my carping.  Those already driven mad by Potter-mania may think I am too indulgent in my overall assessment.  But for one who feels little personal stake in the Harry Potter deification/demonization battle, I must say that this is a pretty good film that, I suspect, could have been much better.Ron and Hermione, Harry's two finely drawn companions in adventure.

1573225517|1.0|I don't like the book because it's too introspective. For me, the main character Rob Flemming is not very symathic and I can't identify myself with him. The story is very boring and too long. The only character I like is Barry, Rob's friend, because he's funny. I think, even a mathbook is better than this book. I would only read the book when I would live alone on an Island and this would be the only readable thing, and even then I would prefer to light a fire with this book. I gave this book one star, because of the character Barry, the rest is [bad].
B00005NKKV|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel's first &quot;folk rock&quot; album from early 1966 is an essential purchase. This does not mean that the duo didn't improve considerably during the rest of the sixties. Still, the moody excitement is here, starting with the classic hit rocked-up version of &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; and the catchy &quot;I Am a Rock.&quot; Simon's guitar playing is excellent throughout, as are Garfunkel's evocative tenor harmonies. True, some of the lyrics on this album seem immature and self-conscious compared to Simon's later work; often they are depressing and lonely. But darnit, these are some *good songs* - &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; and &quot;April Come She Will&quot; remain achingly poignant after all these years, and the hurried tempo and bright harpsichord of &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot; drive home its message of youth and loss memorably. &quot;Blues Run the Game&quot; is a superb lost classic that had been added as a bonus track. (You will also find this track on the box set &quot;Old Friends.&quot;) The other bonus tracks on this CD version are from a later time (1970), and mostly consist of sloppy run-throughs of folk standards. They are none too memorable, but the album itself is.

B00005KHJV|4.0|This only has the TV version in Dolby 2.O mono sound. The 2 disc set collectors edition that is now out of print came with this TV version in Dolby 2.O mono sound plus the other disc was the normal version in an OUTSTANDING Dolby 5.1 digital remaster. I have seen the extra footage on the tv version disc but I always watch the regular version because the sound is really great. It sounds like a brand new movie. Yes this new version is good but it is a shame they left out the new enhanced version of the film. That is why I give it 4 out of 5 stars. But I read somewhere that a new 25th aniversary edition is going to be put out next year and I bet they make it a 2 disc set or at least have the Dolby 5.1 theatrical version in the set. I also read that it will have a directors comentary on it! HALLOWEEN FANS just hold out a little longer for this version to come out so you have both versions of this great horror classic.

B0000028PI|3.0|all right, pretty good for alice. but if you like this, i suggest you listen to the orignal versions of &quot;unholy war&quot; and &quot;stolen prayer&quot; (that is the correct name, notice the word &quot;stolen&quot; is ommited?, how ironic) anyway, these two songs were written by chris cornell and were released on a few soundgarden bootlegs. the one that comes to mind is the &quot;songs for ozzy&quot; bootleg. (they were supposedley written for him). the quality is not the greatest, but chris' rendition of &quot;stolen prayer&quot; is very good, i think he even sounds like ozzy sort of. and if you read the liner notes, you will notice that chris is credited with singing back-up vocals on this album. i don't mean to sound like i'm putting alice down or anything, but just for yer info, ya know.

(You will also find this track on the box set \\"Old Friends.\\") The other bonus tracks on this CD version are from a later time (1970), and mostly consist of sloppy run-throughs of folk standards. They are none too memorable, but the album itself is.
0312265859|3.0|I have been a huge Evanovich fan from the very first Plum novel.  I was very disappointed in \\"Hard Eight.\\"  For seven whole books she stringed us along wondering what Ranger would be like, only to let us down with the extremely short result.  I found all her adventures in this novel were too neatly wrapped up.  Her criminals were too easily caught too quickly.  I don't want to give away details, so it's hard to explain myself as fully as I would like to, but I hope the next Plum mystery has more meat to it than this one did.
0743455967|5.0|No student of writing should miss this terrific memoir/primer because it is more than a how-to on the process; it is the &quot;story&quot; of how-to.  The gems of wisdom abound in this one, the most important of which is probably &quot;write because you love it, not to make money&quot;--this from the most financially successful writer of all time.  The master scribe tells all in a chatty, down-to-earth manner that dispenses with pretention and makes the learnin easy and the time fly all too fast.  The whole book is great, but my favorite parts are his recollections of childhood: fartin Eulah-Beulah; those lying doctors; mad scientist brother Dave; Carrie, his first book sale; his introduction to alcohol; the sad scene on his mother's last day.  Also important for me were his very clear explanations of how he came to write Carrie, The Stand, Mysery, The Dead Zone, From a Buick 8, and some of the pitfalls and changes of direction he encountered in the process.  I was also pleased to learn that my favorite King book, the non-scary, non-thriller Dead Zone, is one he considers amnong his best.  I have tried to convince people for years that Stephen King's secret is not in his imaginative (some say outlandish) plots, but in his emphasis on creating good characters.  This book proves it.  King is a great writer because he understands people, not monsters and aliens; and coming from a background such as his, we couldn't have expected any less.  He was, and is, a family man, and families are made up of people.  Thanks for letting us into your world for a little while, Mr. King.  In your own words, this book &quot;resonates.&quot;  Pow!
B00003CXCS|5.0|I love this movie. And I'm a young lady who was raised with musicals. But it's my number 1. Julie Andrews is beautiful in this and I love the scenery and I love the Music.Plus there is not one bad actor or actress in that entire film.If you have not seen &quot;Sound of Music&quot; you are missing out on a great film.It's a great movie that both you and kids can enjoy together. Don't wait another day to by the DVD.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Definitely a square, but I hope this guy won't be just another one hit wonder. His first effort was definitely worth my dollar. Not for those looking for more exciting (or louder) music, he reminds me more of Steely Dan from back in the day. Soothing music, cute lyrics. He wants it to be like 1983 again in one tune, looking for his dream girl in the sandbox in another. My fave, &quot;St Patricks Day&quot;. 2nd fave, the one I heard on the radio that got me to buy this CD (No Such Thing). In my opinion, he deserves a good look for &quot;best new artist&quot; when the award shows come around. Keep it up, John, and don't try to perfect your formula too much with your next effort. You've already got me hooked with this one.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is rediculisly funny. The Dvd has a bunch of cool extra features featuring the Camelot song in lego format! So, if you like stupid humor and a Monty Python fan youll deffinetly love this film. A MUST BUY!!!
B000062X90|5.0|I was first turned on to this disk in '72 or '73.It was and is great for all of the reasons you can read on the other reviews on this site. I address the improvements of the remastered version. The album was poorly mastered from the beginning. The vocals, guitar leads sounded like they were coming out the end of a train tunnel, and the bass was nondescipt. and the length of the program material was such that those little grooves were just crammed together. No matter the care you could take in handling and cleaning,the record was good for a limited number of plays, then it was done. When I bought the original cd,it was much improved. Much better definition of Martin Turner's bass effort,but still that nagging hiss in the backround, epecially during the acoustic sections. I just received my copy of the remastered and extended version and was blown away by the improvement.It was like I'd had blankets wrapped around my very considerable speakers ripped away for the first time. Clear vocals; stinging twin guitar leads,a clear and more localized bassline on the sound stage. I was truely excited. But you hardcore Argus fans be aware, there is stuff missing, Like the long fade in on The King Will Come is gone! Its a shortened version, and I'm sick about it. There are more omissions (changes?)that the new Ash fan or a casual listener won't notice and I'm not suggesting that the \\"old \\" CD should be the preferred version.just letting long time Argus fans who are critical listeners know that its not exactly the same as the orginal.

0425152251|5.0|Reading books on philosophy issues, or about any specific philosopher, was always boring to me.<BR>This book really made me enjoy the different ways different philosophers treated a same issue.<BR>Because it's easy to read.<BR>Because it's not boring.<BR>Because it showed how philosophy thinking developed through the centuries, and even came back on the same way of thinking after centuries.<BR>I haven't yet found another book on philosophy not boring.<BR>RECOMMENDED
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Poor writing, self-conscious film making and a chaotic plot are just some of the highlights of this pile of stink. This is the story of a troubled teen who is tormented by hallucinations of a rabbit. The problem is that the antagonist is not clearly defined untill the very end of the film and even then it is questionable. Is the antagonist the rabbit? bullies? schizophrenia? parents? teachers? the motivational speaker? the world? the universe? etc.<br />I still don't know. But it is all neatly explained and resolved by a nice tidy wormhole and grandma death's \\"Philosophy of Time Travel\\" book. It is a mistake in my opinion to have a protagonist faced with a multitude of problems, and have the problems resolved by a \\"miracle\\". Actually the film broke all the traditional rules of structure and I don't think this was intententional. It was because the writer/director doesn't know them.<br />A lack of structure in film is easy to pass off as original and experimental if there are some well know actors and the themes are confusing. I love fantasy and horror movies but this DVD falls into the genre of drink coaster.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Frankly, I can't STAND the Resident Evil video games; they're slow and pointless. But for some reason, I truly enjoyed the movie. Maybe it's because it has nothing to do with the games; or maybe it's because I just enjoy seeing zombies get killed. Whatever it is, I recommend this movie to anyone who's in the mood for a solid action flick.
B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi depicts a world that represents \\"Life Out of Balance.\\"  Koyaanisqatsi has no words.  It uses pictures of our decaying society to make its powerful message clear.  I agree with whoever said that the -Qatsi series is explicitly leftist.  Whether or not this is true I can't say here... but the very fact that this film is so powerful should convince you to get it.
B000006OS2|1.0|Although I LOVE the movie &quot;McLintock!&quot;, I HATED this particular version.  It looks as if it had been produced in someone's basement by recording the movie from a television screen and putting it onto a DVD. I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought the DVD, as they all agree with me. (I will be returning it immediately!) DO NOT PURCHASE THE GOODTIMES DVD VERSION.  It is AWFUL!!  Look for another version at your local DVD store.  The movie itself is hilarious!!
B000002UAR|5.0|This CD is really a good one.  Instrumental harmony of the beatles is demonstrated to the fullest.  Lyrics bright.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I love these books...I can read them in a night, and I have done so at least 5 times with each.  But seriously, this movie [disappointed]!  The choice of actors was very agreeable, but the movie was too condensed.  Humor, depth and spirit was lost as the director tried to stick play by play to the plot.  It is not the plot of Harry Potter that makes it so good...its the interactions between the characters, their dialogue and friendship.  The movie ignored that.  Special effects just made me laugh; the troll was so bad.  The movie actually bored me to death.  This is no masterpiece!
B000024KBA|4.0|THIS ALBUM IS INSANE..and I mean that in a good way! I played<br />a friend of mine the song IF IT'S IN YOU and she yelled at me, saying TAKE THAT... OUT OF MY TAPE PLAYER! I think she missed the point. The sloppiness and the clumsiness is one of this album's many charms. SYD sounds like he can barely handle the chord changes and his strumming is very sloppy indeed, but the songs are so darn good that it hardly matters! IF anything, songs like LOVE YOU(my favorite track here) BENEFIT from the sloppy playing.I love everything about this song, from the piano playing, the barely audible tuba solo and the clumsy rhythm track, to SYD'S lyrics and singing. IT sounds like he's about ready to fall down as he's singing, but the rights himself back up just in time!OCTOPUS is also a great song and the most PINK FLOYD-like song here, especially SYD'S vocal on this song. I don't think that SYD BARRETT was a genius, but I do love this album! HERE I GO is another outstanding song!!!<br />BUY IT, BUB!
B0000029DD|5.0|First time I heard this album I was on a road trip with my brother; next thing I knew I had listened to it three times in a row. I bought it soon after, and I must say that this is one of those few albums in my life that is few and far between, because I can honestly say that I love EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM. That doesn't happen very often, you know? Most of the time I buy albums because there was one or two songs that I heard that I liked and I thought I would try the rest of the album out, usually to meet with some disappointment. Here, of course, that was not the case. One of the main reasons I love this album is the scope of emotion that it covers; just like we as human beings can feel every emotion in a single day, so does this album in a single sit-down. I just LOVE an album like that. Favorite songs include the standard favorites &quot;This is our Last Goodbye&quot; (my brother and I believe this to be one of the better songs EVER - there's a reason why it is a favorite of everyone's), and &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (quite different from Leonard Cohen, but still gives the original a run for its money). The arrangement of the songs never overwhelms the message, which is surprisingly simple and thoroughly complex at the same time. I am also a HUGE fan of his lyrics; anyone who could write the words &quot;She's a tear that hangs inside my soul forever&quot; had to be an interesting person. Please listen to this album; I hope you like it as much as I do.
B00005JKNB|1.0|What a fool I was not to trust the reviewers.  I rarely get mad, but I must admit that I was very [angry] for having wasted [my money] and 2 and 1/2 hours of my life to this piece of... whatever.  It's all Jim Carrey mugging, Martin Landau looking really old, and corny political speeches and untruthful sentimentality.  I suppose it is retro Frank Capra, but this film is pathetic as compared to classics like \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,\\" or \\"It Happened One Night.\\"  It's really not just stupid to compare them.  It's wrong.
B000002B1M|4.0|When Nas released \\"It Was Written\\" it was in a difficult place as it was the follow up to \\"Illmatic\\". Does this album follow the magic in \\"Illmatic\\"? No. Is it a good album? Yes! Therein lies the problem, as this is a good album, but it is not a classic like the latter. So by most Nas was to be considered as falling off, when rather he should be considered as still making a good album (just not as good as his last). <BR>Where \\"Illmatic\\" started off with a great intro, \\"It Was Written\\" has a horrible intro that should have been left off. \\"The Message\\" has a nice beat, followed by Nas' masterful lyrical ability. \\"Street Dreams\\" seems like a very odd song to be hearing from Nas after his last album. However, once one realizes and accepts that Nas is growing and changing as an artist then this song can be appreciated. \\"I Gave You Power\\" produced by DJ Premier is the best song on the album. Nas creates an amazing story as he tells the life story of a gun. This song is incredibly impressive. \\"Watch Dem N-----\\" has a funky beat and Nas once again shows his lyrical superiority. On \\"Nas Is Coming\\" you can see that Nas sounds great over Dr. Dre's beats, however it also shows that he sounds much better with Premier. This is the classic song that proves that Nas is at his very best with Premier. \\"Affirmative Action\\" is the lead into The Firm album as it features AZ, Cormega, and Foxy Brown. \\"Black Girl Lost\\" shows Nas' ability to speak on important topics. \\"Shootouts\\" has a simply amazing beat and this is one of the albums highlights. \\"If I Ruled The World\\" is a clever song from Nas, but again shows the transformation from Nasty Nas to Nas Escobar. <BR>The production on this album is very consistent and all flows together very well as no beats seem out of place. However the production is technically very different and nowhere near as good as on \\"Illmatic\\". Nas also raps in a much more relaxed style, rather than the vicious, fast-paced flow he brought on \\"Illmatic\\". If you havenot bought any previous Nas albums before, you should try listening to his albums, but I would not buy this one first. This is his fourth best album, as \\"Illmatic\\", \\"Stillmatic\\", and \\"I Am...\\" are all better than this one. However if you are a Nas fan and want more Nas music to listen to you definitely should get this album.
B00005V9L1|4.0|I would actually give it 4 and 1/2 stars.  I was afraid it was just going to be weird for weirdness sake (which it is) but it is also weird to be funny, and the movie is hilarious.  The director has seen way too many movies and is obviously Mr. Film Student, the movie uses just about every technical technique that anyone has ever thought of at some point or another during the narrative.  Normally that bothers me, but this movie is so out there that it works.  All the social/political references really helped ground the period in it's time (the 80's), instead of just fashion and hairstyle as most movies do.  Jenna Malone is a really good young actress (hot too).  The rabbit is hilarious.  Best Patrick Swayze performance ever!  Still can't decide whether the director actually took the thematic material seriously and had a point to it, or whether it was just a big joke.  In the end I guess it doesn't matter, you get what you get from it.
B0000029GA|5.0|For anyone who calls themselves a hip-hop fan and has not heard this album you should get it right now because this is one of, if not the best hip-hop album of all-time. Nasir Jones, \\"Nasty Nas\\" made the most dense and satisfying album in hip-hop's history. Most albums are a mixture of good and bad songs. This album does not even have a bad sentence.<br />\\"Illmatic\\" starts of with \\"The Genesis\\". A great beat as Nas sets the listener up for the rest of the album. \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\" takes right off of the images Rakim was providing when he was making his classics. Unbelievable flow from Nas as he venomously raps over an amazing beat. \\"Life's A B----\\" features the albums only guest appearance. AZ provides a memorable verse and should be considered as one of the top 3 greatest guest appearances of all-time. On \\"The World Is Yours\\" Nas yet again uses lyrics that create images that are crystal clear. His storytelling is amazing. \\"Halftime\\" is a classic \\"old school\\" feeling song with a great mixture of many instruments. This song is incredibly addicting (all of them are, but this one especially). \\"Memory Lane\\" is a great song with a real smooth beat. The background singing gives this song the depth it needs to be yet another classic. \\"One Love\\" uses a real funky beat as Nas again has his storytelling on full display. \\"One Time 4 Your Mind\\" is an incredibly funky beat as Nas gives the listener lyrics that will make you want to keep pressing the back button. \\"Represent\\" is a raw song with some deep street stories from Nas. \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" has a booming bass line that goes perfectly with Nas' sharp lyrics.<br />This album is hip-hop at its finest. It just does not get any better than this. The lyrics seem to just flow effortlessly out of Nas' mouth as he raps fast-paced with a lot of energy. Every hip-hop fan should own this album as it is simply unbelievable. Perfectly done as there are 10 songs and at the end of the album you are left dying for more.
B000068QY7|3.0|I think when we all think of the defining Oasis tunes, we harken back to DM and WTSMG.  My personal main reason for this is b/c they were guitar-driven, anthem songs with an edge. <br />Their latest starts out OK enough with Hindu Times, Force of Nature, and my favorite Hung in a Bad Place but fades from here to more slower tunes without the driving guitar edge I prefer from them.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I think this movie as the best and I really want to own it.  After seeing it 4 times I just got to see it again for the 5th time or 6,7,8,9,10.... so on and so on...
B000002ADT|5.0|Okay, what I want to know is, does it get any better than this? This is one of those \\"jaw droppers\\" where it just leaves you wondering how in the world did they come up with this? And the answer is, I feel, that they were \\"not of this world\\" when they did it...they couldn't have been! The music is too divinely inspired, too ethereal to just have been made by mere flesh and blood. Miles Davis doesn't just got soul, Soul's got Miles Davis. There are mournful lows, elated highs, tears of sorrow, tears of joy. This baby has it all! This recording will never die. As long as the earth keeps spinning in its orbit, this classic will be around long after we are all gone. If you aren't totally enchanted by this CD, you might want to go to a doctor and have him take your pulse. You could, just quite possibly be dead. Spend the [money]. It'll give you more than your money's worth!
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is great. It sounds very personal. And, dispite what other people say, I don't think she sounds that [angry].
B0000025P9|5.0|Feel the need to get &quot;pumped up,' throwing off the formalities of alternative, classical &amp; jazz music? Toto IV's use of male voices, synthesizer, guitar and percussion offer a reasonably well-written, fun, harmless blast from the past. The tribal rhythms of  &quot;Africa&quot; and idealized romanticism of &quot;Roseanna&quot; reconnect thirty-somethings via this affirmational, morally inoffensive reminiscence about 80's pop culture.
1573225517|1.0|In conclusion I can say that Nick Hornby`s book is not the type of book I like to read. In the book there are too many moods and thoughts and nothing really happens. You could take out half of the pages and you would not have problems to understand the book. The only really funny person in the book is Barry. He made me laugh one or two times when he made jokes about people who came into the shop. The funniest scene in the book is when Ian calls Rob and Rob thinks about some possibilities what he could say to Ian. I think that this book is for women because it has no plot but lots of &quot;grease&quot;, thoughts and moods as in Titanic. I would say to every man who wants to read the book: &quot;Leave it&quot;.
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is one of the most powerful war movies of the last 20 years!  Ridley Scott is unrelenting in his portrayal of Mark Bowden's riveting book of the same name.  Though some of the movie's character portrayals are inconsistent with Bowden's  detailed chronical of actual events, the film does an outstanding job depicting the noise, confusion and horror of close quarters infantry combat against a determined enemy.  Politics aside, Black Hawk Down focuses on the fantastic heroism and fighting abilities of elite U.S. soldiers placed in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The movie's realism grabbed me, shocked me and made me proud of being an American.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Despite all the criticism pro and con, this film has an excellent chance to become a classic.  Although it was targeted to the same audience identity that made films like Raiders, Star Wars, E.T., Back To The Future, Jurassic Park blockbusters, it helps to remember that this one is different...this one is Shakespeare and it does what the Bard himself did over and over again.....appeal to the masses.  Sure it's \\"cute\\", sure it has some historical issues, but it has the great ability to appeal at all levels.<br />...If you don't like Shakespeare, so what?....it's a great romance movie.<BR>If you don't like historical films, so what?....it's got a great plot and impressive acting.<BR>If you love Shakespeare, so what?.....get a life.....it's funny....get it, funny?<BR>If you think this is moronic.....learn to sit back and relax....take it for what it's worth....a nicely done historical fiction with great acting and sets.....personally, it's one of my favorites just because it makes EVERYONE either love it or hate it....and until you give it a chance (which may require multiple viewings for anyone who thinks this is a 1-dimensional film), you won't know which now, will you?
B00005B36H|5.0|This cd frequently gets stuck in my cd player for obvious reasons.  First, i'm fond of anything new or experimental.  For Tool, this cd is like a gem compared to their other cds (which, with my comparison, seem like rough stones).  A very &quot;polished&quot; album, Tool takes everything that makes them good and lets it show through.  Second reason this album is worth the buy is the music (obviously).  Let me put it this way, if you're going to portray a dark, scary mood, do it right.  Tool does it right.  Not that the album particuarly scares me (as the other ones try moreso to do), it's that the album is a behemoth as far as this particular musicmanship goes.  When compared to other &quot;dark&quot; bands (NIN, Deftones, etc.), this band is now the reigning champion, and this album is the reason.<br />The songs on this album are amazing.  They average at about 8-9 minutes (when excluding the short, intro-ish songs).  For a hard rock band, this is a feat.  <br />The artwork for the album is very, very nice.  It is the first glimpse of what kind of album this is, and what kind of band Tool is.  And while most bands dismiss the use of artwork in their albums, Tool uses it to their advantage.<br />Although this album is gloomy, the lyrics are beautiful.  Although the music is dark, it's intriguing.  Although most people would think of Tool as &quot;just another rock band&quot;, they're not.  Get this album to understand why.
038533558X|5.0|\\"Gone For Good\\" by Harlan Coben is spectacular. An ingenuous fast-paced plot full of numerous deceptions, double identities, misplaced faith and countless twists and turns.<br />There are surprises every chapter, making it almost impossible to put down until you've read \\"just one more chapter.\\"<br />Mr. Coben does not just throw the reader an occasional curve---he throws sliders and change-ups as well, misdirecting the reader in a myriad of ways.<br />Protagonist Will Klein's life is unraveling after he learns his brother (thought dead for eleven years) is alive and part of a sinister conspiracy.<br />No one, from family, friends and enemies is who they appear to be.<br />\\"Gone For Gone\\" is engrossing suspense that is unpredictable. You may sleep with the light on after reading this one. A Plus.
B00006ADG8|5.0|A Gem. Missing from the video marketplace for a long time.<BR>This Herman Melville classic directed and starring Peter Ustinov is not to be missed. Robert Ryan in one of his most<BR>sadisic roles, and a perfect cast to backup the first appearence of Terence Stamp in his first role that brought him an <BR>Best Supporting Academy Award Nomination. Wow, is he good.
B000066NW0|5.0|The album is absolutely great, I believe that everyone with a taste for punk, pop and rock must love Avril.  I hope she comes to South America!
B00005AREQ|5.0|This is supposedly the reigning album of all the instrumental efforts that emerged in the '70s. True to its hype, this is Jeff Beck's masterpiece. Listening to the album, Beck's fingers seem to move effortlessly over the guitar strings. At the same time, it's very structured and intricate. Like a glitter picture with all the excess brushed off, Jeff plays the guitar with no filler in between the notes-the notes that only this guy, who has earned his reputation by being in a countless number of well-respected bands: Yardbirds, JB Group, etc., can play. The song, &quot;You Know What I Mean&quot;, exudes funk, along with a feel-good melody. Beck has this ability to take complete control of a guitar (whether it be a Telecaster, Gibson, or whatever is in front of him) and make the listener forget about the 'all-important' lyrics and lead singer; two things that might be desired if a bad guitarist was filling up four minutes with tired shlop. And, unlike many guitarists who are bored with their job and are constantly waiting for each song to come to a stop, Beck sounds as if he actually wants to play even beyond the time limit given to him, which is, kind of a change from todays musicians with their attitude of, &quot;Screw this, I'm going home.&quot; &quot;Blow By Blow&quot; is, in my opinion, Jeff Beck's finest.
1573225517|2.0|The book tells the story about a 35-year old man called Rob. He has his own record shop and many problems with girls and women. His girlfriend Laura left him and now he wants to sort out his old relationships. He calls five girls he once loved to know why they split up. Every woman reacts in a different way.<BR>His friends are Barry and Dick who help him in his record shop although there is not much work. Barry is a mess and Dick is very shy.<BR>Most of the time the book is easy to read and sometimes even easy to understand. The language reflects Rob's chaotic way of life. There are many trains of thoughts in brackets in some chapters. I would give 2 stars to the book because the book is not fascinating and in many chapters boring because there is no real plot.
B0000640VO|5.0|I absolutley loved this movie. I usually am not fond of these types of movies (chick flicks). Thinking this is a chick flick, I entered the theatre doubtful. The movie started and I could not take my eyes off it. The star, Audrey Tautou, is absolutely stunning. Her mixture of beauty, brains, and bashfulness make her perfect for the role. Like I said, I'm a high-school guy who is not into the chick flicks, I like the Farrelly bros., John Waters, John Woo, and Kevin Smith. This IS NOT a chick flick, it is for everyone. It is my belief that this is one of the 10 best movies ever made.
1573225517|2.0|The book &quot;High Fidelity&quot; deals with the story of Rob who has his own record shop and who has been left by his girlfriend Laura. Now he wants to start a new life. To clear up he wants to see five of his exes again.<BR>I did not like this book very much. For me it was too pretentious because I did not understand much of the vokabulary.<BR>I also find the characters of the main persons strange. The book is too unrealistic and too long for the instruction.<BR>I think the characters are very crazy. I prefer other books.<BR>If I had to give stars to this book, I would choose two stars.
B000002I55|1.0|Duke Ellington wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Some really DO dig distortion.  Abstraction can reach a point where it represents or says anything the artist claims . . . But if you want to be IN, just make believe you dig it, man!&quot;  To me, this summed up Ornette Coleman's following in a nutshell.  I'm pretty sure Duke was describing anyone who rated this album five stars.<br />This album presents an interesting concept - a return to collective improvisation, but without any kind of rhythmic or harmonic limitations.  Theoretically, it would be interesting to hear Eric Dolphy and Don Cherry &quot;comment&quot; behind an Ornette Coleman solo, much like all jazz drummers do behind a soloist.  However, without any kind of melody to work from, the result is an absolute mess.  Dolphy comments with something that clashes horribly with what Coleman has moved to, while Cherry jumps in to add to the cacophony.  I like Eric Dolphy, and I like Charlie Haden, and I even like some of Ornette's unaccompanied playing.  But I also like pizza, orange juice, and mint ice cream.  Do I like those foods thrown together?  Heck no.  For all intents and purposes, they may as well just have recorded all eight musicians in seperate rooms with a metronome and layered it together.<br />I fear that your jazz neophyte or casual jazz fan will see this album's five star rating and think it is a jazz classic on par with &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; or &quot;A Love Supreme.&quot;  It simply isn't.  It is painful to listen to.  It is disjointed and by its very nature cannot have any kind of theme or meaning.  Anyone who says otherwise either sees something in it that I don't, or they're just trying to be hipper and more intellectual than the general public who will hate this album.  More than anything, this is a failed experiment.<br />Don't be fooled.  If you want to risk wasting twelve bucks, then buy the album, but I suspect most people will not even make it through the whole thing once.
1573225517|2.0|The book tells the story about a 35-year old man called Rob. He has his own record shop and many problems with girls and women. His girlfriend Laura left him and now he wants to sort out his old relationships. He calls five girls he once loved to know why they split up. Every woman reacts in a different way.<BR>His friends are Barry and Dick who help him in his record shop although there is not much work. Barry is a mess and Dick is very shy.<BR>Most of the time the book is easy to read and sometimes even easy to understand. The language reflects Rob's chaotic way of life. There are many trains of thoughts in brackets in some chapters. I would give 2 stars to the book because the book is not fascinating and in many chapters boring because there is no real plot.
B00003CXSP|3.0|While it was thrilling and exciting like the first, it wasn't all that I thought it could have been.  Some parts just didn't seem as scary, but it was good enough that I bought it.  The DVD also gives an alternate ending.
B00005JKED|4.0|ETHAN HAWK'S ROLE IN THIS MOVIE SEEMED TO BE THE MORE AMAZING ACTING JOB. WASHINGTON IS GREAT TOO, AND PERHAPS HIS PLAYING AN UNSYMPATHETIC CHARACTER HELPED HIM GARNISH VOTES FOR THE ACADEMY AWARD. SNOOP DOGG ALSO DID SOME PRETTY FINE ACTING AS A CRIPPLED CRACK DEALER. DR. DRE SHOULD STICK TO MAKING RECORDS HOWEVER. GREAT MOVIE THOUGH, I ENJOYED IT.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|This Director's Cut edition of Pearl Harbor is a must-own for any fan of the movie. Even if you own the original DVD release, you should still get this, especially since you get a ... rebate for upgrading. The casing for this set is a collector's item in itself. It's supposed to look like the journal of a WWII soldier, and includes four commemorative postcards. The four-disc set includes everything that was on the original DVD, plus several hours of extra features.<br />Probably my favorite addition to this collection is the attack scene deconstruction. You can watch this 30 minute scene either as it appears in the movie, an on-the-set montage, as a storyboard and animation sequence, or as a combination of all three. Then you can choose to hear along with that the sound from the movie, just the sound effects, on the set sounds, or a choice of several different commentaries. You should also enjoy watching the director's cut version of the movie with many shots that were edited out in the original version. You'll notice many of them as soon as you see them.<br />I just have a few complaints about this DVD set. First, I still don't understand why the movie has to be split up onto two discs. It's annoying to have to get up in the middle of the movie and change discs. I realize that the movie is 3 hours long, but there has to be a way to get around cutting the movie in half. Also, with a 4-disc set I guess I was hoping for a few more special features. Some deleted scenes and outtakes would have been nice, and maybe an opportunity to use the multi-angle feature that DVD players are capable of that rarely gets used. Features like these definitely would have made this worth the extra money.<br />Still, this is a great movie. I know there have been complaints about \\"dramatic license\\", but let's face it--if movies based on real-life events stuck strictly to the facts, they wouldn't be very entertaining; they would just be history lessons with expensive actors and special effects. If you take away the fictional storyline, Pearl Harbor did a great job of relaying the historical facts from every possible angle. If you enjoyed the movie as much as I did, it just might be worth paying an extra few dollars for the Director's Cut.
B000002AH7|5.0|With ROUND MIDNIGHT and KIND OF BLUE,SKETCHES OF SPAIN is among the best of MILES.Not only the title tracks delivers but all the numbers reach their goals of letting you melt into the FLAMENCO flavour in mysterious ways.You probably heard the concerto's adagio before ,but maybe did not know that MILES recorded it if you are not a jazz fanatic.Let there be known here that the bonus tracks are not just fillers.Some say that this is elevator type of music;nonsense,it's just that they could not elevated themselves high enough to get down and listen to it.Worth having in your music library for sure.
0345448898|5.0|In the trilogy of His Dark Materials Pullman guides readers through a fantastic and thrilling epic adventure.  The Golden Compass is the most innocent of the three books, whereas the second, and especially third book, take on a more mature status.  These are books that never lose their touch, no matter how many times you read them.  A rollercoaster of emotions lends feeling, and all the characters have amazing depth. Though these books may not be for the die hard christian, they should be read with an open heart and mind.  They will have you wishing you had a daemon too.(a personification of the soul in the form of an animal) If you are anything like me, you won't be able to put them down.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Fred Durst (he of the red cap) is a genius.  His rhymes bust with rhythm and sincerity, his voice peaks at times with true strung-out passion.  Trust me, doggs, the songs on this record flat out rock; they're bold, layered, and in-yo-face!!<br />What's bold about this record (besides the revolutionary lyrics and singing/rapping style) is the slammin' guitars by Wes Borland.  The drums are hardcore too, if not a little 1-dimensional at times.   <br />Why waste time with grunge, metal, and pop?  Limp Bizkit has saved rock and roll with a melding of hardcore rap and severe hard rock.  Grab your seatbelt, folks.  <br />Fred Durst is a real genius.<br />I'll talk to you later.
6300214400|4.0|Naturally, the Star Trek franchise wasn't going to let Spock simply rest in peace, so who better to bring Spock back to life than Leonard Nimoy himself.  Though a quality effort in every way, this has been a somewhat underappreciated Trek movie, perhaps because it had the simple misfortune to come right after the great Wrath of Khan.  Star Trek III does pale next to its predecessor, but so does every other Trek film.  Looked at on its own, The Search for Spock certainly meets every reasonable expectation.  Good humor, the first appearance of a Klingon cloaking device, strong action, the return of Sarek, a stirring subtext on loyalty and friendship, and the dramatic demise of both Kirk's son and the Starship Enterprise itself.  Not to mention Robin Curtis seamlessly stepping in as Saavik and the great Christopher Lloyd as Commander Kruge, the baddest Klingon ever.  Not the definitive Star Trek, but stalwart sci-fi entertainment.
B000002KHH|2.0|The heavy riffs on this album are sludge-filled and dreary - and I guess that's how Black Sabbath wanted them, right?  I'm perplexed by the lack of energy and innovation by this supposed historic band, on this their debut record.  <br />What's most strange, however, are the lyrics and demeanor of lead singer Ozzie Osbourne.  What's his deal, anyway?  I've come to know him as the fun-loving, very well-meaning dad on the hit t.v. show, \\"The Osbournes.\\"  Yet, on this record, his vocal delivery and tone is angry, depressing, and just plain strange, so different from his normal cheery self.  Perhaps he was having a bad week in England when this \\"monumental\\" hard rock dross was being created.  <br />If you want true satanistic metal, get \\"Unleash the Beast\\" by Dokken, a much more revolutionary band.<br />Check ya' later!!
1573225517|1.0|&quot;High Fidelity&quot; is about the life of the record shop owner Rob Flemming who has just been left by his girlfriend Laura. To find out why every girl breaks up with him he meets all of his &quot;top five most memorable split-ups&quot;. Eventually Rob and Laura get together again and they will live happily ever after.<BR>I think the book is not very interesting but maybe this is just because I'm not intelligent enough to get the point.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I wouldn't miss the edgy pop rock created by these music virtuosos.  Quite simply, Radiohead are legends in their own time...and the music's just beginning!! <br />And to think this band started out as a drab alternative grunge band on \\"Pablo Honey.\\"  They progressed to a better grunge band on \\"The Bends,\\" then chose to completely rip off Pink Floyd on the dull \\"O.K. Computer.\\"  On \\"Kid A\\" Radiohead became a total space-age garbage band, and many were left to simply stand back and scratch their head.  Where was the genius material the critics kept talking about??<br />It's right here.<br />Turns out that \\"Amnesiac\\" is the record everybody expected from Radiohead.  It perfectly blends their natural grunge style with the spaciness of \\"O.K. Computer\\" and \\"Kid A.\\"  How can you go wrong with that magical combo?  <br />You can't.<br />Believe the hype, then buy this record.<br />You won't be disappointed.  <br />Thanks!!
1573225517|1.0|The book about Rob Fleming is, in my opinion, bad. There isn't really a plot. Rob is only thinking or speaking about his girls. He's only talking about love and sex and which of his girls was the best. For every thing Rob makes a top 5 list. He's a bit like a psycho. <BR>Because of this it is not easy to like this book with these strange characters.
B00004NRWH|3.0|It's nothing revolutionary, but then again, neither were 38-Special.<br />It's just some good down-home rock by people who know how to play.<br />Not bad!!!
B000006NPY|5.0|Written during his mother's illness due to cancer, Billy Corgan unleashed his masterpiece. For me it was actually his first masterpiece: Adore. As said the mishap with his mother, it is easy to conceive how sad this album might be.The lyrics are a great surprise, and I guess that is the reason I like Adore so much, because it drives such a feeling of sadness, childhood memories and conducts to Corgan's point of views, analysis and complexes (&quot;Blank Page&quot;). The band this time stays alternating from acoustic guitars to piano and eletronica,like the opener &quot;To Sheila&quot;, the explosive beats of &quot;Ava Adore&quot; or the overwhelming &quot;For Martha&quot;. My favourite cuts here are propably &quot;Annie-Dog&quot; and the crushed-heart-like &quot;Crestfallen&quot;. <br />Fans who wait follow ups to rockers like &quot;X.Y.U.&quot; and &quot;Geek USA&quot;, I'd ask you to put this album aside. Recommended only for Pumpkins fans who are longing for something different.
B00005YXZH|1.0|ZZZZZZZ.....oh, I'm sorry, I was dozing off while listening to the latest overrated cd by Wilco.  Someone want to tell me what all the fuss is about, cuz Da Peace Dogg just don't git it.<br />The music on \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is as perplexing as its dumb title.  Sloppy musical arrangements were mostly lame when Pavement (another highly overrated band) half-heartedly tried them, and Wilco are no better when they attempt such junk.  <br />This music just sounds burned out - no spirit, no sense of fun, no real message in the lyrics.  If this band is supposed to be The Beatles of the new millennium, then I guess we're all in for a pretty weak thousand years of rock music.  The dude who left this band was right on target, and it's no wonder that Wilco's former label dropped them like the latest singer in Van Halen.<br />If you want troo music, git The Strokes; their debut album can't be touched.  I would also recommend Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Hives, Pete Yorn, Iron Maiden, Pearl Jam, STP, and White Stripes.<br />As for this disc, I'd leave it on the store shelf, or in the trash bin if you were unlucky enough to purchase it.<br />SEE YA!!!!
0812550757|4.0|'Speaker for the Dead' is called a sequel, but with only 2 characters from the original, it could most likely stand alone. I put off reading this book for a few years, because I loved 'Ender's Game' and just didn't think I would enjoy 'Speaker'. I finally read it last week and finished it in a few days, staying up reading at night. It was impossible not to keep reading, basically because is it a total page turner. I love how the scientists notes, reports, and memos are at the beginning of each chapter, each unraveling more of the mystery. And the mystery is great! The end, while not like the tortured end of Ender's Game, is happy yet strangely so for a book so filled with death and sadness. In reading this book, I certainly did not get what I expected, but what I did get was a mature novel written wonderfully. While I very much disliked parts of it, the end result was amazing.
0812550706|5.0|'Ender's Game' by Orson Scott Card is the story of Ender Wiggin, a little boy. The government has limits on the population in this future, and families are only allowed 2 children. Ender is a 'third', and so he is always picked on. He has his monitor on longer than anyone has, so he is picked on for that also. His older brother Peter is a violent yet genius boy who skins squirrels and threatens murder, yet apoligizes in the middle of the night. Valentine, his sister, is a pacifist and extremely sweet and caring. When Ender is taken away to Battle School, which is in space, to be trained for war, she cries \\"I'll love you forever! Come back to me!\\" At Battle School, Colonel Graff knows that they have little time to find and train the military genius who will lead Earth's fleet against the enemy - the Buggers, or the PC term Formics. He mounts everything against Ender from the first day on the shuttle because he believes Ender is the only one smart enough to save them, and he is a perfect mix of his brother and sister. Ender is years younger than all of the other students, yet he is placed into an army when he should still be a Launchie, or just starting out. Soon after, he is given an army of his own - Dragon. It is thrown back into the mix of armies after being removed years before owing to \\"accidents\\" that we don't hear much about. He is given supposedly the worst army in the school and he rises to the top of the standings, with his whole army in the top 50. He is pushed though, when Colonel Graff begins testing, if not abusing him, by giving him battles every day and weeks sooner than normal, 2 battles a day, and then even 2 armies at once. He breaks, and then is whisked away to Command School, which is hidden on a secret asteroid. He is trained by the famous Mazer Rackham, who beat the Buggers in the first invasion, to beat them again. <br />Alongside Ender's story, there is also a story on Earth. Ender's brother and sister have been watching world movements and have predicted that war is going to break out on Earth the moment the Buggers are defeated. They log onto discussion forums on the nets and write articles about what is happening. They are 2 separate people though, and pretend not to know of each other, under the names of Locke and Demosthenes. <br />This is an amazing book, as you can tell by my long review. It is my favorite book, and I read it a few times ever year. I first read it when I was about 13, and loved it. This year I read it, being almost 16, and loved it on an entirely different level - my eyes tearing at the end. I think that this book can be read by anyone, and loved by anyone. The characters are wonderful, multi-faceted, and all too human sometimes. Ender changes dramatically throughout the book, not surprising with all of the emotional tests he is forced through. This novel is BRILLIANT.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|Great acting by Crowe &amp; Connelly. And thanks to the extremely talented Ron Howard, this otherwise &quot;dry&quot; story comes to life &amp; keeps you interested.<br />This movie is definitely worth seeing, and possibly even worth owning. However, while it was worthy of some of the awards it was granted, it lacks the creativity that ought to be required for &quot;Best Picture&quot; accolades, in my opinion. <br />But &quot;Human Interest&quot; stories always pull on the heart-strings, and this one did it well...well enough to get the necessary votes from the Academy. In short, in 10-15 years, I do not believe this will be thought of as a &quot;classic&quot;.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for all ages.I highly reccomend this movie.:)
0767903862|5.0|Two words come to mind after I've closed the covers of this book... Hilarious and Informative. And Bryson wastes no time at getting to the hilarious stuff. A few pages into the first chapter he describes how he went into a jet-lag induced coma during a sightseeing tour of Sydney. I was reading this in a public place and laughed for about five minutes without breathing... seriously, tears and all! It was very therapeutic for me. Every few pages he again says something undeniably witty, and this makes the book a joy to read. I loved every minute of it.<br />On the informative side, I felt that the book covered as much of &quot;habitable&quot; Australia as possible. It seems very thorough, I followed along with an actual travel guide, cross-referencing and reading further about every site that Bryson mentioned here. I was not aware of the incredible vastness of this country, it's almost unbelievable. 23,000 miles of coastline! Having driven the length and breadth of Canada many times (always with an eye to the odometer), I tried to gauge what is comparably going on here in the Sunburned Country... wow, Australia is crazy man! Keep a gas can and canteen handy if you're driving through...<br />And secondly, I was not aware of the political history of this land and the diversity of living creatures (including trees) that call Australia home. Now I know. Bryson's book is not only a personal travelogue, but it's also a regurgitation (maybe that word is a bit too vomit-like, but you know what I mean) of a lot of obvious research and study on his part.<br />Bryson is the intrepid wanderer. He is always more curious, and walking a bit further into things than anyone else. And at times, he's so well-researched that he helps out the tour-guides! He demonstrates a respect for the country and for the living things there (including the people). Towards the end of the journey, he is on one of his rambling jaunts, this time in King's Park in Perth. There in front of him, an echidna ambles across the path, and just as quietly disappears into the undergrowth. Bryson says, &quot;I couldn't have been more thrilled.&quot; This is the spirit with which he travels, and writes. He is ever ready for amazement, and I know his interest in the natural beauty of things is infectious, because I caught it! About the echidna incident, he says &quot;In a country filled with exotic and striking life-forms my high point was finding a harmless, animated pincushion in a city park.&quot; This attitude is consistent with what he considers one of Australia's &quot;most amazing wonders of all&quot;... the living prehistoric stromatolite beds at Shark Bay on the Western Australian coast. These aquatic growths are virtually unchanged from how they existed 3.5 billion years ago. Bryson again... &quot;Now, if that is not an exciting thought, I don't know what is.&quot;<br />Me neither.<br />This book is an unqualified gem, and should be read by everyone who has already been, or has not yet been, to Australia!across the path, and just as quietly disappears into the undergrowth.

B000066F6H|5.0|This album cant be beat. Garage rock has made its comeback with this album.
0783226128|5.0|Well lets be honest.  Scarface was one of the first true &quot;new wave&quot; ganster movies.  Its a great film and deserves more credit and recognition. Al Pacino is a great actor and this was a GREAT movie in its time and still touches people in many different ways!  Just keep an open-mind when viewing this film and remeber it was made in the early 80's.
B000068QY7|5.0|Being a fan I always expect great things from these guys, but this tops all my expectations.  Every track on the CD has classic written all over it, especially Little by Little and Hung in a Bad Place.  It is interesting to hear songs written by band members other than Noel and rounds the album out a little bit more.  Those who haven't listened to Oasis since What's the Story? will become fans again, and this only reinforces what other fans have known all along, that Oasis is a fantastic band with a great sound and great staying power.  I can't wait to see what they come out with next!
B000066NW0|4.0|American music is good, but we've struck gold again from a country called Canada.

B00004SYWZ|4.0|I wore out several taped copies of my &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; LP back when it was first released. I have still listened to it off and on over the years, and only recently began to wonder what had become of a-Ha. A short search on Google revealed their official web site. Lo and behold, they're still releasing albums! I am open to buying music somewhat blindly, and I was willing to take a chance on this CD, especially regarding the &gt;100 positive reviews given here and the fact that american radio ignores them (I have no faith in US record companies, radio stations or MTV, so I usually look for things they ignore and find gems).<br />This album is a bit like, what is currently termed, &quot;adult alternative&quot; (or just general pop music). However it is very well crafted. The lead singer sill has got a good set of vocal pipes in him. It's a very enjoyable album. So much so, that the 20-something students I teach make fun of me for listening to it and think I'm daft for not understanding their music. (Suddenly I'm old and remaindered at 30).
