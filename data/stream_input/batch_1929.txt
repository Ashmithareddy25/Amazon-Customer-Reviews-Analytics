B0053O89WY|5.0|I watched all three dvd's and enjoyed every moment of them.  I can't wait to be able to purchase Season 6.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Love the new game.  Fun to see the Star Wars characters as birds with their various powers.  The gravity and orbits created by planets is a fun challenge to the game.
B008RTE066|5.0|This was grdered as a gift, it arrived just in time for Christmas & is loved by the recipient.  Definatley a good buying experience
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Classic Story told with old/er and younger actors.  All worked together well telling a great tale of the great american past time.
034553154X|5.0|Better than 2012's calendar! Great artist! Great pictures. Brought me back to many of the books. I can't wait for the next one.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My grandaughters had a great time with their legos for Christmas.  You can't go wrong with LEGOS!  It's fun to have &#34;girl&#34; options.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Great book to read on a road trip. Not too fond of the ending, but great descriptive writing throughout the book. I'd definitely recommend it but still a 4 rating.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|The book had many wonderful drawings that added to the story. As of today Charles Dickens is a amazing author because even his short story's seemed long and his long stories finished fast because you were just too into the book
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The wit of John Corey is fabulous!  I could read his stories all day long!  A note to readers, if you are a DeMille fan, go back and re-read The Lion before you this book.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Naturally, Amazon has asked for a review of this purchase before I have even received it.  I have seen this movie more times than I can remember.  I can quote lines from it.  I will no doubt continue wating it as long as I have breath in my body.  The cast is perfect.  The writing surperb.  There is nothing about this picture that is a negative.  There have been imitations, but none have come close to this production.  I would have to place it easily in the top ten Christmas movies of all time, and near the top of the list at that.  In spite of the fact that it was not originally intended to be a Christmas movie, it will always be a must see every Christmas.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The title wasn't at all appealing to me, but a friend recommended I read it and I'm glad I did!  Keeps you guessing the whole way through!  Even makes you duck a time or two!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|great games and great levels angry birds are fun and a great stress releaser and great to keep a kid busy
0060245867|5.0|Our little grandson received this book along with If You Give a Moose a Muffin for Christmas and has enjoyed them already more than I could imagine.  Very very good quality edition.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Movie was enjoyable. Filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text filler text.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|It's a good movie. I could have rated 5-star but the title doesn't seem to fit, even the plot doesn't seem to coincide to the whole Bourne series. However, I like what it is, they should have changed the title to Aaron Cross or just &#34;The Legacy&#34;. the producers tied the name &#34;bourne&#34; so that viewers will get the idea but it backfired. Viewers compared this movie to all &#34;Bourne&#34; series which Matt Damon was an excellent actor for it.<br /><br />Still, this movie entertained me to the last bit because the story was different. If you want my opinion. Buy this because it's an excellent addition to your collection.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Watch was cute and a good backup when there is no sun for sundial ring, also great for the boy who loves Legos.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The subject matter is of course heartbreaking, but it is a bittersweet love story of two kids with cancer. The characters were well developed and it was eloquently written.
B000EMSU6A|5.0|This collaboration between Pete Townsend and Ronnie Lane is vastly underrated.  Songs like Street In the City, Heart to Hang on To and others are really great.  I have always loved this album and was very happy to find it on Amazon.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|A Christmas gif for my granddaughter. She was thrilled. Packed to avoid any damage to the DVD box and arrived when promosed.
1932100660|5.0|Have only read a few chapters but I'm hooked.  Well written scientific research that can be understood by anyone.  It will shift my eating habits for sure
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I enjoy this, there's no way to lose, you just try to beat your best time.. It keeps my brain working, so that's what's important!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The challenges of a future world are quite complex. Control by the government of each district is so suppressive and to have a competition such as hunger games as a control is mind boggling.
145162445X|5.0|Larry is so honest..it's almost embarrasing, no PC and no BS<br />No pandering to those who believe in the equivalent of the<br />tooth fairy...a great breath of fresh air!<br />  Joe KZ
B000L53D4O|5.0|this a good price toy works great for what is expectedof it ilike that its not flashy or makes noise and so my child is not distrcted by that and actually uses it to walk around!<br />its a great price it works its good!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My 6 year old got Bag It! Lite pre- installed on his Nabi 2. He LOVES it! I was helping him one day and found it to be pretty addictive myself. I always have to get 3 stars and the ribbons before moving to the next. I had to buy the full version! Still have LOTS left to unlock!
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Great acting, wonderful music, beautiful costumes and scenery. Loved the movie. Great for the imagination. A story well told. A life well lived.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We love everything about this series.  The characters, history, interactions are all wonderful.  We look forward to setting aside time together to watch this amazing program.
B000I5XOVY|5.0|I loved this movie before but after seeing it in Blueray I love it even more.  The sound is so expansive and the picture so vivid.  Especially the opening scene.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This game is a lot of fun but is really glitchy.  If it wasn't for the glitches I would give it a 5 star rating.  Basically, it will randomly say you are out of balls.  I always know it is ending my game for me because it will give me a tiny ball to shoot instead of a normal ball.  It did that to me when I had over 400 last night.  I have removed from my device and reloaded but still has this glitch.  Really fun game play but I really hate having my game end for me when I am doing really well.
B007FROH4G|5.0|a brilliant look at the effects of AH and the effect it has on families - much the same as what we are dealing with now. something that helps you understand it a little more.
B0091XT8F0|5.0|In my mind Singin' In The Rain still reigns as the best musical of all time. If you've never seen it, watch it today!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|ok, not the best Mahjong game.  Some times hard to tell if tile is available for selection.  Maybe I just have poor vision.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Got this App for free.  It's a great entertainment device and you can mess with the physics of the dots.  However, it get's old pretty quickly.  Runs GREAT on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This was just plain pathetic.  First of all, why does Christian Bales' voice change from being understandable as Bruce Wayne to a gravely growl as Batman.  I could barely understand him.  His sudden reappearance after being &#34;beat down&#34; is predictable but frankly this whole movie was unnecessary.  I personally liked the first, as even the Joker (Heath Ledger) was likable if not just plain evil.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is no substitute for a bigger and more expensive speedlight.  It lacks their power and features.  But if you are looking for a very small light flash, with a reasonable recycle time, this is the one to get.  It is much better than the built in flash on my d90, and works flawlessly with the camera controls.  This is great to have if you are on the go and don't want to cary around more kit than you need.  Also great to have in your bag as a backup to your prime light.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|This was very interesting and was one of the better Sci-Fi movies I've seen.  Even though it seemed to play on some common themes, it was still a quality story and made for some good viewing.  Once again, kids become empowered with unusual powers, but eventually learn how to manage them, inspite of their darker sides.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Have read all Preston & Child books and love them. Excellent writing, intelligent,<br />marvelous characters and good plots. This was not their best but still warrants<br />a read. Pendergast is now becoming emotional.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Maybe I was looking for something closer to the original but it didn't even come close.  The special effects were over the top, but very dramatic as were the action sequences.  I just didn't like the feel of the whole thing, reminding me of the scenery in Blade Runner.  Dialog was only fair.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|I bought this to show my 5th graders after reading Dicken's original book together.  I was very pleased that most of the dialogue as well as the rest of the movie was identical to the book with some creative liscense taken in the final scene where Scrooge meets his final spirit.  All in all, very well done without being over the top Jim Carey.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is where I get my non-headline news without having to watch the talking news heads on Tv or having to search all<br />Thru the newspaper
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. The plot moved along quickly but the characters were developed rather well. The ending was rather abrupt but since this was book one of three I`m not too surprised by that. All in all, its a book I would recommend checking out.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Picture looks great and the sound is awesome.  great movies.  Got to love Bluray.  Got this for my daughter for Christmas
B002MQYOFW|3.0|A well written book, keeps you reading. I don't like the theme, its beyond imagination that a parent would let the child leave for killing games.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Funny movie.  sound, picture, extras, all great.  Well worth it.  Saw it in the theater when it came out.  Loved it
B002YCVX5S|4.0|Saw this one on a recommendation after seeing Django last weekend. It has many similar elements, but I thought Django was more fun. This one has great performances (Christoph Waltz, Brad Pitt) and is an interesting re-telling of the end of World War II. Worth seeing if you're a Tarantino fan!
0345803493|3.0|but poorly written.  I bought the first two books for my lover and she reads alot.  She didn't enjoy the bad writting.  oh well.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Kate Morton has agin written a compelling story covering many years, going back and forth in time. Her ending was worth waiting for.

B003O86FMW|5.0|For the first time in years I cannot stop reading a series of books! When this one ended I almost threw my kindle across the room in frustration, but then realized that I could just download the next and continue reading!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was purchased for a friend who truly loves it. The movie was a good deal and arrived in perfect condition.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|If you like awesomeness then you will surely like this game. It is addicting and yet you can still cool it when it gets outta hand. Tell all of your friends and I'm sure they will love it. I am a level 22 and I love this game just don't over PLAY. Just kidding. Do whatever you want. And you can also play online to gain xp........  Later
B004QX07G4|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was great! Typical Ellen, funny and charming as ever. If you watch her show everyday like I do then you won't be disappointed. But if you don't, you really should and I guarantee you'll like her books too
141659521X|5.0|I haven't had a chance to finish the book yet as I read it on days that I am working and other times when I have to wait for people other than that it would be finished by now and I would be chaffing at the bit waiting for your next novel to appear.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I decided to read this book based on the reviews I read. Great storyline. A good smack you in the face, think about life and love read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it!!! I would recommend this book to anyone. Best book I've read in a long time. Worth the money!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It helped with my homework and other things. I chose this rating because it was kinda boring but it helped me too
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing!! The whole book had me on my toes!! I'm absolutely ready for book two!! This book is officially one of my absolute favorites!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|When it's John Corey, he's exciting, clever, and in out of the way places.  Yemen, this time!  Not my choice for a vacation.  But when the State Department sends you, you have everything at your disposal.  Or do you?
0425252868|4.0|WOW: I read the previews on this book and ordered on advance. I like this book because i had heard stories of the chivery between pilots during WW2 the American,Royal Airforce Pilots and the respect for there German Foes in the air and this is just such an example of it. Ican say i read better books but not as well written and composed as this one. The author allowed both side to talk each giving there own perspective of the encounter and the great risk involved by the German Ace the hardships he edoured immeeditly following the surrender . I'm glad that while intent on both side's was genuine i little piece was civility remained
B009NG1FCY|5.0|Interesting that this book was band in England as being too erotic.  By today's standards it is really mild stuff, but it is avery worthwhile read and tells of the Social Rank system in WWI post war period.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I liked this movie when it came out.  I bought a VHS copy for my mother in law that she wore out watching.
0300176147|4.0|My nephew is a history buff and likes to read.  He has told me this is the best book of overall history he has.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven confirmed for me what I have always felt about an afterlife, that there is no after, it is all life.
B004LE90ZC|5.0|This story has awakened many deep reflexions about human nature and the blurring boudaries of truth and fantasy, love it
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My daughter, who loves Downton Abbey, was thrilled with this Christmas gift.  I had never seen the show, and now I too am a fan.  We will be ordering Season 3, you can bet on that.
B00867GKIK|5.0|It has everything, it's tender, adventureous, funny.  I totally enjoyed it. Highly recommended for all. In 3D it's just perfect.
B007MDB548|5.0|This is the custest movie. It has a great storyline and is fun to watch. Anyone who's a big Tinkerbell fan will love it. It has a few surprises and shows Tinkerbell's sweeter side.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This show had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.Pleasant surprise that the second season kept up with the first. One of the best shows out there. Now I'm a new fan.Enjoy
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Whether you’re a Star Trek fan or not, you will like this movie, especially if you just want to discover how it all began. I would definitely recommend this movie!
B008JAGZDE|3.0|It is still fun to watch but the whole American Pie thing is just getting old and stale... I can tell you right now what the next 3 will be like. (I bet you can also)
0316069434|4.0|Michael Connelly's latest novel, The Black Box, does not disappoint. It is a classic Harry Bosch novel, but Connelly doesn't get stuck in the same ol' character rut that a lot of authors do when they've had such a long-term relationship with a series. Over the past twenty years, Bosch has aged and adapted to new situations. Somethings never change, of course. He still like his jazz music and he's still the gruff investigator who doesn't give up. But over the years change has happened. He's become a father, which quickly escalated into being a single dad, he's quit smoking, and he can actually move on from past relationships.<br /><br />Of course there are some norms that appear. Harry still has an issue with bureaucratic authority, he still toes the line on appropriate police behavior--but hey, isn't that why we love him? If he suddenly became placid and worked a desk job, readers would lose interest quickly.<br /><br />The Black Box centers around the murder of Anneke Jespersen, a Danish war correspondent who was killed execution style during the 1992 L.A. Race Riots. Harry originally catches the case, but must leave it to others due to the turmoil in the city. Fast forward to 2012--the twentieth anniversary of the riots. The Open-Unsolved has been given a directive to focus on the murders from 1992 that were left unsolved. Harry, of course, takes the still-open Jespersen case.<br /><br />This book involves murder, gang violence, conspiracies, rape, race, and, of course, an internal affairs (now labeled the Professional Standards Bureau) investigation. But there's nothing too graphic for the faint at heart. Everything is woven together masterfully.<br /><br />My only complaint is the nice pretty bow that wrapped up the ending. I won't go into any detail, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. But at the end, when the murder is solved there's an \\"Oh by the way, this is why this other thing happened\\" sort of moment that seemed a bit lackluster when the story line seemed like it deserved more.<br /><br />Over-all, The Black Box is a fun, engaging, and at times thoughtful story.ne seemed like it deserved more.<br /><br />Over-all, The Black Box is a fun, engaging, and at times thoughtful story.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I remember the original from TV, the spooky music the soap opera meets horror stuff. This is more like Pirates meet Vampire same type of personality Johnny has used from all the Pirate movies is the same persona he uses here, and it works surprising well. Goofy, Fun entertainment.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I use it to watch and download videos and movies on my Kindle Fire.  I have the option to download at various quality levels, including mp3.  If I choose to watch in full screen, there are NO ads.  There are also no ads--porn, or otherwise--in the downloads.  This is an app I would gladly pay for, and its FREE!
B0043WHRWA|5.0|I am a big fan of Castle, and I have been watching from first seaon.  Accessing and playing from Amazon is great.  Now I also use my iPad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I  couldn't put this book down, so descriptive I could see the environment the games took place. I was hard not to become emotional throughout the book. I'm eager to begin the next book.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|One of the best horror series on TV. Season 2 is better than season 1, keeps you on the edge of your seat, the doctor is a sadist, the nun is a sadist, very good acting. A must see for horror fans.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|What a great show.  This will make you laugh and gives you a real punch in the gut feeling for real life.
B000YABS8E|5.0|This is the best movie ever!!! Very entertaining. I have seen this movie at least 15 times and will watch it at least that many more times.  Love it !!!
B000056BOR|5.0|I love Cary Grant and I have many of his movies.  The movies from this time period are a lot of fun to watch and although I wasn't born yet when they were made, I do enjoy them today.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I just got this in the other day and I'm satisfied with it. I have an extra display that I wanted to hook up to my Retina MacBook Pro, and this allowed me to do just that!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|HBO takes sames changes to the Clash of Kings but does an overwhelmingly good job with the characters<br />The productions values alone are worth the watch<br />This series is like no other. Love or hate them each character is real person and not a cliche villain or hero
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is good. I like how there are a bunch of mini games and how you don't only have to do one thing
B009JBZH54|5.0|Nolan revision of batman is an epic masterpiece.<br />Batmen Begins Theme - Order<br />The Dark Knight Theme - Chaos<br />The Dark Knight Rises Theme - Pain
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I loved this series of movies up to this point. This latest is strained and has a poorly developed story line.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|This is a new game that moves me into the future but also takes me back to the past. Great game.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|the game is ok. hate running out of coins tho. you exit out n back in to get more faster. great if waiting just wasting time.

B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is a very good book and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it do its a very very very very very very good book
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|.....but to be honest I would have bought it if only to get &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34;. The duets are great, although Donny Osmond doesn't compare to the other talent Susan pairs up with...like Michael Crawford, who is simply peerless when singing anything from Phantom of the Opera.
B004TI1WME|4.0|This calculator is easy to use which I do several times a day.  I am into numbers and new to my new mobile device, this tool is one of the easier apps to learn.  I love it!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Right when I thought I had everything figured out, another twist was thrown in. Passionate emotions were illustrated at perfect times and the story line was spectacular. Well done.
B0044KJIHI|5.0|I only bought the series finale on HD through video on demand because I couldn't wait until the dvd release to see how the series ended.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The game much exceeded expectations and i play often good graphics and the game isn't overly glitchy the thrill and relief of boredom well worth thewait of the extra download time
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I liked Batman Begins and the Dark Knight Rises more than this movie.  The Joker was a little too insane for my liking, but I wanted to see how Batman ends up in the predicament that he's in, in the beginning of the Dark Knight Rises.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the DIARY OF A Wimpy kid series<br />They are very funny and almost anyone can enjoy them.<br />Thank you Jeff Kinney!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The movie was kind of what I expected with maybe a little more violence and was a little slow in spots.  I rented it mainly to see the actor who played the huntsman who has also played Thor.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was helpful to have read the book first simply because it helped with keeping up with with the story line.  The movie was fairly true to the book.  There were some differences but I did not think those interfered with the main plot of the book.  Enjoyed the actors in the movie - I thought they did a good job with their characters.  The price was reasonable for the download video...
B009VB97EY|5.0|Love this movie!! It makes you laugh. You get to look at hot guys. What more could you want? I would recommend this to women who want to have fun watching a movie.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love music and have probably over 1500 cds.  My bread and butter is hard heavy metal since it gives me the energy needed when I work; however, I absolutely LOVE music of all kinds.  A friend on FB turned me on to Lindsey and I really like her playful style and the mashing of electronica and classical violin.  The tone of her violin has a haunting quality that you can feel.  She also has several tunes that rock with fiddle technique!  Can't go wrong with this cd!
B009UZBLSG|3.0|Pros: Display mirroring works great; doesn't require charger to work<br /><br />Cons: It charges a lot slower than when you are plugged directly into the wall.  This means that, while being plugged in will extend the amount of time you can use it, you will eventually run out of battery.  If you start with a low battery, you will not be able to make it through a movie, even with it charging.
1400110335|4.0|Bought the CD's to fill some time in my commuting with something somewhat productive.<br /><br />The reader was clear enough and not annoying, a slight European accent. The topic was interesting enough. I got what I needed out of it. I don't think it would have been as palatable in real book form.<br /><br />I am no finance, or history expert, so I cannot vouch for technical accuracy here. The stories worked for entertainment, I don't think I would bother with it outside filling the commute.
0375405380|5.0|First Don Winslow book for me and I just ordered 3 more. This book is excellent. The story is parallels true events in the drug war. I highly recommend to anyone who likes gritty realistic stories.

B007AJFSJW|4.0|Krugman is the spokesman for the view that more govt stimulus is what is needed and in the short term deficits are a good thing, not because they are in themselves good, but it is the only way to get teh economy moving.  He focuses on the need to get the economy going and produce jobs as opposed to the view that we must impose austerity now, as fast and as deep as possible.
0688091717|5.0|See my review on the plush toy. You really should buy the toy and the book together. Your little one will thank you.
B007V65R54|4.0|Lots of different fields he describes his statistical insights, from baseball to poker to political events.  Excellent insights into the methods used.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This  was an amazing book. Definitely shoes the perspectives of high school and life. I'm a teenager and loved this book.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|I am a sci-fi addict. For me to hate a movie like this, it takes a lot of brainless, science-less movie gimmicks.  Prometheus is packed with lots of gimmicks that defy basic intelligence and a basic understanding of the scientific knowledge accumulated by humans to date.  For it to have come from someone who produced BladeRunner is nothing short of travesty.  This movie should have been characterized as the prequel to Alien (that 1979 sci-fi horror movie).  If you believe in the existence of a highly intelligent, but monstrous-looking alien who has developed the technology to roam through space with no purpose except looking for some helpless and hapless humans to terrorize, this is the movie for you!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|It works great, I don't think it could have been better even if I had got it fro a store.
B006O6F932|3.0|My daughter got this for Christmas and it's a bit disappointing. No directions came in the box so we had to figure it out for ourselves. Not very good quality.  Not worth the money in my opinion.

B004LROMSO|5.0|It works great, I don't think it could have been better even if I had got it fro a store.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Amazon recommended this book and I loved it, so much so that I read it in two day's and had to see if the second book in the series was out. There are some minor issues with the editing of the book but it doesn't deter from reading it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a page turner for sure. It will leave you contemplating the ending. Best enjoyed with large chunks if time to read.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|This was a good movie but certainly not their best.  Worth renting on a rainy day or getting as a gift...not worth buying.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|like this game but get frustrated by not being able to complete things without social network interaction. other thsn that it is lotsof fun to play.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|Good action, ok story, not as good as the first.  Worth renting on a cold and rainy day, don't bother buying it.
B004TI5N38|4.0|This book is informative and entertaining. The writter seems to know how the military works, very well done. A must read
1449417051|5.0|I purchased this as a gift and it was very well received.  Great for a cat lover who has a humourous side.
B004A7OQKY|5.0|I am physically fit and in great shape. I purchased this DVD to stay in shape during my pregnancy. I think it is an excellent DVD and would recommend it to any fit mom's-to-be. If you are not used to working out or are not in shape already, it might be a bit challenging for you.<br /><br />She does use a chair and wall for some of the moves, but you don't need any weights or other workout equipment. It's divided into two parts, the first is 40 minutes and the second you do with your partner. That one is only 20 minutes. I haven't done the second workout yet.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Love love love the masterful scoring -- the piano music is a perfect touch that moves the plot forward and evokes emotions. Keira is a very good actress, but OMG -- she looks like a concentration camp survivor!! Just emaciated!  But the movie is very well done.
B0094K1K42|5.0|I see that I am among the few who enjoyed this movie, but I will say YES this movie was amazing, funny and very well acted on Charlize's part.<br /><br />I've seen some comments regarding no character development, growth, etc. This is why I think this movie works!!!! The characters don't grow, don't change don't turn over a new leaf and become these fantastic \\"good\\" people that other viewers seem to think is expected or necessary in a movie.<br /><br />Can we honestly say we don't know or have come across people in our regular lives who are mavis-ish? People who are stuck in their ways, have personalities that are so neurotic that they believe the world revolves only around them? Mean spirited, completely delusional and completely oblivious to reality? I mean seriously? If that's the case please make that Narnia's address public!!!<br /><br />This movie was brilliant, and for the character it was depicting I think it did a fantastic job! Watch this movie with an open mind on the characters, look at it for what it is and don't presume what it should be. It's a dark comedy so the humour is off, the characters are twisted but it was an absolute treat!!!!<br /><br />If your a Charlize fan, she makes you fall in love with her acting more than ever, I actually think I prefer her in roles that are off coloured and not sweet and straight laced.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I'm always surprised and happy when I get the scenes missing from the broadcast version. Dr. Who is a show I watch over and over.  It's great having Dr. Who 'on tap' to watch when ever I wish!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Excellent project, the Led Zeppelin fans will appreciate this masterpiece, film, sound, set list all details ,seen them at this stage was a super experience
B006LSZECO|3.0|As a mystery novel lover, I really get used to every part of the story being tied up in a nice package by the end. Not so with this one.<br />It did keep me turning the electronic pages but it seemed that by the time the author decided where the story was going to go she just started throwing ideas against the wall to see if any stuck.<br />SPOILER-For example, the cuckoo clock.  If the author is going to put that in the story and keep referring to it, then it really should have some other significance than a conversation piece.  Also, why in the world would the police let her get away with murder?<br /><br />This novel was, ok. Did it keep me interested yes. Was it written well, yes it was written well. The author did a nice job moving between the masculine voice and feminine voice. Did the book end in a satisfactory way? Not at all.<br />Do I recommend this book? I would recommend it only to readers who don't LOVE mysteries and want an easy little read with not a lot of emotion.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a well-written &#34;hard science fiction&#34; story with a moderate amount of &#34;sciencey&#34; exposition [all of which I enjoyed], a lot of sarcastic, witty humor, a very amusing and interesting central character, and a very real sense of thrill and anticipation as the plight of the main character develops.  There are a slightly greater than average number of uncaught, scarcely noticeable typographical errors, but for a super-cheap (and intended to be free) ebook without a large publisher backing it, this ebook is in fine editorial shape. The ebook also could benefit from having page numbers, but this is another minor, almost unnoticeable flaw.  This story, while a tad on the short side and not overly ambitious in its storytelling, is packed with action and detail without unnecessary &#34;fluff&#34;, and I found it a pleasure to read. I personally feel that it stands on its own just fine among the works of better-known authors like Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter, and others whose work I enjoyed equally as much.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was very funny and you have to see it. It will have on the floor it's more on the stupid comdey but that's the beauty of it. LOL
B009329Y30|4.0|Read the book first and this movie followed it well.  There was quite a bit of sexual content and felt that it was not appropriate for 13 year old.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I rented this with little to no expectations, I mean come on, I was however extremely impressed.  It reminded me of the old Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.  Just a good time, not to be taken too seriously.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I had never heard of Rodriguez.  I'm only 15 minutes into viewing this film, I've already purchased both CD's and am looking to purchase this DVD... ALREADY!<br />So far it is incredible! And I'm very particular about movies and music.<br />Interesting story not only for the musician, but also historical perspective into South Africa apartheid years, and quirky way this under-appreciated artist's music changed people's lives... just on a different continent than his own.  Highly recommended!!!<br /><br />Post film update- Really, really beautiful;  the story, the documentary, the people who created and participate in the film.. just wonderful on all fronts.  At so many points of this film I had tears in my eyes with a smile on my face.<br />A bold, but true statement- This film has enriched my life.<br />Please don't miss this.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Just bad, bad taste, bad humor, just bad... Maybe if I was a teenager and under the influence of some illegal substance I might find this funny...  but then I wouldn't have needed to rent the movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|From the first page you are drawn in to a well written, tightly structured story.  Harry Bosch never disappoints! Highly entertaining...
B003GAFA8S|4.0|Definitely worth the purchase to not have to watch the commercials on comedy central.  Not deep but a good way to kill a few hours on a rainy day.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Saw the movie, and quite simply loved it.  Thank God I didn't grow up to be a professional critic; would have ended up enjoying nothing.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Remember THE FIRM? It was Grisham's break-out second book, and just as ridiculous as this one. I remember thinking it was a lawyer's (Grisham's) wet dream. This is his second. I didn't realize how moist the vision was (the firm) when I read it. Only recently have I learned that Grisham \\"never managed to make any money\\" as a lawyer. Now he makes a great deal of money as a former lawyer, and delights in telling us how someone else could do it.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book, although I am amazed that fully half the reviews gave him a whopping 5 stars. It just doesn't deserve that. There are far better writers in the genre. What he does have is an always winning narrative style that sucks you in and makes it easy to keep reading; although in this one he got really sloppy. He's breezing along with one narrative path, then digs up a private eye and chases another one to the true object of the book. The \\"real\\" murderer.<br /><br />While he has history with this guy, we are given no clue of this that I could find. I read seventy or eighty pages and ended up watching my protagonist working his scam in a Jamaica jail. I was convinced I must have missed something, some reference that, however quick or oblique, made this sudden divergence in the dialogue make sense. If I missed it, I was unable to find it with several hours of scanning. The good news is I learned to use some features of the Kindle that makes it a truly neat product. I \\"searched\\", and I moved from chapter to chapter quickly. That part was rewarding. I finally gave up and finished the book confident that Grisham would tie it up in the end.<br /><br />He did. It's a brilliant story. An amazing scam. But, again unless I missed something, his hero was an accessory before the fact to a brutal murder, torture and robbery. I got the impression he was plotting the scam in prison before the murder was committed. Shame on you Malcolm/Max/John!<br /><br />I'll bet Grisham wrote this--actually wrote this--in just acouple of weeks from musings he's had for years. I think it was a page turner for him as well as us. (I confess, the story really hooked me, but Grisham's no Scott Thurow.) Further, I'd be surprised if he even gave it a second reading, much less a careful edit. I recommend it, but reluctantly.
1451627297|5.0|While I have never been interested in reading Stephen King books, as my book club's selection I read this one and thoroughly enjoyed it. I especially loved traveling back in time to the '50s. I was a young mother at the time of Kennedy's asassination and like most Americans was devasted. This book brought back many memories of a very simple yet tumultuous time in our history.
B001NHNG64|4.0|...the effort required represents a great investment. I just reviewed THE RACKETEER, by John Grisham, which is similar to this one only in the primary requirement--SUSPEND DISBELIEF! This is an amazing tale that is impossible in so many ways that the suspension has to be complete. Start with the protagonist himself. He's impossible to believe. West Pointers with great fit-reps don't get purged from the military as Childs suggests. (My son graduated from the USNA. I know how this works.) Secondly, it's unlikely that he would have had such a limited time stateside. Again, I know what I'm talking about. Finally, he wouldn't have spent his entire army career as an MP. Again...<br /><br />But who cares. I went and saw THE EXPENDABLES, and will probably rent THE EXPENDABLES II. When there is a rich reward, suspension of disbelief becomes a prime investment. You can easily suspend disbelief on DIE TRYING and feel like you were treated fairly.
B005LAII12|4.0|I didn't know how I would feel about this movie, but I thought it was hilarious. However, it does wear thin towards the end...*spoiler* they could have left the whole fenway park scenes out. Although, I get they had to show at least one scene there...as they usually do during movies filmed in Boston.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Game does not work in landscape mode, only portrait mode. Not a criticism, but a quite a strain on the hands.
B003THHIEM|5.0|You guys are awesome!!! Where did this show come from?  I was vacationing in New York and I came across this show on my hotel room and from then on Im stuck.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The graphics are clear and sharp. This app is a wonderful addition to anyone's app library. I highly recommend it.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I am so glued to this show. Good Detective scenes and I love Beckett and Castle's banter of love and hate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Jaw dropping, heart wrenching, defiant and amazing. This book had me hooked and ever present in the dreadful Quarter Quell. Each character has such a defined spirit and rebellious attitude in their own way. Positively fantastic.
B0042KA4VO|3.0|It's Okay. It has its boring moments but I was ok in the beginning. I'm not watching it much now.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This is in my top 5 movies of all time. the acting is excellent, but the story line is so spectacular, able to include and hold deep questions and ideas on life while remaining highly watchable for all audiences. I find this to be the most completely complete film by Christopher Nolan.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Where did this show come from?  I was vacationing in New York and I came across this show on my hotel room and from then on Im stuck.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I liked it alot! But I like all MIB movies so far! Worth buying and the Blu-Ray is really outstanding!
B003TH14H4|5.0|Where did this girl come from?  I was vacationing in New York and I came across this show on my hotel room and from then on Im stuck.
B004B63M1S|3.0|Just a lot of laughs, some nudity so not suited for a 13 and under crowd unless you want them to see some naked topless woman.
B006AN78XS|3.0|Well this movie has good soundtrack and that was got me interested to watch it.  I just didnt like the ending.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is great to watch even if its unrealistic. Has suspense,which I love.<br />The kids and I are addicted to it.
030758836X|5.0|This is by far the best book I read in 2012 (and I read a lot!)  Flynn has a wonderful, tight writing style, and the story has so many twists and turns that I couldn't put it down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun to pass time playing this game. wish I did not run out of energy so quickly though. still enjoy it.
B0034IZVV8|5.0|They were great way back when and they still have great songs. I enjoy listening to their songs. It was very affordable.
B004G600A4|5.0|love the disneys, my grand daughter loved the movie. quality was good. will definately recommend the movie and collection to anyone
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had doubts about my liking this series before watching it.  However, after the first couple of episodes I was hooked and am waiting impatiently for the new season which begins this Sunday on PBS.  Great series!  I am so glad I decided to buy it!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Fast paced reading that pulls you right in. I couldn't wait to order the sequel and I was not disappointed.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I love this album (are they still called albums or am I dating myself?).  Another great rocker.  I came late to the Daughtry fan list, having not watched the earlier seasons of American Idol, but I'm so glad I made his  discovery.  It reminds me of the hard rockers of the 70's that I loved and makes me forget that 4 decades have past.  If you're a vintage rocker you'll like this album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One word.... AMAZING !!!!!!!!! This is the first book that I have read by Colleen Hoover and I will definitely read her other books. The storyline was a tough one to touch, but Colleen did an incredible job with it.  Hopeless will be a book that will stay with me for a while and I would enjoy reading it over and over again...  2 thumbs up and 10 STARS !!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"
0786955554|5.0|This is a great accessory to the starter set.  I would recommend this to anyone who owns the starter set.
B003WUYP56|5.0|This is a well written and informative book on the state of physics today. You don't require any knowledge of physics, just an interest.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Very entertaining.  One of the better si fi movies I've seen.  It will keep you laughing and interested.  Special efects were very good.-
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim has always been a pleasure to read. He's not sharing 3rd party information, he's &#34;in the trenches&#34; testing himself to be better. There's not a technique in here that Tim hasn't tried. And if you think it's just about cooking, you're mistaken.<br /><br />Well done again Tim
0738711500|4.0|I have wanted to learn to read Tarot cards for a very long time. After reading reviews of several different beginner decks, because I liked the excerpt from the book, and I liked the look of the cards. I got them in the mail today, and immediately began looking through the cards and book. After counting the cards, though, I was disappointed to find that 6 cards were missing! I called the company to complain about the missing cards, and the representative who answered the phone was extremely helpful and will be shipping out my cards out on Monday. I was off the phone in under 5 minutes! Best customer service I have ever encountered. The cards still look amazing, and the book looks like it will be great for learning. One star taken away because of the missing cards. I'm looking forward to learning with this book and deck!
B000I2J5UG|5.0|My box set of The Black Parade arrived quickly and in mint condition. It really is gorgeous to look at and the extras inside are great. Wonderful for a My Chemical Romance fan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy the portability of the game without the need to carry cards and keep up with them. Fun for more than one person too.
B001L5VYFI|5.0|My album &#34;went missing&#34; years ago.  Now I have one more of the great oldies to listen to and reminisce about.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Very good present day Led Zepelin, pretty good for a live concert, a few songs should not be done live like Ramble on, but all in all very good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a good read I enjoyed it only one left to read  this one I read in a day couldn't put it down
B007THA4FI|5.0|I was not sure if I would enjoy this as much as the Harry Potter books. And there were many characters to keep track of, each with many various connections and agendas. But once I had them sorted out I began to find the heart of this lovely book. Again J.K. Rowling found pathos in the lives of teenagers and their points of view. It takes a bit to be drawn in but it's worth it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is a fantastic series, and stayed very true to the book. You'll want to pick this up if you're a fan of fantasy and intrigue. It's a shame that this was discontinued because one of the producers happens to mention that one of the heads on the wall is a George W. Bush mask. It wasn't intentional, ignore the controversy, and enjoy a great series.
B009H1S56O|5.0|First things first, if you love Lana, you MUST get this! You will not regret it! The box itself is beautiful and made of the thickest cardboard I've ever encountered.<br />After opening it up, there are four picture cards of Lana, all featuring her in all her beauty :) Also included is a mini record with a picture of her I recognize from her H&M ad. On said record is her cover of Blue Velvet and a remix of Blue Velvet.<br />Two discs include all of her music videos and remixes of a few of her songs.<br />Last but not least are the last two discs which feature her albums &#34;Born To Die&#34; and &#34;Paradise.&#34; Her unmatched talent and meaningful songs blow every other artist of this generation completely out of the water!<br />Some people were mentioning having trouble with &#34;Lolita&#34;, &#34;Without You&#34;, and &#34;Lucky Ones&#34; not being included on the Born To Die disc, but I did not have this problem.<br />I would recommend this to any Lana Del Rey fan &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
1449410243|5.0|Another great book by Inman. This one is a collection of his comics devoted to cats, rather than just a collection of comics as his other book had been.
1582406723|5.0|I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead books and show. I would definitely recommend all the books for any Walking Dead fan :) This particular book arrived quickly and in very good condition for a used version.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was sorely disappointed in this, even though it was free. This game is not the oregon trail you know and love. It's Farmville with dysentary. Not worth your time.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is not prize winning literature, but you get pretty much exactly what you expect from it. Racy and entertaining.
B0072OFOM6|3.0|I wasn't thrilled with the recasting of a few of the players. Liam McIntyre especially didn't seem to have the presence that Andy Whitfield had, rest his soul. While the script in the previous seasons was stylized to give the show an older feeling, it really felt that they went overboard this season, making it much harder to catch all the lines and what was being said.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This is not prize winning literature, but you get pretty much exactly what you expect from it. Racy and entertaining.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|It was a free app when I downloaded it to my galaxy s3. I cant complain.  I think I have used it only a couple times though.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is not prize winning literature, but you get pretty much exactly what you expect from it. Racy and entertaining.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|a fascinating and insightful look into a time period. a great read - and clearly well researched. Not only do you look inside the historic figures - you also have a look at people within their period, in the context of their time and the events going on throughout the region. Riveting
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have loved reading these books! I would recommend them to anyone who likes epic-like tales. I actually enjoy the books way more than I do the TV series, and I can't wait to read book 5!
B002WQ7XO6|5.0|My husband and i really enjoyed this movie.  It was all around fun without a lot of garbage. We would highly recommend it.
B006DJ2JSI|2.0|i could not find voice search options and if theyre supposed to be automatic, they dont function on kindle fire hd 8.9. instructions would be hepful. so many apps leave so many people dead in the water. spend too much time trying to figure crap out, less timeusing.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|It's amazing all of the things you miss when you watch these for the first time.  My husband and i are going through these one by one and really enjoying them. Makes the story better when you see them in sequence.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My grandson absolutely loves this show and watches it all the time. Great movie to keep him busy while i am busy myself.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I thought this book was written quite well yet somehow lacked something. I  also thought that the characters never fully developed, and the book left me disappointed. If you are looking for a book that sucks you completely in, this book Is NOT it. However, it is a nice book if you're killing time.
1878424777|5.0|This book is simply a masterpiece of how to lead a happy, blame free life.  Each agreement builds on the next, and it is one of my favorite books to read and re-read.  I love it, and I am very grateful and thankful to Don Miguel Ruiz for being so truthful.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|great show, educational and entertaining,  keeps the whole family interested. The plot is great and the acting is excellent. love it!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really love the graphics with g5 games! such imagination and attention to detail! just wish they were cheaper so I could buy them all!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|bought it to see if i could watch it on my tablet for my girl.  it didn't play but did on my laptop.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is better than I expected.  At first I thought it was going to be the same type of episode repeated with different characters.  I am extremely pleased at the direction the series is taking.  I have not read any of the comics and therefore do not come into it with any preconceived ideas of how it should be.  I would recommend this series to anyone who like hero shows.
B003B02PFO|5.0|this is just like the movie Christmas with the Kranks.  I love this book and wanted a version for my android phone.  great price too
1416955070|4.0|It was given as a gift for a teenager. I was advised by another teenager to give it as a gift.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|The Action is incredible, but the plot line is confusing, and cheesy. Some of the acting looks forced (like their trying TOO hard). Its Great if all your after is violence, it has plenty of that and its awesome to watch. But Like i said, plot story is week as hell, and acting doesnt help.<br />As for that Elevator scene mentioned in another review, its not power, its the water pushing the elevator up the shaft. He had to flip that lever to disengage the safety that kept it from moving.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It was fun at first...but after a while I think it got boring or people weren't as creative or had horrible drawing skills - like me LOL, I kid - I'm aweosme j/k. But it's a good game to play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this over and over. I love it! :) But does any one know how to upgrade? My sis upgraded for free and I cant figure out how to.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I can ownly assume that it's doing it's job. It says it's checking the files and apps download for viruses and that's all I know. Or I'm just that good and haven't gotten any viruses.
B0060D123K|5.0|this is movie is one of my favorites. such a clear image on my kindle fire. really awesome in my opinion
B00A757EFW|4.0|Pac-man-lite pretty much stays true to how pac-man should be. If you want to revisit this classic game I say go download it. The only issue I had with it is that it's not the same without having the stick. Most smart phones are touch screens and sometimes it just doesn't want to go the way you want it. I mean with much pratice you'll get the timing correct though.
B001A3AA0G|4.0|Love Love Love White WInter Hymnal.  Blue Ridge Mountains is proably the most uplifting beat and happy song ever!!!  Definitely should get.
1451695195|1.0|this book advocates universal salvation which is not scriptural. Supernatural events which are not specifically defined as from the God of the bible are necessarily from another source
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Kids loved it, was just what they asked for. They are adults and wanted it for their collection. Good gift!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was amazing! can't wait for the movies!!!!! You have to read these books even if you don't like to read
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Hubby loved this Christmas gift. He is a Stones fan and it had a little bit of everything and new songs too!
B003UYV08E|5.0|my 11 year old loves all the super hero movies and likes to watch them over and over again, so this made for a great gift
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Their really isn't a bad track on this or the previous album. I am glad I came across Wally and his style of music. He really got me inspired to go back and listen to vinyl records again.Keep up the great work. I would like to see his previous record released here in the US on vinyl.
B000MV90IU|5.0|Great cars in movie ,son love it he has a friend who has the bullet ,son he enjoyed the movie
B0080XN3C6|5.0|What a wonderful voice to listen to. Love all the tracks. The only issue I have is that the US release version is missing a track from here Australian release. Wondering Limbs. I don't know why, but glad to see her music in the USA. The vinyl record is very awesome!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First off, I would like to say that anyone at ANY age should pick up this book and read it! It's absolutely such a stunning story that I promise you will not want to put down! :)
B003MC5N28|4.0|This beautifully written story kept me entranced and reading the book from cover to cover without a single stop,  She has left me<br /> deep in thought and with a bitter sweet solace .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't know quite how to put into words how much I loved this story. I hate spoilers, so I won't say what happens.......just read it!! You won't be sorry.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|Disc and case all arrived in great condition. Also arrived within stated time. I am a stickler with my cd collection and this one passed the test! Thanks again.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My son recommended this for a birthday gift for my grandson.  If my son recommends something, it must be good.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|This is a great price for all the Sherlock novels and stories.  In addition, the ebook is arranged well with a proper linked table of contents that isn't always available with other books at this price.<br /><br />There are a few typos and sometimes the formatting of the lines looks a little off.  However, they don't detract from the story too much.  If you don't already have a complete collection of Sherlock or you just want a digital version, this is a good buy.
B009VB97EY|3.0|For being a straight married man this movie was decent. I felt some of the acting could of been better and I didn't like the ending at all. But over all it was ok
B0058W74UY|1.0|Stupid and dissent work on Kindle Fire .  I wasted a lot of time on this .  Don't buy it .
B003B02O3C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book although I was expecting a different ending but that is the magic of John Grisham peace.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I'm tired of the nice &#34;Disney&#34; versions of stories that are meant to scare children into compliance...this movie is great because of its darkness.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't say enough about this book or this author. Everything she writes is completely amazing. This book had some twists and turns that I def didn't expect but loved. I read this book twice already. I can't wait until her next book. I would read anything colleen wrote even if it was written on toilet paper!
B001JNNDEW|5.0|Went to Costco and they had a Swingline Red Stapler! Now I need to find more bling and smash the copier at work.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Master actor, Colin Farrell can make any kind of character real and layered no matter what kind of movie.  This film is a realization of Philip K. Dick's original text.  And just have fun with it.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This is the best book ever made and I love the books. And I want to read them all soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I have read since Twilight. I could not put it down and I can't wait to start book number two.
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|Dr. Cordain presents the scientific research in a no nonsense manor that can be put into practice in your daily life.

1476704163|5.0|amazing.! simply stunning :D love seeing another side of the creative mind of kesha and her growing up with music.!
B0060D133E|5.0|My oldest (4 years old) found this movie when she got ahold of my Kindle and begged to be allowed to watch it - boy am I glad I said yes.  She, her younger sister and I have all watched it several times and it still doesn't get old!  Love having it on my Kindle Fire so that when we go on road trips or longer drives, the girls can watch it at their leisure.  The movie is cute, the story is engaging and I loved that the little girl was so willing to stick to what she believed in!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I loved the book. Jeff u have done it again! Though the was kinda sad cu  of war happened to Greg and holly not being together :(
B000JJJF4O|5.0|It might sound funny, but I watch this movie every year!  There is so much to love about it, because it is funny but also really makes you think about your life.  I find myself crying every time I watch it and saying that I don't want to fast forward through life, but really take it in and consider how I'm treating people.  Get it, watch it, and consider what path you are on.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Same as every book, very entertaining and funny :D Jeff, I hope u keep making books about the wimpy kid XD
B004EPYZP8|4.0|The book was even better. Read the book either before or after - still enjoyable either way.<br />Good view for all PG-13 viewers
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant about reading this book at first, having seen the movie. Although the movie didn't interest me much, I did remember the ending. I wish I hadn't, but it was kind of a given either way.<br /><br />Anyhow, the story had my eyes glued to the pages of the book, reading. I literally couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the second book of the series! (Which, I must say, the author has me curious about. I'm REALLY hoping it doesn't become a sappy romance.)
B009738XXM|5.0|This is another young lady that is very talented. Her music is fun and catchy. This is just great to listen to. It is fun for all ages. If I am down at all, I pop this in and I will be bopping to it in no time at all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was so engrossed in the story between miss Steele and Mr grey. I can not wait to read the next book!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|What a remarkable talent this young lady is. Her music is interesting and fun. I know that the buzz is all about her hidden messages in the lyrics however the messages are very well thought out and very nicely put to the music. Taylor will be around for a very long time. It may be a mute point but I wish her all the success in the world.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What an amazing transition from the hunger games. The book kept me guessing all the way through. I love Suzanne Collins imagery and metaphors. She makes you feel right there in the games and thinking with the characters. As soon as I get off this plan I am downloading mockingjay so I can continue!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I Really enjoyed playing this game. It has just the right amount of difficulty to keep you interested yet able to continue moving along through the game.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|When accessing thru Kindle, difficult to navigate, doesn't remove any post or messages you delete/view. The are still there when you logon thru the internet on a PC/Laptop.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|thanks to my parents for giving me this dvd. It makes me smile when I watch the entire movie, thanks
B000I9YXKG|5.0|The cinematography, the story, the integration of the scenes with flashbacks and flashforwards.  Magnificent. Six six six more words required.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put it down, very teasing book. I will start reading again just because of this book being so goog.
B003GDYMTS|5.0|Love it!  The hit song &#34;Soul Man&#34; is worth the price, expecially if you like Motown.  Ben is French, but sings in both French and English.
1419705849|5.0|I chose 5 stars for this purchase because it was exactly what it was advertised as, a valuable classroom asset, quick and easy to use.  Great for second language learners and those behind 2 or more grades with skills.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I can't imagine working under the rules Harry must follow. I think Connelly is stretching the role of IAD in this one.

B00004YA66|4.0|I watched this movie years ago and just purchased the DVD from Amazon. I loved it as much as the first time I saw it. Very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I enjoyed the ending very much.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is a great book for kids of all ages. I think everyone should read this book. Jeff Kinney did a good job. Even I liked it and I'm  a teenager!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Could have a few bells and whistles. But a great playing chess game for the tablet. I have it on my kid's nabi2 and it runs well.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I loved it!!! It was really good. I recommend this to anyone. I love this book just like the other diary of a wimpy kid books.:):):)
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I want Pendergast the Mysterious back. Too many threads resolved in very flash manner. The more I learn about his history the less involved I become. Time to introduce a lost cousin who can REMAIN enigmatic?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is well-written, straightforward and credible.  A must read for both doubters and believers that there is &#34;something&#34; beyond earthly existence.  Had a hard time putting the book down once I got started!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Dumb. I thought it was supposed to be funny, I have a crazy sense f humor.  I wasted 4.99 and stopped watching 1/3 of the way through.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My granddaughters download this on my Kindle Fire.  She said she loved it and now I'm playing it all the time.  It is a fun game for all ages.
B009LGO88E|5.0|good product, comfortable in the hand and is plays well with the Circle Pad Pro XL, is excellent. just that I found it a little heavy. compared with the standard 3ds. but is otherwise excellent[[ASIN:B009LGO88E Circle Pad Pro - Nintendo 3ds Ll/xl Accessory (3ds LL /XL Console Not Included) Japan Inport]]
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I generally avoid buying the music of American Idols.  I picked this one up because it was priced right. I'm not disappointed. I'm not wowed either.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I don't see why people even get on this terrible social network but other than that the newsfeed works on my kindle but you know 1 star
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I heard this was one of the better recent sc-fi movies and it is not bad.Not nearly as good as many peeps are saying but worth a rental. What prevents this movie from being more than it is, is Gordon-Levitt. He is just too wooden in this  role and there is no emotional appeal there It sad when sub par actors just  get the roles, Like they said about Russell Crowe in Les Mis, you can say the same thing about Joesph.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to read this book because I thought it was mire for a teenage crowd. My daughter Brittany, who is 15, said \\"Dad you have to read it. I know you'll get into it\\". And yes I did get into it. Great story. I can't wait to start the second book tonight.
0446580848|3.0|I never thought it would happen.  I got to page 320(about halfway through book)and I gave up reading it.  I have loved all the other John Corey books(Wildfire is my favorite), but this one drags on and on with hardly any story.  Too many books on my reading list to force myself through one I'm not enjoying.<br />Read the other Corey books first, then come back to this one.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I like the mix between action and drama.  It is cool to see the flashbacks of what happened and how they got to where they are at.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I loved it, like a terrible addiction it is so sweet, yet the bitter taste in my mouth is still left. I can't express the edge on my seat insomnia this has induced!!! In my opinion once again George Martin has done it again! He is a brilliant writer and contrary to popular belief the sweet plot does get oh so much thicker! You get immersed in the tale, in love with characters. I can't say much without spoiling it. However this is most definitely worth reading. If I had to choose one thing I didn't like, it would be some very intense dialogue that does get quite tedious. Although many times it is crucial to the tale. Closing statement; read this and love this onto the next one.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This is all I need for keeping up when I travel now I will not have 400 E-Mails when I return.  It saved me getting a google account as I had to on my smart Phone.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Was decent movie, but not exceptional.  Would not wacth again.  kind of dragged in the middle, but had a happy ending
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I am a huge batman fan and enjoy these movies.  This one I loved! Great story line, great action, and great actors.
0761169431|4.0|My husband really liked this Christmas gift, but he has reported that some of the projects are pretty difficult and the organization of the book doesn't make much sense. The projects are not in order of difficulty or sorted by type. Still it is a very cool concept!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a great movie for those who love singing/musical, comedy, and of course a touch of romance.  Even my husband enjoyed it.  This movie had a perfect mixture of songs from different years and genres. It also had amazing actresses/actors which enhanced the story line and the comedy. &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; was the Perfect pick for a movie night and I'm sure I'll be watching this over and over again!
B007Q0K9ZI|5.0|The is one of the best concerts that I have ever heard of Andre Rieu.  It has some really beautiful songs.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Purchased this as an x-mas gift for my son, he loves it! Arrived in only 2 days, perfectly in time for x-mas.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I am really sparing with the term \\"Epic,\\" reserving the term for sagas like Lord of the Rings (extended edition) or Star Wars (original trilogy). But this film is very close to that mark -- maybe if I watched the extended edition...<br />The trailers made it look exciting, but also darker than it turned out to be. Not that it isn't dark -- it is, but it's fantasy with plenty of action and humor while still carrying pretty dark tone. Acting, sets and CGI are all outstanding and seamless, and I never felt like I was watching CGI. And Kirsten Stewart? Well, the best endorsement I can give is that it's such a great movie in spite of that choice as Snow White. Yes they could have done better but I have to admit she managed it well, and the moveie's other plusses more than made up for any slight negative I would give it on that score.
B000WLIEKK|5.0|This was the first album of theirs that I heard... and I love it. So I bought the others. They're all good, but this is still my favorite.
1451695195|5.0|I read this book in one day...couldn't put it down as it resonated with and confirmed my beliefs about the afterlife.  I have passed it on to another person who in turn already has someone else who she has told about book wanting to read it as well.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|No one makes music like this anymore. This is better than Two Against Nature, this should be the album of the year. Every song is excellent musicianship at its finest. There is only one so so song Planet D'Rhonda, every other song is dynamite. Nobody comes close to the sophisticated sound on this album. This Rock Funk Jazz fusion is a sound only a genius like Steely Dan and Donald Fagen can accomplish. Rolling Stone rates it as the 25th best Album of the year. And they give a Springsteen album as Number one. What? There is no more of a sophisticated sound than on Sunken Condos. I sure hope the Grammy members give this fantastic album more than one listen. Two listens and you are hooked, the songs are so damn good. The is Modern Music at its finest. You will not be disappointed when you buy this album. I can't stress enough how good this music sounds.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is a great companion piece - but with significantly more detail - to the popular Downton Abbey television series - understanding the times of the first great war in Europe - and the inevitable struggle between the haves and havenots - but not just in Great Britain but throughout Europe - perhaps a precursor to what the United States is facing in the very near future.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|After final watching Pitch perfect on video, I totally fell in love with the movie! I love dance and music so it wasn't a shock I must have this sound track. The album is great for adults and pretty clean of curse words for the kids.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The poignant drama of Hugo's work is brought to life &#34;only&#34; in the music written some 26+ years ago in this awesome musical - 2+ hours of the finest talent in an awesome venue - the &#34;O&#34; theater in London. It will move you to tears - if you still have a heart.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My two daughters (ages 3 and 5) really love the new Sofia The First: Once Upon a Princess TV Movie that came out on Disney Channel at the end of 2012. It is a cute story with cute characters. I would say it is geared towards younger, Disney Junior age kids due to the simple story and ages of the main characters.  The story introduces the King and new Queen (Sofia's mother), Sofia and her new Stepbrother and Stepsister, the Fairies who teach at Royal Prep Academy (Sofia's new school), the Castle Sorcerer (the bumbling bad guy), and several other characters.  There is minor, Disney style conflict with the new stepsister and the castle sorcerer which gives the story a great plot. Cinderella even makes an appearance to help the newest Disney Princess.<br /><br />My girls have watched this movie over and over since it came out and quickly memorized all the songs. They would sing along with the TV Movie and would wander around the house singing the songs all the time.  We have already bought the MP3 Music Soundtrack ([[ASIN:B00AAQWR7S Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess]]) and the Hardcover Storybook ([[ASIN:1423169867 Sofia the First]]) already available on Amazon, which I also highly recommend.<br /><br />The regular TV Series premiers on the Disney Channel on January 11, 2013 and this is a must have introduction to the Sofia characters and universe.  I know my girls are really looking forward to the show.  Don't miss it.<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />QUICK UPDATE (01/21/2013):<br />Well the TV Series came out a couple of weeks ago and two episodes in, it is a huge hit in our house.  My girls look forward to a new episode every Friday.  My wife made a big production for the premier episode.  She made a whole evening of it with a princess inspired dinner followed by dressing up and painting the Girls' nails before watching the show together.  It is really great having a princess TV Series for the girls to watch and look forward to.  Great show, and this DVD is a must have for the collection.is DVD is a must have for the collection.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I hate it took so long for us to see. This was a great movie! Clint Eastwood is always fantastic.
B0014R34A6|5.0|This is a great first &#34;motorized&#34; train set for my 2 year old and 5 year old.  It works with most of the other non-motorized lego cars so this train can push them around the track.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Kind of a bittersweet story, but the Streep/Jones combination was very good.  I will watching it again as time goes on.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I always enjoy Danielle Steel and have read most all her novels, but,<br />this is her very best, in my opinion.  A real treat!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|~<br /><br />What is not to love about a man such a Dexter.<br /><br />He can kill the bad guy, cut him up, package the cut up pieces, drop them off into the ocean and still be home in time for Letterman (his words sort of).<br /><br />Never thought I would fall for a serial killer but I love Dexter.
B006O7XOOW|1.0|This was a waste of money.  It basically only pushes the balls up and all over the floor.  My 1 year old son has zero interest in this.
B004ISL4E6|4.0|This work presents a five step process for producing creative ideas in simple easy to understand terms. Worth far more than the price!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This is a book I'd read years ago. Along with Sun Tsu's The Art of War, this is something you should always have by your bedside table. How pleased I was to find this on kindle. This is a manual of life that I can recommend as a must have to anyone that's ever seriously given any thought to the path your life is taking or about to take.
B009ZM74F8|5.0|I am a Sci-fi juncky, and this movie was so good that I added it to my video library.  Good entertanment.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|The plot and acting in this movie was incredible, but I spent half the time looking at the clothes :D  Characters were strong and endearing.  Highly recommended!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book gives a good overview of the Kindle publishing process and helped me get my first book up for sale. Thanks!
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I never really used it much. It may be really great but I found it unnecessary with any sort of cloud storage access
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Expressed sincere love from God and the need to share his experience.  Very comforting and inspiring.  I do recommend this book.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|This movie is one of most boring movies I have ever watched. I am a huge fan of all the Bourne Books and movies except this one. Do not waste your time renting or buying - if you must watch it - wait till it gets to redbox for only a $1.  The story plot was all over the place and made no real sense of where it was trying to take and/or where it took you.
B009Y2KGSQ|3.0|This is gonna be a rather odd review. First off, I have been an Aerosmith fan, since the 70's. I haven't loved everything they've done, but most. My preference leans towards the early years, and Rocks is my favorite album of all time. But this album doesn't have a direction. Joe Perry comes up with some really good riffs on this music, but nothing thats gonna get stuck in your head. And Steven doesn't sound good at all. His vocal reminds me of Night in the ruts, and we all know that was when the drugs had completely taken over. It kind of remind me of the new ZZ Top cd, in that they don't really know what way they want to go. There is a spot or two that makes ya smile, but for the most part its just back ground music. I gave it three because my wife rally likes it, so maybe I'm too critical.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan has such an amazing voice.  Love to hear her sing.  We have all her albums since seeing her on Britain's Got Talent.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Just purchased for our son, I have had this back pack for over 3 years and absolutely love it.  Pockets for everything, laptop, iPod, chargers, drink bottles.  Very heavy duty with padded straps for comfort.  Extremely durable, shows no wear in 3 years, highly recommend.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have only been on the program for four days, but am loving it.  I am not one to just go blindly with a &#34;tell me what to do.&#34;  This book gave me the science.  They tell you if you don't want the &#34;science-y&#34; part you can skip ahead...DON'T!  It will help you understand what is going on, making it (at least for me) easier to make the right choices.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is ahhhhhhhhhhmazing!  Read it all night long and could not get enough of it! I loved the relationship between sky and holder! Can't say enough
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not interested in this trilogy at all, and when it was picked for my book club I cringed.  I LOVED IT!  I devoured it.  I loved Katniss, and was surprisingly pulled into the story despite the violence and futuristic,unrealistic theme.  I am very much drawn to relatable stories, not at all fantastical such as this.  I was addictively hooked though, couldn't wait for the next book.  I do have to say Hunger Games was definitely the best of the three, Catching Fire was still good, with Mockingjay only completed because I just had to bring it to an end, not because that book itself did much for me.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I watched it and then ordered one for my daughter. Really wonderful movie. Now I need to read the book.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Victoria was abandoned as an infant, and barely loved as she was sent from one foster home to another, one group home to another.  On the day of her emancipation she is thrown into the world emotionally inept, financially empty and completely flawed.  Somehow she stumbles into a job at a flower shop, and able to find usefullness in the only passion she has had in her life.  As the story unfolds, Victoria's life actually starts, and she is learns how to live, and eventually love.  This was a GREAT book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I would never have thought I`d get so into this book as it`s emotionally intense, but it was so well written and so relatable I couldn't` put it down. Can`t wait to see the movie, and knowing who stars in it actually made this book better since I love both the leads.
B00009NQQO|5.0|My son loves playing with balls and this is just perfect. We stuck it to the patio window and he just loves it!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a great game that requires some strategy skills. It has an easy and intuitive User interface to learn and use. I would rank it up alongside angry birds.
B00AAX68HG|2.0|It is a free game so you would except ads to support the game makers.  However when it loops up as a full screen ad along with it being triggered because it took to long to show the ad and you are trying to go to the next level.  There is an option to take out the ads but it will cost 4.99. The ads should not take up the entire screen after every 2-4 levels.<br />It is a fun game but the ads are ruining the experience.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|If. You have persistence you can find it on lego.com for $35 plus shipping and handling which comes out to like $45 but definitely cheaper than other places.
0807014273|5.0|I found this hard to read and sad, but informative.  made my current problems in life look like nothing to complain about
B008MEM24S|4.0|What can I say, I'm hooked. Once I start playing this game, I find it difficult to put down. I like that is constantly challenges you.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Love it.  exciting and never know what is going to happen.  Bought all the series and watched them over the course of a couple weeks.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This was a great price.  It arrived promptly and I could not be happier.  ... ... ... ...  ... ...
B006IGZWB2|5.0|good movie.  It was nice to be able to just download it and watch on the laptop.  We have a smart tv too that we could have watched it on also.  I have actually seen this movie twice.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|For less than 5 bucks, how do you go wrong in buying this Dr. Seuss classic? Good to have in the family movie library.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I bought all the series and watched them consecutively.  It keeps your attention and not one of the boring standard plots.
B001DPHDCY|3.0|Inexpensive enough but the movie is only so good. If you're in to owning a bunch of movies, then adding this isn't a bad option but if you only want top movies, then this one didn't fit that bill for me.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This may be the most important book I have ever read. Dr. Murphy sets out the workings of the mind clearly  and simply.
1609611543|5.0|Very educational book. If you are struggling with issues related to wheat, grains and gluten this book will teach you a lot. I am gluten sensitive. I really enjoy this book and use it as a reference as well.<br /><br />Thank you,
B008TMA1LY|4.0|One year old loves hello kity and has been enjoying moving the people around.  She cant get too far but even the older brothers like to help her out.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Happy with it. Got a great deal! Came in good shape and it made for a very good Christmas present!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory has done it again!  Her unique writing style gives voice and depth to each character portrayed.  Definitely a great edition to the Cousins' War series.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Just finished watching the movie and my husband said he wanted the CD so I jumped on Amazon and ordered it.  I plan on giving it to him for valentines day.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like all the books of the series. So I guess  that this series  is just right for me.  I hope Jeff Kinney will write more books in this series.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This app helps me keep all my many lists organized. I love how you can use it on my Kindle, my iPhone and my computer and they all sync together, so I can have my list wherever I go.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|But it's still a ton of fun to listen to! This album has a lot of unique tracks, all with different-sounding songs. It's a lot of fun to sing along to in the car but it doesn't have the same dance-feel as her previous albums.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Cute read! Easy, contemporary romance!  I enjoyed it! :)  Just don't know I'll be rereading it anytime soon.  But cute, and especially since it was free, it was worth it!
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for some of my close friends. They love all things Star Wars. They also have a two year-old who loves Star Wars. I got them this book so they could all enjoy interactive story time. They really love this book.
067144901X|5.0|I bought this for my niece and nephew (2 and 1 years) for Christmas and they really love the books.  They are some of the few books that they like and will get into at their young ages.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in NDE or learning more about life. Enjoy
0671449028|5.0|I bought this for my niece and nephew (2 and 1 years) for Christmas and they really love the books.  They are some of the few books that they like and will get into at their young ages.
B009O2XY12|2.0|This need to be available without wi-fi access.  Not what I expected for the grandkids.  They like Bubble Pop better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a compelling read!! Even when I wasn't reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about the characters and wondering what would happen next. A love story and thriller all in one. Many late nights reading this one, but so worth it!!! This is a definite \\"must read\\"! Sparks will have you on the edge of your seat eagerly anticipating each character's next move...
B000SZK41M|5.0|Here's my new Christmas Eve Tradition:  Watch Die Hard.  Can't say anymore about this movie that hasn't been said before.
1400052173|5.0|Both my wife and I wanted to read this book about an extraordinary tale of science.<br />The book arrived in superb condition and was earlier than anticipated.<br />We have to change our reading agenda.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a very fun game, at first it does not seem like a good game, but after a while  It's a great game, I recommend getting this app.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I just wanted to keep reading right up to the end and they never disappointed - next step watch the film :)
B006LSZECO|1.0|The author is manipulative; the story, while catchy, is trite and ugly.  Not for those with weak stomachs.  Bury this garbage - don't buy it or read it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I got this on my android.  It was almost instant and I got it for free! You can't fail with amazon!
B0007LXPBI|4.0|This is one of my favorite Disney movies.  I loved the original Parent Trap when I was growing up.  I thought this remake was done very well also.  Dennis Quaid is one of my favorite actors.  Lindsey Lohan showed much promise as a great actress in this film also.  I am sad to see how things have turned out for her.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book. It was a little hard to by into, but once you do it is with it.
B0053O89IS|4.0|Bones and Brennan are one of my favorite TV couples.  I love the way they compliment each other and this season with their baby coming is the best.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie is better than I expected!! Very funny and entertaining!! It has a great story line and the music and singing are excellent. I would definitely recommend watching it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. Can't wait to read the rest of the books. It really makes you think if that were to happen to you what you would do. I do hope she realizes the truth in his love for her
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are intense and Collins captures you with each word until you are wrapped up in the grips of this brilliant plot.<br />Reminds me of 1984, it can definitely be seen as a mirror on certain parts of society. Not sure if this was intended or not, but it is sheer brilliance.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|Written by quentin tarantino so lots of violence, swearing, and awesomeness. Very good soundtrack. Seen this movie multiple times and its a good one worth watching. Will buy next time I feel like watching it. In my opinion, good to watch with a gf/bf as well as it has lots for everyone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written, boring and disgusting.  Would not recommend it to anyone.  I returned it without finishing it.  It doesn't deserve even one star.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A cute story about a couple in Vegas who get married.  Oops!  Read this story if you want to see if they break up or stay married.  A cute twist on what could have tragic results.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|yes - it is long, and the bundle makes it seem even longer, but what a story!!!  The author does such a great job of world building and character building, it will go by quickly.  An awesome story.  It is often unpredictable - Martin is not afraid to kill of what you may have thought was going to be a main character.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the book couldn't put the book down! Hopeless ment so many things!! It felt like on every page something was going to happen!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Highly recommended.  A story of survival against all odds - shipwreck, a tiger, hunger, thirst - and you never expect how it ends. . . but then again, what does the end mean?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just love everything about it.  Great character development, great acting, great picture of how the upper crust lived in the early 20th century.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a good read - although it feels like it somewhat rehashes some of the story line from The Hunger Games, it carries on with the character development and is enjoyable.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A friend gave me one of Vince Flynn's books and after finishing it, I was hooked.  I did not read them in order as I requested them from the library; and they all came in at different times and had different copyrights.  But I loved them. I have since got my sister and brother-in-law hooked as well.  They have listened to the audio books and they are great.  I bought &#34;Last Man&#34; because I could not wait to get it from the library.  It is wonderful.  Mr Flynn, I hope you are reading this cause I need you to be writing some more great stories for Mitch Rapp.  Keep up the amazing writing!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|super fun great story and graphics. Story line was good too love the little monkey helper! cant wait to try the sequel
B005LAIIKI|1.0|In short, this film is a piece of crap. It is very violent and the actors are themselves oppossed to violence, GUNS! I must side with Spike Lee on this film. Don't bother.  Jerry
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not a bad game, have to put up with adds between hands, but all you have to do is skip them.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I really loved this movie. Logan Lerman was sensitive, good for the part. Emma Watson was amazing, but it is Ezra Miller whose acting in so right on, he captures the teen years, high school, all the difficulties associated with these years in everyones lives. He is young and his finest roll yet is Another Happy Day. He will need to be turning to more mature rolls now that he is older and I just cannot wait to see what he can do with more mature scripts, stories and how he will interpt with his amazing his abilities.  Jerry
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a very action packed episode! We can't wait to watch some more and recently we heard it has been approved for season 4!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent book can't wait for the movie<br />Keeps your attention through the whole book I gave a 5 star cause I really enjoyed this book
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love this series of books. They are well done with excellent research and have great suspense, mysterly and humor.
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved this book. It made me smile and cry. But I also think it was completely wonderful. I was sorta disappointed that it didn't say anything about him helping her do everything she wanted to do before she died, or about him making her a telescope. Other than that it was a beautiful book. I would recommend it to anybody. Even though I'm 13, I will always want a love as strong as Landon and Jamie's.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me guessing right until the end - impossible to put down! Wickedly perverse and engaging -  would definitely recommend
B007TNS6JI|5.0|How can this game be free it is epic and perfect the only downside is that you have to pay for some things and the cost of new items is too high
0525953728|4.0|bought this right when it came out, before all the movies, after reading this book, you really understand a lot of what the movie (zero dark thirty) and the news regarding the compound in Pakistan. it was originally rumored that this book was going to be pulled by the defense dept or pentagon because there is too much information being released that has not been declassified, but in my honest opinion there is nothing new and the glimpse of the life of the seals is not that surprising.<br /><br />the book itself is not that well written, I based my review off the content and the story, not off the authors writing ability, the book is not very suspenseful but then again I guess I already knew the ending.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was a fast going book that really  spoke to me. The words made me picture what was going on, and it was really good. I am not a romance kind of person, but, this book was surprising good!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun.  Addictive.  Better odds of winning than traditional Solitaire.  I don't go for very many games but I'm glad I gave it a try.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I missed season 1 and 2 on PBS so I had to get the DVD.  The clarity and crispness on the blu ray is amazing and really enhances the view experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So, I just finished reading Hopeless and I have to say .. it is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!  This book had me hooked from the first page, and I knew I was going to be in for an amazing ride. Then out of nowhere, Colleen completely threw a curveball at me and took it to a whole other level, and I loved it. She is such an amazing and talented writer and I know that every time I pick up one of her books I'm going to be in for a wonderful read. She has the ability to write a story that gets readers so emotionally invested and it's wonderful.  I had no idea she was going to take me on that journey and throughout the second half of the book, I cried. When I got to that certain part of the story, I was completely crushed. I couldn't believe what happened and it broke my heart. I am a very emotional person normally, but add this book into the mix and I cried like a baby. I completely fell in love with Sky and Holder. She makes you feel the intimacy and attraction to them with every single word. And I have to say that I loved Six. She was hilarious and I think every person should have a friend like her. I love the friendship between Sky and Six. This was the most beautiful story I have read and I know it will stay with me for a long time. I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat, but I definitely think that Hopeless is number one for me right now.  If you have not read this book yet, I suggest you DROP EVERYTHING and get on it.  You will not be disappointed, I promise!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I watch this series and have found that we much prefer the DVDs of the series as they eliminate the 20-30 minute long appeal for PBS funding.  It's a bit ironic that PBS makes a point of repeating they are commercial free, and proceed to have the LOOOOONG appeals for donations. I like PBS, even contribute! But geez those 'non-commercials' go on and on.
B000VZYPB4|1.0|After recommendations from several trusted friends, I forced myself to watch more than the first episode. First: fake laugh tracks are a real turn off. Being told when to laugh (especially when the situation is not funny) is pathetic. Second: this show is a predictable collection of worn-out stereotypes with no character depth whatsoever. A hot blond bimbo and nerdy scientists? Please! How about a hot blond scientist and nerdy waiter folks? That would be more interesting. Waste of money if you like stimulating shows like Weeds or Breaking Bad.
B00870ZH3U|5.0|Very well done.  Ties into Phantom of the Opera very nicely.  Sets, music and voices were awesome, especially the phantom who has to be the best ever!  Great storyline.  This is a don't miss musical.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|The computer is a very challenging opponent, and while it WILL frustrate you sometimes, the computer doesn't break the rules and it's always your fault.  Yes, even when you lose in 5 turns.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|After being disappointed with Down II, I hadn't picked up this album until just this year - and wow - I'm totally blown away.  It is light years ahead of Down II, and pretty much just as good as NOLA.  I'm not kidding, it's that good.  The riffs are all totally solid - not quite as good as NOLA's, but solid - but the sheer heaviness of this album is amazing.  And Phil sounds just incredible.  Honestly, if you were disappointed in II like I was, absolutely do not hesitate to pick this album up.  This is the album we've all been waiting for after NOLA.  I can't stress enough, this is just about the best follow-up they could've done.  I own the new EP part 1 of their IV album, and it's good, but nowhere near as good as Over the Under.  If you are a Phil, Down, CoC, and Pantera fan, you will LOVE this album.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|It's a fun little game; the puzzles are tricky but fair.  The only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is because the game could use some kind of guide function to help you with trickier maps.  Other than that if you like puzzles go for it!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|This movie is funny from start to finish.  The music is great and to bop along to. The main love story in the movie is a bit slow developing and way to obvious in the end. But hey, if you watch this movie because of the love story you must not know anything about the movie in the first place and will be pleasantly surprised.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Great rendition of the Dr. Seuss story!  Animation and characters are true to the Seuss tales and the story is a great modern fable to show balance in the world is important.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|officesuite professional 6<br /><br />not what i wanted it to do...... ..... ..... ..... would not buy it  again but it may be ok for you..<br /><br />plus i really do not like amazon new rating service........!
B000FA5SMK|4.0|THis is a very interesting book. I even googled a map of Long Island to better follow along. The only issue is the 'hunt for the treasure'. I found that a little far fetched- but interesting.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Even better series than season 1.... very interesting and kept me thinking what was going to happen next.... Although.. had trouble watching one of the episodes due to the DVD messing up.. besides that.. awesome.. can't wait to watch Season 3
B009JBZH54|5.0|it was a great price for all 3 batman flims  have not had time to check out all the extras  but seems fine
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Awesome Start... kept me very interested and could not wait to watch the second series!  Fixin to start the Second Series now...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|As much as I would have loved for there to be a second season, this seems increasingly unlikely.<br /><br />(This is 'not shiny' FOX.)<br /><br />This full length movie (which shares the same name as the series pilot, but is a different story altogether) continues the story of the well-loved characters of the Firefly television show.<br /><br />The acting is marvelous, the story telling compelling and, in my opinion, the storyline gives a very timely cautionary tale for us today.<br /><br />Snuggle up with a loved one, grab your popcorn and drink, and curl up on the couch for a great date-night movie for science fiction fans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Helps me to be more consistent in reading the Bible. The devotional material is varied and relevant to Christians seeking a closer walk with God.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Alas, if only Firefly had lasted even one more season. This show has become a cult classic--and for good reason. Excellent writting, well-rounded characters and intriquing plots make this science fiction show a must see.<br /><br />If you enjoy Star Wars, Star Trek, or the Terminator franchise, give this a try.
B000YABS8E|5.0|This movie is funny, smart and entertaining.  It makes you think of the world we live in today and what we've lost in the last few decades.  Christopher Walken is fantastic as the genius who builds a fall-out shelter in 1963 and hides there during the Cuban Missile Crisis only to have an Air Force jet crash on it making him believe &#34;the bomb&#34; has been dropped on the US.  His son is raised in the fall-out shelter and doesn't enter the real world until 1998.  He stumbles through with the help of Alicia Silverstone and his excellent education he has received from his parents.  An oldie but a goodie!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has worked since day one. It has never stopped working or frozen. It is really convenient! I have it installed on both my Samsung Galaxy &amp; my Fire.
B001THZAAI|5.0|We wanted to see the French movie, since we had already seen the Italian version of this story.  We enjoyed &#34;Bienvenue&#34; very much.  The actors were new to us and quite funny.  In particular, the woman post office employee and the postmaster from the South were charming.  Like &#34;Amelie&#34;, it gives Americans a view of French people as &#34;just working folks&#34;, whereas in the stereotype, the French are often shown in movies as a snobbish elite.  The subtitles adequately supplied a translation for all the dialect jokes, not an easy thing to do.  Lots of fun.
B007SGM084|5.0|What a beautiful love story with a little kinky #=/?!&@$<br />Mixed in.  Anna and Christian just make me want to read more!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved these books. Finished them all in less than a week. Which I have never done before. Now to watch the movie...but I doubt it will be able to capture all of the emotion and great detail. So I probably won't like it lol
B00APUYN0I|5.0|A lot of fun!! Hilarious!!! Definitely looking forward to a sequel. The whole cast was perfect!  A feel good movie all the way around!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good couldn't put it down can't wait to read the final has me on pins and needles to see what's happening next
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I normally do not like reading but after seeing the movie trailer I decided to get the book and read it first!  I am so happy I did!!!  I could not stop reading & now hooked by Sparks!  I am now going to move on to another one of his books!
0439023483|4.0|very quick read, other than that I enjoyed it overall. Sorry if this review isn't helpful I just wanted to add an extra star to a good book.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|Good stuff here.  One minor sticking point so far is that he goes into too much depth in refuting Jared Diamonds premise in Guns, Germs, and Steel.  In Guns, Germs, and Steel Jared Diamond deals with the factors that facilitated the rise of civilization NOT with the success of those civilizations, which is the whole point of Why Nations Fail.
0547569653|5.0|I read this book in a few days, could not put it down. Gotta respect this guy, he is one heck of a ultrarunner.
0062127241|4.0|Kinda disappointed with all of the disappointed readers. I just finished this an hour ago, and I have to say I'm slightly saddened it came to an end. It's not a chronology of Who or solo recordings, but instead a sprawling 500 page book about his various insights about his creative process, his failings, the work he did that made him proud, but mostly, about who he is as a flawed but significant creative force. Some reviewers seem upset that he didn't detail his writing process, or his love for specific guitars, or favorite performances, but this seems to me more a story of a human being, not a celebrity. In the acknowledgements, he claims that it was originally 1000+ pages, and needed pruning. What's on the floor? Probably stuff that serious Who fans already know about. This didn't strike me as an effort to document his musical career--just various recollections, triumphs, regrets, and relationships. And I really enjoyed it. Yeah, I would have preferred a little less of his sexual escapades and (by his own admission) immature crushes on young women, and more about some of his genius as an artist, but it is what it is and so be it. By spending a considerable amount of time on his childhood, we see him as a real person, not some superficial rock star. The book made me cringe in a few spots, but mostly, I found his candor and humanity quite admirable. I recommend it.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|This is a great source of practical advice for all of is who don't fit in. Anchored in several different areas, the information draws a full picture without leaving gaps for us to guess at on our own. Informative AND comforting.
B0026772N8|5.0|I've read this book at least a dozen times in the last 35 years, and it never ceases to amaze me the way Robert Persig's mind<br />works. His mind is out there - way out there!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Love this book keeps you wanting to read with wondering what going to happen next. Easy read. Worth the download!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This was beyond an embarassment to the man's profession - the contradicitions and arrogance put forth and unworthy of an author let alone a neurosurgeon.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Didn't want to put this one down.just the right amount of wrong. Sexy yet tasteful in all the right places.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was definitely a page turner but not necessarily for suspenseful reasons. Nicholas Sparks has a way of making readers fall in love as the characters fall in love. So excited for the movie!
B009MCRHH6|1.0|When I purchased this app for my kindle fire I thought it better be something special if it was $5 but IT WAS NOT!!! Maybe if the price was 99 cents my review would be different.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great book.  It kept me  interested from beginning to the end.  It was well written as all of John Grisham's books are.  What else can I say about the book other than it is a great book  and I highly  recommend it to everyone.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This movie is fun with some great songs and comedic moments. 80's rock set to the story of a girl from Oklahoma looking for fame and fortune in LA.
B000KI6286|5.0|A movie to make you laugh while you think - an excellent movie that you'll want to watch more than once!
B009KHCT94|1.0|I get it, America is the cause of all evils in the world.  At least that's what this movie tries really hard to get across.  By the end of the movie it seemed as if America is worse than the Nazis.  For instance, the re-election campaign slogan of &#34;Black to the Moon&#34;, where the President (a Sarah Palin spoof) sends a black model, not a scientist, air force pilot or something that makes sense to the moon to increase her popularity.  There is the fact that the President sends her campaign manager to command a US space ship to fight the Nazis and the campaign manager looks like a villain from Star Trek.  Or the ever so clever ending that greedy and evil America causes the end of the world through nuclear war.  I know America is not popular around the world, but wow, it appears that at least a few European countries really hate us, or at least a few European based film companies.  I rented this cause I thought it would be a &#34;so dumb it's funny&#34; kind of movie.  Which is why I would guess a lot of people will rent or even buy it.  But I found that I spent most of the movie regretting paying anything to see it.  After seeing it, I don't think I would have enjoyed it even if it was free....
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this HO mystery game! It was not too easy but not too hard. I think all ages can play this game as the hints are very helpful to allow you to see the next move if you get stuck! Great graphics! I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys HO mystery games. Enjoy!
0399157565|1.0|I wrote a review on Trace saying I would never read PC again, but then it was in the new book section of the library and decided to give her another chance. The only thing good I can say about it is that Lucy and her genius intellect didn't play a HUGE part in this story.<br />It was misleading when the cover said it was about a dig finding ancient bones. The title \\"Bone Bed\\" is very misleading.<br />I know now not to get sentimental and give PC another chance. I still don't know who Al Galbraith was and didn't want to go back and check him out.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|You can tell I've been auto-corrected. All the same this was an amazing read. One of my favorites next to Enders Game. Bravo.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loves playing this on my Kindle Fire even more than I do. It is something that we share which makes it priceless in my book.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times and still can't get tired of it! Just love love this awesome movie!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This was a gift to a family member and they loved it! I particularly liked the Sergio Leone Suite the most.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|interesting read. good story line, once you get passed the sex scenes. I would recommend it to adult readers only.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I heard this CD in its entirety when visiting family last spring. Loved it then and decided to buy it to add to my collection.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a fantastic read for any teen because it really demonstrates what a lot of teens go through. I absolutely loved it!
0679418008|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter to part of a set for her birthday. She commented how good the set looked on her bookshelf and that she was excited to read them again for herself and in her classroom.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book is incredible. It is beautifully written and is a perfect balance of love, teenage rebellion, an  the struggle between what society views as wrong and right.
0679436421|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter to part of a set for her birthday. She commented how good the set looked on her bookshelf and that she was excited to read them again for herself and in her classroom.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Night Circus is a beautifully crafted tale guaranteed to leave readers breathless. I tip my hat to author, Erin Morgenstern, for creating not a book, but a dream in itself. Unlike anything you've ever read before, it's sure to be a gem from the very beginning.
0765317389|5.0|I read this book in the 6th grade and listened to it again this past summer during a family trip.<br />Still inspiring, still fun.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, cerebral, SciFi story.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I absolutely hate this game. It's not fun or anything positive except for the fact that you get to see your own guy. Overall don't waste your cash
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Recommend this game. My kids ages 6 and 8 both enjoy this game! There are lots of options- curling, coloring, cutting, etc. I even had fun with it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have had other solitaire games and enjoyed playing them and I do like this versioin and will play it often.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|All your products are excellent.! How can you not love a coffee pot or the drinks? The filters are fine.<br />Mike Lisowski
B006HL9G10|5.0|I love this app! It it great to know how many others are meditating at the same time and where. I love the choice of timing and the gongs are gentle.
B004WR125O|5.0|A $20 part Onkyo could have included in the receiver for pennies.  It seems silly, but it isn't that expensive and just plug it in and it works.  If your receiver only has one USB port, you can't use this and another USB device at the same time.  If you are lucky and have a receiver like mine that has a USB port in back and in front, just plug it in and go!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love the flashbacks to the island. I'm on the edge of my seat to learn more about the island experience and the people there. The undercurrent with his mother is electric with her hidden agenda and her husband's probes into her affairs.<br />I just can't wait for the next episode!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is one of the best note taking apps on the market. I tried doing without it for a few weeks and it was difficult. The other apps I tried to use to replace it just cannot compare.<br />Top of the list is ease of use. Evermore is intuitive and has almost no learning curve. It allows you to organize your notes the way you want, or need to, and therefore is as flexible as you need it to be.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, and I especially like the large keys and display. My only suggestion would to be able to review and correct entries on a long strings of entries.
B0099116AY|1.0|Movie gets to the same spot and will not go forward. Period.<br /><br />Amazon promptly sent a replacement and just had a chance to view and it does the same thing. We finally found that playing the movie with the &#34; remarks&#34; soundtrack that it would play. I am sure it is a production problem.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Read it, you'll love it. A thoughtful, funny, quick read that I thoroughly enjoyed and will recommend to all my friends
B004JN1CW4|5.0|You won't believe the ending. I won't spoil it hut lets just say that if you read the first two books in trilogy, then reading this is an absolute must. Props to James Dashner for an amazing trilogy and an awesome name.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of challenge.  Love the redeal feature.  If you don't succeed the first time, you can try it again to correct your mistakes. Doesn't always work...after all it is a game of chance and luck.  ENJOY!!!
B00001NTXN|4.0|Takes a few games before you start to realize how to play but a fun, different game.  Played it with my 9 year old and he enjoyed it, as he loves games of strategy
0345803507|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of &#34;romance&#34; novels, but I must say that this trilogy doesn't really fit the bit of &#34;romance.&#34;  I loved the visualization created in the book, the suspense and mystery of the &#34;villains&#34; in the book, and the romance and erotica between Anna and Christian.  Definitely worth reading again and again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game &amp; easy way to waste time. I like that it is similar to a Facebook game I play
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks books. But this one is by far the best. I cried, was nervous, and some parts took me by surprise. My favorite part was when Katie finally stood up for herself and fought Kevin. I recommend this book to all my friends and family. It's not just for girls, it's for guys too.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I just returned home from watching this film.  I thoroughly loved it.  If you are a child of the 1980s and enjoyed John Hughes films, you will love this movie.  Take the best things about the 80s:  making mix tapes for people you like, going to dances, having your first crushes, dealing with insecurities and shyness, knowing deep secrets about the popular people in school, but then combine all of the dramatic scenes with very powerful performances, and you have a film that is just a great watch and will make you experience every emotion.  I laughed, teared up, felt sadness, and felt exuberance all in 1 hour and 42 minutes.  I will see again, and I am definitely going to add to my video library.  I'm also thinking about reading the book.  If I were an Academy member, I would vote for this film for Best Picture before I would \\"Lincoln.\\"  I'm dead serious!

0375846735|2.0|Admittedly, I am writing this review 10 years after I've read this trilogy.  I, like many others, really enjoyed and got sucked into the world he created through his trilogy.  However, from what I recall, I was extremely disappointed in the HEAVY religious inclusions in the third book, which ended up becoming a core piece of the climax and the ending in The Amber Spyglass.  This seemingly random conclusion completely broke that \\"suspension of disbelief\\" concept for me because that grounded me right back in reality dealing with concepts that exist in our world vs. in the world that he had previously created.  It was a complete let down and seemed to betray the previous concepts of the other two parts of this trilogy.  The only reason I granted this more than 1 star is because of the weight of the other 2 books.  I appreciated the return of my beloved characters from the Golden Compass and Subtle Knife, but how the characters got, in my opinion, mutilated into people they weren't makes this series not worth finishing....I will say I think this series is worth reading for the first 2 books....but this book really does take a heavy blow to the world, \\"rules\\", and concepts that was previously created.

B007DA2FHG|4.0|Any serious student of WWI will probably be disappointed, since the story is pretty unrealistic, but so was &#34;Lassie, Come Home&#34; and &#34;The INcredible Journey&#34; which this story resembles. Some scenes might upset sensitive viewers/readers but you KNOW they won't let anything happen to Joey, or will they?

B00AFEY354|5.0|Every now and then, you come across a film where everything was done just right. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those films. Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay as well as the popular young-adult novel of the same name from which it was adapted, The Perks of Being a Wallflower seems to hit every note just right, capturing all of the tumult and the extreme highs and lows of adolescence as experienced by a group of friends in high school in Pittsburgh back in the early 1990's.<br /><br />(*** Note:  this review contains what some people feel to be spoilers, so if you're sensitive to such things, please stop reading now and just take my word that this is really well-done, enjoyable film and is well worth going out of your way to find and see. ***)<br /><br />The film begins with 14-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) writing a letter to an anonymous \\"Dear Friend\\" about his nervousness about starting his first year in high school. He writes because he doesn't feel he can talk to his parents or his siblings about his anxieties, nor does he seem to have any real friends he can confide in, for reasons that are initially only hinted at in the internal narrative of his letters.<br /><br />Charlie's anxieties prove to be well-founded as he finds himself isolated in his first few days at school, dodging upperclass jocks looking to harass new freshmen, torn between just wanting to be left alone and yet not wanting to feel alone. The only friend he makes his first day turns out to be his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), who notices Charlie writing down correct answers to questions he asks of the class but not holding up his hand to be called on. Sensing Charlie's reluctance to be noticed, Anderson reaches out to him, \\"You know they say if you make one friend on your first day you'll do good.\\" To which Charlie glumly responds \\"If my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that'll be sorta depressing.\\"<br /><br />In spite of his tendency to withdraw from everyone, Charlie finds himself unexpectedly drawn into the orbit of an ultra-extroverted and over-the-top flamboyant senior named Patrick (Ezra Miller), who happens to be the only senior in his freshman shop class as well as a major source of annoyance to the shop teacher, Mr. Callahan (Tom Savini - yes, for those who recognize the name, it's that Tom Savini). At the school's first football game, Charlie spots Patrick up in the bleachers and ventures up, hoping Patrick will invite him to sit with him, which Patrick cheerfully does. They are soon joined by another senior, a quirky but friendly girl named Sam (Emma Watson), to whom Patrick introduces Charlie and with whom Charlie is immediately encrushed. After the game, Patrick and Sam invite Charlie along to grab something to eat. The two seem so close to each other that Charlie mistakes them for being boyfriend and girlfriend. They laughingly correct him and tell him that they're actually step-siblings who found that they just get along really well-together, always liking the same music and always having each other's backs.<br /><br />Gradually, Charlie is befriended by Patrick and Sam. At the homecoming dance, to which Charlie goes alone, he ends up dancing with Patrick and Sam, who then drag Charlie along with them to a party where he meets the rest of their circle: Bob (Adam Hagenbuch), an amiable stoner; Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman), who's bossy and opinionated; and Alice (Erin Wilhelmi), a proto-goth who's into film. At the party, Charlie unknowingly has his first hash-brownie, which causes him to loosen up to the point of sharing his observations on what he thinks of high school so far, which both amuses and impresses the others. He also later divulges privately to Sam that he hasn't been close to anyone since his best friend committed suicide the year before. Learning this, Patrick and Sam decide on the spot to bring Charlie into their circle of friends, with Patrick making it official byquipping \\"Welcome to the island of misfit toys.\\"<br /><br />As Charlie gets to know Patrick and Sam and their circle, he leans that all of them have their own set of individual issues they have to cope with. Patrick is fairly openly gay, but his boyfriend Brad (Johnny Simmons), one of the school's star football players, is very much in the closet and so they have to pretend to not really know each other in school. Sam, whom Charlie only sees as beautiful, smart and talented, has low self-esteem and always settles for guys, like her current boyfriend Craig (Reese Thompson), who always treat her badly. A problem shared by Charlie's sister, Candace (Nina Dobrev), whom Charlie sees being abused by her boyfriend. At one point, when Sam asks Charlie \\"Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?\\" he repeats what his English teacher told him when he asked him the same question: \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\" But when Charlie says it to Sam, he is finally beginning to understand what it means.<br /><br />Chbosky does a fine job of touching on moments that almost everyone can relate to from their own high school experience. The intensity - and fragility - of adolescent relationships. The way you can sometimes find yourself in a relationship with someone you don't want to be involved with but don't know how to get out of, even as the person you really want to be with is in a relationship with someone else. And how formative moments can suddenly come in the most unexpected circumstances. Like when Patrick and Sam are driving Charlie home after the party and Sam, hearing a song on the radio that she immediately likes, demands that Patrick take the tunnel, where she cranks up the volume and then stands up in the back of the pickup and sways like she's dancing to the music as the tunnel lights flash by overhead. The image is simple and yet entrancing, and we, with Charlie, find ourselves falling in love with her.<br /><br />Other moments are also well captured. Like when Charlie unexpectedly gets drafted to be the substitute Rocky in the group's live-cast act at the midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and suddenly finds himself nearly naked in gold lame hot pants in a theater full of people, doing the \\"Toucha-Toucha-Touch Me!\\" number with Sam's bodiced-and-boaed Janet. Another moment occurs at a party where Charlie his friends are playing truth-or-dare, when Charlie takes a dare and in an unwitting but truly honest moment commits an enormous faux pas, leaving him suddenly shunned by the entire group just as he was beginning to feel like he wasn't alone. And yet another moment reunites Charlie with the group when he comes to Patrick's rescue during a fight in the cafeteria with a ferocity that takes everyone aback - a moment that for all its heroic nature also hints at Charlie's deeper problems. Problems that ultimately come to a crisis point when graduation comes and Charlie has to watch as his senior friends leave and he finds himself alone once again. It is to Chbosky's enormous credit that he avoids the usual Hollywood teen-movie approach and treats these situations much as they really are - complicated, with no easy answers, and with wisdom often coming painfully and with a cost.<br /><br />The young cast are all excellent in their roles, with standout performances by Lerman, Miller and Watson. Logan Lerman's Charlie is a complex mix, perceptive and yet naïve, a loner who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too. He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him. Ezra Miller's Patrick is charmingly rendered, a character who uses his flamboyance to mask his frustrations and sometimes despair at the unfairness of life, only letting a very few, like Sam and eventually Charlie, inside his protective front. And Emma Watson's Sam is a bravura turn as a girl who comes to life among her friends but whose self-esteem withers when it comes to believing she has anything like a future waiting for her or that she can do better in her choices of boyfriends. All three are acting veterans - Lerman (Percy Jackson & the Olympians), Miller (We Need to Talk about Kevin), and Watson (the Harry Potter films) - but I think The Perks of Being a Wallflower will be a break-out film for all of them. Particularly for Emma Watson, who proves once and for all that she can be a lot more than just Hermione Granger.<br /><br />But if the actors are extraordinary in their performances, credit must also be given to the heartfelt dialogue Chbosky's novel and screenplay provides them to work with. All are given wonderfully individual voices, but Charlie, as the would-be writer and ever observant `wallflower' among them, is the one ultimately speaks for all of them with an achingly earnest lyrical poetry, as he does at the end when once again he's with Patrick and Sam, driving through the tunnel and listening to the song they'd heard earlier, except that it is now Charlie who is standing in the back and swaying with the lights passing overhead:<br /><br />\\"I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening, I am here and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite.\\"<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.also well captured.

B0073COMKW|5.0|After I discovered that the cfl bulbs that were all over my house have mercury in them, I was on a mission but couldn't decided if I was going back to regular bulbs or switch to LED.  Regular bulbs are cheap to buy but expensive to run, LED bulbs are expensive but cheaper to run - I opted for LED.  I found warm white bulbs that were supposed to be like 60watts but they were more between a 20 and 40 watt bulb.  Then I found these - They are awesome.  I have ordered more and am happy to say I have replaced 90% of the bulbs in my house.  Now I don't get so upset when someone leaves a light on in the room because the cost to run them is so low.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very good read that keeps you very much in the story and has you laughing at all times.  And just when you think nothing else will surprise you, Mark finds a way with a good curse to point it out.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|I remember getting the original game on December 9th, 2008 and being completely ecstatic when I finished it in June of 2009. Taking 89 hours and 59 minutes was quite the achievement for me because I generally don't have the time to complete games and I only play for fun. I may be slightly biased but the original game was near perfection to me (at the time). The only qualm I really had was that the story never felt complete. When word broke loose of an enhanced port I knew my time was coming to play the new reincarnation of Persona 4 and, needless to say, I'm not disappointed. They really have fleshed out the story making the characters become more lifelike and the transition periods more smooth. As for new additions there are tons of new costumes, new cutscenes, new persona's, new social links, skill cards (Persona moves that can be trained by cards), and extended gameplay. I don't want to give away any of the story but ultimately due to the fleshed out scenes and stories there is actually a better understanding of the overall plot and it moves a long much smoother than the PS2 version. If you've played any of the incarnations of Persona 3 (3, FES, PSP) than you will be happy to know (if you liked those games) that Persona 4 Golden is now the ultimate Persona experience wrapped up in a bow made of new additions. The game play is a nice mix between visual novel/dating sim, turn based battle, exploration, monster mixing, and so much more. Persona 4 is a hard enough game to explain but I hope anyone who enjoys a good game will give it a shot and fall in love like I have!<br /><br />P.S.- The newest addition took me 82 hours and 59 minutes to beat because I didn't grind as much as I did in the PS2 version.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Loved this book.  Couldn't put it down.  I'm reading the Secret Speech now.<br />Would recommend this book to all lovers of suspense.
0316228532|5.0|I've never had the least desire to read the Harry Potter series but thought I might try the book J. K. Rowling wrote for grown-ups.  I loved it!  The character development is wonderful, and the doings of the folks in Pagford were endlessly fascinating to me.  Rowling shows a great sympathy and understanding of the poor and downtrodden, those the rest of us tend to look down on, as well as the points of view and petty egocentrism of the well-to-do.  I cared about all these characters personally by the end of the book and hated for the book to end!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I heard of Drl Alexander's experience and was curious about his book.<br />It did not dissapoint.  His writing was pure and a great read. Very inciteful.  I'm a true believer of Heaven now.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|I have read many of Michael Connelly's books but I'm not excited about reading short stories.  I like a story with more interesting detail.
B002VWNID6|1.0|Tried a couple different copies of this movie and both stopped after 1:14:32 worth of playing. The second half of the movie was not on the disc.  Should take all of these off the market!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it is an original concept and they even make fun of movies that are just repeats of other movies in a scene where they say something like \\"you know that tie is from those old movies that did nothing but repeat themselves\\"<br /><br />SPOILER BELOW  !!!!!<br /><br />I really enjoyed it and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is they should have let us know what happened to the boy after the Looper killed himself, did he still turn out evil? Maybe that's for The Looper 2!!!
1423140605|5.0|My son has read the other books in this series so he was excited to get this book for Christmas
B0052AC8C6|3.0|There were several places where the plot was draggy. There were several innuendos inappropriate for children. I wouldn't think the swearing would be necessary for a movie of this type. Only mildly entertaining.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|Not the strongest book in the series, as it follows mostly secondary characters and plot lines. It does, however, set up nicely for the real action coming up (Martin even has a apology of sorts in the back explaining this). I am stoked to read the next book.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I think this is going to be one of my most favorite books, like, EVER! (Except for Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Nothing can top his awesomness. Period.) If a book makes you feel a strong emotion, that's a good indicator of whether it's a good book or not. This book had me crying tears (of joy!) at the end. I'm a sucker for happy endings, and this ending was perfect. :) Besides the perfect ending, there were some hilarious jokes that had me laughing out loud. I must have looked crazy when I went out in public and read. :)<br />This book is about love. Loving your family, loving yourself, and falling in love. Being yourself and not having to worry what others think, about loving people for who they are. About making a difference in the world. Alex and Brittany both have their problems, but in the end that's what makes them stronger when they have to overcome them. It's what brings them together and gives them their happy ending. Everyone needs a happy ending.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The movie was awesome and the picture was great. I would definetley recommend this movie, amazons streaming works wonderfully and has great prices
B000FC1GJW|5.0|This book was emotionally charged and simply riveting to read. Although I have to say to the author, why the heel did you split them up in the end. But it's a great book.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|They were excited to see they could watch episodes again!  Great purchase, will look for season three to come out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book because I was intensified to finish it. The war between the rebels and the Capitol was keeping me turning the pages. WARNING: MUST READ HUNGER GAMES AND CATCHING FIRE BEFORE MOCKINGJAY. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!!!! Hope you love this book as much as I did!!!!
B005KELW26|5.0|Just what I needed to keep my Kindle Fire clean and protected. Love the color -- makes it very noticeable also.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I bought the book Safe Haven based on the reputation of the author. I found this book amazing n wonderfully written.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Great software.  Easy to access your computer with your Kindle. You won't be disappointed and you'll be able to see who is doing what on your pc.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. I am glad I ordered this gift for him.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just want to start out by saying thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to Colleen Hoover for writing such compelling stories.  I fell in love with her writing way back in May when I read Slammed and Point of Retreat.  I felt like her story line was very uinque and I was excited to see she had a new book coming out, so I gave it a whirl.  I'm so glad I did because before even finished it, Hopeless became one of my favorite books ever.<br />I just loved how the entire thing unfolded with Sky and Holder, and I have to say I was not expecting what was revealed about their past, it was quite a twist. This story did bring up some dark subject matter including sexual abuse and suicide, but what made it so good was that in spite of their rough pasts they managed  surive and find eachother and cling to the hope that they could endure anything in their future as long they had eachother. And ofcourse Holder was just amazing through it all...swoon ; )<br />Again, it was a very compelling story. Read it, tell people about it, and then read it again because you won't be able to help yourself.<br />Thanks Colleen! Can't wait for your next work of art.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Turn off the volume between the singing, dancing numbers and read a good book. The actors and the directing are wonderful but the script makes little sense.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Just simply works. No configuration required. Very good.<br />Haven't seen any ads yet on this free version/<br />Highly recommended. .
B00AH8U4OW|5.0|Off the hook, out of control; very funny and entertaining.  Looking forward to the excesses that Season 6 will bring.
B009M1QRM8|2.0|This is another series I used to love, but am so over now. I felt obliged to get this because it was the last of a trilogy, but I read it as quickly as I could just to get it over. I no longer believe in the characters. And yet it is obvious at the end that the authors are setting up further probable trilogies with two new characters (Pendergast's sons!). Well, they can go on without me.
B008CX2A2I|1.0|I ordered the Onkyo thx surround system, then I order this item to go with it. After getting the item I learned that it doesn't work with onkyo model receivers made before 2012. thanks for the update!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A lot more fun and challenging than you think it would be! Starts off easy and progressively gets harder and addicting!
1400067820|5.0|Antifragile<br /><br />Nassim Taleb is a man with strong views on just about everything. He writes a good book. Antifragile is a more personal narrative than his earlier \\"Black Swan\\". It is filled with personal examples of what he considers is the proper way to live a life that is in harmony with a volatile and unpredictable world.<br /><br /> In \\"Antifragile\\" he presents a consistent contrary or at least an anti-mainstream view of what most would accept as reality. He views the world as a complex adaptive system in which \\"Black Swans\\" or unanticipated and unanticipatable events have disruptive effects quantitatively inversely proportionate to their frequency.  His views are in tune with Kahneman's in that he sees unpredictability as normal and positive for any system worth having. These `antifragile' systems are not simply robust and able to withstand adversity, they are those that improve by adapting to shocks.<br /><br />He values `the man in the arena', he who seeks reward with exposure to risk and scorns those who risk others but not themselves. He favors the cab driver over the bank clerk as the latter has sacrificed flexibility and the ability to adapt to change in exchange for a theoretically stable but actually more fragile position.<br />He dislikes what he considers senseless intervention-what Kahneman sees as the ingrained need to do something-especially in medicine where the legal system favors potentially harmful but defensible action over inaction.<br /><br />Overall this book is more about life than volatility, but with his other books , especially \\"Fooled By Randomness\\" and \\"The Black Swan\\" presents a complete view of the importance of viewing existence as a complex adaptive system.<br /><br />The books bibliography is extensive and useful. Taleb quotes Machiavelli by way of Rousseau in saying `what makes the species prosper isn't peace, but freedom', which also sounds a lot like the message of Acemoglu and Robinson in \\"Why Nations Fail\\" and what doyou know, there it is in the bibliography.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a simple way to organize all those websites I once made tables in word documents in order to save, but it is SO much more fun to go back and search.  I LOVE the photo snapshot reminders.  I love looking at trends people pin.  I have a better relationship with the friends I follow because we 1)have a little window into each other's &#34;hidden&#34; sides, 2) have something to discuss in person, 3) are able to easily share great ideas, and it's FREE!<br /><br />How often do you go to your &#34;Favorites&#34; folders on the internet, see just an icon or a URL and wonder: Why in tarnation did I save that site?  A picture is worth a thousand words!  I LOVE Pinterest!  I wish EVERY website were kind enough to place a pinnable picture or logo on the site/document so that everything was pinnable (:
030758836X|5.0|Let's ignore the plot for a minute and just look at how the story is told - Gillian Flynn has a real facility with language and she just makes the sentences sing.  This is a finely, beautifully written tale.  Now to the plot - I love an unreliable narrator and both Nick and Amy are pretty unreliable,  everything they say and do has to be reexamined once we come to the end of the book,  and I like a book that makes you need to read it twice, not because it's confusing,  but because new information keeps shedding different light...  I thought Amy was a great character and while I never rooted for her,  I definitely wanted to know what she was going to do next.  It's easier to like Nick,  even though he does some pretty unlikable things,  but he too needs reevaluating as new stuff comes to light.  I liked everything here,  there were no false notes.  I'd like to see more of them - not necessarily a direct sequel,  but can we bump into them again in the next book?<br />Well worth reading and discussing,  go ahead,  buy!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Liked this movie, even though am not a big baseball fan. Good story, very well done...acting very good..interesting story line..
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I enjoyed it, but it was quite long as is most of his works.  I have enjoyed her shorter works better.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like this app very much for I get to very quickly.<br />I do have the but it doesn't seen to be able to customize links I wouldn't use
B0079XNWQA|4.0|read up about Jason in a california magazine. decided to buy his cd and found very good tunes here. eclectic bunch of songs and sounds are different but very listenable if that makes sense. i would buy more of his stuff.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|The soundtrack is as represented in description and there were no exceptions.  Very peaceful and calming music.  Would recommend to those expanding Hawaiian music collection.
B008G59IKO|4.0|i found i like uno better but this cd ain't shabby either. songs are vintage green day and fits with the band. i will buy tre next!
B0061S0A64|3.0|The concept on this was fun, and the sound is pretty, but the capabilities are very limited. So I was a bit disappointed.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I enjoyed this tremendous action flick in the theater, the Blu-Ray for which I purchased as a 2012 Yule gift for a friend who also appreciates martial-arts derived action films, knowing how awesome he would find it as well.
B007THA4FI|2.0|As a fan of JK Rowling, I naturally dove into this book with the highest expectations. I Know that many fans would find distaste with such a dark work, but that is not what disappointed me. I applaud an author for escaping from his or her element when writing. It is refreshing to find new ideas and works, instead of trying to recreate a previous work due only by its success. This book, although political and witty, proved to lack depth and character to me. The characters took a long time to develop, and once they did it took far too long to establish a connection and a point. Of course others would argue that that is the way of politics, which the book certainly seeped of, and was much too overbearing for my taste. I will continue to support JK Rowling, but cannot recommend this particular work.
1449417051|4.0|Pretty weird and funny calendar, it's great in the office when you're having a tough day at work or just bored!
B002RI9UBS|2.0|This book was so drawn out I lost interest quickly which was a shame as I was looking forward to reading it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I love this soundtrack and purchased this one as a gift for a friend.  He was thrilled.  Thank you, Amazon!
B004US4K2C|5.0|This app provides a lot of cutomizable settings to my S II and I have not experienced any crashes the phone functionality is definitely improved
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|ive tried purchasing this app a few times but all it tells me is download failed. and then it gives me the &quot;install&quot; option but when I try to install it it says &quot;app cannot be found&quot; so I'm not real sure what I'm doing wrong. btw I'm on a kindle fire.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I've received this before my holiday break and watching this movie was worth on bluray. I've got an additional DVD and bonus features CD.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a great thriller, getting the reader hooked very quickly.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but would still recommend it as a good, light read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is fun, funny, brutal, and frightening all in one! I was just disappointed there was only one season. There will be a new Serenity movie though. Yay!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Too much trouble with the movement between the present and the future. Hard to follow. Looper did have a good ending.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Loved it can't believe Teresa died almost cried but I knew Thomas and Brenda are gonna get together loved it
1594744769|3.0|This is an interesting book but I am glad that I got it from the library rather than buying it. The first part, the \\"before,\\" was really good. The middle, was intriguing and mysterious. The end, though, definitely left something to be desired - and that's not the 2nd book. The end was lacking. Not that it seemed rushed; it just wasn't as interesting as the first half. I do not intend to read the next book (the ending is an obvious lead to a series of books) because I was not invested in the characters. I guess that's the difference between the beginning, middle, and end: I grew more unattached and unsympathetic to the plight of the characters the farther along I got in the book. It's a shame because it's a decent story. I wouldn't read it again but I would recommend it to a friend looking for something interesting and different to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved it!! I am so in love with Mr. Grey, he is so sexy. I am looking forward to the 2nd book! :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book I am so sad because I can't get the next book of the series because I can't get it right now. I love that it leaves you hanging on a cliff which makes it so much worse because I really want to know what happened to Petta and to Katniss but mostly Petta.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love all the diary of a wimpy kid books. I recommend this book although the only thing I have to complain about is that they need to be longer. But otherwise great
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I got this book expecting a good romance novel. Nothing amazing, but just good enough to keep me entertained. Wow was I wrong...without giving this book away It was WAY more than just some romance novel. I read this book in less than a day and literally laughed and cried. I love it and might just read it again.
1451613512|5.0|This is required reading for anyone interested in the subject. The authors may not please the way you think about it and the facts you think you knew about it, but you will sure revisit your own ideas about what the US history is all about and how it has worked...
B004LWZWGA|5.0|pretty good movie.just as good as the other 2.only we did not like the end because we think they killed the batman.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|This is a good read, with the exception of an extremely heavy use of parentheses in every page, and sometimes multiple times in a paragraph. I found it difficult to focus on the content due to her writing style, but otherwise a good read. Not everyone can up-and-leave their life for a year so it allowed me to live vicariously through her adventure. The movie was more enjoyable overall. :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was better than the Harry Potter books& certainly going to be better than the movie.<br />Amazing Awesome better than great
B009E3EY38|5.0|Everything already written in these many 5-star reviews about the DVD is true!!  It was mesmerizing from the beginning of the first song!  If this is indeed the last thing they ever do together they went out on top!<br /><br />Also, as previously stated, the camera work/editing is very distracting to say the least!<br /><br />The CDs/music -- excellent as always.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great app. It is good for people and kids of all ages. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As the mother of a criminal defense attorney and after suffering through all the media coverage of the young man who went on a killing rampage at the elementary school in Connecticut, I thought this story would be most timely.  William Landay did an excellent job exploring what it must be like when defending your own children and their criminal behavior.  The anguish and helplessness the parents experience is so palpable in this novel.  A great piece of work by Landay!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I couldn't put this one down. The plot is good and has plenty of twists to make it interesting. This is the best book that Grisham has produced in a while.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Phillip K. Dick is a great Sci Fi writer and women will love this Dick sci fi/ romance. This one is more fantasy than science.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is epic and super addicting but the coins shouldn't be so expensive. They are pretty easy to get so there's really no point in buying them anyway.  Still a must buy, though
B009VB7P6G|5.0|IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO WATCH A DISNEY MOVIE. MY GRAND DAUGHTER WAS ENTERTAINED AND FASCINATED BY FANTASY AND MAGIC. THANK YOU
0547564651|5.0|Read this book over the last three nights, I think all parents, educators, and anyone interested in the future of the youth should read this. Even those who are well off and living in good school districts can find gleanings from this book. I wish we could somehow get all the educators in this book in a room, and rebuild the education system in the US.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|IT'S ALWASYS AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL USB CABLE.  I THOUGHT THAT I NEEDED IT TO FIX A PROBLEM WITH MY KINDLE-FIRE.....IT WASN'T IT FOR YOU (AMAZON) REPLACED THE UNIT, BUT ANYWAY, IT'S A GOOD BUY.
0671646788|5.0|It is the happiest and most forward-moving and positive &#34;action-oriented&#34; book you will ever read. Once you get it you won't let it out of your sight!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought this was well written and and followed it's story through to a thought provoking ending.  I strongly recommend this.
B005LAII8K|1.0|First of let me say that the movie itself is a lot of fun and I greatly enjoyed it.<br /><br />This review is not about the movie. It's about the &#34;product&#34; I was sold. After registering for my THIRD studio website account (in 3 movies), I was led to a page on Sony's site where I could, in theory, download the digital copy. Upon clicking, the download button, I got a pop up saying that I had to download the Download Manager (really?!) before I could download the movie. Just click the Install button...only there was no install button. I updated Silverlight as prompted, thinking that was the problem. Nope. Tried it on other browsers. Nope, still no Install button. Finally, I just download it from Flixster on my iPad, but apparently I won't ever be watching the movie on my PC.<br /><br />What was wrong with the iTunes/WMV digital copies that have been included with discs for the past several years (other than having to share revenue with Apple)? I would GLADLY pay a dollar or two more to not have to deal with this process, and have my digital movies appear in the same library as all the other videos on my devices. Or go back to offering a Blu-Ray/DVD combo and I'l rip my own.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I recommend this book to every American. REAL hero's.<br />Share it with everyone you know. These men are braver than any hero Hollywood could make up.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is amazing, as a film fan (and former film student) i am all over special features and making of commentaries. this has everything, i spent easily a hour running through special features on the dark knight rises.<br /><br />the sample book it comes with (the art work of the dark knight (or something like that) is also fantastic, is so simple yet so good and interesting i went out and bought the book.<br /><br />if you have a blu ray buy this today!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Confusing story line. Thought any movie with Willis would be good but I was wrong.<br />Wish I could get my money back.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Great game.  Tons of options and fun to play, but have had a few random game closes in the middle of game.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Although many things explode and get blown up, and although we have a lot of &#34;good woman&#34; vs. &#34;bad girl&#34; fighting to spice this remake up, the original film, starring Arnold Schwarzenneger, was better.  In the interests of a &#34;new and better&#34; movie, the director went overboard with stunts and explosions, and strayed too far from the story line.  The result is an adolescent film, lacking maturity.  It got a little boring, after awhile, for anyone who is not a fifteen year old boy.
B000YHG72E|5.0|TWO THUMBS UP!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND I LOVE XMAS MOVIES IN GENERAL!<br />GREAT MOVIE GREAT MOVIE THANKS ALL
B00684J49U|5.0|This was a specific gift request and I thought the price was very reasonable. My sister in law was thrilled. I let her know what great prices these were.
1401235417|5.0|Very enjoyable read, has a great crime noir feel to it. Synder clearly gets how a Batman story should be told.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After reading it I am not sure what all the hype was about. It is very repetitive in it's writing( I get it,he's hot and Ana blushes at everything). The sexual aspect of it...whatever ,it exists and it was relatively tame than what I thought from what everyone was saying about it. Will I read the next one..well yeh..I am only human and do want to find out what happens next.
B00942S4OY|5.0|It was a Christmas gift for my great granddaughter , I assume it works just fine since I was not informed of any problems.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I think that this game is very fun and intertwining. Kids in the ages 5 and up would absolutely adore this game. I really regimens it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is one of the best Ice Age Movies. My 6 & 8 year old love it and I enjoy watching it wtih them.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I adored her first album. My biggest complaint is that &#34;Lights&#34; is also on this album. And a different version. Not necessary. &#34;Anything Can Happen&#34; is good, but not the shining star of the album.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have been interested in military books for as long as I can remember. This is the best I have read yet.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Really cute movie. For people who love musicals (like myself) it's a fun chick flick with a soundtrack you'll eagerly look to download. It's not as funny as the trailers make it out to be and Becca, the main character, is a little whiny, but there's plenty of enjoyment tucked into an hour and forty five minutes. More Rebel Wilson and Adam Levine, please! Fun music selections and some good chuckles.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|Kind of a goofy game, but my 9 year old likes it.  He plays it on his nexus 7 all the time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't put it down!! Great storyline and simple but complete characterization. I love the suspense, intrigue and twists. I can't wait to start on the third book, but at the same time, want to drag it out so it's not over!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Thought it would be &#34;child's play&#34;, and it is, but much more.  Involves hand/eye coordination and cognitive skills - good for teaching children as well as keeping older minds sharp.
B0086700CM|5.0|We love this game.  It is a family favorite and we are always trying to get the highest score. A little different playing it on a kindle.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic writing!  Can't begin to describe how much I enjoy reading Colleen Hoover's books!  Hopeless is just another of her great works!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|My wife and I liked this movie.  The plot is not fantastic but the action is good and overall was pleasurable.
1451695187|5.0|Awesome book.  Well written.  Leaves you feeling wonderful...  Recommend this book to all non-believers!  The details are incredible and the book leaves you very uplifted and comfortable regarding the afterlife.  It makes you look forward to heaven one day!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This piano app not only allows you to learn songs, but it also has several different instruments (piano, drums, harmonica, violin, etc.)  to hear the song played. It also has a way to insert your own songs as well. The sound is a bit tinny, but all in all I think it's a better app than another piano app I've downloaded.
B008Y6S4XM|2.0|That was one of the worst sci-fi flicks I have seen in... forever.  And I am including things like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good story<br />I enjoyed it and it was very touching. One of the best sparks books I have read. Loved iy
B00APUQRPC|2.0|most predictable movie-\\"they lived happily everafter\\" Hollywood ending - Clint combines all his previous characters of old crotchety  men and think you can come up with a newer fresher role or stay behind the camera with you superb directional skills.
1451683405|2.0|I am a big admirer of the works of Sam Harris.  I loved \\"The End of Faith\\" and thought that \\"The Moral Landscape\\" was very quite thought provoking.  They both were in my opinion impactful on my views on the subjects they cover.  This book however was essentially useless.  It is just a rehash of some of the arguments that he makes in previous books and in some cases seems to be verbatim copy and pasted.  I gained no insights from reading this book, which is a tragedy as I agree with Harris that free will is an illusion and was hopeful about reading \\"Free Will.\\"  The only reason I give this book two stars instead of one is that the ideas that are recycled in it are somewhat convincing, just not new.<br /><br />I hope Harris's next offering is better.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading this Trilogy, my humble opinion would be that all three books are poorly written and far overrated.  As I was reading, my hope was that somewhere along the line the author would redeem himself, to no avail.  A frivolous waste of time and money.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|Cooler seems to work pretty nicely but it is just way too tall.  It hits the side of my case which is just a standard mid atx, thing could have easily been designed to be even 1/4&#34; shorter with no performance drop.  If your case isn't extra wide don't get this cooler.

1594202842|4.0|This book was launched with a fair share of media attention, most of which stemmed from a few key passages being taken out of context. This is one of the best pieces I've read about it which explains it all. As an ABC (American Born Chinese) myself, I'm no stranger to the strict parenting that many children who are born to immigrant families can feel.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's a story about parenting and clashes in culture. Sure, she highlights some things that are common to Chinese family structures (such as filial piety), but as she shares her delightful narrative, it is clear that the experiences are her own and many are things that all families can relate to in some way.<br /><br />There were many laugh out loud moments and it reminded of two important lessons:<br /><br />1) Show more appreciation towards my parents<br />2) Never have children

0767827716|5.0|I watched this movie twice the day I got the DVD. I have always loved cars for some reason, and this classic Plymouth Fury is a neat one to portray \\"Christine\\". Yes she gets \\"furious\\" and does some damage! What I like about this film too, it is another one from the 80's in which we know what we are watching is fake. Some parts are even funny like \\"Buddy Repperton\\". He has the John Travolta sweat-hog look, and no way is he high school age unless they allow 35 year old men to stay. The bad guys seem to feel running down the road is a good way to get away, but hey, a car is after them!<br />Then you have \\"Christine\\" driving into Darnell's junk yard burned, while being watched by the owner who had a shotgun. He walks over and touches the door handle and gets burned. I guess he didn't think it needed to cool. Then opens the door to find no driver. In my experience, this is a clear cue to run, but he decides sitting in the driver's seat was the thing to do. Oops!<br />She has a blacked out windshield and windows when she is \\"driving\\", and the usual bloopers when you have a car trashed/fixed repeatedly. Arnie needed to look mean toward the end, but his gray makeup is obvious, and a bit smeared. My very favorite part is watching the car \\"fix\\" itself. I become a child glued to the set watching these scenes over and over as if I have never seen them before. I love that! Classic old horror movie that is clearly fake! I keep coming back decade after decade to see it again.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read. Very well written. I am a retired 24 year vet and this book is so on target. It is the best.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Lucky me, my husband loves chick flicks too. We watched this on a projector in our room and popped some popcorn. We had our own theater night. This movie is great. The Notebook is still better but this one comes in 2nd. I highly recommend this movie.
0767802659|3.0|You don't eat pizza for the nutrition, you eat it because you like the taste.  While this film is equally cheesey, and miles from the book, it's what you watch when you want a sci-fi shoot-em-up.
B003TH14H4|5.0|I love this show  I think it keeps you guessing whats gonna happen everytime. I think Stana Katic  is amazing
B001F12J0C|4.0|Not for me, but it came as promised and she was very happy!  (And at a good price for the holidays.)
1451629192|5.0|This is such an amazing and touching story. This is def. a must read! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|Just when you think you know what is going to happen, Suzanne surprises  you with a twist!  Like it or love it, it is a must read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was amazing. Now book three.<br />Can't wait to see the movies they are going to be great if they follow the books
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I'm sure this would work fine if there were enough instructions.<br /><br />Telling me to click here to do something and then nothing happens when I do is not enough instructions.
B007VDPMYI|5.0|I love George's work and some of these songs are even better than the versions we are accustomed to hearing.  Listen to the samples on the mp3 page and you'll know exactly what you're gettiing.  I got this for someone else too and we're both listening to this non-stop!<br /><br />I hope there's a volume 2!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Good graphics.  Neat puzzles.  Like the way you earn energy &amp; stuff versus most hidden object games.  One of the better apps or games I have found lately.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best alarm out.  I have it on any app device I have.  I love all the ring tones and it's very reliable. I just  hate to forget to turn it off  when I do not need to get up. I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard  time waking  up.
030746363X|5.0|Great info that exposes mainstream information for the Bull S*** that it is.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about improving their health and getting results.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|This is a great family movie with small children. Teaches many (at least 5) lessons. Wish I had the stick Nanny has, I could use it at work.
1452105111|5.0|I used these letters + ribbon to make a Happy Birthday banner for my son.  It worked well, the cards are on a medium thickness card stock, a bit thicker than index card thick, but not nearly so thick, say as the Eric Carle Letter Cards.<br /><br />Each Letter is a circle that is 5 1/4\\" in diameter and brightly colored in the Eric Carle style of collage-y animal backgrounds, so not a solid background.  They are very pretty.  There are 72 alphabet tiles, and 8 animal tiles.  There are 5 yards of ribbon that is in a light lilac/periwinkle blue, decent quality, some cotton-synthetic blend.  Each letter circle has two little rectangular slats so that you can thread the ribbon through, that works very easily, there was no issue there.  Because the letters are strung through two slats, they stay in position on the ribbon, but can easily be slid along to where you want them to go, they still in spot even if hung at an angle.<br /><br />Here are the letter counts, there are:<br />5 - A, E<br />4 - H, O<br />3 - B, C, D, G, I, L, M, N, P*, R, S, T, Y*<br />2 - F, J, K, U, V, W<br />1 - Q, X, Z<br />* = After spelling 'Happy Birthday' you'll have only one 'P' and one 'Y' left, in case that's important to your child's name.<br /><br />The animals are on a white background, and, as expected, are the Eric Carle animals: Caterpillar, Butterfly, Frog, Elephant, Bear, Hippo, Peacock, and Giraffe<br /><br />The package itself is a small format, at 7\\"x5.5\\", nice presentation.  Made in China for those who are interested.<br /><br />It worked really well for us, I was surprised actually, I wasn't expecting a lot, but really liked the results, and received compliments.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I love this thing! I had been wanting it for a while. I have tried several methods for cutting wine bottles, and this is definitely the fastest, safest, and easiest. Great price too. I've been using it a lot since I got it. Eager to try lots of fun projects for turning wine bottles into glasses, planters, candles, and more!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|As always, Reacher is an interesting man.  At first glance, the plot/setting seems a bit thin.  As usual, however, the complications mount up and make for a page turner.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Got this for my fiance for Christmas. It was a good, funny movie. Great blu ray quality. Jennifer Aniston was pretty hilarious in this role.
B000FC10WU|5.0|My first time to read her and will definitely do so again. I'm a Murder he Wrote fan and I see where they got their inspiration
B009NPKTN6|4.0|This movie was funny, cheezy, and had a great soundtrack. I loved Tom Cruise in it and I haven't been on his bandwagon for quite some time. It was good to see him play this cheezy weirdo/diva.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series and would recommend it to others to read. The price was good also. Thanks
B0096BIENY|5.0|It is wonderful and so full of many nice songs.  I hope they continue to record for a long time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this series was so popular because of the uniqueness of the subject matter.  I really enjoyed this even though I have grown kids of my own.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought for my son who siad he has used this on different edges and is more than pleased with it and recommends it to anyone
B004SIIBGU|5.0|THIS app is a fast and easy way to view eBay and all of its content. Bidding and and all of the other tools on this app make using eBay easy as ever.
B00151W394|5.0|This version of Madonna's 2008 release of Hard Candy is an absolute must have cd, it's 2 discs of non-stop remix fun with some remixes never heard before that will make you wanna dance and sing and get up and do your thing, so if you wanna get into the groove with Madonna or just wanna hear a great cd that will keep your dancing shoes burning up, then this is the one for you.
B000002GHH|3.0|The disc seems original but the CD artwork seems like it was printed on so-so paper by a so-so printer.  I don't think it's original.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Top notch chanteuse, in the spirit of Cleo Laine! Great song selection and technical execution. Our favorite new CD for sure.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|If you like action movies with at lot of stuff blowing up you will enjoy this one.  Everyone who was ever an action hero is in this movie.  Fun interaction between the characters.
0307454541|5.0|A great suspenseful read - way better than even the good movies. Definitely made me stay up late to finish.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Sent as a gift and the person liked it for christmas this year.  That is all that I know, it arrived on time.  It is a family favorite movie for 15 years.  It is a must for those who enjoy great stories and anime.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Love the voice, but the ragtime instrumentalism was a bit &#34;thin&#34; for my tastes. Preferred the &#34;best of&#34; CD collection.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Sent as a gift and the person liked it for christmas this year.  That is all that I know, it arrived on time.<br />WE LOVE this movie!  a must for households who love anime for children.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. lots of options for a free game. plays great on my kindle and my android phone.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Sent as a gift and the person liked it for christmas this year.  That is all that I know, it arrived on time.
1594745692|5.0|I really like this tarot deck because it is truly original. It is both campy and creepy, with images from classic old horror films of the genre. It is 100% genuine tarot deck with image associations and correspondences as per the Waite/Rider deck, etc., yet with dark but tongue-in-cheek energies. Very entertaining deck!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This one was nothing like the other Bourne movies, and was less than satisfying. I suppose that they did it this way to set up another sequel, and I will go see that one, especially if Jason Bourne is the main character. Overall, not a great movie.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie was hilarious and the playback and audio quality was great! Really clear picture and sound through the entire film.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Very different, very original I feel it’s another classic by Brandon Sanderson. My only complaint is that this wasn’t a longer book. I hope he revisits this story in the future.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great show, and this Blu Ray version was perfect for me. I like the Play All option on the disc main menus.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What an excellent book.  I was spell bound from the first page until the last.  I now need to see the movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is a great show to watch with your friends, not so much as your family as some scenes can get uncomfortable but a great show never the less.
B004BLXHT0|1.0|You know I quite enjoyed the Forgotten Garden as a vacation read, but this was just bad writing.  It dragged and it was lifeless. Don't bother.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Buyer beware! As soon as the download finished my security software detected malware in the program. Immediately uninstalled from my kindle.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|A modern story set to Beatles music (not the actual Beatles recordings) The story is great, the use of the music to tell the story is great, the singing is fabulous. Just an awesome movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book not only tells the riveting story of a girl trying to stay alive but, is a great romance novel for young readers.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Just a great,fun,upbeat movie. Still great, still funny, still worth watching again and again. If you haven't seen it, you should.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Of course the ending made me cry and I wanted  to know more, but it was well worth the read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely riveting!<br />Total page turner!<br />I can't wait to start the next book! One of the most unique books I've ever read
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. It takes you and wraps you up in this world of flowing ribbons, intricate paper animals, illusions and love. Fantastic!
0066620996|5.0|I started reading this book and have not put it down since!  I have not finished it yet, but from reading what I have, I am convinced.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well, I'm absolutely positively in love with this book & cannot begin to express how much!!! Obviously. I will refrain from going into specifics for not wanting to release any spoilers. It has been a very long time before I have  read such a well written story. Powerful. Emotional. Breathtakingly beautiful. There are unexpected twists and turns and so many warm fuzziness in this story that your heart continually smiles & releases just the right SQUEE!!!! You will not be disappointed. Not. At. All.<br />Very  Well done Colleen Hoover, well done!!!! :)
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|My grandson is 3 1/2 and we watch this together and totally enjoy this movie.  Never a dull moment - keeps a child fully engaged and his Nana as well!  I think all of the Ice Age' are truly fun and entertaining.
B008X9Z37A|2.0|I have tried to return the item but another one comes in the mail in a couple of days . It is not that it is a bad item it is that I thought it was leather, it is not leather so I wanted to return it. Why they keep ending me one is crazy and irratating.
0399246665|5.0|Eric Carle knows how to teach young minds and definitely has a clue on the eye-hand coordination requirements of development! We are amazed at how my Grandson just takes to this set of wonderfully authored and illustrated books in a manner that captures even the youngest child! thanks for your prompt, expeditious service!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wonderful I love playing these games. they keep me busy when I have a little down time also when I don't.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm not going to bore anyone with a long review of the story, that if you didn't already know you probably wouldn't be buying the DVD.  Fast shipping,  good movie, decent price.  What more do you want ?
0525953728|5.0|I will state that I personally did not read this, but ordered it for my 17 year old son.  He loved it, and couldn't put it down.  He said it was fascinating.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|Couldn't get myself to read chapter two.  Who wants to read a whole book written by a 5 year old...it takes forever to figure out what the child is referring to.
1451695195|5.0|I ordered this book after I heard Madonna Badger say she found it very comforting (she tragically lost her 3 kids and parents in a house fire).  The author writes well, and I love how he goes into detail medically; ie: layperson can easily understand!  I am half way through and plan on finishing up tonight.  It's a fast read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is easy to learn and soothing when some stress is needed to be released. Fun game to use.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have always liked playing this game at the fair...now I can play it on my Kindle anytime I want!!!  I wish you could get more coins though without buying them :(
B00APUQJLO|3.0|The movie was very well made per the book.  I love Rob Pattinson.  However, as per the book all the dialog was done in a rythmic robotic stance and about essentially nothing.  Well the downfall of the monitary system.  The best scene in the whole movie was the last long scene with Paul Giamattis character.  Finally some useful meaningful dialog.  Some emotion getting through to Erik Packer.  Like I said, very well made but perhaps not my type of Indie movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This may be the best sci fi series ever. It is a crying shame that it was not picked up for a second season.
B00005AREQ|5.0|cd great shape. overly satifyed,this one is my favorite Jeff Beck albums. Thnaks for giving joy and a clean product.
B007T2U2WI|5.0|I purchased this for my 18 month old nephew.  He absolutely adores it.  The pictures are delightful, the message is simple and positive, but the music on the CD is his favorite part.  Warning to parents:  he wants to play the CD and dance with it a minimum of 10 times a day.  A delightful book ceries.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn has put together an amazing book of hope, fear, weird twists and the psyche. Most of us will recognize some of our dark selves in Gone Girl. Now, it is time for the sequel.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Could not put ths one down till I finished it.  Typical of Michael Connelly and his books.  Harry Bosch is the<br />best!  Love this character with his methodical thinking and patience.<br /><br />If you liked this book also try Joel Goldman(Jack Davis series) or David Baldacci &#34;The Forgotten&#34;.
0060763280|5.0|I loved this book!  I couldn't put it down and my fiance read it too.  Great advice and an easy read.
B007SGM084|5.0|A true love story. Very good if you can look past all the sex scenes. I would recommend to anyone that likes a romantic novel. Especially if you liked the twilight saga!
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|This is a very cool app. It works really well. My daughter really enjoys playing with it. She is getting quite good!
B005MJ883K|5.0|My nephew is 10yrs old and very smart and likes challenges and was so happy we got this for him at Christmas. It will keep him occupied for awhile at a time.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|what can you say about a classic. was time to show the kids the type of movie I grew up with
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Clear quality. Quick and easy purchase. Unfortunately the buffering happened more often than liked and when watched on the iPad the app crashed a few times.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Here's a cast of guys that are getting long in the tooth that manage to kill hundreds while only getting a few wounds themselves.  It's amazing that the bad guys are standing 30 feet from our heroes, pumping out thousands of rounds and the good guys are doing the same and the bad guys are the ones getting blown away.  While it's nice seeing all the old faces together, it's way to full of old movie cliches and references to their roles in other movies.  If you like machine gun fire and mayhem followed by lulls in the action and then back to the machine gun fire then it's for you.  It got a bit tiresome after awhile.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun to play.  Easy to use and navigate.  Great way to relieve tension after a rough day.  Great fun
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Wasn't sure if I wanted to buy the movie because I saw it in theaters so I decided to rent it. For the price to rent it and stream it on your smart tv it was well worth it. Though I might have seen it one too many times and didn't laugh as much as I did when I first saw it.<br />Streaming and renting experience 5/5<br />Movie 3 maybe 4/5
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I found this version very difficult to navigate.  It is not easy to use.  I would prefer a different version.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing work by Nicholas Sparks. Best surprise ending that I've read in a long time. Recommended read for anyone who wants a thrill.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy & fun to play  Great way to spend waiting time.  I play at the dr. office or anywhere I have to wait.
B005XTLAQQ|4.0|Its perfect for any Twilight Collector!!!! I love it! I'm so happy with my purchase. She looks good next to Edward.
B000HFERPW|5.0|The vendor had it to me before Christmas, my nephew loved it and it was better than pictured!  It was a perfect replica of a first edition.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|My little sister and I have had a lot of fun exploring this dark carnival. There is a lot of puzzles and the environments are really interesting, warning not free game costs 2.99 but worth it!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Start to finish this book kept my interest and held it. Definite page burner....Could not put it down. Absolutely loved the book...but then again its Baldacci
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I was looking for some &#34;easy watching&#34; a few laffs, nothing to strain the brain, and that's what I got. Can't lose altogether with Markie Mark...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really enjoyed the plot once it got going. Just need patience...Its well worth putting the time in to allow the plot to gel...It just takes a bit of time
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Wow. This is truly an amazing story. Very detailed. The book flows nicely and puts a picture in your head. It conveys pain, fear, and loneliness beautifully. Sure, some parts are a bit on the confusing side, but that's my opinion. All in all, if you want to read a truly unique story that will leave your mind whirling, give this book a try! :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Was so intrigued with the movie and had so many questions that I had to read the book. Once of my all time favorite books
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Awesome, funny, wow, great, cool, one of the best books ever invented. You should read this book sometime. 5 stars!!!!!!
B009RH973I|1.0|I had returned my Kindle Fire HD to Best Buy because I was not satisfied with the device.<br /><br />1) Only 1 Front facing camera makes taking pictures or video of family impossible.<br />2) No speech recognition on keyboard<br />3) Amazon / Android interface not what I was looking for in first Android device<br />4) Cannot get ABC App or the CW Network App which is 99% of the reason I bought it for my wife to watch her shows.<br />5) Not familiar with web browser<br />6) Volume and home button were difficult to find with fat fingers<br />7) Missed the physical buttons for paging through a book.  I was looking forward to this as an alternative to always having to touch the screen to &#34;swipe&#34; all the various places in most apps. This is the #1 thing I hate about iOS devices and smart phones in general.  More buttons intelligently placed to enhance gaming experience is what is missing.  I hate hate hate having my finger on the screen to control a game or skip a song, or turn a page.<br />8) Video quality of streamed Amazon Movie was just OK.  Even the 5 year old said &#34;It looks fuzzy&#34;
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I thought about the plot whenever I wasn't reading it. Simple and thrilling read. Thank goodness there are more books to read.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Header for Compose and Folders was hidden unless I went into an email.  Returned Kindle.  Didnt Like it. Still.  Really
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|If I didn't see the other Bourne movies I would probably rate it a little higher but the bar has been set. His acting is nowhere the level that he displayed in The Hurt Locker and The Town but we all need an easy payday I guess.
B004I744AS|1.0|I downloaded this app as it was the first one on the list for dictionary's (playing a game of Scrabble)<br />You enter a word and it gives you the word along with a choice of languages...that's OK. What's not OK is the fact that you have to look halfway down your device (Kindle Fire) for the word and its definition!  The upper half of the screen is advertising!!!<br />Just didn't suit my needs. Can you say, &#34;Hello, Miriam Webster Dictionary!!&#34;
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Great if you love baseball, it's full of baseball trivia. Also, a nice little romance. Not a great movie, but fine
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The creativity and imagination it took to make this book is exquisite. There were a few moments where I wish it would have been a little less predictable though. Looking forward  to book 2.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|You just can't beat Sherlock Holmes and this collection is no exception.  Well done and most enjoyable.  Read them - for the love of the classic Sherlock Holmes mystery!
B008NW67IQ|5.0|I love this cd. Mumfor & Sons have a very unique sound that is great to listen to. It has some mellower songs as well as some to rock out to.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fell in love with the books from the beginning of the book to the end of the book. Read it about 20 times.
B009KHCT94|4.0|okay this is NOT a great film but it is a lot of fun.  The special effects are actually quite good and the plot ludiricris but great fun.  Whoever plays Sarah Palin did a great job.  If you want a film that is entertaining then this is the film for you.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great! Easy read. Couldn't put it down. In the middle of reading the second book. Would love to see this put into a movie.
034580404X|5.0|I had to check out what the fuss was all about. At first it was hard to get into it, but quickly you get addicted and before you know it, you have read the third book! I loved it!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|The protagonist is a dear soul working her way through the pinball machine of life, bouncing from one event to another, but not in a maddening way. She stumbles across her soul mate and things become more complicated, and one wonders how this might all work out. I won't spoil the ending for you, and don't skip to it, because it is long and involved and make sweet sense.<br /><br />Not one of his best, but very good, plus there are good some good history lessons to be learned.
B006W0QR1S|1.0|I do not even know where to start. I just finishing watching it and felt compelled to come here and write.<br /><br />Let's see:<br /><br />Boring...depressing...boring...depressing...boring...depressing. Very little talking...a lot of deep stares...just basically really stupid.<br /><br />I'm thinking the actors needed money very badly which in this economy isn't anything new. And then, of course, a very sad ending to a very sad movie. I normally would not have watched it to it's miserable end, but I was kind of stuck with it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time unless you have time to waste!  And even then DON'T  ;-(
B009MO5960|5.0|i loved this resident evil movie it was  great very action packed and just kicks ass like all the other. very recommended to watch if ur a resident evil fan or zombie fan.
1439152802|5.0|I love all of Kate Morton's books and particularly enjoy them on CD as read by Caroline Lee.  I was so sad for this book to end - as is always the case with her books - so will just have to listen a second time and more!  She has a beautiful way with words and crafts her stories so well that you just can't break away.  Ms. Morton has a particular knack for switching the storylines back and forth between great distances in time and then tying up all the threads into a very satisfying end.  I hope another new book will be on the way very soon, I'll be eagerly (if impatiently) awaiting its publication!
B005LAII1C|5.0|had to buy this movie because of Seth MacFarlane creator of family guy and Mark wahlberg. i love family guy and its really funny. but this movie is very funny i loved it. the way i see this movie is its basically a  funny, love story, pothead partying type of movie.
1451695187|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the most amazing story Ihave ever read..  Everyone should read this.  Especially anyone who ever doubs that there is a God up in heaven waiting for us when we pass on from this earthly life.  June Dunaphant
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|In this game I had bought all of the gadgets and 4 jetpacks and the game is saying that I have not bought 6 gadgets &amp; 2expensive jetpacks. I really hats what it's doing fix it or I'll delete the game.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barba is one of my favorite singers.  As a professional pianist, I quite frequently play her song to accompany my singers.  Everything about the transation was very smooth.  June Dunaphant
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It kept making turns that I didn't expect. It was a Fun read!! I&#34;m glad I bought it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan is a person I admore very much.  She has a beautiful voice.  I have certainly enjoyed the CED I purchased from Amazon.  June Dunaphant
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was excellent and I would highly recommend it.<br />I am very happy with all my purchases from amazon and with<br />all the variety of items available
B00571F26Y|5.0|Plain and simple - cut out the wheat, reduce your carbs in general, stay active, and you'll be healthier in no time.  Easiest June resolution I ever did (and carried into New Year as well).  I'm down 35 lbs. and counting, and off my asthma inhaler to boot.
B001NESPHC|5.0|If you like Diana Kraal, Peggy Lee, or Katharine McPhee, you will also like this singer. Got my attention. Highly recomment.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like this game its almost like Mario and I love Mario! So keep up the good ideas!!'' :)
B000TZUSOY|5.0|Very smooth, breathy style. I liked it very much. Great for jazz fans who like the beat of Brazil with the smooth jazz style. No harsh repetitive runs that sometimes marred some of the older style jazz musicians.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|I already responded to this rating but it was on the wrong account it was on the account of the person they were mailed to. But I was very pleased and my grandson loved the truck.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Best Show! So funny! I don't normally like buying episodes but this show you can watch over and over again!
0316187216|5.0|Yet another great book by Joe Abercrombie. Reads very easily, and very much in the same vein as the others he has written.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Is watch this movie again. It was full of suspense, and a lot of action. It's a must see two, even three times.
B008MEM24S|5.0|lots of fun, and the cut scenes are right out of the show.  hours of entertainment but simple enough to not frustrate.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Interesting to see and understand the two levels of society living in one home. My hat is off to the writers and actors!
B000VT7AUS|5.0|This is a great album to listen to while traveling, at work, sitting around with friends or just working around my home.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! So many twists. You really feel the emotions of the characters! I always..root for the underdogs but in this book everyone is not what they seem.
B0020VKZ4I|5.0|This is a great album to listen to while traveling, at work, sitting around with friends or just working around my home.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is so much fun that I can't stop playing it. I would recommend this game to a friend.
0307200477|5.0|this is my son's favorite book! We love the two restored pages. This book helps develop fine and gross motor skills and will be a big hit in our house for years to come.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|The laugh-out-loud was so distracting.  It is like vulgar language in that it has no place in writing.  Silly at best.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I've already forgotten it. Would it be a great offence if I didn't review it? I would very much care your answer on this.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great for my son.  I am amazed at how he can zip through the levels.  It keeps the mind sharp.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. I heard it was going to be made into a movie.  I cannot wait to see it.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Typical Harry Bosch, with twist at end. Michael, how could you do this? I have read most of Connelly's work. I really enjoy Harry. I highly recommend everything written by Connelly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not wait to see what would happen when they had children.  It was a beautiful love story.
B0058BI896|5.0|extremely funny! Love sheldon, leonard, penny, howard, raj and all of the stories that you feature on each episode. Hurrah!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I like it but glitches often. There will Times when progress is lost which is frustrating. I have spent money on the extras so I do expect a little more.
B0080BFWE0|5.0|Bought this for my wife while in Afghanistan, got it fast, and it was everything she loved.  Even better on Blu-Ray.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's been awhile since I've read a book where I just don't want to put it down. I got totally involved in this story, to the point that time got away and it would be 4:00am when I.looked up at the end of a chapter. The first book finished, it was impossible not.to order the second and now, I am ordering.the third.for.sure.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was very interesting and not too long. The story was very well written. I liked it very much. Nice choice
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you are a fan of Seth McFarland you will thoroughly enjoy this raunchy but funny movie! We loved it!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I had never really listened to Kelly Clarkson and was pleasantly suprised by this CD.  i would recommend it to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun to play and keeps your attention.  I have only played the lowest levels, but I am enjoying the game,
B0000DJE9R|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the cd and I'm not sure why.  I thought I loved all the songs but maybe not
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like puzzles this is a good one.  The games really get you thinking.  i love the ease of erasing and starting over.  Someday i hope to get good enough at this to try the time trails.
B00914JWSW|3.0|I'm a big fan of Barbra Streisand and this was a typical album from her. nothing to write home about
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Amazing work - absolutely amazing. This is the type of series I'm gonna watch agin and again. Good actors, good story.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this converter to use with programming software for an MX-850 remote control.  I installed it on a desktop computer running Windows 8 Pro.  There were no snags during installation, and the MX-850 programming software immediately recognized the \\"serial port\\".  The programming software had no problems communicating with the MX-850 remote.<br /><br />I highly recommend this converter.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is easy to begin and picks up steam as you play. If you read the signs there is a sense of humor to it. (Those signs also give hints.) With all those level games out there, this one stands out and is great for, at least, the Kindle Fire.
B009738XXM|5.0|This album is just a whole bucket of fun dance music.  No, the music doesn't make any great statements about life or philosophy, but it's a lot of fun to dance to.  It's impossible not to smile and bob your head with Carly Rae on your iPod :)
B00913DPW2|3.0|There are so many better search and find games out there. There are secondary games within this game but they can be skipped. Really, I give this game a 'eh.'
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old love this! He will play until it he times out of it. I almost feel guilt putting a time limit on it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was exciting with some suspense. It was a really good book. It never got boring. It was romantic and heartfelt.
B0011Z33ES|5.0|I used to have this album but lost it in our move. Every song on it is great and it offers a wide variety of music within the genre.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it really had a different approach to robbing a bank Hollywood style. The acting was really good by the whole cast. Go watch it for yourself.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|My 13 year old daughter really enjoys this soundtrack. Easy listening, all very good enjoyable songs. The movie is 5 stars also.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Good one! My friend loves Christmas movies, and this new one is fun and unique. I would recommend it highly
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I think I was a very good book and has a very interesting story and presentation of the story of the zombie outbreak
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book! I haven't read a book since high school and that was 10 years ago! It had me on the edge of my seat and I just couldn't stop reading it to find out what was happening or what was going on! Anyone who likes suspense, I would definitely recommend this book to them to read!
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a good movie and is consistently well done as is the whole series.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Fat Amy is the highlight of the movie providing laughs throughout.  A mixture of slapstick and puns keeps the movie going with some top notch singing.  The movie is quite corny but not overly so and has a very underdeveloped romance.  However, if you're looking for anything but fun, cheap entertainment, you should be looking elsewhere.
0810994739|5.0|My grand son really loves this series of books. He reads them every day. It is helping him with his reading skills and the book is well written.
B001NLKT60|5.0|What a story...such detail and expert writing.  I loved the twisted plot and the many turns this book took.  Excellent!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very good story and well written. Good historical background. Kept my interest throughout. Some characters were a little trite and cliche.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I love this case.  It's been a great way to protect my kindle and I use the stand alone feature all the time.  It's a great way to set up the kindle to watch something without having to hold it.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This was a good story but a little predictable. Interesting main character even if somewhat unbelievable.  I liked the part that explained what each flower represented.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I try to avoid watching 'chick' flicks whenever i can, but ended up watching this with my wife the other day.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  That being said, i genuinely enjoyed watching it.  Anna Kendrick was awesome and Brittany Snow was hilarious.<br /><br />It had a 'glee' feel with more obnoxious humor (and better looking actresses). heh,...
0525953728|5.0|I bought this book for my husband.  He read it in just a couple of days.  He said he wished there were more books similiar to this one.  The only negative thing he had to say about it is that it was a little anti-climatic, but he still loved it.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Really cute.  I'm looking forward to showing it to the kids.  Ad format is especially annoying but hey, it's free! Enjoy!
6305291489|5.0|I bought this movie for my 6 year old daughter.  I was sick of cartoon movies and so many movies today are too sassy.  My daughter loves this movie and has watched it many times and it is one of the few movies I don't mind watching with her!
B004SIP8W0|5.0|This movie won 7 academy award nomination, including best foreign language film on 1998...is there someone who has given to this film less than 5 stars, indeed?? I can't believe it. It is not Batman, it is true, you won't find here those kind of special effects. Also, it isn't &#34;Friends&#34;, it is another kind of irony you will find in Benigni, and above all, reality. This is a true story, told you without showing bomb attacks, bloody people everywhere (as often happens), but anyhow you will feel the cruelty, emotion of that time. You will get the point, finding out how far the craziness of human beings arrived and how the people faced it. How this family did too. It is amazing seeing again the genuineness of those years...you can really touch it watching this film.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Evangelion was and still is a great anime. The Rebuild movies allowed director Hideaki Anno to recreate the series in the way he had originally wanted to but was never able to due to budget and technology restrictions. Although there aren't too many variations between this particular movie and the original anime, the story is as great as it ever was, and is incredibly impressive visually.<br />To the reviewers that gave this a poor score while comparing it to some other animes, I would recommend watching the original series and this movie with an open mind. Comparisons with &#34;your favorite anime&#34; are bound to lead to disappointments.
1449410243|4.0|Cat lovers also have a great sense of humor. This is a ridiculous request to make me add more words. I will not rate any more of your products.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This movie is amazing, and is where things begin to change from the original anime. The introduction of Mari's character and the interactions between known characters begins to build the story in a new and interesting direction.<br />The visuals are even better than the first movie, and the ending leaves you waiting with bated breath for the third movie.<br />100% worth the purchase!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good family movie. Clint Eastwood is the aging sports agent and Amy Adams (whom I love) is the daughter constantly trying to gain his approval. Plus a little romance side story. Really enjoyed it.
0439023513|5.0|I loved this series.  I was waiting for my family to get done reading it, but got impatient.  Good read
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best thing I've read in months. Great book, better than Hunger Games.<br /> Two thumbs up, read it if you haven't .
B008S4YZCO|5.0|It is the Best game I have ever played and it is very addictive I cant put It down AHHHH
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|This is a weak story designed as a star vehicle for Seth McFarland.  The novelty of a talking teddy bear with a dirty mind wears off after the first 15 minutes or so though, and then you're left with a bunch of weak jokes, Family Guy-style references that seem out of place without their usual accompanied jump cuts, and boring plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put my kindle down while reading hopeless. I absolutely loved it!!! Highly recommended!!! I fell in love with the characters.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag after using a Canon Starter Kit bag for several years. So far I have been extremely pleased with it. I have a modest amount of amateur gear, and this bag holds it perfectly. Currently I have in it a Canon T3i w/ battery grip, Tamron 17-55mm, Canon 28-135mm, Canon 430EX II flash, Gary Fong Light Sphere, Rode Stereo Camera Mic, two AA battery chargers, T3i battery charger, three small plastic containers (3\\"x3\\"x3\\") containing spare AAs and SD cards...and that's just in the main compartment! The numerous zipper pouches hold wired and wireless remote triggers, flash brackets, small tripods, manuals, and two Canon PaS cameras. My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't offer a bigger version so I can acquire more stuff! The shoulder straps have more than enough padding to make it comfortable to carry, and the build quality is very good. Everything is very easy to get to in the bag, even in tight spaces. Recently I took it to my daughter's Christmas Pageant, which was shoulder-to-shoulder crowded. I was still able to get my camera out, lens and mic configured and shoot her performance without dumping the entire bag all over the auditorium!<br /><br />If you're looking for an inexpensive bag to store your DSLR rig that is light, comfortable, and secure to take on short or medium excursions. this bag is for you. I don't know how it would stand up to heavy or extreme outdoor use (e.g. backpacking in cold or wet conditions), but if you're an everyday amateur or semi-pro photog, you can't go wrong with it.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|I have always been an appreciative fan of Michael Connelly's writing - I have read all his books.<br /><br />The Black Box is his best book in a long while.  The fact that Harry Bosch must solve a cold case he was personally involved in 20 years ago, gives the story an edge.  The case of the murdered Anneke Jespersen is believable and unfolds seamlessly.  I also liked the growth in the character Maddie, Bosch's daughter.  I look forward to reading about her life's choices in future books.<br /><br />One point of criticism (if one can call it that!), is that I read the book far too quickly.  His ease of writing is something I have always liked about Connelly's work, but I would have liked a little more meat on the bone in this book!<br /><br />However, all in all, The Black Box is a very good book, which I strongly recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Because I wish I hadn't !  I adore Holder, but I'm a Colleen Hoover fan!  I loved her 1st 2 books and quite frankly bought this as soon as it became available but only now read it.  Why? Because her other books I could not stop until I reached the end (just like this one).  Make the commitment for time and focus because this story requires both!
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I read the book and watched the movie at the same time.  Both were great.  Movie was chilling, disturbing and enthralling.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written fiction based around a difficult subject. Author does a good job describing the emotional rollercoaster victims encounter in becoming survivors.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was awesome and Josh Whedon is a genius. Everyone got their time to shine and the character development and interaction they needed which is hard to do in such a big budget film with big budget stars and even larger than life characters or should I say legends. The only thing I thought was missing in this movie was cap saying &#34;AVENGERS ASSEMBLE&#34;. Hope the sequel is just as good which is a no brainer and will be made. Josh better do it and not let someone else screw it up like Brett Ratner did Brian Singers's Xmen 3. Now that was a load of crap.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|You can stream all your videos over all your devices - works perfect. Seven more words required. Three more words required
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first downloaded the short story &#34;Wool&#34;  and I was immediately intrigued!  I ordered the omnibus edition after that. I can't wait for the prequel to come out in the spring.  Before I decided to read &#34;Wool&#34; I was noticing that this is one of the few books that almost has a perfect 5-star rating. I think if you liked &#34;The Dog Stars&#34; you will also like this book!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|We mailed Prometheus to my son at college and it provided a great study break for him and his friends. the video shipped as promised, and he has watched it at least 3 times (that we know of!).
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|In four hours I am past page 125.  True Clancy plus easy to read on my KIndle because I can enlarge the font.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this on my kindle fire. works very well. no complaints. never causes me any problems or crashes .
B007M45PMU|4.0|I really like this album. The soulfulness of the lyrics combined with authentic musicianship of Schultz, Fraites and Pekarek make each of the songs special. I thought that Schultz voice on some of the songs reminded me of another recent artist named David Gray. I'd pay to see them.
B008U74U56|5.0|This is the work of an incredible songwriter. The arrangements are great, not just a man and a guitar but an album full of sound. I had never heard of Bill Fay before but he blew me away. I don't want to give it away, but he does a cover of a popular song that will have you hearing it in an entirely different, and better, way.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie on New Year's Eve while waiting for the ball to drop in Times Square.  We were thoroughly entertained!  It's a story about a group of seven elderly British citizens who decided one way or another to spend their time in a rundown hotel in India for \\"the elderly and beautiful\\".  Of course, none of them knew before leaving England that this hotel was NOT as shown in the glossy brochure they saw, but a dilapidated place in India, managed by a young man whose dream was much bigger than his wallet.  At first, the group was horrified, but they soon adjust to their exotic environment.  Each had their reason for going to India.  Some in search of lost love, while others in search of independence and, in one case, a new hip.<br /><br />The screenplay was witty and the plot moved along.  My only complaint was that the introduction was rather rushed so was bit confusing.  But never mind.  The movie had a GREAT cast and the director did a fine job of weaving the scenes!  Some part of the movie was predictable, but most were poignant and entertaining.  This movie is not limited to the mature audience.  Young adults will get some insight into the human relationship.  This is a critically acclaimed movie and deservedly so.
B002SS8S7E|3.0|But the service from Amazon is terrible.  The movie starts and stops and there were long periods of &#34;loading&#34; or where it just shut down and pushed us back to the main menu.  I love Amazon -- but their streaming is terrible.  Stick with Netflix for this one.
B00ARAOBKS|2.0|This was one of those films that I consider a love it or hate it deal. For me, it was to QT like, and i don't care for any of his movies. Bottom line, some will love it, some will hate it. I am in the latter category.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Prompted to reread this by the recent television production Middle is a little confusing but all is clear at the end. Boyd is a fine writer and the book is entertaining
B009ZQI41C|5.0|This is NOT my genre. I resisted watching this series despite constant begging from multiple family members and friends.  Having the week off around Christmas, I thought... what the heck.  I have Amazon Prime, so watching the series was free!<br /><br />Let me tell you... I watched TWO SEASONS IN THREE DAYS and I am suffering from major withdrawl today!  This series sort of treads water for the first two episodes but by number 3 it dives deep and remains there.  I was a terrible parent for the last three days while I hid myself in my bedroom with my kindle fire HD and watched this compulsively.  WOW.  LOVE IT.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I was worried that they would bring some of the old style back, but it was rewritten very well. with a few things brought from the original.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Honestly, bought this book to see what all the fuss was about.was not disappointed.found my self intrigued and not wanting to put it down.would recommend it to my girlfriends. Can't wait to start the next in the series
1400052173|5.0|A heart wrenching story of incredible inequities waged on one woman and her family during a time when society wasn't held accountable for human experimentation.
B0093QDGEO|1.0|I wanted to rent this, but Amazon forced me to buy it since that was the only option available. 20 minutes in to the film I turned it off, with no desire ever to finish it. I am all for funny, but every other word was F and all the jokes were about male genetalia. Why did these producers ruin such a memorable show of my teen years? The original show dealt with real high school issues, they may have made it light-hearted occasionally, but this movie version was vile and a slap in the face to real teen issues. I know it was rated R but you only need 2 F words for that, this should have been NC-17 with how many there were.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Sinse I got in love w/ that banb I wanted as much of it,The voice of lead man,beyond your expectation:crazy tochying,sexy,cool.<br />Though my favorite The Bib Bad Wolf I do love that one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! I can't stop thinking about it. It will stick with you for days. I fell in love with all the characters. Please read it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing my mother and I loved all three books. My mom read this book in a matter of two days I had all three done is two.
B009MO57H6|2.0|I've seen all the Resident Evil movies prior to this one and liked them all very much. Unfortunately this was not the case with Retribution. While it shows a lot of potential, it also shows that someone who made it simply did not care and thought it could just ride along on the wings of the previous movies in the series. I kept hoping that it would get better, but it simply did not. What a major waste of money. Shame too as I loved that Milla Jovovich was in this one as well. Her role was well played as always, but whoever wrote the script didn't care about the story as a whole. Like other reviewers have mentioned, there are a TON of holes in the story and many things that did not make sense.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Ah, the life of a monkey is a fabulous one, isn't it? You get to chill all day, climbing trees, eating fruit, flinging...well, things that shouldn't be flung. Unfortunately there is a downside to all that leisure, and it involves the most chillingly lethal thing known to man, the deadly balloon, or bloon for short. The use of monkeys and bloons in the opening paragraph can only mean one thing, NinjaKiwi has finally hit with their latest tower defense gem, Bloons Tower Defense 5, in which nature's most mortal enemies (i.e. the monkeys and the bloons) are once again at war.<br /><br />Each type of monkey tower is unique and kills bloons in its own way, and each is upgradable in a pretty deadly way. NinjaKiwi has added two new tower types and one new bloon type since Bloons Tower Defense 4, but they have also tweaked the gameplay in some interesting ways that changes the old strategies. Each tower, for instance, can now be upgraded in 8 different ways and camouflage bloons have become more deadly. The new heart bloon has a bad habit of regenerating if not hit fast enough, and is much harder to kill. Other new things include \\"secret agents\\" which are one-shot items that can only be deployed once per round and which can be purchased with monkey money, itself earned by completing a path without getting killed. There are also the usual modes, new paths, and new experience levels which are earned by smiting a lot of killer bloons. And, if you get that far, there's a new ultimate type of bloon, the ZOMG. Be warned.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best stories I've read - believeable, realisitic, and you keep wondering how Mark can survive.  Never would have thought that a story based on a journal would be intense and gripping, but the author has worked wonders -- I had a hard time putting this book down!  The reader gets a very in depth look at the stranded astronaut, how he grappled with his many survival challenges and overcame each one in turn.<br /><br />At the end of the book the only disappointment I felt is that I realized that we hadn't learned anything about the other aspects of the astronaut's life -- family, love interests, etc.  And I also wonder how he readjusted to life on earth after a prolonged exposure to daily dances with death not to mention the isolation.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  The reader doesn't have to suspend disbelief or accept any premise that seems unbased on science -- just dive in and hang on tight.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing because of the violence and the love going on with the characters. I recommend this book to people who are ready for the violence and romance of this book. Before you read this book you should most likely read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire the two other books in this series.<br /><br />Reagan Austin
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The singing performances are amazing in this film and the soundtrack is a great way to re-live the story again and again. However, as a fan of film scores (and a completist of things I admire), I was a bit dismayed by the complete absence of the FULL FILM Soundtrack and Score! Getting double-dipped annoys the heck out of me, but for the sake of hearing these songs immediately after watching the film there is no better fix than this Highlights album. And hopefully there are enough folks that feel the same way so that we will eventually see the full soundtrack release???<br /><br />And just for the sake of argument, wouldn't it be nice to hear some of the alternate takes from Jackman and Hathaway? Might have to wait for the DVD on that one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is amazing!! its absolutely perfect!  nothing has ever been a problem. temple run shouldn't be changed at all.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I didn't feel this was up to Connelly's usual Harry Bosch style. It was OK but the ending was too contrived and not believable.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Is a great game, very detailed. Would like it more if u could earn more stars, instead of having to purchase them.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|There is a glitch where in multiplayer I can't  get so for kills and the games won't load even if I have full bar,overall the game is great -please FIX glitches in next update
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing improvement of the hunger games!!! I loved this book so much I would've shared this with all my hunger games fans
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Held my interest and had enough twists and turns to keep me guessing. A page turner and a quick read
0316172324|4.0|He appears to have become required reading.  Right, wrong, his books are always another way to challenge the way you look at the world and his writing is accessible and examples useful.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It's  always great to have a resource such as this handy. It makes for a great companion just at your fingertips.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I just finished the Ender Quintet. All five books are excellent, but I think this one is the best. Nonetheless, I would recommend reading them in order. If you only like fast action, skip the fifth book. If you like to think and be entertained by a powerful and original writer, then read them all.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|I think this show is awesome and the music that goes along with it is amazing too.  It is great how the actors also do their own singing.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|&#34;Wanted Man&#34; is just what I wanted and expected in the latest Jack Reacher fast action series by Lee child.
0321885112|3.0|First of all, this is a beautiful book, having a matte(?) finish, full of illustrations, using the very medium to 'deconstruct' itself. I even love the accent color (orange) used throughout the book. Loved the guest sketch noters. Don't get the Kindle edition. Appreciate the book in its native format as the author intended.<br /><br />The videos were okay. I felt they added little value, as the author merely clarified the concepts in his book. Given the passion the author has for sketch-noting, I kinda expected him to burst upon the screen like those guys from the infomercials. He had a business-like demeanor in front of the camera. If there was just one chapter worth watching, I would suggest watching the segment where Mike does a sketch note in real time, listening to Mr. Mueller. Oh- the online videos were not captioned. I would suggest that Peachpit require that future video submissions have subtitling and/or captioning.<br /><br />I primarily bought this book to give me ideas and techniques that i can share with my students. Then, they can make meaningful connections in studying their subject matter, i.e., Math, Reading, Science, in a visual way. It's also nice to undertake some sketch-noting during those professional development workshops. This book delivers for me, full of little tips I can immediately put to use.<br /><br />I feel that this book was somewhat superficial. It is indeed a quick read. I would have liked more coverage on Dual-Coding Theory, for instance. Little coverage was given to speaker patterns. What about having a 'listening triage', weeding out white noise and capturing relevant ideas? What if someone in the audience has an insightful idea? A heated debate? I'm not asking for a full blown treatise; just better coverage on listening and capturing ideas quickly and effectively.<br /><br />Another example; I rely on sign language for communications. In a meeting, I just can't look down and start doodling (or jotting) away. I have to watch, and retain as much as I can before there's a lull in the meeting, then I furiously scribble down my notes. At least, sketching images may be an acceptable substitute in writing notes during lulls as they're quicker to make and i can get back to the presentation at hand. In this book, Mike describes a 'brain cache' area, but doesn't really explore it. I would have liked to acquire better memorization techniques so I can hold ideas until I put them to paper.<br /><br />Mike Rohde is correct that sketch noting is an invaluable addition to a person's toolset in acquiring, retaining, and making meaningful connections between ideas. Not only Dual Coding Theory helps us understand why we retain and make meaningful connections between ideas in a visual manner, it is also kinesiology, the very act of sketching, that helps tie it all together. Thus, sketch notes have the most value to the person who did the notes; it truly helps him/her retain and understand what was presented at that workshop, meeting, etc. Even sketch noting while digesting a heavy treatise helps an individual better grasp and utilize the ideas being learned.<br /><br />However, I find an odd disconnect in treating sketch notes for wide distribution via social media. Sketch notes have little utility in communicating ideas to other people who were not present at the meeting, workshop, etc. I've looked at a couple of sketch notes in the wild and really couldn't understand them. I may grasp bits and pieces, but i get the feeling that I had to be there to understand these sketch notes fully. That said, sketch notes have some utility for communicating ideas with people who actually attended the meeting, workshop, etc., but didn't do any sketch-noting.<br /><br />I may be missing the point, but why would sketch noters share their sketch notes on social media, when they are ill-equipped vehicles in communicating ideas? Is it because they may have some intrinsic artistic merit? Just treat sketch notes as a tool thata person can utilize in capturing and synthesizing ideas in a visual form, and not for any intrinsic artistic value they may have. Overall, a good book.
B005P5TQPU|3.0|I watched this episode for free thanks to my Prime Membership to try to remember something that happened in it.  I'm a long-time fan of the show though I think the first 5 seasons were definitely better.
0385343175|5.0|Even though I read some reviewers who said they thought the book was boring, it was not worth your time, .... negative remarks, I have to say I've read a whole lot of Danielle Steel's books and for me, this book was a good read.  A child who adored her dad was his constant shadow and the two of them lived in a jewel of a hotel in NYC because he owned it and ran it.  Her mom never bothered with her and ran away with a rock star, so daddy's girl grew up \\"learning the ropes\\" of being a hotelier.  It was a great story with lots of twists and turns, even if some of them were expected it was a wonderful book to curl up with and enjoy.  Do all books have to be The Best Book You've EVER Read??? OR can you read Really Good Books and say you enjoyed reading them?  I really enjoyed reading this book. Just maybe you will too.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have not watched the dvd that came with this yet but the Blu-Ray and 3D Blu-Ray are great and play without issue.  I bought this version because I have a TV that does 3D and it is only the second 3D title that I have purchased.  The first was just because I could - bought it at the same time as my tv.  This one was just because it was The Avengers so why not?  As for the complaints of most...the information about what's included on the DVD and Blu-Ray discs is available.  So is it really anyone else's fault that they didn't get what they wanted out of the product they bought?  As for the people with problems playing it, it's more common for it to be a problem with their hardware or a dirty disc.  I don't have a top-of-the-line blu-ray player but I also know not to expect the same results from a cheap one as a more expensive one.  They're not there yet.  You can get a cheap dvd player that works fine.  You still can't really get a cheap blu-ray player that works fine.  It's unfortunate but it's true.  The same can be said for early-adopters.  People who have had blu-ray players for years where subtle differences that have evolved as the technology matured have had to watch their expensive players age-out already.  But that's the price of being an early adopter.
0316227706|5.0|This book is great!  The entire family enjoyed the pictures.  We loved that the breeds and their regular photos were also listed in the book.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|I want to first comment on the product as this is what these reviews are supposed to be about.  The Blu-Ray was great.  Played well and did everything it was supposed to do.<br /><br />Next I want to comment on the movie.  I'm amazed by the negative reviews.  First, if you can't stand exploitative violence...why are you watching something with Tarantino's name on it?  Also, if you're judging it negatively because of people cheering the violence of the one side against the violence of the other....congratulations, you've just met irony.  Tarantino's movies are very unique and they are certainly not meant for everyone.  I haven't liked everything about every one but I have liked something about most.  Good, bad or something else, they're always interesting.  Does that mean everyone should experience them?  No.  It is definitely not for everyone and a lot probably walk away with the wrong impression.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of the comics you can't deny that this is one the most outstanding trilogys in movie history,and for every fan of a good story,made with the well knonwn professionalism of Christopher Nolan,and amazingly well writen,(well enough to take the goofiness off from others batman films)it's definitely a must have.The surreal City of gotham comes to life with plots that bring some of the most insane  and briliantly perfomed villains you will ever see in any &#34;superhero&#34; movie.This is the most serious and adult take on the batman universe ,and by far the best,This trilogy will be remembered for ages to come.<br /><br />This Blu-ray special edition will definitely fulfill yor espectations with the special features,and the behind the scenes book with unique pics from the films.<br /><br />prepare to be amazed.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|Tongue-in-cheek, and fun all the same, this movie is one of the best B-Movies I've seen in a long time. In Norwegian, and subtitled in English, the movie centers around a mysterious hunter of trolls, who is secretive at first about what he does but later on becomes disenchanted with the way the government covers up what he is doing.

B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Not even close to being as good as any of the other REs.  Love the genre and have watched every RE, including the animations (which are actually pretty good).  Lots of action and absolutely no substance.  Seriously, its non-stop action with no plot.  The action wasn't even that good.  Milla looked good in her standard S&M outfit but even that didn't keep my attention enough to rate this higher than 1 star.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I rate this book a full five star because it was filled with excitement, curiosity of what will happen next. I am not a person who like to read, very few books interest me. I am glad I found this book, looking forward to the others. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for adventure and excitement.

1449320104|5.0|I program daily in C#. I have the 3.0 version of this book and have found it to be an excellent reference for both C# and the more commonly used components of .NET. Enough so that I decided to buy the 5.0 version to replace it as it got out of date. I don't know that I think it would be a great book for a beginner to start with as it's very much more a reference rather than a tutorial.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very entertaining.  I would recommend this to everyone of all ages.  It was a relaxing way to entertain yourself and a good way to pass time when waiting for appointments.
0385344228|3.0|William Landay's DEFENDING JACOB is pretty much a retelling of Rosellen Brown's 1993 novel BEFORE AND AFTER (which inspired the film of the same name, starring Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson).  Both novels are about respected parents whose teenage sons are charged with the murder of a classmate.  Both explore the horrors of suddenly finding oneself in the spotlight, trying desperately to believe in the innocence of a beloved child while nagging doubts keep threatening to break through the resolve.  In both novels, the accused teen is named \\"Jacob.\\"  And both novels use the terms \\"Before\\" and \\"After\\" (with capital letters) to describe life before and after a tragedy.  But Landay hasn't stopped there - he throws in a healthy dose of William March's suburban horror novel, THE BAD SEED, giving DEFENDING JACOB another level of mystery.  Is fourteen-year-old Jacob guilty of murdering the boy who had been bullying him?  And if he IS guilty, is it because of his family's history of violence and bloodshed?  Is there really such a thing as a \\"murder gene\\" which predisposes some of us to the kind of unrestrained viciousness that can result in murder?<br /><br />DEFENDING JACOB is told primarily from the first person perspective of ADA Andy Barber, Jacob's father, who finds himself investigating the very murder his son is ultimately accused of committing.  Barber is certain Jacob is innocent, but the reader isn't so sure - Jacob is a sullen, disagreeable teenager with a history of anti-social behavior as a young child (kids just seemed to get hurt around Jacob, his mother says).  The victim, Jacob's classmate Ben, seems even more disagreeable - he's portrayed as a cruel bully who had been systematically harassing Jacob for months before the murder.  Andy and his wife, Laurie, respond to their legal nightmare as we might expect - he knows the legal system, so he can't trust the courts to exonerate his son, and she's obsessed with the idea that something they may have done as parents (like putting Jacob into daycare when he was a baby) might have trigged anti-social behavior.  Add to that the shocking truth that Andy's father and grandfather were both cold-blooded murderers, and we have to worry that maybe Jacob is a demon after all, a heartless narcissistic psychopath without any compassion for his fellow human beings.  Is this genetics at work, or is Jacob really just an average teenager - after all, aren't they all a bit narcissistic and detached?<br /><br />Woven through Andy's narration are excerpts from Grand Jury testimony that apparently happened after Jacob's trial was resolved - the new ADA is interrogating Andy about elements of the case, about Jacob, and about Andy's behavior during the trial.  It's not clear until very late in the novel what these excerpts are all about (which makes them a bit confusing and distracting - they interrupt the story itself in a way that becomes annoying).  Once we understand what's really going on, Landay throws us a twist that, while not totally unexpected (I've read THE BAD SEED), is more than a bit over the top.  Characters do things in the last few chapters of this novel that are absolutely absurd.  I was with Andy and Laurie through most of the trial, and I was even willing to give Jacob the benefit of the doubt (I've raised two teenage boys myself, and a surly tone does not a murderer make), but in the end all three behave in ways that simply make no sense.  I get that Landay wanted a killer finale (both literally and metaphorically), but this one just made me shake my head in disbelief.  It's out there, no doubt about it.  But it doesn't work with the rest of the novel.<br /><br />I liked DEFENDING JACOB until the last forty pages; thus the three stars.  But a bad ending can seriously undermine even the best of novels.  If you liked BEFORE AND AFTER, you'll probably like this one as well.  And if you've read THE BAD SEED (or seen the 1956 movie version) you'll be prepared for the ending.  Overall, not a bad read.  It was just ultimately disappointing on several levels.all, not a bad read.  It was just ultimately disappointing on several levels.

B001A4LYN2|5.0|I saw this movie back when it came out, and just watched it again after several years. You understand so much more the second time around. This is a great story told in a very unique way. Its most redeeming quality is getting you deep inside the sentiment of the era and the perspective of the characters. This is really a gem of a movie.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Frank is a breath of fresh air in the congested music landscape. His words are so true and the tone of the album is just like butter. Really hope the rumors of this being his last album aren't true. Keep it coming Mr. Ocean!

B00A7ZXDLQ|3.0|Love the girl's music and has been on point for the past few albums...but this one is just kinda boring. Resting on her laurels a bit? I dunno. Just something missing. I'm sure she'll have another one later this year, as her albums seem to be an annual event at this point. Here's hoping she steps it up next go around.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|As a girl who wasn't into actual comics, this still had me wanting to see what happens next! My husband had to explain certain people & background history to me, but it was so well done it didnt affect how much i liked it!

My personal favorties are &#34;Imagine the Fire&#34; and &#34;Rise&#34;. Sad that the trilogy is over. I hope Zimmer and Nolan work together again, because this is pure gold.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|watched season 3 on link.  can't wait for actual dvd to get here so i can watch it again.  love this series!!
B009KUANWG|5.0|Adele's voice is genius for the opening theme for the new and BEST Bond film. I heard this song TOO many times(in a good way) and when I heard it during the opening credits...it just got me even more excited for the film. Great lyrics. Great artist. Great song.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought this was a very good series. I do believe you should continue it. I really liked at the end how you seen Christians versions of things a little change in pace. Maybe you should have done that throughout the books. Just an idea
B004A2V3K0|5.0|C'mon. Bon Jovi. Greatest Hits. What more can you ask for? Disappointed &#34;Thank You For Loving Me&#34; wasn't included. But I just bought that separately anyway. Start at Track 1 and just let it ride allllll the way down.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I cannot believe how much I love this show, not so much for the horror & gory but for the acting. Jessica Lange is my favorite but they are all so good that makes the stories even better.  There is way too much blood though.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|I've always been a sucker for reading the classics and finally got a chance to read this one. The language takes time to get used to if you haven't read any old literature in a while, but just like most classics - definitely worth the read! And, how can you beat free?!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the book's story, however, I felt like the intimate scenes were quite boring and poorly written. If there wasn't revelations in them I would have skipped them. Some parts I had to work to keep going. Even though I did quite enjoy the book and for the most part couldn't put it for down.
B00908DDZM|5.0|The beginning of the album starts out fun and danceable, and as it progresses the songs get deeper, then prettier. Overall it was an album worth buying as opposed to just snagging a few songs.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Writing is great with vivid descriptions that create beautiful pictures in your mind.  Great combination of magic, mystery and love.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Why did the series have to end on that note? There is still another book that could have been written.  It's a must read book if you have read the first two books in the series.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I am just waiting to see what they do with the movie. The book is very suspenseful and leaves you wondering. I don't know why someone would not read the book.
B0015DROBO|5.0|After watching both movie versions, I was quite interested to finally sit down and read the beginning of it all. In truth in was not disappointed. Stieg Larsson's series has now become a classic in 21st century literature. With his inventive characters, twists, and incessant action Dragon Tattoo is all but impossible to put down, but a quick read. I'd recommend watching both films first before reading the book, it definitely made it easier to follow along.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The suspense in the book is killer!  When I had to stop reading question kept kept running through my mind.
0345522478|5.0|It's no secret that the fiction market is on fire with modern/urban fiction books. Go to any bestseller list and you're sure to find a book dealing with Vampires or Werewolves trying to make it in a modern day society. Kevin Hearne has decided to tread in barely explored territory by telling the story of a twenty centuries old Druid (an Iron Druid to be exact) named Atticus O'Sullivan who's managed to really piss off the Celtic God of Love in his centuries long existence.<br /><br />Kevin Hearne is a self-professed &#34;comic book geek&#34; and it really shows in his writing style. I don't mean this in a negative light, not in the least. Atticus is one of the best main characters I've had the pleasure to meet in years. Twenty-one centuries alive have made him a rather unique cross of badass and smartass, and as a tribute to Hearne's skill, Atticus comes off as believable and incredibly likeable. Hearne's fight scenes are some of the best ever written and do a perfect job of reflecting the speed an chaos of what a fight is: two men trying to come out on the other end of the argument alive. Hearne also expertly combines multiple mythologies into one believeable whole, where Gods and Goddesses new and old cohabitate in our world, fighting for relevance and believers. But he never, ever comes off as preachy.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's an absolute blast to read, and I found myself laughing out loud many times as I've turned the pages. The telepathic interactions between Atticus and Oberon (his pet Irish Wolfhound) are at times hilarious, and yet so incredibly honest between the way owners interact with their pets when no one else is around.<br /><br />If you've just finished a massive fantasy series dealing with fires and ice and are looking for something new and fun to read, Hounded and the rest of the Iron Druid Chronicles may easily become your next obsession. They have for me!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Every one of the characters seemed to be depressed or just depressing. Only one of them seemed to have a better outlook at the end. I know life is like this for many people, I just don't want to bring them in to my reading.
1439156816|4.0|I was fascinated to learn that my mentor and previous Creative Writing professor has made On Writing \\"required reading material\\" in all of his classes ever since he came across this book. After reading it I can thoroughly see why. I've been a life-long Stephen King fan ever since I read Salem's Lot (when I was six years old no less) and I consider On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft to be one of his best works.<br /><br />King makes it plain in the beginning of the book that most books about writing currently on the market are \\"loaded with bulls***\\" and as such keeps On Writing a short and succinct affair. The first half of the book deals with his life and how the writer in him was \\"born\\". It honestly reflects on how hard he had to work to become a published writer. King does his best to describe what he \\"thinks\\" worked for him where others have failed, but he also freely admits that he really doesn't know the secret to his success. I found this to be the most entertaining portion of the book. As a writer myself, the book illustrated just how much perseverence counts (more than anything) to becoming successful in your craft. You get a true feel for what helped shape the writer and the man.<br /><br />The second portion of the book deals with actual writing itself. King tries to explain what makes writing work, what can make it magical, and suggests several ways to approach it. He frequently references Strunk and White's Elements of Style (a must for any writer as well) and where they were right on grammar. It's not exactly a how-to, but there are some exercises and illustrations of a few techniques that can help you pump your own writing up a bit.<br /><br />If you're a King fan, this is probably the most in-depth and intimate look into his life that SK has put to paper. He makes no efforts to hide his faults, and his approach to life and his approach to writing reflect an honesty that any aspiring writer should inspiring and helpful.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great fun and please watch all the credits.  This is a good mix of Campy fun and cartoon (no spurting blood) violence.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not bad. First book was better. I skipped some of the love scenes because they are overdone. The suspense makes me want to read the third book though. Well written overall.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|There are a lot of classic through the window 3D tricks in this one.  I almost broke a plate when the fish flew out at me!  However, I think there are way too many gratuitous through-the-window 3D effects (through the window is when something appears to be between the viewer and the screen).  I also found the window violations to be too numerous for me (window violations is a through the window effect where part of the through-the-window object is cut off by the edge of the TV screen) something appears to be between the viewer and the screen but is cut off by the side of the screen).  IT is OK if something is sticking out at me, but when half a person is sticking out at me, it is too distracting.<br /><br />That being said, my family enjoyed it and would give it 4 stars:)
B00005JNDZ|5.0|how can you not like Bridget Jones? The movie was in good shape and plays well. Ive used it many times.
B00701897I|5.0|I enjoyed the 3D and the story line - I bit campy, but still a fun romp in 3D land.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a heartfelt and moving movie that is a must see for all families.  Tragedy which brings life saving hope to the future of our children.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book and you should read it because It's funny it's about his uncle and his advice for Greg's love life and who he should bring the dance.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like this app and use it daily.  Only, I used colornote as my first note app and really like the ease in which you can move lines up or down in lists.  The complex notes including audio and video are fantastic but what about my daily notes like grocery list and monthly/weekly budget that I use most? An option for a simple list (esp. for use on phone and tablet where copy/paste is not as quick/easy as on a PC) would make this app perfection.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|True Baldacci writing. Very good read. Keeps you engrossed till the end. I did not want to put it down.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|It had it's funny parts but not enough to make it worth watching in my opinion. My daughter enjoyed it but not worth the $5 rental fee in my opinion.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As always these guys rocked it!  The story is always believable and very tense lol!  A must read!  Everything they right is great!!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Beautiful presentation, incredible songs and amazing concert video. The live concert video is just incredible, showing michael at his best. This product is just a MUST for every MJ fan.
0525423656|2.0|This book, a sequel to &#34;Matched&#34;, didn't have much meat to it.  There were some explanations to how and why there was a conflict between the Society and the Rebels, but it dragged on.  The pace was too slow and the ending trite.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Well written plot with lots of twist and turns ! Excellent ! Excellent ! Excellent ! Excellent ! I highly recommend this product to everyone !
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|fun game.  sometimes it doesn't save though so you lose your progress.  if that is fixed then it is a five star game.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|This app is really handy for checking my many Hotmail email accounts. I no longer have to boot my comp to check email, which is a huge plus for me.Things are much faster without slowing my Kindle down, or closing out what else I' m doing.

B00APUYWYA|3.0|It was okay for me, but our girls loved it (they would have given 5 stars :-))<br />The movie's main theme is capella so if you are into it this is a must-see movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved thus entire series!! Every sentence was captivating and each chapter brought a new twist or turn. This is truly a great book! The story is complete, I'm just sad there are no more to read.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Amazing book! Keeps you on your toes, you think you have it figured out but then it goes a complete other direction. You really fall for Jacob barber and his family. Shocking ending for sure!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord fits tighter and seems to be lasting longer than the last one I bought. It would not Stat attached to my kindle. This one has given no trouble yet!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I bough this for my daughter, who is a big fan of Ms. Swift, and ended up listening to it myself. I was surprised that it was not bad, once you get past that &#34;never ever ever ever ever&#34; song that makes my ears bleed. That track is awful, but I liked the rest of them.
B00009R86L|5.0|This product really takes the stress of carrying a messenger bag. I can't imagine how I walked around anywhere without it.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|good for the price. highly recommend this. Looks no further. i am no audio expert but its good for the price.    [...]
0553801473|4.0|I got this book because I have been reading the series and its a very good book. My only complaint is that I must wait to read the ending of this great series. Thats not a real bad problem though
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Bought for my 11 yr old grandson. It works perfectly well for him. Not too expensive and does the job of covering what it should. Should keep his iPad well protected. Sturdy and good looking!
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun to play great graphics there are some great dragons that you can breed nice way to relax and a lot of fun
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves to watch the tv series and to have this game where she can interact with her favorite characters brings hours of fun.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love the story of Gideon and Eva from their torrid past to their sultry present. A must read if you like these erotic novels. Must read bared to you inorder to understand the story line. Can't wait till May when part three is released

B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun an very addicting. Once I start playing I can't seem to quit. I could play for hours.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I you want this film, get it here, it's easier to order, great quality, and speedy delivery.  You must have this in your Christmas film collection.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|This was my third time reading Carch 22 and it just keeps getting better each time. I'll probably read it again in a few years.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did not particularly care for the ending. It was not a satisfactory completion to this story. It seems as though there will have to be a continuation  and therefore a series. I do not appreciate it.<br />I did find the book exciting until the ending.<br />Selda Milton<br />&#34;Gone Girl&#34;  is the title of this book
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Fun movie, my granddaughter wanted to watch it but we just were not able to get to the theater. Everyone young and old liked the movie and laughed throughout.
B008MM9630|5.0|Having a blast with this game. Pretty easy and quick to learn. Cute game. Great time killer. Try it you will like it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This Battery charge indicating app is accurate and easy to use. Downloaded and installed easily. I would recommend it for othe Kindle Fire HD users.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover doesn't disappoint with this offering. Nothing about this story was predictable and it kept me enthralled page after page. I LOVED Slammed and Point of Retreat and Hopeless is just as good. I cant wait for the next book from her.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its soo stupid but I like it. Some games are better than others (of course) but overall its pretty fun (in a weird, stupid kind of way)
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you don't like Batman, I would not buy this product.  That being said, my favorite Batmans so far.  And the Blu-ray is crystal clear and beautiful.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter but I hate all the extra apps they have for it. The moment you fall in love with one app, they change it or it stops working. But this app is great!
B0064ORVCQ|5.0|Mainly got this movie for my kids. Watching Harry Potter in 3D is an experience unlike any other and well worth it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like it. I wish the kindle fire came with a percentage next to the battery bar but since it doesnt. this app has def come in handy!
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|Well written songs sung by others that are not part of the country music mainstream.  If you like country music, you'll enjoy this soundtrack.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It really helps when you download a file and it just magically disappears! I always know I can go to my ES File explorer and find it there!
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Long boring scenes without much action. Lacks a good plot and tries to make a dull story into something somewhat complex. The expected idiotic scene of a guy sitting in front of Congress and the almost expected anticlimatic end... What a waste of a good action actor.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|It's a good game. I'm mid twenties and I enjoy it. Gets harder had you go on. Fun for all ages.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|i'm a big stephan king so i watch this every holiday season its a family thing. This was listed in good condition, but was in excellant.
B007MDB548|4.0|The 4 pack DVd is  excellent idea !. However the 3d cover on the wrapping should of been on the dvd case itself.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|My husband and I watched the first season in a matter of days. We absolutely love this show! Its captivating, interesting and always keeps you guessing. While I think Season 2 isn't as good, Season 1 is a home run. It's worth owning, you will want to watch it again!
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Seriously, one of the best CDs I own.  100% energy. No slow s***. Great to dance to.  They have two other CDs. Get them all!
B009V3KKXY|5.0|had great details and pictures to show how it is made  and great book  i got the kindle book and it had great qulidy
0385536828|5.0|I loved this book!  I would give this book 4 1/2 stars because of the ending, however.  While I did like the end of the novel, I felt it could have been more satisfying.  Overall, though, I enjoyed reading this novel.
B0000TB014|5.0|Just replacing (can you believe this) my VHS tape with Thriller on.  Not a big fan of Michael Jackson but really enjoyed Thriller.  For the truly big fan this is definitely a keeper
B0073Q0DZG|2.0|When it comes to Owen Wilson, it's hard for me not to like a movie he does. I just didn't get this one. Overall it was slow, boring, and most importantly just not funny. Come on Owen, you can do better!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Si bien es cierto, cuenta con cómodos espacios para guardar todo lo que un fotógrafo profesional necesita, la considero demasiado grande para quienes solo necesitamos un buen lugar, donde guardar la cámara.
0470932139|5.0|From setup to exposure, to post production, this book covers it all. Great read if you are interested in doing food photography for yourself, or another. Highly recommend.
B00021R7CG|5.0|This movie should be watched by everyone.<br />It will give a person plenty to think about.<br />Highly recommend it to everyone!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I first started reading these books, I just couldn't believe someone actually wrote a book about kids killing each other for sport. It certainly won me over by the end, though. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good read!
1451696191|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, lots of funny anecdotes and an interesting writing style. however, i did feel that some of the topics and content of the story were a bit mature for a younger audience. References to teen sex, drug use, self sexual exploration, just a little too blatant for a reader under the age of 15. But otherwise a very good book and i really enjoyed it!
B0078N2MTE|3.0|Compared against some of the other duds I've watched lately, this was at least watchable. I would not by any means call it great. It's better than staring at a wall for 2 hours though.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Qwerky fun game.  Nice and simple and a good way to keep busy for a few minutes.  And the grand babies like it.
B000XWJQF0|5.0|These guys never go out of style. I loved them when I was a kid, and my kids love them now. Good clean fun. Beware if you have young boys - they may start karate fighting everything in sight after watching this a few times! ;)
B007FTZDN8|4.0|This app is great! I absolutly loved the science behind the speeches. Another amazing thing about td tv is it has everthing from music to math!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|If you need to kill time on a bus or train, sure this can be fun. It can also be nerve wracking after a while ;). All in all good game, and different.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is really fun and exciting.Due to the fact that every time you open the game you always have something different to do.You always enjoy yourself.It feels as if the City is actually your own city in the real world!!!
B0071MV540|3.0|Whatever happened to the great comedies such as Wedding Crashers and Shanghai Knight? Maybe I expect too much out of comedy, but I just didn't think it was very funny. Its not the worst movie I've seen all year, though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's great for passing time when there's nothing else to do. I actually play it daily. I love the games it has and I like that you can replay games you have already completed. I also like how you can unlock more then one game at a time.
1400069289|5.0|This book has so many applications that I can't begin to list them all. I personally purchased it to gain insight into human habits as it relates to marketing and advertising. I was not disappointed. Highly recommend!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Choose the book cause i have heard a lot about it<br />Rated it because i haven't found one that is this Good in a long time
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I really liked this movie, mostly for the visuals and concepts. Kristen Stewart was surprisingly adequate, too. I have seen about an hour of the Twilight movies, and Kristen's inability, in those movies, to open her eyes or close her mouth seemed absent in this picture. Theron does a great job as the queen, as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a wonderful book. With every page there was something to keep me wanting more. Very anticipating, descriptive, and very well written. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of eighteen. My favorite part about the book is I feel it has a hidden message that we have all experienced at least once. An excellent read.
B0098R6M1M|3.0|As a kid in Catholic high school about 50 years ago I was surprised to hear my most-admired priest say that he had been called upon to speak at a meeting where he hadn't expected it, in front of the bishop and other big wigs and he panicked.  But he remembered Luke 6:38, &#34;Give and it shall be given unto you&#34;, and decided to open his mouth and see what would come out.  Cardinal Melville as the unwilling pope-elect could have done the same and made it a much better movie.  It's just hard to believe that a professional church man could invest decades of service and then fumble when it counted most.  I'm wondering, what is it?  Has he been diagnosed with cancer which he is hiding or some other dark secret ... some explanation.  To take my time and money and then not deliver any reason at all made this a very disappointing movie.  On the other hand, it's a pretty movie, lots of grampas in red robes bobbing and weaving around the Vatican.
B008Y6SA36|4.0|&#34;Resident Evil&#34; has gotten a bit of a &#34;schlock&#34; reputation; I find trailers for the latest theatrical release intriguing; when I mentioned this to my son, he recommended this first in the series.  It doesn't have the timbre of supernatural or horror film that I've been told sequels do.  In fact the story is more plausible than say, &#34;Total Recall&#34; or &#34;Sixth Sense&#34;, which are accepted as scifi.  If you're looking for horror/zombie, this isn't the flick for you.  But I recommend it to SciFi fans who may have passed it over.
