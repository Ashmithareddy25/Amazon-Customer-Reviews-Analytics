B000BVQ9JO|4.0|After wooing critics and fans alike with their first two albums \\"Is this It\\" (2001) and \\"Room on Fire\\" (2003) the Strokes are back with their eagerly awaited third album \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" (2006).<br /><br />I am generally wary of bands that are the darlings of the critics. Much like their counterparts in the UK, Franz Ferdinand, a band so hyped and praised by Rolling Stone, NME and SPIN can't be that good. While both bands have no doubt churned out some good albums and memorable singles, the hype has deluded their impact. Would Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, the Velvet Underground and Black Sabbath's catalogue have stood the test of time and be so loved by fans if they had everything handed to them?<br /><br />This brings us to \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" an album that most critics probably already wrote a glorious review for before hearing a note. So, do the Strokes prove their champions right? Luckily they do. Unlike Franz Ferdinand, the Strokes actually sound like they took time to write a follow-up, rather than just rehash what worked for them the first two times around. \\"Impressions\\" is probably the band's strongest offering yet. It doesn't sound radically different from the band's first two offerings, but it isn't just more of the same either. Rather, the band know what works for them, sticks to their formula, and perfects it for their catchiest, most well written collection of songs, but with a few curveballs thrown in.<br /><br />One thing that really works for this album is that the band mixes it up a bit and stretches their artistic muscle. While this album is straight forward in the vein of their first two releases, the band really gets inventive this time around. The up-beat rocker \\"You Only Live Once,\\" with its melodic chorus and lush solos gets things off to a great start. The frantic, go-for-the-jugular \\"Juicebox\\" with its funky bassline and alternating James Bond-esque chorus and poppy chorus is both exciting and unexpected. \\"Heart in a Box,\\" sounds like rock-a-billy on speed. The good-but-not-great popish \\"Razorblade\\" is effective enough and keeps up the momentum. The ultra infectious funk/danceable \\"On the other Side\\" should be a strong contender for an upcoming single. \\"Vision of Division\\" throws the listener a curveball with its frenzied intro and chorus, middle-eastern-esque solos, and laid back verses.  The striped down-synth \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" like \\"Ask Me Anything,\\"  comes out of left field and offers a refreshing change of pace. The album gets back in gear with the straight-forward rocking \\"Electricityscape,\\" which wouldn't have sounded out of place on the band's first two albums. Its dark trimmings and melodic, free-flowing solos make this song really shine. \\"Killing Lies,\\" with its almost march-like structure is good, but not the album's most memorable cut. \\"Fear of Sleep\\" which alternates between a catchy, peppering guitar-lead-in, dark brooding pre-chorus and loose chorus is both captivating and exciting. The brooding sing-song of \\"15 Minutes\\" which morphs into a furious, melodic jam offers another entrancing change of pace. \\"Izle the World\\" is a pretty straight-forward, better than average rocker that keeps things going. \\"Evening Sun\\" sounds a bit a like a sped up version of the Velvet Underground's \\"Who Loves the Sun,\\" which shows the band's obvious Lou Reed influence. \\"Red Light\\" sounds like Gary Glitter's \\"Rock N' Roll (part II)\\" meets Lou Reed/T.Rex with a showbiz twist and makes for a good closer.<br /><br />While I liked the Strokes first two albums, I thought they were somewhat overrated and one dimensional. \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" shows the band venture out and experiment without letting their ambitions run wild. There really is a lot going on with this album. There are subtleties to this disc, little nooks and crannies that a listener might not pick up on the first time around, this makes \\"Impressions\\" good for repeated listens, even though it is instantly addictive.  Andwhile guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. may not be the next guitar heroes, they definitely come up with some awesome, crunching solos that should please fans clamoring for the return of the solo. Nikolai Fraiture (bass) and Fab Moretti (drums) offer an exciting and dynamic rhythm section that is definitely better than average. Singer Julian Casablancas, while not the most dynamic or gifted singer, is competent enough.<br /><br />\\"First Impressions of Earth\\" really exceeded my expectations and the Strokes should rest easy as they have finally lived up to the hype.k Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. may not be the next guitar heroes, they definitely come up with some awesome, crunching solos that should please fans clamoring for the return of the solo.

B00005BL2A|4.0|Depeche Mode is a band that comes along with high expectations from their fan base. When you release an album once every three to four years you have to expect an adrenaline rush from the people that have been waiting patiently. I think that is one major reason why this album was so quickly cast aside as subpar, after all we waited 4 years for an experimental and light hearted album from one of the most dependable bands in music. The only problem is that this album is actually one of their best post \\"Black Celebration\\" releases. You see Depeche Mode fans see the band as a dual generation entity, the new wave synth-pop band that was generation 1 (81-85) and the dark, moody synth-goth band they became in 1986. \\"Exciter\\" breakes them away from the generation 2 stereotype a little by warming us with some lighter mellower faire.  <br /> <br />Overall the songs on \\"Exciter\\" are exceptional. \\"Dream On\\" and \\"I Feel Loved\\" ,2 of the albums 4 singles, are quintessential Depeche Mode and could find a home on any of their post 1990 releases. It is some of the lesser played tracks, however, that bring the albums true grace to light. The majesty of \\"Shine\\" with it's atmospheric keyboard intro that brings to mind a brilliant city skyline lit up at night, or the beauty that is \\"When The Body Speaks\\" bring the album to a whole new level for the band. An earlier reviewer noted that this album has 3 songs with \\"Love\\" in the title as a negative,  however you need to remember that when listening to this album you have to remove yourself from the stigma that Depeche Mode created. This album is not mean't to be dark or dirty or gothic. Simply put it's like an unexpected gift from a dear friend and as the gorgeous aura from \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" lulls you to a friendly goodbye remember that this was a rare glimpse at a band doing something new and exciting (no pun intended). <br /> <br />Spotlight Tracks - Shine, Freelove, I Am You, Goodnight Lovers <br /> <br />Disappointing Tracks - The Dead Of Night
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer about the songwriting not being as good as her other projects but the beats on this one will definitely get you moving. They will stay with you long after the EP is finished playing.<br /><br />Ms Badu has a way of bringing you right into her funky, soulful and positively charged world with her music. Her energy is as usual, nothing but positive, and when this EP reaches it's end, you will want to go back into her Worldwide Underground for more.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|My 5 year old son went to see this at the theaters last summer, but when he said he saw \\"sky high,\\" I assumed he was talking about Chicken Little (\\"the sky is falling...\\").  Anyway, when the commercials started around Christmas for this DVD, he totally wanted it! <br />I watched this movie with both sons (age 5 and 3), and i was laughing more than they were!  It was good, clean humor (with some kissing that grossed out my older kid!), and tons of 80's music which i love!  the smiths, spandau ballet, go-go's, yeah baby!  i think that they intentionally put in all the cool 80's songs to hook us parents! <br />all in all, you will be giggling throughout this wonderful family movie!
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|great album, catchy as hell, dueling guitars, nothing bad about this, just not a perfect album but close, the strokes are a good band despite the media love fest the get and arty uptown vibe, just listen, the best album of 2006 until Straflyer 59 and Radiohead
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is a must every Guns N' Roses fan.  All of Guns N' Roses hits are here including the masterpiece- Welcome to the Jungle, the ballads- Don't Cry and November Rain.  Their #1 single, Sweet Child O'Mine is here.  You Could Be Mine is a blistering piece of metal and showcases Guns N' Roses at their best.  Patience shows the lighter side of Guns N' Roses.  All the hits are here with Don't Cry, Sweet Child O'Mine, Patience, Yesterdays, Paradise City, Yesterdays, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Civil War and Since I don't have you.   <br /> <br />Guns N' Roses topped Billboard 200 albums with Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion II.  I have every album released by Guns N' Roses. <br /> <br />Say what you will about Axl Rose- but his band, Guns N' Roses is one of the best metal acts in history. With more than 100 million records sold, who can argue with the success of this band. <br /> <br />Velvet Revolver can dream about having the same success as G N' R- but the truth of the matter is that Velvet Revolver will never ever have the same success as Guns N' Roses.   <br /> <br />This is one of the best greatest hits collection released- not to mention that it was #1 on the Canadian album chart. <br /> <br />With #1 videos for November Rain, Don't Cry and You Could Be Mine- the success of the band speaks for itself. <br /> <br />
B00004TJWE|4.0|S.F. Sorrow is one of the hidden treasures of the 60s.  I first heard the album in 1979 at a friend's house.  I already owned their \\"Silk Torpedo\\" album from 1974.  At the time I liked it even though psychedelic albums sounded dated.  I came to appreciate more over time.  Listening to the opening track \\"S.F. Sorrow Is Born\\" first reminded me of Stephen Stills with the acoustic guitar and then the Moody Blues with the mellotron.   The horn overdubs gave it a different sound.  One should contrast this version with the \\"BBC Sessions\\" version which uses a Hammond organ instead of a mellotron and no horns.  Next comes \\"Bracelets\\" a song about masturbation which anticipates groups like Queen.  \\"She Says Good Morning\\" is about falling in love.  \\"Private Sorrow\\" about going to war with an interlude that segues into \\"Balloon Burning\\".  This latter song alludes to the Hindenburg disaster and features an excellent guitar solo by Dick Taylor.  Next comes \\"Death\\", a bluesy dirge that has keyboardist John Povey playing sitar (owned by George Harrison).  \\"Baron Saturday\\" follows and features Dick Taylor on vocals and a drum solo followed by flutes, etc.  This is followed by the medley of \\"The Journey\\" which starts out with acoustic guitars and ends with electric acid rock rave up that segues into \\"I See You\\" a melancholy song in the vein of Cream's \\"White Room\\" and finally into the noise effects of \\"Well of Destiny\\".  All is calm with the instrospective \\"Trust\\" a song about seeking new values and then the violent \\"Old Man Going\\" which features acoustic and electric guitar interplay (compare this to the Who's \\"Pinball Wizzard\\")  and finally \\"The Loneliest Person\\".  The Snapper reissue has four bonus tracks which are excellent psychedelic pop songs from 1967-1968.  I would have added some other bonus tracks from the BBC Sessions \\"Turn Your Head\\" and \\"SF Sorrow Is Born\\".   Supposedly, \\"Defecting Grey\\" was originally recorded as a 12 minute demo.  That may be nice too.

0962477060|5.0|Back in the late 70s and early 80s, I used to love to play my guitar.  I took lessons and made progress pretty quickly.  I was okay, but really I was just poking around in the dark, trying to string together a few chords and licks that sounded good together.  I eventually, like tens of thousands of others I'm sure, got frustrated and drifted away from it.  When I came back to the guitar, I began to remember those same frustrations.  I could afford better equipment, but couldn't get any better sounds out of it.  Finding this book was like grasping around and finding the light switch.  I've only had it a couple of weeks, but with Edwards' book, things are beginning to make sense like they never have before.  I'm never going to be a guitar idol, but making sense out of the fretboard is a LOT more exciting than just memorizing chords and patterns and figuring out licks.  This system is simple, and still requires a lot of practice, but it will help you understand the whole fretboard and make the progress you've been struggling for.  Bravo, Bill Edwards!
B00000JGOJ|5.0|It's time to stop labeling movies as such 'Robert Altman' films. After all, dramas aren't still referred to by he who supposedly did the first drama. What stands out more than distinct, inter-related stories, is the lessons learned about loving. These lessons can be no more relevant than in present day - when people date until they find 'the' flaw... or a flaw. Even the seemingly least-inviting of us all, are insecure and just need someone to stick in there with us... We all wish for supreme realism and honesty, but this movie shows what happend when it's put into practice. One of the best lines, aside from the numerous ones from Jolie's character, is, \\"Do we (or We don't) really need to know everything about those we love?\\"<br /><br />The original name was to be 'Dancing About Architecture,\\" Sometimes words cannot express.

B000BTJDGC|4.0|It's hard to rate this movie. It's based on true-life events, and it's also a faithed-based horror movie that draws on our own, deep-rooted beliefs in God and the devil, something that has always found success in the movies, starting back with the original horror classic The Exorcist. Though it is a movie about the tragic events of a young girl who was obviously tortured in life, The Exorcism of Emily Rose captures everything that modern horror films don't. Simply speaking, it scares us. And it handles Emily Rose's story sensitively, without making her appear as no more than a Hollywood monster, like Linda Blair's character has become. With that out of the way, I will go onto the review.<br /><br />Exorcism begins \\"in media res\\" (beginning in the middle), starting the movie with Emily's death. It's a good start to the movie, because it introduces the other main character in the process, Father Moore, the priest who watched over Emily and attempted the only exorcism. From there, the movie becomes a court trial, literally. Emily's story is told through witness testimony and flashbacks while Father Moore's story is taking place. Father Moore has been charged for Emily's murder, and faces ten years in prison. Though a plea-agreement was proposed, he refuses every attempt and decides that he wants to go to court, so that Emily's story can be told. During the trial, Emily's possession is detailed and played out, and we, from start to finish, see the things she had to go through. All the way up to the actual exorcism, the horror is really no more than a feeling of creepiness (at least for me) but when you realize what is possessing her, and just how outnumbered Father Moore and Emily's family truly is, then it takes a violent shift towards horrifying. In that final epiphany, the torture of Emily and the hopelessness of her exorcism is presented. It doesn't take an understanding in Humanities to know who and what Father Moore has attempted to chase away.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, when all the facts are in place, you can't help but have a feeling of despair, both for Father Moore and for Emily Rose, as both of their separate endings were and are inevitable. Yet, in both of their fights, their goals are achieved.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie for fans of the Exorcist, or for anyone who has any prior knowledge of the Emily Rose possession and the happenings that surrounded her death. I'd even recommend this as a weaker companion piece to Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, as both contain stark moments of pain and horror, and both can help us tap into our religious selves.he end of the movie, when all the facts are in place, you can't help but have a feeling of despair, both for Father Moore and for Emily Rose, as both of their separate endings were and are inevitable.

B00005JOQ9|2.0|Poor Bratislava and Slovakia, talk about a place getting bad treatment from the movie industry. First it gets \\"armpit of the world treatment\\" in \\"Eurotrip\\", then it gets portrayed as the center of private enterprise torture in \\"Hostel\\". I saw \\"Hostel\\" on impulse (seeing Tarentino's name after the film title on the theater's list of show-times) without realizing it was the actually the brainchild of Eli Roth, who apparently intended it as a homage to Takashi Miike's \\"Audition\\". It is a slight improvement on Roth's boring first movie, \\"Cabin Fever\\". Although neither movie (Roth's stuff does not rise to the level of an actual film) is even remotely scary, at least with \\"Hostel\\" Roth keeps his tendency toward \\"Evil Dead\\" silliness in check until the last few minutes.    Anyway the first half of the film is pretty much a replay of \\"Eurotrip's\\" Amsterdam and train travel scenes, including the funny pervert in the train compartment. I found myself wishing very early in the movie that the three guys were traveling with Michelle Trachtenberg. This wish intensified during the sauna scene in the hostel where the only exploitation elements were a skanky Russian blonde and her fat slug-like friend. The movie would certainly have benefited visually from Trachtenberg's presence.     Anyway the three guys arrive in Bratislava and Roth slowly reveals that it is the home ground of a club that provides its members with people to torture and kill (watch 2002's \\"My Little Eye\\" if you think Roth might actually be doing something original). At this point the thing starts to look a lot more like \\"Toolbox Murders\\" than \\"Audition\\" and I began to yearn for an appearance by Angela Bettis. But instead Roth gives us a confused Asian girl who can't speak English very well.    Fortunately or unfortunately you never actually identify with those being tortured. But there is at least a point to all the torture as it gives the hero a reason to inflict ultra-violence once the tables are turned and theaudience an excuse to mildly cheer from that point until the movie itself thankfully expires. There was no audience applause at the end as everyone was in a hurry to get out and have some BBQ down the street.    To make matters worse for the Slovakia Ministry of Tourism, the one thing Roth manages to do very well is to convey the isolation felt by a tourist in a strange place and the target on the back of Americans in foreign countries these days. Given our image in the eyes of the world these days if such a torture business did exist it is likely that American victims would be in great demand and would command a healthy price premium. There are not just corrupt police but a gang of street urchins who extort gum and candy from visitors.    \\"Hostel's\\" wide theatrical release and $18 Million marketing campaign (verses just $4 Million production cost) pay homage to P.T. Barnum's comment: \\"No one every went broke 'underestimating' the intelligence of the American people\\". There is little danger that Roth will ever be mistaken for David Cronenberg. Save your money for the \\"Saw II\\" DVD.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B00005JOIF|4.0|Steven Spielberg could have made a film about the vengeance sought and claimed by Israel for the kidnapping/murder of 11 of their Olympic athletes wherein the avengers are implacable, remorseless, stalwart and unaffected by their actions, and their quarry could have been one dimensional comic book villains with scarves and snarls, and each killing a glorified and audience- pleasing vicarious thrill.  In short, he could have made a Chuck Norris movie.     But Spielberg was after something different, a film that is not only a tense thriller, but also explores more fully dimensional characters and what the effects of this type of violence has on the participants. Going beyond a simple revenge plot shoot-em-up required courage and I applaud that.  But delving deeper has the result of making more obvious the strengths and weaknesses of such an exercise.    Surely it is no stretch of the imagination to believe that the men carrying out such a mission, which by its nature must be cold-blooded, would be affected by their actions over time.  They are being good soldiers, true, but this is off the battlefield, and by definition does not allow passion and fervor to rule.  Believing or even knowing your actions are righteous, to carry out executions in the form of calculated murder would wear on any men, lest they be monsters.     The greatest strength of the film is in depicting the difficulty faced by some of the team in doing close-up, face-to-face killing.  Spielberg shows us the nasty, brutal horror of violent death, even when \\"deserved\\".  There are no Rambo-like happy explosions or shootings.  Human beings are being killed, and even if they are bad and guilty of their own heinous crimes, their deaths aren't pretty.  Even when the act seems justified, neither his characters nor we, the audience, are allowed to bask in self-righteousness about the sordid death of another bad player.  It just isn't that simple.    But having raised the question about the consequences of setting out on a path of well-motivated vengeance and the cycle of violence it may engender, Spielberg runs into trouble providing any alternatives or answers.  What else could Israel have done?  Ignore the murder of their athletes?  How do you successfully counter implacable and unremitting hatred directed at you?  Can you afford the luxury of trying to \\"understand\\" someone who wants to kill you? Or is the cycle of violence and revenge inevitable until both sides exhaust themselves?  These are questions that face this nation today, and I don't know the answer and neither does Steven.    In the end when Avner says to Ephraim \\"Why not arrest them, like Eichmann?\\" It is a pathetic answer to these disturbing questions. The Eichmann kidnapping to Israel was a one-of-a-kind operation, and possible because he thought he was safe and hidden. Against Black September, it would have been nearly impossible, and even possibly more violent. Having watched the Germans casually release the 3 Olympic terrorists they held to end another hijacking, I doubt trust in jail terms would be high on the agenda. Hell, the Olympic athletes were taken hostage and eventually murdered over the demand for release of Palestinian prisoners already in Israeli jails!     At any rate, I find this film admirable for its depiction of the soul-numbing result of violence, even violence you can justify.  That Spielberg and Tony Kushner get a bit lost in trying to achieve an over-arching theme or resolution to this dilemma is not surprising, as this is the problem of our age and every age that went before us.  If the only answer to a violent act is an even more violent response, and it may well be, than the human race has a long and sorrowful future ahead of us.  This is not a political opinion, this is a cry from the heart.
0307276902|5.0|Jameson Thottam reviewing A Million Little Pieces <br /> <br />I stumbled across this book completely by accident, but the bright blue cover with a candy coated hand on it caught my eye. I very rarely find the chance to do recreational reading, but this book was begging to be read. I very rarely read, but this book was screaming out to me. I read all 380 some odd pages in two days. I just could not put it down. I even wrote my final literature paper in school about this book. <br /> <br />A Million Little Pieces is actually a memoir (auto-biography), which is hard to believe after reading it. The highs seem so high and the lows are definitely lower than any that I have ever had. The majority of the story takes place in a Minnesota drug and alcohol treatment center where James Frey is trying to overcome his addiction to crack and alcohol. The people he comes into contact with there are incredibly interesting. Frey goes very in depth with describing most of his characters so you build a strong bond with all of them. I could not help but to like Frey for wanting to go against the norm (twelve-step programs) and to overcome his addiction in his own way.  <br /> <br />Eventful to say the least: James Thottam <br />For the majority of the story to be set in a rehab clinic, it is very eventful. There are many gruesome scenes, but they are only detailed enough to be interesting, not sickening and I have a very weak stomach. There is even a love story woven in. A tragic forbidden love found in a drug treatment center; doesn't that sound promising? The whole story builds up until almost the very last sentence of the book (do not look at the last page, it shows where everyone ended up and it would ruin the book for you). The end of the story is shocking and reading where everyone is now is almost like reading where everyone you went to school is now. <br /> <br />Multiple Appeals: Jameson Thottam <br />I think both men and women would love this book. It probably would be better for younger readers (20s-30s). There are drug addicts, prostitutes... it's a modern day adventure story. There is way too much graphic material to let your kids read this book; you would not even want to have to answer the questions they would ask after reading it. <br /> <br />Inspirational: Jameson Thottam <br />This is a great inspirational story. I think it definitely has the potential to help other people in the same situation. As for people who are not in that position, it is still a great story that may make you sit back and appreciate things in your life more.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam
0307263118|4.0|Max Mordon is an aging art specialist who is reeling over the death of his wife Anna from cancer. He books himself into a cozy seaside resort on the windswept Irish Coast, hoping that he can somehow reconnect with his past. Deeply affected and distressed by Anna's quick illness and subsequent decline, Max is in dire need of consolation. His dutiful and kindly daughter, Claire wants him to come and live with her, but the grieving Max prefers the all-encompassing isolation of the house by the sea. <br /> <br />The boarding house is called The Cedars and is and managed by the enigmatic and capricious Miss Vavasour. It is here where Max recounts his childhood friendship with the socially well-to-do family, the Graces. The Graces not only changed his life, but also provided his first two definitive adolescent crushes. As Max spends his days in the company of the crusty old Colonial - a fellow aging widower, he steadily ruminates, intermingling episodes from the remote and recent past.  <br /> <br />In fact, Max seems to be living in the past, and is constantly haunted by the memory of how things once were. Perhaps by staying at The Cedars - his room here, the only possible refuge for him - will enable him to recapture perhaps some of his time as a boy. But Max is shocked by the state of the lodging house, and is surprised that it has retained little of the past, of \\"the part of the past that he knew.\\"  He had hoped for something more definite of the Graces, but now there's nothing, where \\"so many of the living passing through have all worn away all traces of the dead.\\"  <br /> <br />Gradually the memories return, of his yearning for a connection with Mrs. Grace and his furtive, unsure couplings with Chloe, and his stoic friendship with Chloe's twin brother Myles. A child of meager means, the result of a father who abruptly deserted him, and a mother who was forced to find menial work where she could, Max is absolutely mesmerized by the Grace family; he sees them almost as gods and even gives them a mythical status, they had a motorcar and stayed in a big house, while he and his parents rented a chalet.   <br /> <br />But as Max broods on his ghosts - his troubled relationship with his parents, the illness of his wife, and his enigmatic relationship with the Graces - he succumbs to \\"paralyzed dismay\\" at what his life has become. Essentially a story about age, love, and loss, The Sea - like the ebb and flow of the ocean itself - is all about the coming of old age and the reconcilement of one's older life with one's youth. For Max, \\"so much of life was stillness then, when we were young, or so it seems now; a biding stillness; a vigilance.\\" <br /> <br />It's not as though Max is waiting to die, far from it, and although he's \\"grown corpulent and half-grey and almost old,\\" he still possesses feistiness and a savage will to live. When he thinks of the Graces, and especially of Chloe, it is as if he had stepped suddenly out of the dark. But with so much loss and grief Max ultimately finds solace in his past. He even admits that the past is such a retreat: \\"I go there eagerly, rubbing my hands and shaking off the cold present and the colder future.\\" <br /> <br />The prose is exquisite, the reader constantly assaulted with stunning images: \\"the seabirds rose and dived like torn scraps of rag, and a silent sea had now set up a vague tumult; water-beads break and fall in a silver string from the tip of oar.\\"  The sentences are languid, broad and poetic, forever mirroring the melancholic nature of the story.  <br /> <br />Full of mythical parallels, and artistic allusions, The Sea is all about one man's journey through memory and loss from puberty to adulthood, where the past and the present inevitably coalesce. Until Max can make sense of his feelings - work through the death of Anna, and come to terms with the tragedy of his childhood - he is perhaps a prisoner of his own memories. Max ultimately discovers that in this world of nostalgia, this land of his adolescence, there are more answers than he could have ever hoped to dream of. Mike Leonard January 06.  <br />
0671027387|1.0|Brown's success with The Da Vinci Code made his name. However not having read that book yet, I thought I'd try this one first. It is a cheap pastiche of (bad) science fiction, political machinations, and conspiracy. Exciting enough in a pulp fiction sense but far too much extreme heroism and contrived suspense.<br /><br />Having now read The Code, it by contrast deserves its popularity.

B000BRBA8S|3.0|Overlong, pretentious, and overstuffed with voice-overs and affected quotes, Wong Kar-wai's 2046 looks beautiful and is indeed sensuous, but the film is ultimately so muddled that most viewers will find themselves becoming lost in some kind of vague storytelling fog. The actors are all handsomely costumed and the art direction is gorgeous, but the story is so convoluted and mysterious, that the film ends up totally being off putting and really quite boring.  <br /> <br />In the claustrophobic world of 2046 the characters exist in a netherworld of dream and memory, holed up in tiny flats, narrow corridors, and small intimate restaurants. The film takes place in Hong Kong in the 1960's during a period of political instability, and everyone is dressed elegantly in '60s-style clothes and hairdos, cigarette smoke still curls in the air in imaginative patterns, and American pop music plays softly in the background. It's all very sophisticated and decadently arty.  <br /> <br />Tony Leung stars as Chow, a freelance writer who fanatically scribbles stories involving the hotel room 2046. A beautiful prostitute in whose company Chow keeps occupies room 2046, and as he movies into the room next door he becomes fixated with her. Also in his story, a passenger has boarded a train headed for 2046, where the hostess is an android who can never leave the train. The more Chow writes, the more the story delves into his past. <br /> <br />Bai Ling ((Ziyi Zhang) and Chow starting out as drinking buddies, the two wind up in a torrid romance. When his ardor predictably wanes, Bai Ling is devastated because she has fallen in love with him. She finally abandons the flat, but the two of them have connected not only physically but spiritually as well.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the landlord moved in his daughter (Faye Wong). She is too in love with her Japanese boyfriend (Takuya Kimura), of whom her father disapproves, to become more than a friend to the writer. He clearly longs for her, although he is haunted by Bai and also by the memory of Su (Gong Li). <br /> <br />The Asian actresses are absolutely gorgeous, but they all look the same, so it took me an hour to figure out who was who, and by then, I'd lost the thread of the story. But the actors are all fairly convincing and you really do believe that Chow - with his whisker of a mustache and his low rent sex appeal - is the type that would make the members of the opposite sex go weak at the knees. <br /> <br />But the major problem with 2046 is that it's just too arty and self conscious for its own good. Every scene is manicured and coloured to within an inch and breadth of its life - there's just so many gorgeous outfits glinting in the half-dark; so much creaseless ravishment in the high silk collar of a Chinese dress; so much whispery coiling tendrils of smoke, and so much artfully pouring rain that merely patters around the characters, not ever getting them wet. It all becomes rather tawdry and yawn inducing after a while.  <br /> <br />I guess 2046 is supposed to be about the importance of memory and purports to a future where humans are whizzing around super fast trains in gleaming cities heading for a place where they can recapture their memories. The middle of the movie has Chow sitting on a train that is staffed by exquisite female robots - he seems to be besotted with them as well. It's a visually exciting part of the film, and gorgeous to look at, but it's also the most boring part, and this conceit of android eroticism just doesn't sit well with the rest of the story. <br /> <br />I'm still not quite sure what exactly 2046 is supposed to be. It is the number of a hotel room which people have trouble leaving? Or is it a year in the future where part of the story is set? Or is it perhaps some kind of date? Or does it just exist in Chow's memories and writings? One thing is for sure, this movie moves so slowly that you'll swear that 2046 is also the number of minutes in the film's running length, by the end you'll feel like you have boarded Chow's train too, as you try to stay awake through this one.

B000006TRV|5.0|Fear, angst, alienation find a salve in Roger Waters' seminal work, The Wall. David Gilmour's vocals and guitar purify Waters' dark, bleak lyrical world, while Nick Mason's always-on percussion kick in the windows and smash in the doors of the oppressed and oppressors. Post-war disillusion and a domineering mother models Pink's childhood, and fosters isolation in subsequent intimate relationships. This is not background music but rather a soundtrack for those of us coming to terms with the post-industrial, post-patriarchal paradigm.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I just saw this movie at the theaters today. It left me with a lump in my throat. This movie was so real to me. No matter if you're gay, straight or whatever, when you're in love with someone you cannot have...it hurts. Without a doubt, the BEST movie i have ever seen recently.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|One of my favorite scenes in this movie happens to be at the end AFTER the credits.  It's (Napoleon's brother) Kip's wedding!!  I'm sure most people have missed this part because very few people sit through to the end of the credits.  Just like the rest of the movie, the wedding scene is hysterical and if you have missed it, then by all means go back and watch it again!!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Simply put, this album is a one of a kind listen, taking you through the state and history of Illinois. Steven's stories range from optomistic and exciting to dark, and sometimes even chilling. To portray these stories, he uses jazz, folk, and pop in ways that I have never heard before. This album is one of the most diverse and intriguing albums I've heard that was released after 2000. This album is definitely the best album of the year and one of the best albums since 1990. Just beautiful... it's not the songs, it's the album as a whole. It flows unimaginably well. Buy it now; and when you receive it, open it up, take it into the room with surround sound, dim the lights, and just take off. The trip will be incredible.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Point Break is not only a truly great action movie, but it is a realisation of everything a truly great movie should be in general. Johnny Utah is a new FBI agent fresh out of Quantico, ready for some action. He's \\"young, dumb, and full of cum\\", as his new FBI department chief Harp puts it so elegantly. Utah is teamed up with Agent Angelo Pappas, a genial, no-BS 19-year veteran of the Bureau who knows everything his bosses don't know about doing the job, not by the book, but the best way. Their boss, Agent Harp, doesn't like that, and doesn't much like anything else about Pappas, either, which soon becomes apparent to Utah. On their first case together, Utah and Pappas investigate the most recent bank robbery in L.A. by the notorious \\"Dead Presidents\\", a gang of four bank robbers who don masks of Reagan, Carter, Johnson and Nixon during their armed capers. Utah then learns Pappas' theory regarding the Dead Presidents: \\"The Dead Presidents....are SURFERS.\\" Maybe not a revelation of historic significance at first to Utah, but this small detail is what makes the film so compelling, in the end, the stuff that is the meat of the action; the story revolves around the world of surfing, with all the tremendous beauty and power of the ocean, the concurrent mysticism and physicality of the sport, and the language, culture, and traditions of its adherents. Utah quickly makes friends with a local surfer girl, Tyler (Lori Petty), as a way to gain entry into the surfing clique, who teaches him some of the basics of the sport. It turns out that Tyler is a friend of surfing legend and spiritual guru Bodhi (Patrick Swayze, in a tour de force performance), who not only sees his sport as a pathway to enlightenment, but sees life itself as a higher calling to be experienced to the pinnacle of every activity. Bodhi quickly sees the \\"kamikaze look\\" in Utah, who he recognizes as the former All-Big Ten quarterback from Ohio State. They are kindred spirits. Bodhi brings Utah under his wing, initially unaware that Utah is an FBI agent, and they set out as part of Bodhi's surfer-cum-extraordinary gentleman's club on various daredevil adrenaline trips such as skydiving into the sea, surfing at dusk and wild beach parties. All this is great, for sure, except Utah eventually realizes that his new best friend is actually the head of the Dead Presidents. That's when things really heat up. First is a seat-of-your-pants chase through what looks like South Central L.A. after Utah and Pappas break up the Presidents' latest bank heist. As the truth comes out, Bodhi controls Utah by threatening Tyler, who it turns out is Bodhi's former girlfriend, but who Utah is now in love with. When Tyler is kidnapped by Bodhi's gang, Utah is forced to become one of the Dead Presidents. Utah robs a bank with them, bystanders get killed--knocking it up to murder one--and then they end up in Mexico, where Tyler is finally freed--but not before Bodhi makes a dramatic getaway. The only clue Utah still has is that Bodhi must eventually get to Australia's Bell's Beach within a year to fulfill his spiritual destiny and catch the 50-Year Storm, a weather pattern which yields 200-ft high waves and the penultimate challenge for big-wave surfers. It seems that at least one of our two protagonists, Bodhi or Utah, will not survive and walk away from this storm. But that is part of the beauty of it all, is it not? Point Break is just about the most compelling action film you could ever wish for, especially if you are one of those coinosseurs who demands that a movie is both pretty to look at but also philosophically profound. Patrick Swayze's Bodhi brings a new meaning to the concept of hero-villain, by also making him somewhat of a prophet or seer at the same time. There's no doubt that you'll like what you see here. In addition to stunning surfing photography, the film achieves a certain zen flow which builds up to a definite crescendo towards the end. It's not enough for Bodhi to achievegreatness, on the ocean and in the mind, he must transcend our soul-robbing society and the law itself, and ultimately conquer death. He'll either succeed or fail, and obviously perhaps die trying, but either way, Point Break looks really good.greatness, on the ocean and in the mind, he must transcend our soul-robbing society and the law itself, and ultimately conquer death.

0192804782|4.0|SENSE AND SENSIBILITY chronicles the young lives of two sisters, spirited Marianne and the more stable Elinor.  After being driven away from home by their step-brother and his wife, the Dashwood family (Mrs. Dashwood, Marianne, Elinor, and younger sister Margaret) settles down in a small cottage in the countryside.<br /><br />Each sister proceeds to fall in love in her unique way: Elinor quietly and seriously loves somewhat-awkward Edward, while Marianne impetuously and passionately gives her heart to the dashing Willoughby.  As with most of Austen's works, disparity in social class and inconsistencies in personality cause the lovers turmoil.<br /><br />Austen uses some of the satirical techniques that are so prevalent of her other works.  While not as funny as her other satires, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY presents some characters' absurdities quite well.<br /><br />When I read this at the age of 14 or so, I did not enjoy it nearly as much.  Older readers will like the subtle humor that Austen invariably includes in her work.<br /><br />Overall, a good introduction to the classic work of Jane Austen.

B000002UAU|5.0|With Revolver, the Beatles made the Great Leap Forward, reaching a previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation. Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock & roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian \\"When I'm 64\\" seems like a logical extension of \\"Within You Without You\\" and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of \\"Lovely Rita.\\" There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish,  la \\"Help!\\"; \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of \\"A Day in the Life,\\" a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon's verse and chorus with McCartney's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here

It is totally worthless (except maybe as kindling). <br />Also, the author goes on, and on, and on ranting about poor grammar.  I got the point at about page ten.  The rest of the book was a little (note the extreme sarcasm) redundant!
B00005JOFO|3.0|I wanted to like this movie more than I did.  Based on a story by a great author, great actors, a renowned director and great reviews should equal a great movie experience, but I'm conflicted.  My biggest complaint about the movie is the relationship between the two main characters- to me if feels like it comes out of left field.  I have no sense for why these two men fall in love and spend the next 20 years meeting up, outside of the physical aspect of their relationship.  What is it that they see in each other, other than the fact that they are gay men living closeted lives?  I feel much more sympathetic towards Ennis' wife.  When she finds out about the relationship, it is heartbreaking.  Watching Michelle Williams play her suffering through this reality for years is the true great performance in this movie.  In the end, I felt Jack's love for Ennis more than the other way around.  Even the final scene does nothing to convince me of the magnitude Ennis' loss.  Despite my reservations over the authenticity of the love story, the movie is beautiful and there are great performances from the actors.  I did find myself thinking about the movie for days afterward, which is a sign of a good movie to me.  I just wish I had \\"felt the love\\".
B00000ILDF|3.0|Alien was a great horror film.  Aliens was a great action film.  Alien 3 is just an okay film.  Ripley is a great character and the one that Sigourney Weaver will be always remembered.  But this round the plot felt like it was already outdated.  The one thing is Weaver knows Ripley better than the writer and makes the character three dimensional.  Unfortunately, that is the only thing in this film that is three dimentional. <br /> <br />If you liked Alien and Aliens, you probably will want this to get this film and Alien Resurection to have the entire set.  But as a stand alone, pass on this and go for one of the first two.

But I never go with Hype, I never even know what is the hype because it just doesn't interest me. I heard my Friend playing this album the first time I heard it. I was instantly hooked. Yes, they borrow from the seventies and whatever. Yes it is not a NEW sound as per say like the over analytical and feeble review of someone who proclaims ROCK is DEAD, who cares. The music is good, in the end that is all that matters. Their wouldn't be Weezer without the Pixies, there Wouldn't The killers wihtout the Cure, who cares... the music is good and they are not copying, just working with what they love and what we love to hear. Hating something because it is the Hype is no better then liking it because it is the Hype, form your own opinion without having your judgement clouded by the outside world
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Set during the cvil wars in Japan in the 1570s, it's about a man (played by Tatsuya Nakadai) who will be pardoned from execution if he will assume the double (shadow = Kagemusha) of a slain clan lord in order to maintain order within the clan and fear in the eyes of the enemy. The shadow, reluctant at first in his new role, becomes the \\"soul\\" of the lord he's replaced, but he's eventually discovered and banished, and the clan is soon defeated.<br /><br />Directed by Kurosawa, the movie is an interesting exploration of expectations and leadership. The color photography is exquisite, and the battle scenes - a Kurosawa specialty - are awesome: they are so huge in scope (the cast is enormous) and thrilling in execution that they almost wear us out just watching them. Long at 3 hours, the movie never drags.
0783231202|3.0|What Spielberg did for the Holocaust in Schindler's List, and WWII in Saving Private Ryan, he did with our terrible past of slavery in Amistad. While this movie was not hailed by critics far and wide, and was actually considered unsuccessful, those who understand what truly makes a movie and a beautiful story will see the power of Amistad. As usual, the directing is emotional and heart-wrenching and the cinematography is beautiful. The acting on all accounts is wonderful and captivates the essence of the time. The actual story of the Amistad, slavery, and the personal view through Cinque is powerfully moving. This is a movie not to be missed that pack an emotional punch for any who watch it. But do not expect much action. It is purely drama, and the story's power lies in the words, expressions, and actions of the actors who make it up. It will really make you think. Truly one of the most beautiful movies I've seen, once again, Spielberg has proved himself to be the master of putting the human spirit on the silver screen.

B000063DI9|5.0|This cd is a masterpiece and deserves to be at the top of your shelf! Besides having the same type of guitar, bass, drum, and vocals, Maiden added a little something different to this bad boy... Keyboards/Synthesizers! Dont be alarmed. The keyboards dont drown out the most important stuff in the songs and there only on a few of the songs, played in the intros, or way in the background. It still sounds sweet nonetheless and I'm glad Maiden stepped out of the box and changed it up a little bit. Thats always a sign of creativity and thats sweet in a metal band! Anyway, here's the lowdown on this sweet album!<br /><br />Moonchild: A great opener, with a great keyboard intro, and a cool dialogue from Bruce to start off the album! Its a sweet, fast-paced song that will leave you screaming Moonchild! Its a well-rounded song with good drums, heavy riffs, and off-course Maiden's trademark solos! 8.5-9/10<br /><br />Infinite Dreams: Depending where you look, this song couldn't or could be a greatest hit! In my book, its the latter! This song is so awesome and the lyrics are mezmerizing! I love the solos and the creative drum parts. 9.5/10 Easily!!<br /><br />Can I Play With Madness?: This greatest hit is one of my favorites on the cd! The chorus is sweet and the guitar riffs are really catchy. Try and pick up the sweet keyboard background on the chorus! 10/10<br /><br />Evil That Men Do: The sweet intro kicks off the song, and it gallops on to the grand finish! No seriously, the drums do sound like galloping horses through the verses. No matter; It sounds insanely cool anyway and the chorus is to die for! Definetly a greatest hit! 9.5/10<br /><br />Seventh Son Of a Seventh Son: The title track, the 9-minute plus song on the cd, and one that will last in your hearts for years to come. Yes, its one of those maiden songs that, no matter how long it is, you never want to stop listening to it! Everything is creative and its not repititive the least! 10/10<br /><br />The Prophesy: This intro is one of the sweetest intros on the cd! It builds into a nice rythym and a sweet solo! I will admit that no matter how hard I try, I can never keep from laughing at the chorus. It sounds really kiddie and Bruce's words overlap each other, but thats just me! 8.5/10<br /><br />Clairvoyant: No matter what anyone says, this is my favorite song on this cd and top 10 of all Maiden songs! The opening bass solo is kick  and the chorus is just plain awesome! Listen for the out-of-the box solo like riffs during the chorus!! 11/10<br /><br />Only the Good Die Young: A great way to end the album and what a song! The chorus is really meaningful and the guitar licks are out of this world! It starts off with a faster pace and never lets up!

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Before anyone reads further, I would like to say that I am a hardcore fan of Tool, which was partly why I bought this CD. For everyone out there who says that there is a massive Schism (yes, the pun was intended) between Tool fans and A Perfect Circle fans, I suppose I am the rebel to the rule. I have read so many reviews by Tool fan's being let down by this album, it's sickening. So many Intolerant (once again, pun intended) Tool fans bash this because it's not Tool. My response is \\"Read the artists name! Does it say Tool?\\" Either way, I enjoy both bands immensely. As I stated before, I purchased Thirteenth Step mainly because I'm a fan of Maynard and Tool, so my expectations were completely defied. And I am so happy that they were. <br /> <br />Time for an in-depth dive to look at the songs: <br /> <br />1. The Package: It's a little slow at the beginning, but it gets better as it continues. There is some sweet guitar in this one and Maynard presents some nice vocals. Nearly the end, it gets rather heavy, too. 8 out of 10, simply because it lags in the beginning. <br /> <br />2. Weak and Powerless: A pretty cool beginning, nice chorus. From the title, you'd expect something depressing, but the music doesn't want to follow that trend. This is a very good song, too. 9 of 10 <br /> <br />3. The Noose: It's a relatively slow song, but slowly becomes louder and heavier. It's another nice song with Maynard's touching vocals. There is a prefect fusion between the music and the vocals in this song, so I have to rate it nicely. 10 of 10 <br /> <br />4. Blue: I absolutely fell in love with this song, probably because it reminded me a lot of my girlfriend. But that aside, it's an impressive song. It's as close to a love song as I've ever heard Maynard and he does an incredible job at it. It's a predominantly percussive song, which also forces me to give a biased rating. 10 of 10 <br /> <br />5. Vanishing: Bass guitar Heaven, which is why I enjoyed this song very much. Not much to say in the area of lyrics, it's mostly devoid of them. There are short spats every once in a while. It's a song that must be appreciated for its music rather than its lyrics, though the few lyrics that arise are quite beautiful. 9 of 10 <br /> <br />6. A Stranger: This song is... well... it just never clicked with me. The vocals are, as usual, outstanding, though. 7 of 10 <br /> <br />7. The Outsider: As a Tool fan, I obviously loved this song. It is also the first song I heard from this band (or at least the first one I remember). This was what I expected all the other songs to be like. It's heavy, it's dark, and it's wonderful. The message is a very good one, too, so I have to give A Perfect Circle some credit for that. 10 of 10 <br /> <br />8. Crimes: This reminded me of Tool's \\"spacer tracks\\" on nima. Very few vocals, very straightforward music. Not really worth listening to unless you need to teach someone how to count to ten. 5 of 10 <br /> <br />9. The Nurse Who Loved Me: This is an odd song. It's funny yet thought-provoking, it's weird yet normal, it's interesting, and it's new yet old at the same time. It's Maynard in song form! I loved the music in the song; the lyrics were just a silly bonus. Very nice violins in it. 8 of 10 <br /> <br />10. Pet: This one is similar to Track 7, thus I loved it. It's haunting and dark, but compelling. Maynard uses a myriad of different voices in this one, too. It's a Maynard sampler. It's got a very addictive beat, also. 10 of 10 <br /> <br />11. Lullaby: Eh... this is almost like Crimes, except there is some impressive vocal manipulation that turns Maynard's voice into an instrument. It's still more like an extension of Pet than a different song. 6 of 10 <br /> <br />12. Gravity: I like this song. It's slow, but catching. Makes you think, too. 9 of 10 <br /> <br />13th Step: This stands for the album as a whole; it's not a song, so nobody freak out. The overall grade, excluding the \\"spacer tracks\\" comes out to a be9, which equals 4.5 stars, which rounds up to the five stars you saw at the top of the review. <br /> <br />A Perfect Circle isn't anything like Tool, to my relief. I love Tool, but it's supposed to be a deviant. In this sense, the two bands are similar. A Perfect Circle isn't organic, commercial rock music. It's its own unique genre of music: usually quiet, astoundingly beautiful, relaxing and inspiring. Like Tool, it is for the thinking man, I belief. Most people probably can't draw many parallels, but there are countless ones. The music in A Perfect Circle is a being within itself, separate from the vocals, but both the vocals and music are made up of several layers. Everything flows together perfectly. <br /> <br />For any Tool fans out there: This is not Tool. This is a completely different band with a completely different style. If you want more Tool, wait until Spring 2006 (or so I'm told the new Tool album is coming out). If you want to experience more of Maynard's gorgeous vocals, more engaging musicianship, and more thought-provoking lyrics, I suggest you give this album a try. Don't expect them to be the same. I love both of them in different ways for different reasons. I'm not guaranteeing that you'll like this band, but it's worth a try. <br />
0316172324|4.0|Do you believe that your snap decisions are better than those you worry about, mull over, and even lose sleep over? Malcolm Gladwell does, and this book is his defence of that idea.  <br /> <br />Gladwell is a superb writer, and even if you find yourself questioning some of his evidence, you will learn a lot from \\"Blink.\\" He has amassed material from a huge range of sources to give you insights into police work, art fraud, speed-dating, firefighting, classical music, marriage counselling ... the list is enormous. The author's gift is finding a common element in seemingly unrelated areas, as he did so effectively in his previous best-seller, \\"The Tipping Point.\\" In \\"Blink,\\" that common element is that people make better decisions, he believes, if they follow their intuition and decide quickly, rather than weighing up every facet of a problem and taking a long time to decide. <br /> <br />I largely agree with his theory. But the reason it works may be that most of the examples he gives are of people who know their subject inside out because they have had so much experience or training in it. His first example tells how an art fakebuster felt there was a problem with an ancient sculpture that a museum was considering buying. All the tests showed the sculpture was ancient, but the fakebuster's first hunch that it was a fraud turned out to be right. I suspect it was not so much the snap decision that was the key, but the years of experience in art fraud the fakebuster's subconscious was relying on. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this is an interesting book. Not quite up to \\"The Tipping Point\\" standard, but well worth reading anyway. If it does nothing else, it will probably convince you that faster decisions are at least no worse than slow decisions. And that will save you time and stress.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've been pretty much listening to madonna'a music since grade school, and without a doubt madonna has become a music ICON and inspiration to singers like britney spears. It's amazing that she is still making music... after all these years filled with controversy. publicity, and criticism, and yet she always held her head up high, and just doing what she wanted (see madonna truth or dare) I have pretty much listened and own every madonna album.. and  always enjoyed her catchy songs that had alot of meaning. She still is beautiful and will always have what many singers/songwriters wont...... originality. <br /> <br />I heard samples of confessions on a dance floor, and it sounded great to me even though the clips were short, so i bought the cd on amazon, with expedited shipping. I wanted to listen to this album a little at a time, but as i began to listen to it, i was already on track 6..... and was obviously enjoying it... so i finished it and was all sweaty. (whenever i listen to an album i love and when i'm spiritually connected to the music. i get chills and i sweat, but it's almost like meditation, because alot of the songs were mellow and relaxing and had beautiful rhythms, like soft techno but with singing. Also there are the tracks that are upbeat and you can definately dance to. I give this cd 5 stars, among my fav's are hung up, sorry, let it will be, and forbidden love. In fact one track made me a bit sad because i was relating to the words...... in \\"jump\\" which is about making changes in your life, and stop wasting time, and how you feel like you're stuck but all you have to do is go for it.. but also when she was singing jump hold my hand. previously i was thinking of suicide but that came from my life of misery and abuse, and losing everyone i cared about, and sometimes you think of just giving up.... but then the words were inspiring..... like \\"i wanna get a place of my own\\" and boy do i ever..... cuz i still live with my old man and annoying obnoxiousverbally abusive brother. But like the song said, i can choose to leave and take a different path. And the song really hit me hard. I guess what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I'm still here. But enough about that.  <br /> <br />I've always been a fan of madonna, and she (like me) doesn't care what others think and she has always had a wild freakish side and has done some pretty crazy things over the years, so i always think of her as a one of a kind woman who has been an inspiration to women to just be themselves, be true, and be real.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|This movie was so boring. I do have to agree with some of the other people who reviewed this movie, the beginning was good, but the rest was terrible. I watched the first hour and fifteen minutes, and then i shut it off because I was about to cry on how dumb this movie was. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because there are millions of better movies out there. My friend is in love with this movie, and she wants sequals made. LISTEN DIRECTORS: THIS MOVIE WAS A PIECE OF TRASH, AND IF FOR SOME LUDACRIS REASON U DID MAKE SEQUALS, THEY WOULD BE JUST AS BAD, IF NOT WORSE, THAN THIS ONE!. I would much rather stick my finger through my eye, and swirl my brain around than have to sit through the first hour of this movie. SKIP THIS MOVIE, EXTREMELY BORING!
0679422714|2.0|I finished reading &lt;u>Mao, the Untold Story&lt;/u> by Jung Chang and John Halliday last night.  I think the title of the book should have been &lt;u>&lt;strong>Mao, The Fragrant Fart&lt;/strong>&lt;/u>. <br /> <br />After reading how Mao &lt;strong>never&lt;/strong> took a bath or brushed his teeth during his rule of terror in China, and also how he himself loved to used digestive analogies, especially those relating to breaking wind, to illustrate everything from domestic policy to how he felt about his family, \\"untold story\\" just does not do him or his life justice. <br /> <br />Has there ever been a more evil person to walk the planet?  More selfish?  More responsible for death, destruction, and loss? <br /> <br />I used to think Bill Clinton was the standard for corruption. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I am convinced President Clinton was a bit player in the tyranny model of leadership.  What are a couple hundred &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">political murders&lt;/a> compared to the 70 million Mao is responsible for?  <br /> <br />With those in the chinese government willing to stop him either imprisoned or murdered, Mao was able to live out his sad, sorry life to the end and died of natural causes. <br /> <br />This book answered so many questions.  Who started the Korean War? Mao.  Why did the Soviets split with China?  Who funded Pol Pot, Che, and all the other communist players? Mao.  Who ruined Tibet?  Mao. <br /> <br />Any country who received aid from China, either food or money, owes the Chinese people an apology for what this aid cost them.  Millions of lives were lost while Mao threw money at various communist causes all over the world. <br /> <br />One of the most surprising facts of this book was that Mao was NOT a die hard Marxist.  He used communist ideology to spread his personality cult, but to say that he was a good ideological \\"comrade\\"  is a lie. He was a hedonist who simply wanted to read books, eat good food, and have sex with whomever he chose. <br /> <br />As a husband and father Mao was a complete failure.  His four wives lived unhappy lives, and most of his children died in infancy because of him neglecting to provide properly for his family.  His absolute focus on his military goals and lack of natural affection for wives and children ruined not only his own family life, but the families of most of China, especially the peasantry. <br /> <br />I read this book in a weeks time simply because I could not put it down.  The text is very easy to follow.  It is a must read.  If you truly want to understand China today, and if you would like to help in spreading Democracy and Freedom in our world, this book is crucial for understanding the true history of the 20th century. <br /> <br />It is time for the Chinese people to throw off the fetters that bind them in the personality cult of Mao.  When His ugly face is taken off of their currency, when all the pictures are torn down, and when the truth is shouted from the housetops, (and this book is allowed to be published and freely read in China) then that terrorized people will begin to reclaim their sovereignty. <br /> <br />The people of China deserve nothing less from the west that being encouraged to set up a government that lives by the Rule of Law, Property Rights, Individual Rights, Constitutional Democracy, and Separation of Powers.   <br /> <br />The families of China should be allowed to have as many children as they desire, and be given the gift of the pursuit of happiness as the object and end of their existence. <br /> <br /> <br />Thankyou Jung and Jon for taking the time and effort to write this exellent expose.  I predict in future generations that \\"Mao\\" will replace the word \\"Hitler\\" as the standard of who and what is evil. <br /> <br />Go get the book today, read it, and weep for the people of China and for all of those who suffered because of one evil man.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">Jenny Hatch&lt;/a>uralFamilyCo.com\\">Jenny Hatch&lt;/a>

B00092ZL80|5.0|Check it OUT~! I purchased this live DVD to watch Chicago take over Los Angeles. I had been to several Chicago concerts through the years and was wondering if Chicago could still reach the high notes.<br /><br />I have never seen such a pumped-up session by Chicago until they performed with Earth, Wind and Fire. I could see that the baby boom generation (yep, that's me) in the audience were trying to keep up with Chicago and EWF. Bill Champlin and Jason Scheff struggled on many notes, but they looked happy as ever while performing. It was worth every penny to watch them. Jimmy Pankow and the horns, and Tris Imboden and the percussion, gave tremendous performances. My highest accolade goes to Robert Lamm when he comfortably sang `with soul' \\"Does Anyone Know What Time It Is\\" with full support from my leading man Verdine White and EWF.<br /><br />Step it OUT~! I had only heard of Earth, Wind and Fire. The closest I got to their music was hearing the Tomorrow Land Band at Disneyland play the tune \\"Let's Groove\\" through the years. I also didn't realize I was that old. :(<br /><br />The first person I could not avoid from the beginning to the end of the DVD was Verdine White. I stared at disbelief at this absolutely crazed dancer. On the other hand, was he an absolutely crazed bass guitarist? OK, which is it? His attitude from the get-go was \\"We are the Greatest, You are the Greatest, let's Dance Together and be the Greatest Together!\\" He hypnotized me. :)<br /><br />Earth, Wind and Fire is one of the most talented bands in the World, at any level. The singing of Philip Bailey and Ralph Johnson is absolutely superb. I was dancing like an absolutely crazed fool on the couches, on the tables and on the walls of my living room (it can be done) trying to keep up with Verdine White. As I was gasping for air, I listened to all the hits of Earth, Wind and Fire for the first time in my life. Over and over again, this band performed each song with class, style and charm. The graceful and talented Ms. Krystal Bailey gave a wonderful performance while trying to maintain Verdine White (who am I kidding).<br /><br />BUY IT NOW~! You must buy this DVD. You will fly on Fire to the Windy city of Chicago for weeks after you get it. This is one of the most spectacular live performances on DVD. The ambience at the Greek Theatre with the combined sounds of both groups musically sharing their hits together was eclectic. Here is a secret. You have to see Verdine White shake it up with Robert Lamm and Philip Bailey when both groups play \\"September.\\" When you play this DVD at a party, there will be M A G I C in the room. Let's Groove Together and Don't Care What Time It Is with this DVD. Did I mention that Verdine White is one of the greatest performers in the World?

0553801503|3.0|At the bigning the Song of Ice and Fire was a master piece. A true epic saga that kept the readers attention from the first words till the end! Clever and full of good stories and charming caracters. Unfortunately the Feast for Crows didn't stand up to my expectations. It's just another endless-epic-S.fiction book. After 684 pages I found myself reading: :\\"Hey wait a minute!\\"Wher's Dany and the dragons? Where's Tyrion? We hardly saw Jon Snow. That can't be all of it\\"... I felt cheated. How is it possible that after all thoses pages the author says he didn't have pages enough to talk about them??? That the author had to slpit the book in 2 parts???.... :[ <br />And at the meam time we should be more than happy to read about Lady Brienne? Cersei? (mind that she didn't do anything new that you didn't already know that she wanted to do)? May be Fantasy books should be taken more seriously when written. This one seams just another one to make money and pay the bills!

B000BTJDGC|4.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is one of those rare modern-day horror films that actually thrills. Unlike most recent entries in the genre, the film does not rely on overdone violence and grotesque images to scare its audience. Instead, it uses story and atmosphere to create hysteria and mounting suspense. The film has a great story to tell, and it tells it well. <br /> <br />This is possibly the first horror film ever set mostly in a courtroom. The film chronicles the trial of a Catholic priest (Tom Wilkinson.) He is accused of negligence that resulted in the death of 19-year-old Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), whom he believed was possessed by demonic spirits.  <br /> <br />A lawyer (Laura Linney) whose star is rising takes the case at the behest of her boss. Unfortunately, he seems more interested in serving the interests of the local Catholic diocese than that of the client, who refuses to take a plea bargain because he wants to tell Emily's story in court and let the jury (and the audience) decide what really happened. <br /> <br />The possession and exorcism scenes all take place in flashback while various parties give their testimony. This technique allows the film to portray Emily's suffering a la' Rashomon, but with a significant difference: There is little disagreement about what actually happened to Emily. It is all a question of interpretation.  <br /> <br />By giving us the facts as seen through the eyes of the various characters, the film is asking the audience to be the jury that decides the case. All of the information that is provided is intentionally left out in the open for the viewers.  <br /> <br />The exorcism scenes are scary and creepy, but they are not of the pea soup-spewing kind. The film tries to ground itself in the reality believed in by the priest who is on trial for Emily's murder, so the horror is more psychological than grotesque.  <br /> <br />The courtroom aspect of the film may put off some horror fans, but I think it works extremely well and results in a great deal of tension and suspense, albeit very few, if any, surprises. <br /> <br />Structuring the story as a courtroom drama increases the horror because it takes place in a believable context. Whether you think Emily is sick or possessed, what happens to her is almost beyond endurance. Moreover, since the fate of the priest rests on the trial's outcome, it is clear that the horrific events in the story have dramatic consequences. What happens is part of a convincing story, not just a series of gratuitous special effects. <br /> <br />If anyone has seen the trailers for the film, they probably thought this was the sort of violent horror film I mentioned earlier. It is far from it. In fact, this is a very well-made thriller that has many suspenseful supernatural moments, and does not go for the cheap scares and predictability many audiences are used to. <br /> <br />The trailer is obviously designed to draw in the cheesy horror fans, but there is something more intelligent in this film and most of them will be bored, disappointed, or both. <br /> <br />The performances in the film are top-notch, with Wilkinson's turn as the exposed priest is heartbreaking, while Linney and Campbell Scott are fantastic as dueling lawyers. The real standout is Jennifer Carpenter (\\"White Chicks\\"), who plays Emily Rose. She has quite a bit of silent screen time and pulls it off well without \\"demon\\" makeup,\\" just contorted faces, uncomfortable postures and nerve-shattering screams. She is creepy, yet vulnerable. She is scary yet innocent. She gave an amazing performance. <br /> <br />Although the credits claim that the film is \\"based on a true story,\\" there seems to be just a bare fragment of truth in its script. Before the end credits, a title card tells us that the priest involved with the story cooperated with an author who wrote the book that served as the basis for the film. Screenwriters Scott Derrickson (who also directed) and Paul Harris Boardman purchased the rights, but neither the book nor the author are credited.  <br /> <br />The book is in fact \\"The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel,\\" and the only point of similarity between the actual events and the film is that a young woman dies during an exorcism and that the priest is put on trial for negligent homicide. It seems clear that in the actual case, the young woman's death did result from negligence. She died from malnutrition after undergoing a series of exorcisms for months. <br /> <br />\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is definitely a film worth seeing. It may not be fast-paced enough for some horror fans and a little rough for others because of the subject matter, but it is certainly a fascinating film presented with dignity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001FS3|5.0|There's so much I could say about this outstanding, landmark album, but suffice it to say it was my favorite during my high school years. I can still remember singing \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" at the top of my lungs driving down the road with the top down, goosebumps rolling up and down my spine all the while. Although I had little idea of the background of the songs, the overriding themes of spiritual, political and personal angst clearly came through for me at a time when my eyes were opening to these issues. <br /> <br />Contrary to what many other reviewers may think of this album, I love the more \\"obscure\\" cuts the best. \\"One Tree Hill\\", \\"Mining Town\\",\\"Gods Country\\" and \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" exemplify some of Bono's best poetic lyrics, on par with UFire and Promenade. <br /> <br />Along with Achtung Baby, IMO this album is the one to get if you're a newcomer to the wonderful world of U2. If you are, welcome! Buy this CD, and enjoy!

B000002J09|5.0|Yes, this album as you know is very overated, and is very overplayed. But the whole album in itself is a classic album among the Led Zeppelin catalogue. <br /> <br /> <br />The following ratings are based on how good the songs are after being very overplayed and overated. And how they compare to every other led zeppeling song out there. The ratings dont reflect how good the songs actually are, but how a true led zeppelin fan who has listen to all led zep's stuff would rate each song so dont be mad at my ratings: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />1. 7/10 <br /> <br />2. 5/10 <br /> <br />3. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. 10/10 OVERPLAYED, and OVERATED BUT STILL DOESN'T RUIN ITS RATING <br /> <br />5. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. 2/10 JUST NOT A GOOD SONG AT ALL, QUITE ANNOYING <br /> <br />7. 10/10 BEAUTIFUL SONG <br /> <br />8. 10/10 LAYED BACK ROCKING <br /> <br /> <br />For those of you who are doubting my reviews YOU ARE WRONG! I know your probably thinking to yourself this guy doesnt know what hes talking about. YOUR STILL WRONG. If you agree with me you probably have listened to pretty much all led zep's stuff and good for you! And for the people who disagree........you still have a lot to listen to before you even talk about led zeppelin to me or anyone else.Anyway i got a little carried away there. This is a classic if you dont have it buy it, if you do have it try listening to some other great led zeppelin titles like: Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, Houses of the Holy, Led Zeppelin III, and the highly and sadly underated favorite of many led fans everywhere \\"Presence.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|2005 was the best year for new music I've seen since 2001. Sigur Rs, Opeth, The Mars Volta, and the Eels all put out extremely strong efforts. However, after a few listens to this, I can say that it tops anything else I've heard that was released last year.  <br /> <br />Each song rolls off the stereo with a certain \\"oomph;\\" an energy that's very hard to replicate. They sound kind of like early-Metallica-era speed metal... but then you start thinking, and they really sound more like the sort of juicy psychedelic pop bands like Jefferson Airplane and Country Joe and the Fish churned out \\"back in the day.\\" All of a sudden, you realize that they're singing about some pretty heavy stuff, like genocide and air raids (\\"Tentative\\" features an eerie chorus with the line \\"no one will save us now, not even God\\")... and terracotta pie and \\"ghosts of hooker girly dudes.\\" The album is great for bouts of extreme depression... and bouts of extreme euphoria too. It is a little bit of all the simple joys and terrors of this world packed into a 40-minute CD.  <br /> <br />Is this as good as Mezmerize? It depends on what you're looking for. Mezmerize seems more like a cohesive whole than a colleciton of songs... but Hypnotize definately has some of that \\"collection of songs\\" vibe to it. However, the songs here are much more interesting and well-developed in my opinion. It's scary just how good System of a Down has gotten at writing amazing pop songs. They have now reached a point where they can write a song with hokey-sounding lyrics on paper (\\"the most lonliest day in my liiiiiiiife\\") that WORKS like nothing else and actually has an emotional impact. If you like pop, metal, rock, or just plain interesting music, this is well worth your time. Yes, it is fairly \\"mainstream\\" in terms of sales, but it sounds nothing like all those awful contrived fake-metal bands out there. Trust me: this is the real deal right here. From the sudden onslaught of \\"Attack\\" to the false calm created by theacoustic bits of \\"U-Fig\\" to the masterpiece that is \\"Soldier Side,\\" Hypnotize resembles a sonic orgasm.  <br /> <br />And yes... in case you were wondering, Serj sings a lot more here than on Mezmerize. Not only does he take the lead more frequently, but his harmonizing sounds signifcantly stronger. These guys are getting pretty close to The Beatles as far as vocal harmonies go.

Even before it was subjected to this great remastering job, it was a very well produced and mastered album jam packed with hit tracks such as \\"Rosanna\\", \\"Africa\\", \\"Make Believe\\", \\"I Won't Hold You Back Now\\" as well as other great album tracks like \\"Waiting For Your Love\\" and \\"Good For You\\".  Overall, a very good 80's style pop/rock offering that has aged quite well.  This album now comes in a mini-lp sleeve replica packaging and is DSD remastered for a great sound.  I got my version from a Japanese site and so got mine much cheaper than it is here but if you don't mind the price, this is the best version of this album that is out there at the moment.  Recommended.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|On \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\", the Strokes branch out, keep their irresistible hooks, and get even more clever, to create a truly superb album. <br /> <br />The Strokes' first two albums, as every good child should know, are incredible. \\"Is This It\\" is simply unbelievable, closer to short, pure rock 'n roll perfection than anything else I've ever heard, and \\"Room On Fire\\" was a solid follow-up, though the songs didn't quite have the familial bond that those on \\"Is This Is\\" did. Anyway, these two records are short, immensely enjoyable enjoyable, endlessly replayable rock'n'roll albums. They don't make any claims about the meaning of life or the self, and they don't need to. There is no element of genius about the songwriting, simply a band doing what they do unnaturally well.  <br /> <br />\\"First Impressions Of Earth\\", however, sees the Strokes retaining those qualities that endeared them back in 2001, while at the same time expanding out further and more richly than I ever would have expected. With this highly-anticipated album, I expected one of the two: it would either be forever listenable and fun, like their earlier efforts, or they would experiment with their sound and branch out. Never did I expect that Julian Casablancas and Co. would actually manage to pull off both at the same time, as repeated listens of \\"First Impressions\\" will prove they have. <br /> <br />The Strokes continue their tradition of highly structured, melodic rock 'n roll (which works for them: there is nothing better than having a few rules and boundaries against which one can comfortable kick against), but certain apects have been vastly improved; the most significant of these being the lyrics. Coming out of nowhere, the lyrics on this album astonished me when I first heard them. It was simply not a criteria I was using when evaluating this album. The changes made to their sound have almost uniformly paid off. On this album, the Strokes have gone a smidgeon Prog-Rock at times, and soundlike they're happily at the beginning of overturning musical evolution. <br /> <br />My personal favourite songs on \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" are Ask Me Anything (a Radiohead-esque, futuristic, slower song that illustrates perfectly just how superb a vocalist Casablancas is), Razorblade (perfect guitars playing those trademark Strokes riffs with a slightly stranger edge than we're used to, complimenting Julian's \\"just-out-of-bed\\" drawl), You Only Live Once (vintage Strokes meeting their new sensibilities and loving each other), On The Other Side (every now and again it becomes very clear just how clever this band is being, even while they retain their facade of nonchalance), and Killing Lies (strangely addictive, like much of the album).  However, the individual songs are only part of a larger picture: the cohesiveness of the album as a whole is one of the most impressive things about it. \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" is one of those albums that demands to be listened to as a whole. <br /> <br />The practical things a Strokes fan might like to know before acquiring the album: Julian's vocals no longer have that trademark distortion on them, and the drums (and, to a lesser extent, the bass) take a far more dominant role than they have in the past. No change that has been made is detrimental in any way: these are the same Strokes you know, except a bit more clever and a lot more free. <br /> <br />I would recommend this album both to people familiar with the Strokes and not. Unlike how \\"Room On Fire\\" leant so heavily on \\"Is This It\\" for support, \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" stands on its own. I would never attempt to tell people what they will like, but I can offer a case-study of one: I loved \\"Is This It\\", really liked \\"Room On Fire\\", and love \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\". Make of it what you will, all I can say is this: with this album, the Strokes have leapt, in my estimation, from being an incredibly good rock 'n roll band, to an incredibly good rock 'n roll band that I will keep track of with positive fervour. The Strokes, with this album, have begun a musical evolution, and I want to be there for every step of it.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|The typical Dream Theater fan will tell you that this pales in comparison to I&W and SFAM, but I'm here to tell you different.  This is not quite as hard as TOT, but it still rocks nonetheless.  The only real slow song on here is \\"The answer lies within,\\" which is a really good ballad.  This album still has some heavy hitters with \\"Panic Attack,\\" \\"The Root of all evil,\\" and \\"Never Enough\\". <br />Never Enough, by the way is a song that I haven't seen alot of people comment on because of its somber vocals, but once you hear the chorus you'll realize that musically, this track alone might be worth the price of admission.  \\"Sacrificed sons\\" is also a masterpiece.  When you see these other people say how reminiscent \\"I walk beside you\\" is of a U2 song, they aren't kidding.  It's a great song, but seriously, once I heard it, I was clearly picturing Bono and Company in walking in the snow.  The title track is long, but if you listen to each part, you get the gist of how good it is.  I'm a person who only likes the hard and heavy hitters, and I can honestly say just about every song on this album is worth your while. No, it's not as heavy as TOT, but just as good an album. <br />By the way, you do miss out on alot if you decide to just get a burnt copy of this stuff.  Buy this CD today.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|The show \\"Firefly\\" that spawned this theatrical feature had aired and been subsequently cancelled before I saw a single episode.  Thus, I viewed \\"Serenity\\" with no preconceived ideas about character, plot, or setting.<br /><br />That, without a doubt, was an advantage.<br /><br />I found Joss Whedon's creation to be well made, with the right balance of humor, action, and situations. The mostly unknown cast (I only knew Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass) acquaints itself well and adds to the \\"freshness\\" of a storyline that, at times, is reminiscent of genre films that have come and gone before.<br /><br />What with \\"The Federation\\" (\\"Star Trek\\") on hold, \\"The Empire\\" (\\"Star Wars\\") having bit the dust, it might be time for Whedon's \\"Alliance\\" to take its place in the minds of sci-fi fans, hungry for the next franchise.
6305428220|4.0|While \\"The Faculty\\" isn't the greatest horror flick out there, it is worthy of a few viewings.  I must admit that four stars is probably more than this film deserves, but I can't help but enjoy this movie.  The story, retread as it may be, is fun and played out wittingly by a cast full of up-and-coming stars at the time that will eventually have solid careers.  Also, the actual faculty is played by established actors and actresses who you will recognize and perhaps be shocked by their appearance in the film.<br /><br />The plot has been around the block a few times, mixing stereotypical teenage characters with a stereotypical teaching staff that starts to act just a wee bit strange.  As time goes on, people start to go missing or are transformed into zombie-like drones.  The small band of heroes, with stellar performances from Clea DuVall and Elijah Wood, must join forces to find the queen of an alien race trying to--you guessed it--take over the world.  Other young stars in this flick include Jordana Brewster, Josh Hartnett, and Shawn Hatosy.  Usher Raymond makes a small appearance as well.  The highlight of the young cast, though, is Laura Harris, who plays her character very well.<br /><br />The faculty is chock full of mainstream actors, from Robert Patrick(Terminator 2) to Bebe Neuwirth(Cheers, Frasier).  John Stewart turns in a memorable performance as the science teacher and I was shocked to see Salma Hayek as the funny school nurse.  Famke Janssen goes from shy to svelte as an extra-terrestrial, and Piper Laurie gives a motherly, if not-of-this-worldly performance.<br /><br />This film is just fun to watch.  I can't complain about that.  It laughs at itself as well as sci-fi horror as a whole, all the while giving you a story full of solid acting and a little suspense.  It's a well done flick worthy of repeat performances.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I developed an art unit for my high school students around this movie, and every couple of years when I show it, the kids have a blast!  They also carefully watch \\"Inside the Labyrinth,\\" which shows all of the \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff, such as model making, set design, and so much more.  With all of this information in their heads (reinforced with homework assignments relating to the lives and work of Jim Henson, Brian Froud, and MC Escher), they then enter the \\"movie business\\" by sculpting creatures, designing costumes, creating mock sets, etc.  (Please visit my website if you'd like to see examples of their projects!)<br /><br />As many times as I've seen this movie over the years, I still enjoy it.  And as many times as I've used this as a catalyst for creative thinking in my classroom, the kids always impress me with their work.
B000002U82|5.0|I love this album. I cannot stress how important it is for every person to have this album as a part of their collection. It is a true classic. If you don't have money to buy this album...steal it. It is that good.
0743454537|5.0|This book has been so hard for me to put down!  And I am a teenager (as you know by rumor...most teens don't really like to read outside of school, so you know if I read it, it had to be good).  The plot is constantly throwing you curve balls that will keep you turning the pages.  My favorite aspect of the book is that it is told from 5 people's view point, so you see it at different angles.  But the ending is like seeing the Sixth Sense for the first time.  Wowing, unexpecting, and just astonishing.  You don't see it coming. <br /> <br />P.S. Be sure to have a tissue ready for parts in the book!
B000AARKOO|1.0|When depicting a religion and culture he doesn't understand, a filmmaker should show respect and sensitivity and strive for accuracy. Ridley Scott's treatment of medieval Christianity fails miserably in this regard. The opening text informs us that Europe was suffering under \\"poverty and repression\\", indicating the filmmaker's attitude toward the religion of Europe. What a dilemma. For a Western market, the protagonist must be European, but a pious Christian would be more alien to the values and sensibilities of Scott and his intended audience than even a Saracen. Ah! Problem solved. Make him anachronistically disconnected from his religion and have him murder a priest at the start of the movie to allow bigots to identify with him.  When soldiers show up to arrest him they are likewise murdered with the help of his noble father. But it's OK; the officers were somehow sent not by the local ruler but by the bishop (reinforcing the perception of the Church as the enemy.) <br />   Now on to Jerusalem to find forgiveness.  But what's this? When Balian gets there he doesn't feel anything and announces that he's lost his religion. That's alright, reassures one of the few sympathetically portrayed characters, \\"I hold no stock in religion\\", which is just for fanatics, anyway.  Strange sentiments, coming from a man vowed to a celibate religious order with a large cross on his garment!  Even Jeremy Irons, who made such a good Jesuit in \\"The Mission\\" and \\"The Man in the Iron Mask\\", claims at the end of the movie that God has left him.  But we must remember, it's always Scott and his screenwriter talking. <br />   Next we're treated to the hanging of some Templars, who, despite their real life independence, authority, and selfless, heroic protection of pilgrims and citizens of the Holy Land, are portrayed in this movie as stock henchmen to the villainous renegade Reynald de Chatillon and his co-conspirator Guy. This occasions a snide comment from Balian about the pope, implying that he wants Muslims murdered.  Interestingly showing his embrace of Hollywood values, Balian adds adultery to his sins in this city to which he's come for forgiveness, all the while pontificating about the importance of being a perfect knight. <br />   Muslim citizens are respectfully shown at prayer and praised for wanting \\"to be one\\", but no such portrayal of Christian piety and virtue is shown.  The Patriarch of Jerusalem is used solely to advance the anticlerical, anti-Christian agenda of the film. Whenever someone wants to shut off debate and do something dastardly or foolish, he simply exclaims \\"God wills it!\\", reinforcing the image of religion as manipulative and closed minded. <br />  The basic events and names of characters in this movie do bear a reasonable resemblance (allowing for poetic license and the exigencies of storytelling) to real historical events and persons. There's no point in quibbling about that. It's in the spin applied, the details and dialogue, that history is falsified. The framework of real history is used to lend false credibility to popular misconceptions and prejudices in a big-budget propaganda vehicle from intolerant Hollywood Christophobes.  What a shame! I was really looking forward to this movie. It is visually impressive and carries a lot of star power, but the contentious apects of its relentless message overwhelm its virtues. It might have been salvageable by a little less agenda driven editing.
B0001WGDX0|2.0|All I got was some very average Beethoven performances from Leonard Bernstein, a conductor usually renowned for his extrovert, fascinating approach to various music but who so misses the mark with this dull cycle of the greatest symphonies of all time. One of the main problems is possibly the fact that Bernstein chose to record this cycle, ( his 2nd cycle of Beethoven symphonies ), with the Vienna Philharmonic. His earlier one was with the New York Philharmonic and that was a lot more youthful and vigorous. These Vienna versions are much more mellow and relaxed, I love the Vienna Philharmonic but they've played this music to death and I don't think they can really be inspired, full-throttle like a younger, less tradition ingrained orchestra. And to add insult to injury, Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic was always much superior in these years in terms of virtuosity, finesse, power and everything you need to feel the impact of Beethoven.<br /><br />Still, the Vienna Philharmonic is one of the finest orchestras in the world and it leaves it up to the conductor to truly inspire them. This is where Bernstein fails, every single one of these symphonies is safe, lackluster and middle of the road. Let's take a quick, one by one analysis of the works.<br /><br />Symphony 1 is done with charm and grace, Bernstein obviously enjoying the mood but I miss the sprint and attack that Karajan brings to this music. Symphony 2 is where Bernstein truly shines, he puts in plenty of power and concentration throughout and the slow movement, the larghetto, is gorgeous. All in all, a success. Symphony 3, the Eroica is where the trouble starts. It's boring, it's deflated, it's dull compared to Bernstein's earlier New York version and Bernstein typically falls flat on his face when compared to Karajan or Furtwangler in the Eroica. The funeral march by Bernstein can put you to sleep, where is the emotional gravity that Karajan brings to it in his devastating digital record? Symphony 4 is good but not great, a general run through with a few interesting touches. Symphony 5 is a dismal failure, the famous first movement is the worst I've ever heard. It's obscenely slow, 8 minutes, 38 seconds! Compare that to most versions which average like 7 minutes, 20 seconds. The rest of the symphony is nothing special but at least better than the atrocious first movement. The Pastoral symphony is well played but isn't in the league with Karl Bohm or Bruno Walter. Symphony 7 is one of the best performances of the Bernstein cycle, with lots of energy and drive. Symphony 8 is humorous and lively, not massive like Karajan, but that's ok.<br /><br />Finally, Symphony number 9 is where you should hear true fireworks from Bernstein, instead you get your typical run through as if this was some background music. The choral finale especially is a total let down compared to Solti's magnificient 1972 version or Karajan's 1977 recording. I hope Bernstein's later performance for the coming down of the Berlin Wall is not as routine as what I hear here. I have yet to hear that famous record. ( I have subsequently listened to the Berlin Ode to Freedom 9th led by Bernstein and I must warn you, it is absolutely awful! See my review. If you want Bernstein conducting Beethoven's 9th, this Vienna Philharmonic version included in this boxed set I'm reviewing is about as good as it gets as far as Bernstein is concerned. His earlier New York version is about the same except this Vienna performance has better sound. Regardless, Bernstein never recorded a great 9th, he could never perform the finale adequately. He made it episodic and disjointed, not symphonic as with Furtwangler, Karajan or Solti, stick to those conductors. )<br /><br />All Beethoven symphonic cycles are eventually disappointing because no one conductor can approach perfection in every one of these works. Bernstein succeeds in symphonies 2 and 7 in this set, but that's really it, the rest are average or worse. Karajan's early 1960's cycle is the one to go for if you desperately need a complete set by one conductor. It's not perfect but the most satisfactory available.<br /><br />For individual symphonies, try Karajan in symphony 1, Karajan, Szell or Bernstein in symphony 2. For the Eroica, Karajan's digital version if you want drama and power or Klemperer from 1961 if you like it slow or Toscanini from the good old days. Szell and Furtwangler are also great. Symphony 4 goes to either Szell or Karajan, Symphony 5 to Giulini, Furtwangler, Karajan and Kleiber. The Pastoral goes to Karl Bohm or Bruno Walter. The 7th goes to God knows who, I haven't found a perfect Seventh, yet! Try Thielemann, Furtwangler or Bernstein or Karajan's first DG cycle. Go with Karajan's digital version for the 8th symphony. Last but not least, Solti, 1972 for the the Choral Symphony or Gunter Wand on RCA, as well as Karajan, 62, 77 and Furtwangler, 51, 42, all great.<br /><br />Man, that sounds like a lot, but that's Beethoven for you. You can't ever find the perfect interpretation, because they simply don't exist!'s cycle is the one to go for if you desperately need a complete set by one conductor.

0345442989|5.0|This is one of those books that gives great insight into the background stories of the movies.  If you like stories that closely relate to the movies, you'll enjoy this book.  It gives some background on the relationsship with Sidious and the Trade Federation as well as how Palpatine manouvers in the senate to position himself to be the runner up to Valorum as supreme chancellor.  I don't have the money or time to obtain and read every SW book or graphic novel. So if this sounds like you, I would say this is one of the SW books I would read. I would also highly recommend Labrynth of Evil, also by James Luceno for the same reasons I reccommend this book.
B000001GPX|4.0|This ultra famous recording of the the Beethoven Fifth and Seventh is absurdly overpraised. I'm not going to be a Mr. Know-It-All and attack these performances just because people love them, I'm just going to try to be fair and impartial and get at the core of why these recordings shouldn't be deemed so unsurpassable.    Kleiber is an exceptional conductor and he knows exactly what he is doing, his penchant for drama, attack and drive work well with these two symphonies but they miss quite a bit too. The VPO for instance is a great orchestra but they don't always rise to the challenge here. I want to pay particular attention to the sound of these recordings which is simply not that great. It's servicable, actually typical Deutsche Grammophon sound from the mid-70s. It's cold, at times harsh and stringy. The opening of the last movement of the 5th symphony is shrill, there is no resplendent majesty here like you get in Karajan's 1962 version or Guilini's version from the early 80's with the LAPO.     Kleiber's first movement is fast, intense but lacks the ultimate power I heard in the Karajan 1962 version. I would say Kleiber's first movement is one of the best regardless, with the musicians really digging into the accents. The second movement is good, Kleiber doesn't rush things, the scherzo is terrific, the transition to the finale doesn't have much mystery, certainly not the heaven storming insanity that Furtwangler brings to it in his war-time recording from the 1940's. Kleiber is also very literal in his observation of repeats in these works. Repeats everywhere you can find them is typically the norm in recent times. The repeat in the first movement is a must, obviously every conductor takes it but the finale repeat is a matter of choice. Kleiber of course takes it and it's to his credit that the movement doesn't drag as it might under someone else. Giulini's last movement does drag because he takes a slower tempo along with the repeat. Karajan on the other hand, never took the finale repeat in any of his versions, from 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s! All the Karajan versions fly to the finish with unbelievable, exhilarating force! So with Giulini or Kleiber, you're more exhausted by the end of the symphony, with Karajan, you're on cloud nine, ecstatic because of the power of the Berlin Philharmonic and because he skips the redundant repeat. Of course Kleiber's version is terrific but I would not give it this high of a status among classical recordings. Here are the best Beethoven 5ths, any Karajan version, especially the '62 and '77, the later 80's digital version is extremely powerful too but not as well played as the earlier versions. They all do pack quite a punch. Giulini with the LAPO is among the best, then Carlos Kleiber is up there in that great company as well, but not the definitive at all. If you want a Furtwangler 5th, of course there is the war-time performance to go to. It has a slow first movement but the rest of the work is majestic beyond words. Unfortunately you have to deal with the mono sound, even though it's not that bad.    The 7th symphony is a tricky one and I've never been completely convinced by any version that I've heard. Kleiber once again takes all the damn repeats! It's ok in the first movement, but he takes one too many in the scherzo and he takes the repeat in the final movement which makes things way too repetitive, many conductors used to skip this repeat but Kleiber is so bloody literal minded! Karajan's versions of the 7th are just too driven for my taste, even though Karajan's finales have always been the best! The fast speed works well in the finale. Kleiber is less driven than Karajan and Carlos is also more humane in the Allegreto. However, all these versions just don't spark me too much. Furtwangler on the other hand is outstanding but of course you have to deal with the old mono sound. You can find his version on the Music and Arts label. In addition, check out the very weighty, traditional approach of Christian Thielemann with the Philharmonia Orchestra on a recent Beethoven record, with great sound that easily surpasses the sound of the Kleiber and Karajan recordings.    What you ultimately have here in Kleiber, is pretty intense, terrific performances but with some catches involved. The sound is not great lacking some lower end weight and Kleiber insists on all the repeats just like most recent conductors and that tends to make things drag in the 7th symphony. All reservations aside, they are still great performances but this is surely not the holy grail of classical recordings!
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I have been a Marillion fan since I walked into a record store around 1985 and they were playing Fugazi. At first I thought they were playing Genesis but asked and was quickly turned on to one of the best progressive rock bands ever. I was very hesitant to give Steve Hogarth a chance, but I am so glad I did. The strength and passion in his voice is no more evident than on this CD. It took me a few listens, especially through Invisible Man, but I have to agree now that this is probably the best Marillion release to date. I also bought the DVD and would recommend it highly to those of you who love the CD.  I can't wait to see what they are up to next.
0451191153|4.0|Of course, this is more than a novel.  This is Ayn Rand's attempt to use the vehicle of fiction to present her philosophy of objectivism.

B000002H33|5.0|ok the heavy metal genre has received alot of stick now i see must heavy metal as lacking imagination but there are a few execptions them being iron maiden (only just) mettalica and system of a down (they dont really qualify as metal but i put them here anyway) mettalica use alot of classical influences witch gives there music more colour also there songs change and shift from different moods althou on some albums it makes u suseptable to like some bits of songs more than others but this is a classic definatly worthy of purchase heres a list of the tracks <br /> <br />battery 9/10 lovely acoustic interplay at the beginning effortlessly shifts into trash then switches in to a good interlude section is a beast of a song  <br /> <br />master of the puppets 10/10 a milestone for all metal no other metal band has managed to sum up heavy metal in one song mettalica then manage to do it again with enter sandman but metallica have done it in this one song only thing that stops me giving it 11 out of 10 is i dont think hammet shows his best solo at the end but there is a lovely interlude section in the middle witch can only be defined as epic  <br /> <br />the thing that should not be 10/10 gives of this atmosphere of being in a well at the beggining and then when it goes from the echo acoustic it sounds like its breaking free this song is a monster another milestone in metal  <br /> <br />welcome home sanitarium 11/10 i love this song start with a beautifully melodic riff and some really nice solo work from hammit starts of very spanishy and has hetfield singing in a melodic style something i would of never imagined happening after hearing kill em all for the first time  <br /> <br />dispoable hereos 8/10 decent track but to be honest the subject matter is stupid even thou i always put tune first i cant really dig in to this song but is a good track contains some good riffs  <br /> <br />leper messiah 8.5/10 sounds like what most of the songs on there later album .....and justice for all tried to sound like althou they have better this one its a good track very heavy dosnt have the imagination of some of the other songs on this album <br /> <br />orion(instrumental) 11/10 i love this contains so many good bits i do like hetfields vocals but this is great shows alot of imagination and appears to shift from strait metal to strange guitar sounds you dont see many other heavy metal bands attempting something like this <br /> <br />damage inc 10/10 contains one of the fastest guitar solos ever influential but not the best bit of the song personally i like the way it builds from the beginning starts of nicely some wierd effects then just bursts into metal riffery stuff that bands like machine head always attempt to better but always fail i dont give it 10 out of 10 because i think its a brilliant song its just the influence it has had alot of the others are alot better (all the others have been my opinion)
B000BVD460|5.0|Even with the new songs, he just doesn't stop.  He's the BEST!  I'd buy his worst CD and it would be better than most of the hip-hop artists out there.  Definitely a keeper!
B000002H6C|3.0|this album isnt one of mettalicas best its better than some of the albums to follow disincluding the black album . alot of the album sounds the same although its starts off promising its over produced for the most part . althou it contains some really good tunes i doubt mettalica have recovered from the loss of cliff burton a tragic loss of a great talent .althou this contains some truely monumental materials to put this up with some of there over work is an insult to the artists themselve they are so much better than this im not saying this is somthing you should avoid .there is some great material on the album for example one an epic tale of a disfiqured soldier cept alive by machinary lovely solos from hammet nice guitar playing starts soft and turns in to a thrash epic. i always put melody above everything else on some songs it lacks i like bits of songs to live is to die the instrument track has some lovely acoustic guitar ruined by dumb power chords bringing it into the main song (nice interlude section thou) but the trasition just dosnt fit blackened is an example of a good eye of the beholder has a nice rythum to it a good song from mettalica very heavy like a slow moving beast emerging from the flames has some of the essense of kill em all in it harvester for sorrow has a brilliant riff and the beggining worthy of a mettalica great has some really nice acoustic guitar inbetween the power chords.the shortest straw sounds at the beggining like a weaker version of the intro to harvest of sorrow and dosnt really inspire from there at all.the frayer ends of sanity sounds like the mines of hell itself sounds like your going straight there witch is some ways a good thing they are a heavy metal band after all but this track seems to lack some of the imagination they exhibited in the past.the last track leaves you feeling unfurfilled worth buying but there are better there is some very worthwhile meterial on this album but as a cd it dosnt really hold together
0307276902|5.0|This book is amazing!  I've read A LOT of books throughout the years and this book is probably the BEST book I've read.  I don't need to go into why... read it and find out for yourself!  :o)
B000B8QF00|5.0|As always, a great CD
B000084T18|5.0|I love 50 Cent!  This is definitely my favorite CD of his.  He's serious, a little melodramatic, funny... it's all there.  He's at the top of his game.
B000AOENJA|5.0|Life In Slow Motion has everything a great album needs. It has upbeat songs such as Hospital Food and The One I Love, the latter of which will make you think, \\"This sounds great! Have I heard this before?\\" Life In Slow Motion also has slower songs that you can relate to when you are down; my favorite being Slow Motion.<br /><br />Do not expect another White Ladder, as Life In Slow Motion has a very different sound.<br /><br />The DVD side of the DualDisc contains a very neat lyric book. The lyric book's pages flip automatically as you listen to the album. The documentary is a great addition. I was surprised at how well David Gray performed in the studio and practice sessions. The quality of his voice is identical to the album. David Gray is a very talented performer.<br /><br />Be aware that the CD side of the DualDisc will not play on some CD players. It plays fine on my computer running Windows XP but will not play on my 1996 Subaru car stereo.<br /><br />Overall, Life In Slow Motion is a great album. You won't be disappointed.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay's multi-platinum debut \\"Parachutes\\" is a wonder.  Granted, it doesn't have the feeling of freedom that one gets while listening to \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\"; nor does it have the strength or power of the songs in \\"X&Y\\".  But this is where it all began, and in the minds of a majority of people this remains the band's best album.<br /><br />It's hard to pick out the best songs of the album, as they're all nearly equal.  \\"Don't Panic\\" is a great, easy way to begin the album.  It's followed by \\"Shiver\\", which is most definitely one of - if not THE - best song on the album.  Other highlights include the hit \\"Spies\\", a wonderful piece about paranoia; \\"Sparks\\", a calm, romantic song that has a feeling of great comfort; \\"Yellow\\", which displays the versatility of the band as the song switches from percussion-heavy rock to a beautiful, free-flying chorus; and \\"High Speed\\", which was recorded before all the other songs.  There isn't a bad song on the album; as I've said, nearly all the songs are equally great.<br /><br />Chris Martin has a great voice, filling these songs with a feeling of hope and a sense of wonder about the world.  The percussion switches from being very subtle to smooth and gentle to heavy and pounding.  The guitar work is really terrific, particularly on \\"We Never Change\\", echoing dreamily.  The lyrics are far from Shakespearean, but that's part of the beauty of it.<br /><br />This is heartfelt music.  It never tries to be grand, and perhaps that's what's so great about it.  It's a beautiful, hope-filled masterpiece of an album that you'll want to listen to again and again.  By all means, pick it up.  You won't regret it.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Billy Joel was something that almost never happened. After failing with his first band, \\"Atila\\", and releasing the hardly selling \\"Cold Spring Harbor,\\" he came back with an amazing album called Piano Man, and shot right to the top. But the one thing that I loved about Billy Joel, was that every album had a different flavor of music to it. Piano Man was Country laden, Sreetlife Serneade had an old, almost rag-time feel to it (hence the song: Root Beer Rag) The Nylon Curtain was his strangest album, very dark and somewhat psychadelic, and An Innocent Man was 50's doo-wop. BUT 52nd Street has a jazz feel to it, and it is amazing. Yes there are alot of big time hits on this album, but the 2 best songs on the album dont get any airplay and they are Zanibar and 52nd ST. Even if you arent a fan of Billy, and you want an album with a great jazz vibe, this would be one to add to your collection...ENJOY
B00005QXXO|4.0|Except for LSP, which is better than the Amnesiac version, this EP is probably not for the casual Radiohead listener who wants to hear studio perfect sound.  With that said, most hardcore fans will enjoy it very much for the different takes on familiar songs, primarily from Kid A and Amnesiac. I personally like the live versions because of the raw and more authentic feel of the songs. Real life doesn't unfold in a recording studio, and sometimes a song has more impact when the artist's voice isn't perfect.  If you don't agree, then you might want to pass.  <br /> <br />Now a question:  Why do people buy an EP and complain about its length and track selection?  Here's a tip:  Read the label before buying.
B000002UB3|5.0|When the Beatles first started out, they were basically a bubble-gum rock band that took the US by storm during the British Invasion. I still can't believe that the same band that sang \\"I wanna hold your hand\\" came out with such a powerful record. The Beatles proved that not only could they mature with each album getting better and more unique, they also grew as better musicans. Every Beatle in my opinion was an outstanding musican, as they all contribted to some form of the song writing and most played a variety of intruments. If you consider yourself a fan of rock and roll, and you dont have this in your collection, then shame on you. As one reviewer stated, the Beatles had something for everyone and usually satisfied listeners of all different generes. This album I believe though is their best effort. Come Together and She's so Heavy remain my 2 favorite Beatles songs, and those songs alone are enough to buy this. But every song on this CD is amazing in some way. I highly recommend that if you still have a turntable, to get this on album, as the record is the most true to the orginal master that you can get. ENJOY!
B00005RHGL|5.0|In early 1994, when I went to see a B-movie western about Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday, I never thought it would be one of the most entertaining films of all time. This is the same year that Lawrence Kasdan released his highly anticipated 2 ½ hour epic retelling of this legendary lawman's career. Ironically, his mega budget film turned out to be an interminable bore, offering a flat, dreary performance by Kevin Costner. Conversely, Tombstone, directed by the late George P. Cosmatos is anything but lackluster, with a superb ensemble cast featuring Kurt Russell as Wyatt and Val Kilmer as Doc, in the most colorful rendering of these characters I have ever seen.<br /><br />On hand as the bad guys, are Powers Booth as the affable Curly Bill, Stephen Lang as thickheaded Ike Clanton and Michael Biehn, turning in a notable performance as the educated but psychopathic gunslinger named Johnny Ringo. In a particularly interesting sequence, Ringo and Doc exchange barbs across a faro table while speaking in Latin. How many times have you seen that in the Wild West?<br /><br />The plot line follows the prototypical OK Corral story about Earp and his brothers going to Tombstone to make their fortune. After the famous gun battle with the Clantons and McLaurys, Wyatt's older brother Virgil is crippled by a gunshot to the arm and younger sibling Morgan takes a fatal bullet to the back. Seeking vengeance on a Biblical scale, Wyatt is accompanied by consumption ridden, drunken Doc, who in spite of his afflictions is loyal to a fault and deadly with a short barreled colt.<br /><br />This is the best version of the Earp saga and though not quite historically accurate, Kurt Russell turns a nicely layered performance, breathing life into a complex character. Though often too brief, there are some excellent supporting appearances by Dana Delany, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Zane and Charlton Heston. Additionally, the scenery (filmed at Old Tucson Studios) is authentic and the stylish costumes are second to none. I have seen this film at least ten times and will probably watch it another ten times before I ride off into that big saloon in the sky<br /><br />Bonus Features on The Director's Cut include some very nice  sequences deleted from the theatrical release, which add at least 10 minutes to the film. Also the making of \\"Tombstone\\" documentary makes this a must for those of you like me who love this moviecostumes are second to none.

B0007Y4TVU|2.0|I really loved SOD when they released the self titled debut. I thought that Sugar was brillent as they mixed a variety of jazz and \\"trash metal\\" into the song, and on that song along I was sold. I picked up a copy and was very impressed and thought that they would just get better as time went on. After two more realeases I was still pretty happy with the direction of the band, even though Toxicity didnt quite have the feel of the first album, and the collection of Bsides, Steal this album, was well what it was, unreleaed material. When Mezmerize came out, and I first had a listen to it, there were a handful of songs that caught my attention, but the album really seemed to lose some feel and the heaviness of the other CD's. Serj sounds more and more whiny on this one, and some of the songs lyrics are just absurd. I really wanted to like this one, as I have tried to listen to it multiple times, but it just seems to get more on my nerves as I listen to it, instead of growing on me. Hey, this could just be a bad album, and hopefully the band won't fizzle and crash and burn like Korn did. Pick up the first two albums, wait til this one goes on the discount rack.
B000AM4PBS|3.0|This was a gift from my husband, and on some episodes the laugh track is far far louder than the dialogue.  It is very random.  I know we had a speaker setup issues, but we corrected that and we still have this problem (even when we play it on the computer). <br /> <br />I do love Friends and the set itself is very nice, I am just concerned about the sound quality. <br /> <br />I will point out that I have been watching the re-runs for quite some time on numerous networks and cable and there are episodes that are rarely, if ever, shown in syndication.  Such as the one in the laundromat with Ross and Rachael or where Nana dies (and people think Chandler's gay).  I see the pilot often, but not these older episodes very often.  It is nice to have the set.
B00008BRDX|5.0|Everytime that I listen to this CD, or any other Police album, I think what if....What if Sting didn't want to go on and pursue other interest? What if the Police were still around today?? The Police might be one of the greatist rock and roll bands of all time, and thats saying alot since they only released 5 albums (that contained orginal material) This happens to be my favorite of the bunch, even though they are all equally good. Since I figure that most people that are reading this are Police fans, the ones that aren't or  are only familer with the songs that you hear on the radio, then you are missing out, because on this CD there isnt one bad song. If you want to hear one of the best 3 man bands, then this is right up your alley. I believe fans of all music will treasure this, and even if you can't stand Sting, pick this one up just to listen to Stewart Copeland, one of the best and most under-rated drummers of all time..ENJOY
B0007KTBIU|4.0|I've been loving the story of Pocahontas since I first saw this on video so many years ago - I also saw it at the cinema. I love the fact it's so historical, despite it being based on folklore. I also own a fictional book on it, which extends on much of the stuff in the film. I did look up the straight-to-DVD sequel, but there's no John Smith. :( I was so into Pocahontas, that it made me want to dye my hair black, and grow it long. If I have my hair in braids at work, I even get called Pocahontas. Back in those days, I wanted to be Pocahontas so much, but thankfully, my tastes have changed since swooning over a blonde, clean cut John Smith.<br /><br />This story is so romantic in every way, from their first meeting, to the finale, and all the scenes in-between. They're so different but so meant for each other. I even liked the new scene, which blends so seamlessly into the film, and seems so familiar, I barely realised that it was a new scene. It also has a brand new song, \\"If I Never Knew You\\", which was cut after children in test audiences found it boring. OK, it does go over stuff that we already know, and rehashes earlier footage from the film, but it's still one of the best songs.<br /><br />In the extras, during a very long and interesting The Making Of Pocahontas, the viewers get to see who Pocahontas was based on. Boy was I disappointed! Irene Bedard provided the voice for Pocahontas and the animated character was based on her. I look more like Pocahontas than she does!<br /><br />What sets this Disney film apart from the others (it was also the last Disney movie I ever watched) is that unlike many Disney movies these days (Shrek for example) nearly every voice in them is a big star, which just so doesn't happen in this film. I much prefer Disney movies when you don't know the voices at the other end. OK, in this movie you have Mel Gibson as the voice of John Smith, but the only other big star is Billy Connolly. (I only just realised this after watching the DVD!) Also the animals don't talk, which is normally a given in Disney movies. It also drags you into the film, until you quite literally fall in love with it. Watching it again after so many years (and now as an adult), made me feel like a little girl all over again, going all gooey over the scenes between Pocahontas and John Smith, and wishing I had it for myself. Amazing how all this stuff can just come straight back to you.<br /><br />There's been a whole hoo-ha, about how stuff wasn't historically represented, blah blah. It's a Disney movie guys. Come on! If you want to know about the legend of Pocahontas, there's plenty of books out there, I own one, and although I haven't read it in years, I'm definitely going to dig it out again.<br /><br />This film is an absolute diamond, and is much better than some of the rubbish that Disney decided to churn out after this. It has some of the best songs included in a Disney movie (hello, Colours Of The Wind could be practically considered a classic!). Pocahontas is a strong woman, not afraid to stand up to her father, although I am disappointed she didn't go to England with John. (She does in the book I've read.) The extras are quite good, with the making of going a wee bit into the history of Pocahontas, and showing around Jamestown, and where John Smith originally landed.<br /><br />Magical?

0694003611|5.0|A classic, I read this to my 7 year old when he was a baby, he now reads it to is 7 month old sister. Full circle joy. Great bed time story, makes bedtime fun time.
B000005JAB|5.0|I must admit I was a little sceptical about this album beforehand; having heard that this was a very classical inspired album and that I might find it a little hard accessible. Therefore I was happily surpised to discover that this in essence is an album of mostly great songs - tastefully arranged and produced.<br /><br />The classical thing is more or less only come forward on the title track and \\"Endless Plain of Fortune\\" - and even those two tracks are really just rock-ballads with an orchestered accompaniment - and both very strong tracks.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are not very unlike the best material on \\"Vintage Violence\\" and \\"Fear\\".<br /><br />The opening track \\"A Child's Christmas in Wales\\" is a gorgeous tune, greatly played and built up by Cale and his band, featuring Bill Payne, Richard Hayward and (not least) Lowell George on guitar. The melodic slide guitar really add to making this a song you wanna hear over and over again. \\"Half Past France\\" is another track in the same category is \\"Half Past France\\".<br /><br />The most immediately catchy track is the acoustic \\"Hanky Panky Nohow\\".<br /><br />Another outstanding acoustic track is \\"Andalucia\\" - heartbreaking lyrics and vocals.<br /><br />The song where the Little Feat contribution is most obvious is the shuffle rocking \\"Macbeth\\", which  unfortunately seems a little out of place, being pretty wild and noisy compared to the rest of the album.<br /><br />\\"Graham Greene\\" is a quite funny song with a reggae-beat.<br /><br />Overall Cale lyrics are mysterious, at times slightly dark, but usually delightfully thought-provoking.<br /><br />The album was produced by Chris Thomas (Badfinger - Procol Harum) and with Cale's songs and arrangements he has been a part of creating another classic.
B00006IR5S|4.0|Even though I found the score for \\"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone\\" a bit disappointing, John Williams manages to outdo himself with the second Harry Potter installmemt.  It's funny that William Ross is credited as arranger and conductor, but that doesn't matter: this one has made an improvement over the score of the first movie.<br /><br />The prologue presents an interesting arrangement of two important Harry Potter themes (Hedwig's theme and the wondrous world music).  There are two themes that are a real knockout: one is 'Fawkes The Phoenix', which is extremely magical and wonderful; and the other one is 'The Chamber Of Secrets', with its malevolent flair and mysterious mood.  The theme for Gilderoy Lockhart is very entertaining, and the one for Dobby is kind of childlike at best, very nice.  The action music is also a nice treat, as shown in tracks like 'The Flying Car', 'The Spiders', 'Cornish Pixies', and 'Dueling The Basilisk'.<br /><br />In general, this is a fine album, with a great performance by the London Symphony Orchestra.  John Williams is definitely a master of the fantastic genre, and his music for this sequel fares better than the original.
071563318X|5.0|Growing up, I always enjoyed anything dealing with zombies and the undead.  George Romero movies were my favorite, and I spent many sleepless nights listening to the wind outside my bedroom window, imagining a ghoul creeping around.   <br />If you were like me, or if you just enjoy a detailed look at how the end of world might occur, then you will appreciate this book.  Every part of a zombie's existance, from how it is created to the best weapons to kill it, is discussed in gory detail.  No aspect is left out.  Tactics for escape and survival in different terrains, lists of must-have items for individuals and groups, and even case studies from past outbreaks are discussed in detail. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, both as a humorous take on survival manuals and as a study of how easily the structure of our society can come crashing down.
B000002552|4.0|I share Alexander Lynn's complaint that much great Dylan music (in particular \\"Sign on the cross\\") that has long circulated as bootlegs was left out of this package, and hope that an official \\"genuine Bootleg tapes\\" will make an appearance someday. <br /> <br />For all historians or fans of Bob Dylan or The Band, these recordings are essential.  Many fans will have more exhaustive bootleg copies anyway, but for casual listeners or people not familiar with this aspect of Dylan, the official Basement Tapes CD is an excellent introduction to the sort of relaxed, traditional Americana-influenced music he made with the Band in the basement of Big Pink, the necessary \\"bridge\\" between his albums \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and \\"John Wesley Harding\\". <br /> <br />Alexander Lynn points out in his review here that the Band's contributions to this set weren't recorded at Big Pink but at the studio where they recorded their first album.  Nonetheless, none of the 4 or 5 CD \\"genuine Basement tapes\\" that I have seen contain the Band's own songs presented here -- not even their version of \\"Don't ya tell Henry\\".  There is little doubt that they played all these songs in that basement but perhaps some of those recordings don't survive -- therefore, as part of the historical record, I'd support Columbia's (and Robbie Robertson's?) decision to include those recordings here, though the packaging is admittedly deceptive.  Subsequently, better remasterings have shown up as bonus tracks on re-releases of the Band's own records.   <br /> <br />That brings me to Lynn's chief complaint: that \\"this is attributable to Robbie Robertson's disturbing tendency to obfuscate his own role in the formation of The Band's signature sound, and his de-emphasis of the collaborative nature of this wonderful group... The Band's earliest self-penned songs often came from Richard Manuel\\".  Given that of the five tracks here that were penned by the Band, three are credited or co-credited to Manuel (in addition, he sharescredits with Dylan for \\"Tears of rage\\"), it is a strange accusation.  Manuel's influence is clear, in the music and in the credits, in \\"Music for Big Pink\\" and to a lesser extent on their next two albums: after that, he appears to have lost his songwriting muse.  There is no crime here: many great musicians were not great songwriters (think Louis Armstrong, Bill Evans, ...) <br /> <br />Levon Helm, in his autobiography, does accuse Robertson of taking  undue credit, but it is an accusation that comes years late and is denied credibility by the fact that the Band found it so hard to write new material after they regrouped in 1983.  On the Band's early recordings Manuel has plenty of credit. Helm, Danko and in particular Garth Hudson have much less credited to them, but it could just be that they weren't such talented songwriters, brilliant musicians though they were.  It is impossible to doubt Robertson's or the young Manuel's songwriting talent and there's no evidence, on this record at least, that Robertson chose tracks to misrepresent his contributions to the group.
B000002J1S|5.0|By 1974, Genesis had released four classic albums, and were among the best of the progressive rock scene. By the time Lamb was released, the band's lead singer Peter Gabriel had already proven that he was an amazing lyricist, his lyrics were extremely eccentric(and dark), and most of his songs told odd stories. On The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, the entire album tells a story, and is a very deep story, that requires a lot of time to trully figure out. In fact I have had the album for nearly a year, and i'm still figuring it out. Because of the concept, this album is divided into two discs, and is just over 90 minues long. Now the albums length can be either a blessing or a curse, as it is very hard to sustain a high quality level on an album like this. Besides being hard to keep consistent, a concept album is usually very heavy lyrically, and because of this the music may suffer, because the band decides to let the music take a back seat to the lyrics. Here Genesis succeeds in both areas, although many people say the second disc is weaker. I cant say I can not see why certain people have this opinion, the second disc is much more instrumental than the first disc, but I cant see the problem with that, because the instrumentals are all very good. The only other complaint that people ever have against this album is that Genesis departed from their trademark symphonic prog sound on Lamb, but I could care less, because even though they changed their sound, the music still remains extremely deep, and the band is all in top shape here.    The story is in my eyes the story of Rael, and what I believe to be either a series of halucinations, or his journey through purgatory to get to heaven. This album was lyrically the peak of Peter Gabriel's carreer. The liner notes do really help in explaining the literal meaning of the album, there are however certain things that are never explained(where Rael is, and as it seems with all concept albums the ending is even in the liner notes very vague).    There are many standouts on the album, and not an extreme amount of filler(and the songs/instrumentals that are filler are very good filler). There are just so many good songs on this album. The title track is extremely catchy, and is everything an opener should be. Cuckoo Cocoon is a short piece, but it features great flute, and is very soothing. In The Cage is the best song on the album, it is a true epic with great keyboard parts(the moog solo is one of the instrumental highlights on the album). Back In N.Y.C is so raw and angry that if it was a bit simpler, it could almost be considered punk, especially the way Gabriel delivers his vocals. The Carpet Crawlers is the greatest ballad Genesis ever wrote, it is beautiful, and very well delivered, with its ethereal keyboard lines, and subtle guitar work. Lilywhite Lilliath opens the second disc the same way the title track opened the first, it features a great beatles-esque chorus. The Waiting Room is a creepy instrumental that sounds like it is a recording of hell untill the guitar comes in. The Lamia is another great ballad, that has great piano, and synth. The Colony Of Slippermen is the second discs epic, and it is very well constructed, this is the song where Peter Gabriel really has fun with his gift to do different voices. The Light Dies Down On Broadway features the same theme as the title track except slowed down and more psychedelic, I consider this song to be The Lamb's climax. Of course I just mentioned what I consider to be the best moments on the album, but every song on here is pretty good. The band all puts in great performances, but this is mainly Tony Banks's album musically as most of the songs are keyboard and synth dominated. Steve Hackett doesn't really have that many major guitar parts, but he does have alot of subtle parts that are really good. Mike and Phil create a great  rythym section, with many of the songs featuring very strong bass and drum parts.    The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway features great music and lyrics. If you are just getting into Genesis this is definately the best place to start, as it is overall their best album. Too bad that Peter Gabriel left the band soon after this album was completed, and Genesis began to slowly transform into the band that would make the many mediocre pop albums that were so popular in the 80's. Hopefully someday when people look at Genesis they can forget about the horrible pop band and just remember the amazing Prog rock band fronted by the great Peter Gabriel.

0735619670|4.0|The book is what I was looking for. It describes how do construct a smart program. The focus is on construction and not on design so there is only a short overview of good design although they tell you 1000 times to take more time in designing than in coding. <br />But a very good book anyway.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is not an album the average 'pop' fan should purchase. Purple Rain, Diamonds and Pearls, Batman & Musicology is the Prince of pop you need. This is musical and artistic genius. When Prince is dead this is the album he should be remembered for - frivolous to audience expectations, pure and organic production, spiritualy and sensually exhilirating and some of the tightest piece of musicianship ever recorded by a 'pop' musician. Apart from the dreary Mellow and comical Wedding feast, this album is flawless. The lush sequence between the title track and Muse 2 the pharoah, the voyeuristic experience of the \\"digital garden\\", the stanly clarke bass riffs and pitch perfect drumming on Everywhere, as well as the epic final three tracks which epitomise Prince's musical superiority amongst all of his so called contemporaries - all of this are reason enough for serious music lovers to challenge themselves to listen to this record and rise, rise, rise....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a loyal citizen of the \\"Buffy-verse\\", I was so delighted to discover--shortly after my hearbreak over the incomprehensible cancellation of \\"Angel\\"--that there was more of Joss out there yet to discover.  (\\"The WB?  They are like gypsies!  Spit, spit! We shall speak no more of them!\\")  I saw \\"Serenity\\" in the theater and immediately came home and ordered the \\"Firefly\\" DVD.  Please, God, tell me somewhere in the world there is a TV executive discerning enough to realize that Joss Whedon's work is a diamond glittering in the mountain of cow dung that is today's TV programming.  Meanwhile, order \\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity\\" both--you'll love them and they'll provide a much-needed Joss-fix until such time as he emerges once again victorious with either a new feature film or TV series. You can't stop the signal!
B0000028M7|5.0|What separates Alice in Chains from any other grundge or emo band is sadly that it was real emotion not angst. This had more of a melodic and passionate feel than others because the songs here are more about the pain of suffering from drugs and feeling hopeless, regret and even a song about about Jerry Cantrell's father's experience in the Vietnam war. Layne Staley gave a lyrical masterpiece, powerful and emotional and aggressive vocals, you might actually sympathies with his pain. Jerry Cantrell has some great riffs and solos and made variable guitar tempos from acoustic to aggressive shredding, and also wrote the majority of the songs. The bass guitar is actually audible with some strong slaps of the bass and the drummer gave great patterns and gave great tempo to this album. It is just sad that Layne's demons, which added to the feel of his music also is the one that caught up to him and led to Alice in Chains' demise which could lead some of us to figure out for ourselves the destructive nature of drugs and how not to become possessed by those demons( Just my Thought). Overall it is a quality album that everyone should buy and listen.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I found Legally Blonde to be the type of movie that helps you forget your troubles. Of course, that's what it's meant to do. The heroine is very blonde, very rich and devastated when her boyfriend, instead of proposing marriage, dumps her. So what does she do? Leave California behind and follow him to his prestigious law school, naturally. There, she will show them she's no dumb blonde. Her little dog is cute, too. An endearing little creature, if ever there was one.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|When Cabin Fever came out a few years back many people I know loved the film because of it's camp style, but still feverish gore. Peter Jackson praised the film, so many horror fans flocked to go see it. Many people thought that the film was too light hearted, and not dark enough. Director Eli Roth promised that his next film, Hostel, would be much darker without as much light hearted moments. Now released on January 6th, 2006 we can finally see what he is talking about. <br /> <br />The film as just that, not a horror film, is a pretty well organized one not suffering from shotty editing, rushed action sequences, score issues, acting, or dialogue. From the opening shots of the film, we get a very dark look to the torture area that is the topic of the film. The score throughout makes the intro very suspensful, and that hasn't even covered the other parts of the film yet.  <br /> <br />Then we get into the introducitons of the main characters. The 3 men, 2 of whom are from California, the other they met in France while Backpakcing are in Amsterdam enjoying what there is to enjoy. Checking out the red light district, enjoying some herbal substances. While out past curfew they meet Alex who informs them that in Brataslava there is a Hostel with many beautiful wemon who \\"love\\" American men. The 3 decide to head there the next day, and thus the rest of the film unfolds. <br /> <br />Is this film really as gory, twisted, macabre, and scary as they advertise it? Well for me it was 3 out of the 4 I listed above. Eli Roth writes with a lot of dark humor, so for someone like me who loves to laugh at brutal situations this film was defenitly twisted. There were limbs cut off, fingers sliced, autopsies performed, and a nice little scene with an torch. The only thing is I did not find the film scary. Suspensful? No question, but for scares the film really didn't make me cover my eyes in fear. I loved every blood soaked second of the torture scenes as Eli carefully shot each scene and used the special effects to the upmost advantage. <br /> <br />Eli Roth has defenitly done a better job with this film than he did with Cabin Fever. He matured as a writer and took elements of his dark comedy, but also went the extra step and took the brutality the whole extra mile. For horror fans this is what alot of us have been waiting for, and for non horror fans? Certain scenes may have you wanting to leave the theater, and or turn your eyes away but after all, it's only a movie right?
0743454537|5.0|this book was an extremely engrossing and a quick read. the subject matter was interesting and made you really consider whether what the parents where doing with their two daughters, anna and kate, was right. i had never really thought about this subject seriously before. it showed you that even though they had good intentions it doesnt always mean its best for everyone.  the ending was suprising, but having read some other of jodi picoult's books, not totally unexpected. i dont think it ruined it at all. it was just part of the story of their lives, which was unexpected.  besides being a controversial and interesting subject the story of kate's sickness was really intimate and heartbreaking.  overall it was a really amazing book, one that i wont forget for a long time.
B00005JLWN|3.0|I'm surprised at all the rave reviews. It's really nothing special. The movie is about how humans have decided to not feel emotion, with the help of a drug, so they never get angry enough to go to war again. How good can a movie be when everyone walks around without any emotion?
0740748475|5.0|I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard Calvin and Hobbes fan, but I'm certainly a big fan.  I have about 6 individual books and I've even designed a T-shirt for my freshman dorm with Calvin and Hobbes as the two party characters (don't tell Bill). <br /> <br />So let's skip what C&H is about and talk about this collection.  Best thing about it is that you get everything he's ever done, in one shot, in chronological order.  Each strip is dated, in order, 6 B&W followed by a Sunday color splash.  It's great to sit down and read one by one, kinda like going back in time. <br /> <br />Binding is good, not super, but good Chinese quality bindings.  Pages and paper are amazing, print quality is awesome.  I do wish they'd put a bookmark tassel to each book... I hate bookmarks.  Other than that, the only other draw back is the weight and size.  It is HEAVY and HUGE! <br /> <br />Otherwise it is all I'd hoped for!  Fun and awesome collection.
0156027321|5.0|First of all, I am not much of a fiction reader. I normally read nature writing, science, travel naratives, outdoors, natural history, etc. A friend of mine gave this book to me as a gift because she thought I might enjoy it. (She is not sure if she liked the book or not.) I started reading the book only because she gave it to me. <br /> <br />I found this story to be very well-written. I am not sure how much the introduction is true or not, but is leads well into the story. I liked the way the chapters were written. They jumped back and forth in time, and varied greatly in length. I was hooked right away, and then I had a hard time putting the book down. <br /> <br />I don't want to give much away about the story. I will say that I enjoyed reading about zoos, in general. I enjoyed the dialogs about the religions discussed in the main character's life. Some people might be offended by these. I enjoyed the main dramatic event of the book. I found it to be believable while reading it. <br /> <br />If there is something I didn't like, it was the end of the main dramatic event in the book. The book wrapped up kind of quickly. I wish it had gone on a little bit longer. Maybe that is because I didn't want it to end. I don't know. <br /> <br />There is some really strong scenes in the book. I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone under college age unless they were mature. <br /> <br />A good read. I am going to look at this author's other titles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002NRQTS|4.0|Rush's album Presto is known as the album where the band abandoned the heavy synth sound from their previous releases from Signals through Hold Your Fire and a return to the heavy rock sound that made them famous. However, while the songs  certainly hit harder and Alex Lifeson gets to let loose here more than he has since Moving Pictures, the keyboards are still here, although this time they add more to their songs rather than clutter them.<br /><br />One only needed to hear the great riff that opens \\"Show Don't Tell\\" to know that the old Rush was back. Yes, the long epics \\"2112\\" and \\"The Camera Eye\\" were now in the past and the instrumentals wouldn't return until \\"Where's My Thing?\\" from their next album Roll The Bones. But Presto is clearly a return to form as the songs here are their strongest overall since Grace Under Pressure and they grow on you with repeated listens. \\"The Pass\\", which deals with the issue of teen suicide, is one of the best songs the band has ever written. As Geddy Lee stated before performing it on the Vapor Trails tour, this is one of the band's favorite tracks and one of my personal favorites as well. Other great tracks include the aforementioned \\"Show Don't Tell\\", which features a cool little bass solo from Geddy, the driving \\"Scars\\", which the band should bring back on their next tour, and the half acoustic-half electric title track. Lifeson's solos are great throughout the album as he shows his strong musicianship by relying more on the song's feel rather than overplaying. While Neil Peart's drumming is solid throughout, he plays like a monster on \\"Scars\\", his lyrics are even better, especially on \\"The Pass\\", \\"Chain Lightning\\" and the piano driven \\"Red Tide.\\" The tracks \\"Superconductor\\" and \\"War Paint\\" are also very good. Like a lot of their later releases, Presto loses a little steam during the second half although the closing \\"Available Light\\" ends the album on a high note. While the band has played little from this album on their subsequent tours, this was their only release not represented on their 30th anniversary tour, it is a very good album which over the years has become their most underrated. It's definitely worth picking up.subsequent tours, this was their only release not represented on their 30th anniversary tour, it is a very good album which over the years has become their most underrated.

B0009S3HI0|5.0|Who would have thunk it- one of the best CDs of 2005 consists of a bunch of covers and acoustic versions of 4 previously released songs. This band once again proves that their releases should always be highly anticipated like great works of art. Even a \\"throw-away\\" album like this one.    And what a way to kick it off: \\"Savory\\" is an immediate classic and instantly ranks as one of the best opening tracks of any CD in recent memory. It is the type of song that can only be played at maximum volume and show Deftones at their at absolute butt-kicking best. This song and other jams like \\"Crenshaw Punch..\\" and \\"The Chauffeur\\" (a Duran Duran song!!) rock with a combination of unrelenting power and song arrangement sophistication. Every previously unreleased track (except for a few mis-steps like \\"Simple\\" and \\"No Ordinary Love\\") is a unique creation. Its a real eclectic collection and demonstrate how this band and its sound is constantly evolving.    But the most impressive thing about this album is how much better the re-released songs are in comparison to the originals. The fact is that if these versions of \\"Digital Bath\\" and \\"Teenager\\" had been on WHITE PONY, I would have rated that all-time classic even higher. And \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" becomes a delicate wonder versus the first version's unoriginal simplicity.     This release in undoubtably an appetizer Deftones have served up to their hardcore fans in order to tease us in advance of their new album (that will supposedly be released later in 2006). Kind of like SOAD did recently with \\"Steal This Album\\". But in a year that saw powerhouse bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Audioslave and My Morning Jacket putting out world class albums, B-SIDES & RARITIES is right up there as one of the best of 2006. It proves that Chino and co. deserve to be called modern day hard rock icons and true legends in the making.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|\\"The Final Cut\\" is Roger Water's statement against the Falkland War.  Even though this event is long past, it still applies to us today, especially with the situation in Iraq.  The theme of anti-war is timeless.    Song-by-Song:    1. The Post War Dream - A heartfelt reflection on how the dreams of hope after WWII were shattered by conflicts such as Vietnam and the Falklands.  There are, however, some racial slurs for the Japanese, so be warned.  The song has a powerful conclusion that challenges Margaret Thatcher, asking her what she has done to England.    2. Your Possible Pasts - A song about how after WWII, veterans' lives had been irreversibly altered and they could never live a peaceful ordinary life.  Musically, it is one of the best songs on the album.  Thematically, it provides a bridge between politics and the backstory of the oppresive schoolteacher from \\"The Wall,\\" which is coming up next.    3.  One of The Few - A veteran comes back from the war.  Tormented and confused, he decides to teach/torment children.  This song is basically the prelude to \\"The Hero's Return.\\"    Extra: When the Tigers Broke Free - This song from the film \\"The Wall\\" is included on the reissue.  It is a description of the death of Eric Fletcher Waters, Roger's father.  The song is heartfelt and really contributes to the album's overall themes.    4.  The Hero's Return - The story of the teacher continues.  He is frusterated with the children, who have no appreciation for the hard-earned freedom he fought for.  He is tormented by his experiences in the war, and his relationship with his wife is crumbling.  The song ends with a bridge into the next song where he says that there is \\"a memory too painful to withstand the light of day.\\"    5.  The Gunner's Dream - While many of the songs feel over the top, the one hits home like no other.  It is a gem that is supposedly the dying words of a soldier, who describes his own funeral, saying his goodbyes \\"in the corner of some foreign field.\\"  This suggests the gunner is a universal character, he could be any soldier dying abroad.  The gunner describes a place to retire to, a place that is not paradise, but close enough to satisfy a veteran.  The emotion overflows right up until the final line: \\"Take heed of the dream.\\"    6.  Paranoid Eyes - A calm number about being a soldier, hiding behind paranoid eyes.  It shows great insight, and is a welcome rest after the relative intensity of \\"The Gunner's Dream.\\"  It is a bridge back into the political themes of the album.    7.  Get Your Filthy Hands Off of My Desert - A number reminiscient of \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\" from \\"The Wall.\\"  It is Roger Water's description of the Falkland War, and the prelude to the next song.    8.  The Fletcher Memorial Home - One of the most angry political songs of all time, this song calls for all warmongering politicians (referred to as \\"overgrown infants\\" and \\"colonial wasters of life and limb\\") to be removed from their positions and institutionalized.  Many may be offended by this track; it calls for the removal of Ronald Reagan amongst others.    9.  Southampton Dock - A slow, emotional number about the troops disembarking to go to The Falkland Islands.  It begins by talking about the end of WWII and the vows for peace, then jumps foward in time to when these vows come crashing down.  We really feel the tragedy of the fall of the Post War Dream here.    10.  The Final Cut - Breaking away from politics, this track is a throwback to \\"The Wall.\\"  It seems that Pink (the protagonist of \\"The Wall\\") is singing, though exactly when the song takes place is unknown.  He sings about his usual alienation from life and his isolation from society.  The combination of the words, the tune, and the way they are sung makes this song a masterpiece.  Though it really doesn't fit in with the rest of the album, it is still a great song.    11.  Not Now John - In a sharp contrast with the rest of the album, this track is pure hard rock, full of aggressive guitar work.  We finally get to hear David Gilmour's voice during parts of this song, which is really a breath of fresh air after 10 or 11 tracks of Roger.  The lyrics discuss the dangers of international economic competition.  Disclaimer: This song is Pink Floyd's heaviest in profanity.    12.  Two Suns in the Sunset - The final song is a true gem.  Roger Waters sings about the everpresent threat of nuclear annihilation in a very calm manner.  The acoustic guitar riff and the poetic lyrics are solid genius.  The song ends with a session musician's saxophone solo, reminiscient of \\"The Gunner's Dream.\\"    The final word:  Buy this album, but don't expect it to be typical Pink Floyd.
B00001OH7T|4.0|'Young Americans' marks Bowie's transition from the outrageous glam rock of Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane and Diamond Dogs to disco tinged blue eyed soul. This album also gave Bowie his breakthrough overseas: the song 'Fame' was his first #1 in the US. Bowie's next record, 'Station to Station took this concept even further by marrying the funk to krautrock, with masterful results.   <br /> <br />This is not one of Bowie's most essential records, but it is very enjoyable and definitely worth owning. Unlike its predecessors, 'Young Americans' is an emotional rather than intellectually stimulating album. The musicianship is excellent, especially Bowie's soaring flexible vocals. I love the smooth and sensual mood the album evokes,  specific words matter less than the sound of his voice interplaying with the instruments. My favourite song on the album is the gorgeous ballad 'Win', in which Bowie gives one of his best vocal performances. Another standout, 'Can You Hear Me' is probably the most beautiful love song Bowie has ever written ('Wild is the Wing' is after all a cover). Other standouts include the frantically paced title track , which harkens back to more characteristic Bowie songwriting. Familiar themes of desperation, isolation and violence lurk behind the deceptively cheery musical backing. Finally, the simplistic yet highly effective single 'Fame' spitefully examines the price of celebrity. Even the biggest misstep on this album, the overblown cover of 'Across the Universe' is quite enjoyable when taken in context of the other songs.  <br /> <br />This isn't one of my favourite Bowie albums, but I still love it very much. I recommend it but recognize that it isn't Bowie's best work.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|Hostel (Eli Roth, 2006)<br /><br />[note: 250 words cut from review to meet Amazon length requirements.]<br /><br />Six or seven years ago, I saw Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood for the first time. Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the Guinea Pig series, they pretty much defined Japanese Extreme Horror in the eighties, and Flower... is the most extreme of the lot. It has no plot; it's just a guy in white face paint and a samurai suit dismembering someone for sixty minutes and change. My copy was a grainy, badly-tracked bootleg, and I was still utterly fascinated at the same time I was repulsed. The main thing that went through my mind is \\"who would make a movie like this?\\" When it was over, in some way I have never been able to define, I was changed.<br /><br />I tell you all this at the beginning of this review because, while Hostel falls far short of the high(?) points of Japanese Extreme Horror, as far as American movies go, the films that came before this leave a lot to be desired in the way of bare-bones filmmaking; America's contributions to Extreme Horror have always been somewhat cheesy.<br /><br />Eli Roth, on the other hand, knows how to make a movie; Cabin Fever was one of the best shaggy-dog jokes in years, and the director's cut had gore to rival Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer. Roth obtained the backing of Quentin Tarantino, who was similarly impressed with his first outing, and the two of them set about convincing the MPAA, I presume, that the reason Americans are utterly incapable of meeting Japanese New Horror on its own turf is because we never went through the painful childbirth of Japanese Extreme Horror. So, then, the question becomes-- what happens when you put a better filmmaker in charge of what is, essentially, a spiritually-bonded remake of the extreme revenge films of the seventies?<br /><br />The biggest criticism I can level against Hostel is not a fair one; simply put, it's not Japanese. Americans have a different set of taboos, and Roth wanted to go whole hog, so he's taking potshots at a whole batch of things that Japanese wouldn't even consider. Because of that, the first half of the film tends to drag. Once it gets going, though, you'll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between this and any Charles Bronson film that comes to mind, except you've got marginally better actors here.<br /><br />Two American grad students, Paxton (Ladder 49's Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Dumb and Dumberer's Derek Richardson) are taking some time off from school and backpacking through Europe. While in Paris, they hook up with Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson in his feature film debut), an Icelander with raging hormones. The three of them are traipsing through Europe in a sex- and drug-fueled haze when they bump into Alexei (fellow newcomer Lubomir Silhavecky), who promises them that there's a hostel in a small town in Slovakia that will cater to all their wildest desires. They set out for it, and find it to be nothing short of paradise.<br /><br />Now, the big problem is, you're already halfway through the movie, and the only scene that begins to do justice to the trailers is the opening credits. Those looking for a Guinea Pig-esque experience will no doubt be grandly disappointed by all this. But hang on, folks, things will start looking like the trailers eventually.<br /><br />The best thing about Hostel, by a mile, is the incredible cinematography. Milan Chadima, who normally acts as a second- or third-unit assistant director on his films, is equally at home filming gorgeous Slovakian panoramas, dark corridors, and the acres of nude female flesh that inhabit the first half of the film. Sometimes, with a movie this beautifully shot, it's possible to ignore a wooden script or bad pacing, but you don't need to here; while, as I said, the first half does tend to drag, once we get into the action, the pacing is pitch-perfect, and the main characters usually turn in good, if not exceptional, performances.<br /><br />But you couldn't care less about that. you want to know about the gore.<br /><br />The gore effects are, shall we say, impressive. It's not necessarily that there are a whole lot of them, it's the pervasiveness of the gore-drenched atmosphere in the second half of the film that really makes it all seem worthwhile. It's mostly just atmospheric, which is where the film falls so short of Japan's entries into the extreme horror world, but Roth does get personal with a minor character, Ikana (Puritan beauty Jennifer Lim). It's Ikana who, if this film has the effect on you that Guinea Pig 2 did on me, will leave you fundamentally changed.<br /><br />When you put all the pieces together, Hostel is flawed, but Eli Roth has traversed far more distance than any other filmmaker in dragging America, and its painfully Victorian MPAA, kicking and screaming into the 1980s. The amount of stuff Roth got away with, even in the theatrical cut, is cause for unreserved celebration. I can't wait for the director's cut, to see how much more he had to leave out.<br /><br />The short version of all this is: if you're looking for a nonstop extreme horror ride, Guinea Pig 2 is no longer the obscure, hard-to-find title it was when I was reduced to buying a crappy bootleg on ebay; you can get a gorgeous remastered DVD now. You can even buy it from Amazon. And you'd probably be better off doing do. But if you want a film that's going to attack American values all the way around, where you just happen to get some good gore in the process, and you want something made in America, you will not, as of this writing, find a film that got major distribution anywhere in American history that fulfills the requirements nearly as well as does Hostel. ****mances. <br /> <br />But you couldn't care less about that. you want to know about the gore. <br /> <br />The gore effects are, shall we say, impressive.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|This is not rocket science, just good rock n' roll.  Everyone of the naysayers about this band is dead on wrong..These guys have staying power and are cool just for sticking with the same standards they applied on the last two CD's.   <br /> <br />Listen to it and see for yourself.  Good stuff.
0141301155|5.0|Like other previous reviewers, I was naïve about this film being based on a book.  Having now read it, I have a much greater appreciation for the story itself.  This could be said with regard to just about any book/film combination.<br /><br />The most significant difference (which I won't divulge too many of the details of in case of spoiling the ending for you) is the addition of an episode with the fizzy lifting drink in the film.  Also, in the book, all children but Charlie have two parents with them instead of one.<br /><br />This is a charming book which I'd recommend to child and adult alike.  It is very easy reading, which must be one of the reasons why Dahl is so popular.  Easy reading doesn't always mean that everyone can polish a book off in an hour or so, like others often say they have done.  So don't feel encouraged if you didn't read this as quickly as your friends.  The main thing is to read and enjoy it - and keep reading!<br /><br />Not only is it a heart-warming story, but there are quite a number of indictments of our sinful nature.  The main thrust of the story is that all the children (and adults) who go into the factory with Charlie are quite naughty.  This is all with the exception of Charlie, who wins a special reward in the end.  Charlie is good, doubtlessly because of his good upbringing and humble surroundings.  We can all learn from such simple lessons.  The one I personally need to listen to most of all is the warning not to watch too much television, brought to us courtesy of Mike Teavee.<br /><br />5 stars without hesitation.
6305181772|4.0|\\"Mission: Impossible\\" takes the basic premise from the TV series, the theme music and the character of Jim Phelps and reinvents them for this enjoyable action movie. This review was originally written for the first edition of the DVD. First an update--the earlier DVD looked decent but the new DVD is a marked improvement. We get a sharp looking anamorphic transfer with bold colors. Some digital flaws occasionally show up but they're not all that big a deal. The previous edition had no real extras to speak but here we get some decent ones. \\"40 Years of Creating the Impossible\\" basically is a promo for Tom Cruise's films not for the series per se. Most of the extra featurettes are short but entertaining and interesting. Most important you get a movie ticket to see \\"MI3\\" if you choose to acccept that mission. Overall this edition is a marked improvement over the previous version of the film<br /><br />Phelps (Jon Voight)puts together a team including Ethan Hunt (Cruise), Phelps wife Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas)and Jack Harmon (Emilio Estevez)to catch a diplomat stealing the identities of US Undercover agents. When the sting goes horribly wrong, Ethan and Claire appear to be the only survivors of the operation. Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny who has playing bueracrats down to a fine art)an IMF supervisor believes that Ethan betrayed both his team and the IMF acting as a mole selling information about the organization.<br /><br />Ethan and Clarie are on the run but not before Ethan hatches a plan to prove his innocence and find out who murdered his teammates; he uses IMF's database to track down two disavowed (basically agents that have been busted for one reason or another whether they were caught doing something illegal by IMF or by another government)agents Luther Strikell (Ving Rhames) a computer expert and tough guy Franz Krieger (Jean Reno)to tap into the IMF mainframe and steal information that will help Ethan trap the real mole and prove his innocence.<br /><br />A taunt thriller well directed by Brian DePalma (\\"Sisters\\", \\"Obesession\\", \\"Carrie\\", \\"The Untouchables\\", \\"Carlito's way\\")and co-written by David Koepp (\\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", \\"Panic Room\\" and \\"War of the Worlds\\"), Robert Towne (\\"Chinatown\\", \\"Personal Best\\")based on a story by Koepp and Steve Zailian (\\"Schindler's List\\", \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" and \\"The Falcon and The Snowman\\"), the film isn't an extension of the TV show so much as a reinvention.

B00005T30L|3.0|Long, slow scenes. Lots of swearing (supposedly to indicate the offhanded angst of the two main characters (Thora Birch as Enid and Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca) and a story as uneventfully told as any my wife and I have seen in a long time.    The plot can be told in a sentence: Two recent high school grads with hopes of moving into an apartment together play a cruel joke on a nerdish record collector (played to perfection by the always outstanding Steve Buscemi), with the ringleader girl (Enid) later feeling sorry for him, (somewhat) falling for him, sleeping with him, ruining his life big time and then leaving town, without telling anyone, for parts unknown.    Ho-hum.    My wife and I kept waiting for this movie to go somewhere, to reach a higher level of either (a) dialog, (b) wit, (c) social commentary, (d) action, (e) humor, or (f) drama. But we waited in vain. The pace of the movie was the same from start to finish. And the only \\"action\\" was Enid completely ruining her much older, sad sack \\"boyfriend's\\" life even more than before she first met him.    Even the usually brilliant Bob Balaban looked hopelessly out of place and somewhat uncomfortable in this movie. His exceptional talents were wasted, as were Scarlett Johansson's.    In the end, as Enid drives off in a bus and the screen fades to black, one is left with an awful feeling in the pit of one's stomach. We felt terribly sorry for Steve Buscemi's character. We felt only disgust for Enid. We felt as though Rebecca dodged a bullet by not moving in with her loser friend. And, overall, we felt that this film was a lot like life with all of its twists, turns and tragedies -- too much so to be of value as entertainment. It was like watching a Reality Show. Nothing much really happened from what normally might happen in the course of a few weeks in the lives of these 3-4 people.    I know this movie is critically acclaimed. But I can't figure out why. The acting was so-so. The plot was pedantic. The directing was unfocused. The humor was dry.    Scarlett Johansson has gone one to better roles (Lost in Translation and A Love Song for Bobby Long just to name two), so if you'd like to trace this talented young actress' career, Ghost World is best seen as a stepping stone -- a deeply flawed film that filled gaps in her resume while she prepared for her next role.
B000059XYL|1.0|This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews above the only exception is concerning the Sex and Nudity statment This programme was targeted at the Mature viewer (hence a 15 certificate in europe) and the Sex issue was dealt with exstreemly well , Lets just say the most you see is a undraped back of a beautifull women ' Oh terrible'' The sets are great, Script is strong And the acting is anything but wooden, My only critism is that you don't realy get empathy with the characters but that could really be due to the shortness of the run...  <br />Still want to watch a great alternative to trekker or babylon/ Galactica. Enjoy!!!!!
0684824906|5.0|I read this book in a few days, and it's about 700 plus pages long. An incredible account of the way Lincoln worked with people who were his competitors for the presidency, and yet how he molded them into a cabinet. Wish they'd taught history like this when I was younger. <br /> <br />I've read a number of other books about Lincoln, but this is a totally different view of him. The same person, but really shows his ability to work with incredibly different, and sometimes difficult people.
B00005B4GU|5.0|As a college-age rock-and-roll lover, I immediately took to Radiohead the first time I ever heard them. Amnesiac is a great, if not unorthodox model of Radiohead's style. Thom Yorke's smooth, lilting voice holds you spellbound as he croons a seductive \\"You and Whose Army?\\". You can't help but close your eyes and drink in \\"Knives Out\\". The bizarre techno-effects of \\"Push/Pulk Doors\\" makes for great dance music. \\"Life in a Glass House\\" was the song I used to listen to after a fight with my boyfriend. Thom's sullen gentle singing of \\"Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend..\\" and the mix of trumpets and snare drums matched my mood perfectly. The music fills your space, whether it's room or car. All in all, Amnesiac is a winner.

B00005MP58|4.0|Austen's stories are for women of every age.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett is easily one of the top ten female characters ever written. Her intelligence, strength, wit, and charm is admirable and timeless. My sisters, mother, grandmother, and I spent a long, enjoyable afternoon getting lost in the manners and morals of the 18th Century.<br /><br />Having recently seen the Keira Knightley version, I purchased the Special DVD (A&E/BBC) version, eager to compare it to what I previously thought was one of the finest novel-to-screen adaptations. Yes, they're both well done, but this one is better.<br /><br />Jennifer Ehle is a wonderful Elizabeth Bennett and I echo the many who say that Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />I found the character of Jane, the eldest and described in the book as the most beautiful of the Bennett sisters, to be rather homely and not believable at all as the prettiest sister.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that the Special DVD version (Full screen) seems narrowed and squished into the frame, giving the entire film an unnatural feel that I don't remember from viewing the BBC version on broadcast television.<br /><br />Yes, Austen's stories are written for and about women, but men who like a good, romantic, witty, period piece will enjoy this one, too. It's six hours, though, so prepare to not be able to pause it.
B000066I6N|1.0|Ok I am not in agreence with most of the reviews here. I can't believe this was an actual Robert Plant approved release! The songs are weak from beginning to end no matter their history. I've been a fan of Plants solo work for the most part. I have not been a fan of his outtings with Jimmy Page as they are boring droing affairs as is this $15.00 coaster. I was hoping the he got all those weird noises and rythems out of his system while playing with Page. Alas he has not at all... This album is not in anyway comparible to his solo history. The man sounds old and tired on every vocal. He might sound believable in his delivery but still that cannot sell the music he's putting forth. Production quality is decent as to be expected from Plant but I keep harping about the songs and they are the weakness of this album. If your a fan of vanilla folk music with african/indian instruments then great your in for a treat. If you want to hear the man rock or croon look elsewhere.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old daughter received these from Santa and they have been a big hit!  The first night she jumped in the tub and immediatly started making all the car and truck noises and putting them on the road.  They foster great vocabulary skills when you can talk about all the different types of vehicles and transportation.  What I especially like is the colors.  It is hard to find cars and trucks that aren't the traditional red and blue.  They are more girl friendly without being too \\"girly\\" for little boys.  They are very sturdy and store easily in the mesh bag provided.  The only downfall is there could be more road pieces.  Otherwise, a great tub toy!
1400034779|5.0|My mother in law turned me on to these books.  I read the first one in a day and went to the library for the rest.  I am dying to know what Bush Tea is like.  I loved the simplicity and honesty of Botswana.  I'd love this whole series to be on PBS or a movie.  And the main character had better be a 'traditionally built' Botswanan woman!  It's fun and entertaining to read.  I love these characters.
B000000OA6|5.0|Yep, the title says it all, this is one of Queen's best right next to Queen II and ANATO.  There is a very dark and emotional presence here, (most likely because Freddie was dying at the time) but that does not stop the music from being great.   <br /> <br />The title track is the most progressive Queen has been since they're Queen II days, and sounds like a hybrid of Queen and Led Zeppelin.  The next song, \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" was Freddie's way of poking fun at himself, even in his time of dying.  It's a very eccentric tune, and this makes it recognizable when talking about songs by the band.  \\"Headlong\\" continues the album's streak of great songs, it's a fun and fast rocker that is, again, not like anything Queen had done before.  \\"I Can't Live With You\\" is more of a pop-rocker, but it is still very enjoyable.  \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" is, IMO, one of Queen's best ballads, and shows the darkness and emotion is this album.  However, I believe that \\"Ride the Wild Wind\\" isn't as strong as the first five songs, it is great lyrically, but musically, it doesn't have the same luck.  \\"All God's People\\" is a step up, but it probably would've been better if it was reworked a little more.   <br /> <br />Side Two opens with \\"These Are the Days Of Our Lives\\", another ballad, but this time it's even more heartfelt and sad.  It definitely ranks as one of Queen's best.  The next two songs, \\"Delilah\\" and \\"The Hitman\\", I believe are the two weakest songs of the album, but \\"Bijou\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\" make up for them. <br /> <br />\\"Bijou\\" is another very heartfelt and emotional song, you can see from the atmosphere.  I believe in would've been better if it was longer, and in some sense, it's reminiscent of the opening of Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Show Must Go On\\" is, along with the title track and TaTDoOL, one of Queen's most brilliant songs.  It's not so much the guitar work or lyrics in this song, it's mostly because of the pure and raw emotion in Freddie's voice.  That being said, the lyrics and the guitar work ARE amazing, in their own right. <br /> <br />This is one of those albums that has a certain...aura that most albums today just can't achieve. Like The Beatles \\"Abbey Road\\", Joy Division's \\"Closer\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\", this album is very emotional and heartfelt (as if I had to say that again).  If your a fan of any of those albums, I highly recommend this to you.  If your a fan of Queen, I tell you that this is a must-have.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Don't get me wrong.  This show is not like Buffy or Angel at all.  Well, it shares lots of the same comedic method, but the plot, story, characters, theory, cinematography, heck EVERYTHING else is 100% original.   <br /> <br />I can't say enough about this show.  If you can wrap your mind around the sci-fi setting, I promise you'll LOVE it.  I know I did.
B000087F6M|2.0|\\"Legal Eagles\\" is supposed to be a comedy. We're supposed to find the characters played by Robert Redford and Debra Winger to be amusing, their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious, and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying.    The problem is that the movie is too dumb to be taken seriously, and thus too dumb to be funny.    Briefly, the story takes place in New York. Robert Redford is an assistant District Attorney about to be promoted to be the DA. Debra Winger is a defense attorney, and Daryl Hannah is a young woman with emotional problems, and is Debra Winger's client. The plot involves a fire 20 years ago, when Daryl Hannah was eight, a fire that killed her artist father and purportedly destroyed a large number of his paintings. This experience left Daryl Hannah traumatized, but all is not as it seems, and now, 20 years later, Daryl Hannah is first accused of attempted theft and later of murder.    Unfortunately, the plot involves many elements that simply don't make sense. I won't go into detail, but Roger Ebert does a good job of listing four different major things that make the plot completely unbelievable.    As well as the story being dumb I found some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny to be anything but.     For example, Robert Redford is a weekend father to a teenage daughter. At one point his ex-wife threatens to go to court to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Robert Redford makes a telephone call to his ex-wife's home and starts an angry monologue of threats about how he'll take her apart in court. Then he realizes that he's actually talking to his daughter! This mistake is apparently supposed to be hilarious. Ha, ha.    In another scene Robert Redford and Debra Winger are together and see one of the bad guys. Robert Redford takes off on foot to try to catch him. Debra Winger, who doesn't know how to drive a car, feels it necessary for her to jump into Robert Redford's car and try to follow him. She makes a wrong turn and finds herself going the wrong way into traffic on a wide heavily trafficked street. There follows one minute of her frantically dodging cars at the last moment. Very funny. Ha, ha, ha.    This movie could have been a fairly good romantic thriller if they had fixed the plot and not tried to be a comedy. But the dumb plot and the unfunny attempts at comedy make it a complete waste of time.    Rennie Petersen
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush's \\"Moving Pictures\\" is a little cheesy, but considering all of the songs are good-if-not-great helps it a lot (and you would hope so considering there's only 7 songs here). Geddy Lee sounds pretty reminiscent of most 70's metal vocalists, and the musicianship sounds like it's new-wave-influenced-rock - it's also really tight and clear (this is probably the biggest attractor for the album besides the \\"classic\\" songs \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Limelight\\", \\"Red Barchetta\\" and \\"The Camera Eye\\"). The drums on \\"The Camera Eye\\" are especially fun and interesting to listen to. \\"Moving Pictures\\" is indeed a very tightly produced album. The lyrics tend to be pretty uninteresting albeit relatively catchy - I don't think they were the focal point for the band here. This is essentially a have-fun-rocking-out record and it certainly succeeds there. I think that a lot of people will really like it, and for $8.00 this is a steal! Absolutely recommended!  <br /> <br />Highlights include:  <br />the entire album!
B000000ORE|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!! <br /> <br />I remember at the time of it's release there seemed to be some thought that this album wasn't as strong as \\"Mechanical Resonance\\". Looking back at these first two albums now, whilst the songs on the debut were more immeadiate, it's \\"The Great Radio Controversy\\" which has really stood the test of time. <br /> <br />Standout tracks? \\"Hang Tough\\" is brooding, moody and powerful (still love the piano breakdown piece as well); \\"Heaven's Trail\\" was a mini anthem for me as a twenty something wannabe rock star; \\"The Way It Is\\" is a perfectly weighted upbeat ballad and need anymore be said about \\"Love Song\\"; the rest of the heavy rock fraternity should have just given up on power ballads after that. <br /> <br />I've often thought that it's a shame that Tesla get thrown in with the other 80's hair bands. They were always more than just part of the hair metal scene and with the possible exception of Cinderella, are the only band of that genre whose material has really stood the test of time. <br /> <br />Just do yourself a favour and buy this album!!!
B000002MY3|5.0|Though Alanis Morisette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is arguably barely a classic, you'll still like it a heck of a lot. A couple things hinder the experience, however - A: Alanis's voice is pretty bad (yet oddly likable) and B: it's too poppy for her subject matter (the musicianship, though very catchy, is pretty dull). With all that aside, though, this album still has a bunch of very fun hits that also have occasionally disturbing and always interesting lyrics. They perfectly capture teenage angst in the eyes of a 19-year old girl. If there's one thing Alanis' voice is good for its in capturing the anger and authenticness of a teenage girl who's clearly mad at the world. The instrumentation is very poppy which doesn't necessarily work with the lyrics, but in the end you just won't care about that. This was also a pretty influential album in its day, paving the way for women to be likable and popular in the alternative pop rock genre (it did wonders for women in music - at least around the time of its release, anyway). Hits like \\"Hand In My Pocket\\", \\"Ironic\\", \\"You Oughta Know\\" and \\"Head Over Feet\\" all make this an extremely satisfying purchase. It's like a greatest hits CD that also happens to be an album! Pop rock fans will definitely love this album despite its flaws. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"All I Really Want\\"  \\"You Oughta Know\\"  \\"Perfect\\"  \\"Hand In My Pocket\\"  \\"Forgiven\\" (sort of)  \\"You Learn\\"  \\"Head Over Feet\\"  \\"Mary Jane\\" (sort of)  \\"Ironic\\"
0062502182|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! Because of the author Paulo Coelho I now pray to God and the Source of the Universe. I recommend that everyone reads this book, because while at the same time it's a love story, an adventure, and it makes you question your own being.
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M. is one of the best bands alive today, and although they aren't as good as they used to be, their older albums still stand the test of time. \\"Automatic For The People\\" is but another classic in their impressive catalog which will surely not disappoint. It's arguably a more emotional and deep album than their predecessors were, and it has three classic songs - \\"Everybody Hurts\\", \\"Man On The Moon\\" (which is a great tribute to the late Andy Kaufman) and \\"Nightswimming\\". The rest are, fortunately, just as amazing. The lyrics are always extremely interesting and emotional. Michael Stipe still sings as passionately as ever (he has one of the best and most unique voices in the business), and most of the songs here get their emotional power almost entirely from his delivery (see \\"Nightswimming\\", especially). Overall this is just an amazing album that most people will love. Absolutely recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Everybody Hurts\\"  \\"Man On The Moon\\"  \\"Nightswimming\\"  these are the standouts, but the rest are great, too
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is a brilliantly captured concert, and as anyone reading these postings can tell, highly anticipated.  The currently displayed release date of January 1, 2010 is of course disheartening to many.  However it seems perhaps this is a generic 'placeholder' date used by the distributors, until a confirmed release date is reached.  We may yet see this title in 2006... <br /> <br />...to that end, I came across a blog comment, dated 12/31/2005, from David Gilmour's personal website ([...]) that states: <br /> <br />\\"2006 promises to be a very good year for fans of David and Pink Floyd, with the release of 'On An Island', a tour of Europe and North America and also the 'P.U.L.S.E.' concert from 1994 coming out on DVD.\\" (embedded paragraph towards the end of the blog) <br /> <br />Of course this doesn't hold credo any more than the manifold prior promises of release spanning the last 3 years, but there is still hope!
B0000AI45P|5.0|I'll admit that I'm not usually a fan of punk music, but Television's \\"Marquee Moon\\" is just way too good not to like. There a ton of classics here - \\"See No Evil\\", \\"Venus\\" and \\"Friction\\" are but a few. Tom Verlaine does an excellent job with the vocals, he's punkish yet still likable and accessible. He verges on being unlikable, but he somehow manages never to cross that line. The songs themselves have great qualities - the lyrics, musicianship and overall appeal is just fantastic. The production, though dated (I have the older and unremastered version, though) is very well done. You can tell these guys are great musicians and songwriters. Every song here is fantastic, and those classics I mentioned before definitely make things that much better. Its historical influence also definitely adds to its rating and worth. Punk fans will most definitely love this album, and chances are fans of other genres will also like it a lot (even if some of the songs tend to venture off into non-catchiness). This is highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West has an exceptional debut album.  The album is entitled \\"The College Dropout\\".  This album was leaked heavily, but Kanye added some new songs for those that bought the official copy.  I love this CD and find myself listening to it quite often.  As the title of my review states, West has endless talent.<br /><br /> For those that are unaware, Kanye produced his entire album.  The production is really good, but its his word play that really lured me in.  I love it!  I also love his sincerity.  He doesn't sugarcoat anything.  Most rappers don't, but Kayne just seems more sincere than most.  \\"Jesus Walks\\" is an example of Kanye's sincerity.  I can count on one hand the rappers that would make a song like this, let alone release it.  That was definitely groundbreaking.  The song is about how good Jesus is. He also talks about how afraid some Djs are to play a song like that, especially created by a rapper.  \\"Last Call\\" is a deep song about Kanye's past, his family in particular.  I like this song, though its kind of eerie.  \\"Workout Plan\\" was just plain creative!  Kanye tells women how they can pull men of status.  He also has women on their who supposedly tried his workout plan, and it worked for them!  So not only is Kanye is big time producer, a sensational rapper, and an accident survivor, he also has a sense of humor.  \\"All Falls Down\\" is one of the deepest songs on the album.  It talks about women who have physical beauty and success, but she is still unhappy. This is an album highlight, although he should not have Syleena Johnson on the hook, she doesn't sound too hot.  \\"Two Words\\" is really something to listen to.  Mos Def brings us a real treat with his verse.  It will probably make your jaw drop; it's that good!<br /><br /> Kanye covers many subjects and takes his listener through so many moods during this album.  I have heard people from age 10-50 say they enjoyed this album.  So, this isn't a rap album that is geared just for rap fans.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who is interested.  4 stars. Why just four?  Some of the interludes are dumb, and a couple of the songs sound a little strange, and some songs are better than others.  But, don't get me wrong, I love it!!!<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. We Don't Care<br /><br />2. All Falls Down<br /><br />3. Never Let Me Down<br /><br />4. Two Words<br /><br />5.

B0000AM6K2|4.0|With the two opening tracks \\"1972\\" and \\"Love Vibration\\", one would think the rest of the album would be just as wonderful. Unfortunately, this was not so. The rest is good, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely disappointing if you're expecting to hear more songs that sound like these first two. Josh is a pretty good singer, though he's certainly not great. He's about as good as the singer of a local band you know. Lyrically the songs are usually pretty good, especially on the first two tracks, but during the course of the album they get increasingly hard to make out and less-worthy of repeated listens. After \\"Love Vibration\\" the album slows down and gets a lot mellower. The musicianship is pretty good and interesting, too - he throws in some jazz influences here and there as well as some cool instruments (bongos, for example). Overall it sounds very much like 70's rock (hence the name of the album!). There's a good chance you'll like the rest of the album if you go into it without thinking the rest will sound anything like the first two tracks. It comes close to being a classic, but for some reason it doesn't \\"wow\\" you like other classics like Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\" or James' \\"Laid\\" do (random examples). Still, this is a very good singer/songwriter album which I think might appeal to a good number of people. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"1972\\"  \\"Love Vibration\\"  \\"Rise\\"  the rest are good, too - these are just the standouts
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Catchy songs with great lyrics.  Although the lead singer's voice is strikingly similar to that of fall out boy, the actual music is uh, quite different and i cant see why or how people would label them as copy cats.  <br /> <br />very original, but a few of the songs are not my style.
B000002BBY|5.0|Though \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" takes a more pop-oriented approach than its predecessor, it's still very much another classic by Oasis. It's definitely a more appealing album as it has three classic Beatles-esque songs - \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\". The rest of the album, fortunately, is just as good, and Noel Gallagher sings just as passionately as he did on \\"Definitely Maybe\\". The lyrics are much easier to make out than on \\"Definitely Maybe\\", and they're indeed very memorable and catchy (on their three hits, especially). You'll absolutely love singing along to those songs. This is indeed an incredibly appealing album that most people will love if they didn't like the first one as much. Pick up \\"Definitely Maybe\\" too!! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Wonderwall\\"  \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\"  \\"Champagne Supernova\\"  the rest are also great, but these are the standouts
B000B8QEZG|5.0|i really like this album and there are few albums around right now and lately that can hold that title.  nowadays you cant find an album that you can listen to all the way through.  and this one does not drop the beats for one second.  the first time i heard hung up i could not get it out of my head.  the song is that good.  i also have a soft spot for the song simply because it samples from abba.  i love the fact that this song can pack the dance floor and everyone has fun.  my second favorite song is sorry.  it is a great song that just says \\"i am done listening.\\"  sounds like a great break up song and she lets him know it.  the beat behind the song is awesome and i could just see madge going after some dude and just letting him have it and then leaving with no regrets.  this is great music if you could visualize a scenario for a song.  jump is a great dance song also.  it is like an adventure that the listener to go on.  it is a dare and one that everyone should take.  these three songs are the real stand outs for me.  although like i said before the whole album rocks and can be listened to over and over and over.  this is a real return to form and ranks right up there with ray of light and the music albums.  let us hope that she can keep up her greatness and give us another excellent madonna album in the near future.

B00003CXAA|4.0|What is there to say about the Godfather Series.  They are a part of the American Culture as Apple Pie.  Although, one thing I am dissapointed in with the movie--certain scenes within the movies, in which the Don would speak in his darkened decision making office are extremely dark.  One can barely make out the Don much less the setting.  One would think with all the technology available today, those parts of the movie would be alot clearer.  Maybe they will release a \\"Newly improved Godfather Series \\".
B00004XPPC|4.0|Most war movies are either pro-war or against it.  This film refuses to get bogged down in politics.  Instead, it's a character study, which happens to be set during a war.<br /><br />The movie primarily focuses on the story of two men.  One, portrayed by Alec \\"Obi Wan\\" Guinness is a British officer.  The second, played by William Holden, is an American POW.  The two cross paths briefly in a Japanese prison camp, before Holden escapes.<br /><br />The character played by Guinness is a prim and proper soldier.  His men surrender to the Japanese, and are then put to work building a bridge.  Guinness bristles when the Japanese colonel expects his officers to do manual labor, and the two have a stand off as Guinness expects to be treated by the rules of the Geneva Convention.  Eventually, Guinness wins a contest of wills and convinces his men to build a bridge that will show the Japanese the proper way to do things.<br /><br />Once Holden escapes, he is recruited by British commandos.  Their purpose is to find the POW camp and destroy the bridge, thus preventing the Japanese from completing their railroad.<br /><br />David Lean directed this film, and he was a master of epic films.  Along with this, he also made \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" and \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\"  This film is definitely an epic, clocking in at around three hours.  Compared to modern war films, some people might find it boring.  There's not a lot of action.  Instead, the movie is built around the characters and strong acting from Guinness, Holden, James Donald, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa.  This movie doesn't reward you lots of explosions and blood, but instead it builds the characters up until the suspense becomes palpable in the last 20 minutes, as you sit on the edge of your chair wondering what each man will do in the end, and what the final result will be.<br /><br />If you're looking for blood, guts, and glory, this movie probably won't satisfy you.  The same is true if you're looking for a political statement.  But if you're interested in a good character study of complex men under pressure, you can't go wrong with this classic.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Just got the DVD and have the following to say: <br />1. If you want to see people jumping off speakers and running around crazy barely re-creating their own songs. <br />DON'T BUY THIS DVD.  <br />2. If you think being so talented you sound as good live as you do in the studio is bad (what a sin). <br />DON'T BUY THIS DVD. <br />3. If you want to hear great music, done well. <br />BUY THE DVD. <br /> <br />The mix up is great with lot's of small changes and if your a fan you can tell the eagles are changing it up a bit, more horns and good sax group. Great to see Joe Walsh up on his feet and saying so. Three hours of enjoyment for me and my wife, if my toe was not tapping, we were dancing. <br /> <br />Kemper Galyean
B0001US8FI|5.0|If you see this movie for the first time today, you might be let down.  It really can't compare to the wire tricks seen in some movies, or the incredible antics of someone like Jet Li.<br /><br />To truly appreciate this film, you have to remember when it was made, and then you have to look on the impact it had.  \\"Enter the Dragon\\" was intended to be the film that would introduce Lee to an American audience.  It was made in Hong, but the film is in English and it was directed by an American.  On top of that, the film features an established Hollywood star (John Saxon) to make the movie easier to market, and it also features Jim Kelly, a black fighter, who fills the Blaxploitation role that was popular in many American films in the seventies.<br /><br />In many ways, the movie lacks originality.  The plot involves a group of men showing up on an island where a kung fu tournament is being held.  Among them is Bruce Lee, who's working undercover for a government agency out to get the man running the tournament.  Obviously, chaos ensues. The movie often draws comparisons to James Bond films, probably due to the simple plot and the over-the-top villains, which include a Chinese bodybuilder (Bolo Yeung), a giant American with a beard and scars, and an insane criminal with a fake hand.<br /><br />Despite the borrowed elements, this movie was still groundbreaking in terms of kung fu films.  If your a fan of the genre, it's easy to see the influences this movie had on many of the movies that would follow, including famous American directors like Quentin Tarantino.  Most importantly, it brought attention to the genre that led to more films (and stars like Chan or Li) making it to the US.<br /><br />As far as extras in the two disc set:  you get an assortment of documentaries on Lee and the making of the film.  If you're a big fan of Bruce Lee, you will probably enjoy watching them, although they probably won't be of any interest to a casual fan.

0060955775|3.0|So this was his first title I've read. I really wanted to give it more stars but I couldn't do it. <br /> <br />It was easy to relate to Veronika, I think he wrote her beautifully. It ends up being an uplifting book and yes, there are a few things to learn in this book. He actually introduces me to a few subjects I'd like to look further into and honestly gave me a new perspective on a few things. I really liked that about this book. <br /> <br />I don't think the asylum and a lot of the activities are based in reality. Though I'm not speaking from any personal knowledge what-so-ever. Just what I imagine to be my truth of those institutions. But I will say it could be different from what I envision because it's more like a private hospital. <br /> <br />All and all, I'm not a \\"faith\\" type person, but I liked his writing style, his character development wasn't bad and I read the book faster than I do most. I will also admit that it's thinner than the other books I read as well! <br /> <br />Annette
B00005JOFO|1.0|Utterly objectionable - and not for the reasons you'd think.  Vito Russo's classic The Celluloid Closet exhaustively details how Hollywood films time and again deliver the same message about the fate of anyone who engages in \\"the love that dares not speak (or in the case of Ennis Del Mar, mumble) its name.\\"  The heterosexual norm can only be maintained if gay lovers either die or end up miserable and alone.  Sound familiar?  Brokeback Mountain is hardly any different than outdated films and books such as The Children's Hour, The Victim, The Well of Loneliness or even Cruising -all of which scholars agree remain interesting primarily as documents of society's antiquated and harmful views of homosexuality.  Then there's the gay \\"esthetic\\" of the movie:  a cinematic rendering of the pathetic \\"straight-acting, no fats, no femmes\\" personal ad, with more than a touch of sanitized Advocate Men fantasy fiction thrown in for good measure.  I thought the real low point came about 3/4s the way through the movie when Jack, rebuffed by Ennis, goes to a third-world, film-noirish Mexico to seek out furtive, shadowy sex on what seems to be a leftover set from Touch of Evil.  The year is roughly 1978.  Yes, the height of the disco era.  I guess a weekend in L.A. or Dallas would have out of the question for him.  At this point the movie has its heels so firmly planted in the recidivistic 1950s celluloid closet of its own making, there's simply no hope.  The movie does raise some interesting questions however:  Were there any gay people involved in the scripting or making of this film?  Were there really no gay actors available to play these parts?  (Doth I protest too much?  Ask yourself this question:  how would the public react to a movie about two inner city black girls that was written by Ben Stein and acted by Paris Hilton and Gwyneth Paltrow....)  Leaving us finally to deal with message of the movie's sub-plot:  closeted gay fathers - in their quests to remain eternal Peter Pans - pose a threat to the institutions of family and marriage.  I can't imagine a message we need less right now in America!  The hype machines have been in overdrive about how this is a \\"mainstream\\" gay film where \\"A-list\\" heterosexual actors, writers, authors, etc. are \\"unafraid\\" to openly address gay issues.  Doesn't that sound suspiciously like kind of self-interested condescension that led recording artists in the `50s with nothing of their own to say to cover the hits of Ray Charles and Little Richard to \\"sanitize\\" them for white ears?

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is by far Madonna best album to date that makes you want to hit the clubs!  The whole album is high energy and the songs all mix together so it is non-stop.   <br /> <br />Hung Up- Her first single and for good reason.

Not one of my favorites but still good. 3/5 <br /> <br />Sorry-Her next single and I think it will be another big hit although not as good as other tracks on the record that could of been released.  3/5 <br /> <br />Future Lovers-Disco beat.  Good dance song. 4/5 <br /> <br />I Love New York-One of my favorites.

B000BRBA8S|4.0|Like Fernando Meirelles, Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai comes up with visually arresting, highly kinetic films that strike emotional chords with audiences that transcend individual cultures. What strikes me most about this 2004 film is the feverish sexual energy that Wong generates throughout, even though the narrative ellipses in the story can frequently be frustrating to track. In sharing the same central character, struggling writer Chow Mo-wan, the movie is a partial sequel to Wong's acclaimed 2000 film, \\"In the Mood for Love\\", picking up Chow several months later in the same Hong Kong hotel after his sojourn to Cambodia. However, it really isn't critical you see the earlier film before this one.<br /><br />Chow is a significantly changed man, rather embittered and far more misogynistic than before but haunted by memories far deeper than the failed love affair of the first movie.  Chow initially hopes to rent the very same room (2046), but since it's not ready for occupancy, he settles for the one next door (2047). Not only does the room 2046 become elusive to Chow, but it becomes the imagined, futuristic destination in Chow's science-fiction story where people can search for their lost memories. There is yet a third meaning to the number, as it is also the year when control of Hong Kong will fully revert back to mainland China. Wong encompasses this numerical device by cleverly going back and forth between Chow's affairs with several beautiful women and scenes from his invented sci-fi story in which a man finds himself falling for an android stewardess. The multi-layering story structure is a high-wire move for Wong, especially when the film opens confusingly with a Japanese narrator. In fact, various characters speak Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese to each other with perfect comprehension. Most -though not all - the pieces coalesce by the end, but the journey there is worthwhile with some truly memorable sequences.<br /><br />Same as the first film, Tony Leung Chiu Wai plays Chow but this time, plays him as a world-weary, predatory philanderer in the way Bogart or Gable did in the 1940's, an emotional cipher indifferent to the women he meets as he is convalescing from the failure of finding his one true love. Although Maggie Cheung comes back from the first film in a wordless cameo, Wong has recruited four of China's leading actresses to play the women who come in and out of Chow's world - Gong Li as Su Li Zhen, the mysterious gambler from Singapore who wears one black glove and the coincidental namesake of Chow's love; Carina Lau as Lulu, the mouthy prostitute; Faye Wong as Wang Jing Wen, the eldest daughter of Chow's landlord, as well as an almost anime-looking robotic object of desire in the sci-fi story; and Ziyi Zhang as Bai Ling, the upscale Hong Kong dance hostess conflicted about her feelings.<br /><br />All four actresses make vivid impressions, although unsurprisingly, Li and Zhang stand out in roles that are almost the polar opposites of their respective roles in Rob Marshall's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\". With her luxuriant beehive and pensive manner, Li bristles with pained passion, especially in her farewell scene. Zhang displays the unbridled sexual energy and open-hearted regret required for her role. As Wang Jing Wen's boyfriend and the protagonist of the sci-fi story, red-haired Takuya Kimura makes his moments count. Mixing imagery that recalls \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and Japanese anime, the computer graphics of the sci-fi sequences are impressively rendered by a French special effects company, BUF. The best sequences, however, take place in 1960's Hong Kong where Wong captures the tawdriness and eroticism of the atmosphere with fierce authority on a muted palette of vibrant colors. This is audacious filmmaking, but a greater focus on the story structure could have really helped.<br /><br />The DVD package surprisingly has no ongoing audio commentary from the filmmaker, which I think wouldhave been helpful given the narrative ellipses in the story. As compensation, there is an illuminating 30-minute making-of featurette, which includes interviews with Wong and most of the principal cast except Li. There are additional interviews with Leung and Wong, who speak fluent English, as well as Zhang who is subtitled. As part of his creative process, Wong doesn't work with a final script, and each provides an in-depth analysis how it worked and often frustrated the actors, a particular challenge for Zhang who never worked with Wong before. Their comments also help explain the idiosyncratic casting and the motivation for key scenes, such as the significance of Chow paying a restaurant bill for Bai and himself in ten-dollar bills. Also included is a short on the genesis of the computer animation. Additionally, there are two deleted scenes, both intriguing, and a very brief alternate ending that makes an attempt to merge the two stories. There is also an excellent feature which focuses on the film's diverse music and of course, previews for other from Sony Pictures Classics.k would have been helpful given the narrative ellipses in the story.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Epic! That is only one of the words that can even slightly describe the scope and grandeur of Sufjan Stevens' new release Come on Feel the Illinoise. Along with James McAuster, Craig Montoro, Katrina Kerns, Shara Worden, Matthew Morgan, Daniel Smith, Elin Smith, The Illinoisemaker Choir, and a String Quartet, Sufjan Stevens composes complex songs while also contributing his own proficiency on multiple instruments. Like his Michigan release, this second installment in the grand states series focuses on Sufjans' experiences and thoughts on the state of Illinois. With 22 tracks and utterly epic names for the songs, Sufjan has produced an incredibly lovely disc that really outdoes his previous work.<br /><br />\\"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois\\" starts the listener on this new epic journey. The track begins with echoing piano that is sweet and simple, inviting the listener in. Then, recorders play lovingly over the ivory. The vocals are what one would expect from Sufjan: enigmatic, charismatic, and inviting. From the very first track, you instantly know that you have happened upon a masterpiece. If it's possible, Sufjan has matured since Michigan and his story-telling ability has progressed. Here, an experience involving the war in Lebanon, but I am not entirely sure how to take the cryptic lyrics here. \\"UFO\\" then flows into \\"The Black Hawk War, or, How to Demolish an Entire Civilization and Still Feel Good About Yourself in the Morning, or, We Apologize for the Inconvenience but You're Going to Have to Leave Now, or, `I have Fought the Big Knives and Will Continue to Fight Them Until They are Off Our Lands!'\\" This track is a short track that is entirely instrumental. There are beautiful voices, recorder, acoustic guitar, piano, and drums. It has a marching sort of feel and is brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Come on Feel the Illinoise! Part 1: The World's Columbian Exposition\\" begins with Sufjan's signature staccato composition. The piano is energetic and Sufjan's voice perfect. There seems to be homage to Chicago's progress throughout the decades, but not without some criticism. The feel of the song changes a bit with some electric guitar and strings when there is a transition to \\"Part 2: Carl Sandburg Visits Me in a Dream.\\" Some brass comes into the mix along with tambourine. The lyrics in this song just catch the ear and attention of the listener. A few of my favorites are \\"And we laughed the beatitudes of a thousand lines\\" and \\"Even in his heart the Devil has to know the water level.\\" His songs surely are songs to ponder and think about. Sufjan just doesn't come out and tell the story in a straightforward fashion but is poetic and allows the listener the time to cogitate on his meanings.<br /><br />\\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" is a soft acoustic and piano song about a serial killer from Chicago. The song is disturbing and tells his story in a sorrowful manner. What is striking about the song is the last verse.<br /><br />And in my best behavior<br /><br />I am really just like him<br /><br />Look beneath the floorboards<br /><br />For the secrets I have hid<br /><br />It's a rare person that can admit that he has things dark and deep that others would find horrible. What a great, great song. \\"Jacksonville\\" begins with beautiful violin and moves into piano and Sufjan's signature banjo. There are sprinklings of civil rights movement in the song and I have tried to locate some sort of idea of what he is speaking of here, but have come up dry.<br /><br />\\"A Short Reprise for Mary Todd\\" comes next and is a short instrumental piece that floats on heavy and light strings. \\"Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Step Mother\\" has a sound of a more complex version of a song he might have included on Seven Swans. Banjo is the primary instrument in this song and the lyrics are steeped in history. If you are a US history buff, you will certainly love this disc for its witty comments on history. \\"Chicago\\" is an complexly arranged trackthat begins with strings and chords. I had only heard this song live with just a banjo but this version is just beautiful and shows Sufjan's ability to share his experiences with his listeners. It is apparent that his experiences with this city really shaped his youth. The end of the disc is soft keys and beautiful angelic voices.<br /><br />\\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\" is an acoustic tune akin to Seven Swans. Again, this song seems very personal and about a love that Sufjan had at one point in his life. The person that he loves dies of a kind of bone cancer and the song is just emotively impacting. All the lines in this song are strong, good, and, frankly, just perfect. Ok, as a critic, I am struggling with how to communicate what is going on in this disc to you, the reader. There are no words that can truly express it. This is one of my favorite tracks on the disc. \\"To the Workers of the Rockford River Valley Region, I Have an Idea Concerning Your Predicament\\" is an instrumental piece that is soothing and sorrowful with classical intonations. There is a bit of Spanish style horn, perfect drum accents, piano, and what might be a glockenspiel. \\"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\\" has a mock, rock feel to it with dissonant chords that eventually float into acoustic guitar. The brass work on this song is gorgeous. The choir on this track plays a great foil against the odd electric guitar work.<br /><br />\\"Prairie Fire that Wanders About\\" begins with organ and xylophone. This song almost feels like it has a hymn type structure to it. This is a short tune that is fanciful and has a sort of stream of consciousness feel to it. \\"A Conjunction of Drones Simulating the Way in Which Sufjan Stevens Has an Existential Crisis in the Great Godfrey Maze\\" is another one of the great instrumental short interludes on this disc. This has an ambient feel to it, with ride and keys. It lasts a whole 19 seconds, but I like it. \\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!\\" has a peaceful beginning with recorder, acoustic guitar, and piano. The arrangements on this song are beautiful and really compliment the story Sufjan is telling about a boyhood incident. \\"They are Night Zombies!! They are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From the Dead!! Run for Your Lives!! AHHHHHH!\\" has got to be the track with my favorite title. The track has groovy base, trip-hop drums and slick organ. The violins add a wistful delight to the song and really bring depth amidst the chorus of singers. This is about those who are famous from Illinois who have died. There are also personal touches here about dying and being forgotten, which, I doubt Sufjan will ever be forgotten with this incredible musical legacy he is leaving behind.<br /><br />\\"Let's Hear that String Part Again, Because I Don't Think They Heard it All the Way Out in Bushnell\\" is a short violin piece that must be a shake toward the site of Cornerstone Festival. This is followed by \\"In This Temple as in the Hearts of Man for Whom He Saved the Earth\\" is another short interlude of voices and organ that is beautiful and I wished it would have lasted longer. \\"The Seer's Tower\\" has a primarily piano accompaniment and possibly relates a disturbing personal experience of Sufjan's with the Sear's Tower as the center of the imagery. It's a haunting tune that is wistful and lovely. \\"The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders: Part 1 The Great Frontier\\" is a song with that wonderful Sufjan arrangement again with horns, drums, recorders, and what may be keys in there somewhere with Glockenspiel or Xylophone. The song seems to center around the great people of Illinois from history and also the commerce that arose in that state throughout the 20th century. Chicago was the commerce center for investments in farm goods and produce as well as the center for Sears Co. This flows into \\"Part II Come to Me Only With Playthings Now.\\" There is a great reference to the curse on the Chicago Cubs as well as references to other great sports teams from Illinois such as The Bulls. \\"Riffs and Variations on a Single Note for Jelly Roll, Earl Hines, Louis Armstrong, Baby Dodds, and the King of Swing, to Name a Few\\" is another brief interlude with fantastic Horn and a bit of an underlying drone. Obviously this is a tribute to some of the greats in Jazz. The final cut on the album is \\"Out of Egypt, in the Great Laugh of Mankind, and I shake the Dirt from My Sandals as I Run.\\" This is a gorgeous instrumental with piano and a mixture of instruments that seems to make a wall of sound. This is a perfect ending to this epic album and really ushers the listener out of the grand adventure that Sufjan has just lead him/her through.<br /><br />This album is just epic. Sufjan obviously shot the moon with this album and hit his mark.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|How the human brain can fool itself into thinking that this is the Strokes reborn is beyond me. <br />At best this is the Strokes floating in limbo between two worlds, <br />uneven, confused and sadly...boring. <br />I do give credit for the first few opening tracks and the great booklet, but the album drags on and on until it's finally over. <br />You want to try a new sound, try different instruments once in a while. <br />I would recommend you skip this one and try something more authentic like The Stooges.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity was as good as the series, but with more action.  The only thing I would recommend is that you watch the series first, then watch the movie.  It will make so much more sense.  Either way though you have to watch them both.
0739308742|1.0|This has to be one of the most boring books of all time.  I enjoyed books 1-3 and listened to them on Unabridged CD's.  The publisher even had the guts to use a new narrator(John Lee) instead of Roy Dotrice who had narrated the first 3 volumes.  Mr. Dotrice is the best creator of interesting voices after Harry Potter's Jim Dale.  Maybe Mr. Dotrice tried to read the book and told them No Thanks.  First a trilogy and now a projected 7 book story arc. Bring back Roy Dotrice for the rest of the books.
1400032717|2.0|This is the most modiocre book ever written.  It does nothing for the reader.  If you have a couple of hours to waste, pick up this boring mystery.
B00005JO1J|5.0|My hope is that when the DVD is released, many many more people will give this movie a chance. It's the most profound movie I've seen in my 57 years. For audiences on both sides who have critiques and agendas with this film, I say: Let go of fear, judgement and agendas and journey with these characters and you may be surprised what you DO find, not what you don't find. After seeing the movie for the 1st time I felt compelled to see it again ..and .again ..and.. again.. and.. again.. and.. again.. and.. again ..and.. again for a total of EIGHT TIMES.  Never in my life has this happened to me. Sometimes we find the most surprising things in the most unlikely places!     As the story unfolded I fell in love with Angel & Collins.  They drew me in and never let go.  It was they who brought me back to the theater time and time again. Watching them I realized I wasn't watching the story of a gay couple in love, I was watching a story about LOVE! A subtle look, a small gesture, something all of us who have ever been in love recognize. When you see it, you recognize it and say AHAA!  THAT'S IT ! Then what seemed to be gender related love transcends to the UNIVERSAL. It doesn't get any better than this ! Judgement, Critiquing, Ideologies can't exist in this place! It's heartwrenchingly beautiful if you can get there.    I won't spoil it by getting into their full story, but I loved Angel whether he was playing on his pickle bucket with jeans, jacket & short hair,dancing & drumming her heart out in full drag, asking Collins to hold her puse while she picks up the trash can breaking the lock on the door with great gusto & nonchalantly retrieiving her purse,or the most poigniant scenes. I guess to me Angel was a complete human being. Not defined by gender. The term he/she is interchangeable. Angel seemed quite comforfortable in his/her own skin at each moment, and made no aplogies for it.     Mimi was the heroin addict...she came to represent the addictions in all of us.  We think HEROIN  AHHH! but what are our addictions?  Food? Smoking? Gambling? Over the counter medications or Physician prescribed medicines? or how about CONTROL?  We all have them but most of us think of ours as acceptable.      Maureen I had the toughest time with.  Took me awhile to warm up to her, maybe because I recognized her in our friends who have cheated on their spouses since day 1.      I eventually came ot love all these characters and feel they are my friends.  They remind me to have tolerance & compassion. They show me to look for beauty in the darkness.      (...)I encourage everyone to rent./ buy it. It is truly Jonathan Larson's gift to us.    Enjoy!
B000AWYOGE|2.0|When i first heard about this movie I wasn't to thrilled about it. I've seen a LOT OF thriller/horror movies in the past but this one was absolutely dumb. Where's the main plot? <br /> <br />Although the acting wasn't bad, the story line was completely stupid. And although i haven't seen the original version, how could this movie be unrated? <br /> <br />I'm sick of movies that come out with unrated version that have the f*** used once or twice, that is stupid.
B0007GADZO|5.0|So much whining from Vai's fans about this release! To be honest, it pretty much sickens me that so many so-called \\"fans\\" seem unwilling to go along for this ride with him. They remind me of Frank Zappa fans, who are similarly demanding and whiny. Thankfully musicians aren't required to obey every whim of their fans and can do what their art demands of them, if they so dare. And on Real Illusions, Steve Vai dares. <br /> <br />People who rate this album 3 stars or less seem to have very little tolerance for anything that doesn't fit the mould of Passion & Warfare, the standard album by which everything Vai ever does will be judged. Personally, I think Real Illusions is much, much more interesting than P&W. I also think this album shows a new level of honesty for Steve Vai as a musical artist. For example, \\"Dying For Your Love\\" is Steve showing more of himself than I think he's ever dared to before. I find it hard to believe that anyone who dislikes this song could appreciate Steve Vai on more than a superficial level. <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it: if all you like about Steve Vai is his skill as a guitar player, then there is a lot of stuff on this album you probably won't like. If you actually appreciate Vai's music on an emotional and/or intellectual level, then this is his most mature and accomplished outing to date. And it makes me feel very hopeful about what he'll be doing in the future.
B0007P3582|1.0|Tally ho!  More mainstream claptrap off the starboard bow!  Ah, another dose of Hollywood hogwash to brainwash MTV junkies.  I have not, nor will I listen to this garbage, but I have had a good measure of 50 cent's music from TV, Radio etc.  One word: Pig-swill.
0316168815|3.0|The novel, a literary confection one can consume in an afternoon, begins as a perfectly wonderful fable about a man who builds a sort of whimsical hobbit-hole to delight and amaze neighborhood children.  One such child agrees to peer into his excavation, and, in an act of even greater benevolence, this man sends this young girl to a luminous playland heaven where she never ages nor ever experiences the maudlin drudgery of adult employment.  The man, knowing he's about to send her to this Shangri-La, engages her in a little innocent fleshly pleasure, a more than adequate reward for someone otherwise so selfless and loving.    Were the novel to end there, it would've have been a tale to captivate generations of readers.  However, the author, Alice Sebold, inexplicably attaches a rather lengthy coda in which the now happily heaven-residing young lady follows the events of her family, who by and large remain lugubriously dysfunctional, somehow unable to come to terms with the girl's great good fortune.    It is only after many pages of such moroseness that things are finally set back on happy course, but not before the generous hole-digging man is, in a rather perverse piece of plot manipulation, anonymously dispatched--an ignominious end, you'll agree, for one so saintly.    So if you can abide such injustice, then, by all means, read this book.  By now it can be had rather cheaply in any one of your local thrift stores.  Look for it on the shelf next to copies of the Scarsdale Diet and those smugly titled Rush Limbaugh monographs that swept the nation in the early nineties.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|John Mayer has certainly proven that he has the chops to play guitar with the greatest.  It really upsets me, however, that he is actually calling his latest cd a blues albulm.  At best \\"Try\\" is a watered-down concuction of Pop-Funk, Pop-Soul an one or two half decent blues songs.  I am a blues purist and have been playing this music for most of my life.  It is unfortunate that so many of Mayer's fans will believe they are listening to real blues when they buy this cd.   <br /> <br />Mayer is an amazing musician but it is wrong for him to label his watered-down funk and soul as hardcore blues.  In my opinion it is a travesty to all the fine blues men and women over the past 70 years who have built the genre into what it is.  It is very sad that people today actually believe that they are experiencing real blues music when they pick up a John Mayer CD.  If he really wanted to, Mayer could record a hardcore Chicago Blues CD, much like Eric Clapton did with \\"From the Cradle\\".  Instead he sells out and plays pop-blues on this albulm in order to appease the masses.  I have lots of respect for John Mayer's musicianship but I feel as if he has deceived everyone on this new albulm.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Well, at first, and still even, i am not quite sure how to describe SOAD's new record. It is actually a bit more unusual than Mezmerize, but unfortunately not better i don't think. I think at times on this they tried too hard to be out of the normal sound. I love their past releases because it feels like the songs came natural but these seem forced and some are only decent. But after all that it is truly an enjoyable listen.    1.Attack 9.5/10...One of my favorite soad songs. It starts off very heavy with the fast drums and the melodic chorus makes it a great song.  2.Dreaming 9/10...Definitely a song that grew on me. At first i wasn't a big fan of it, but it has certainly grown on me. My favorite part is the middle with the breakdown and Daron singing.  3.Kill Rock N' Roll 8/10...Eh. Another Cigaro type fun song. But, it's really only decent. Too hard to understand the message if there is one...except for the grass part.   4.Hypnotize 9.5/10...A more serious side of SOAD that i love to see. Such a melodic song and i love the intro into it.  5.Stealing Society 8/10...Another decent song. The beginning is a tad annoying but it ultimately turns into a good song.  6.Tentative 10/10...Probably my favorite song on the cd. Great lyrics and you can't beat the chorus or the bridge where the heaviness kicks back in. Good stuff.  7.U-Fig 9/10...The beginning guitar is so cool sounding and then the song explodes. Serj owns the vocals all the way so it's great stuff.  8.Holy Mountains 9/10...A five and a half minute epic. Softer more melodic verses with eratic outbreaks of the chorus which is extrememly heavy and pretty fast paced. New ground for SOAD and a great song.  9.Vicinity Of Obscenity 7.5/10...One of, if not the weirdest song every by System. I loved it, but it gets annoying quick and it's kind of pointless.  10.She's Like Heroin 6/10...My least favorite on the cd. Just not good, Daron on vocals, it's almost nauseating, kind of like Old School Hollywood without the guitar breakouts and the techno voice.  11.Lonely Day 7.5/10...Eh. Another not so great song by Daron. Just kind of boring, and i can't get past the line \\"the most lonliest day of my life.\\" It doesn't make sense, anywho, just ok.  12.Soldier Side 9/10...Thank goodness. A Great song to end a pretty good cd. Great lyrics, some of their best, and it's very epic.    Overall pretty decent, i recommend picking it up along with Mezmerize because they're both good, but I highly recommend their first 3 albums, because that's where the real System is.
0688170528|4.0|The book The Pact: A Love Story by Jodi Picoult is about the love of Chris and Emily, two teenagers who have known each other since birth from being neighbors. Everything is going perfect for the two of them, until one night they are rushed to the local hospital. Emily is dead on account of a bullet wound to the head, and Chris is in shock with somewhat minor injuries. As can be imagined, the police would never believe this was simply a suicide, and Chris is charged with the murder of the girl he loves. There are countless twists and turns in this book that I will not give away - you'll have to read it for yourself! :) <br /> <br />I loved the format of this book more than anything. Every chapter goes back and forth from the \\"Then\\" and the \\"Now.\\" In the \\"Then\\" chapters, elements of early adolescence of the two lovers, their dating history, and the times when Emily was feeling her depression and contemplating her inevitable suicide. The \\"Now\\" chapters include everything after Emily's death including trials, prison, interrogations, and so on. <br /> <br />Picoult should have made her characters a little less of broken-records though. By that I mean Chris's complete obsession of sex, Emily's of death, not loving anymore, and abstinence, and virtually every other character has one thing that is so blatant that it feels almost preached to you about how they act. A little subtlety could have made this book better. <br /> <br />A slight warning to any parents thinking of buying this book for a younger reader: though the book is based on two teenagers, the book does get explicit and graphic. This book should only be read by the mature reader able to read through those expressions without getting a case of the giggles. <br /> <br />All in all, this book was one I found myself not able to put down, which is rare for me. It deals with themes of love, death, grief, adultery, passion, justice, crime, guilt, and overcoming challenges all in just 389 pages. I recommend it, definitely.  <br />
B000BOH8XW|4.0|While I liked her previous album better, this is still a great album.  I haven't found a song that just jumps out and grabs me either, yet I still want to listen to this CD over and over again.  This album, once I heard it, did cause me to turn around and buy the spanish version of this CD.  I think all Shakira fans will enjoy this album as well as funs of rock.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|When I picked up Pat Metheny's latest effort, I was hoping I'd be impressed with the sort of reputation that precedes Pat back from the old days.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed by this record.  Don't get me wrong - this is good jazz with high-quality sound.  But it is unremarkable, repetitive, and unoriginal.  The composition lacks definition and sounds as though the group just got together in the studio and started jamming together without any sense of direction.  These being highly talented musicians, the result is musical hodge podge that is pleasing to the ear, but I expected more from Pat Metheny group.  The energy and excitement is lacking.  The record is more bluesy than jazzy.  Perhaps some other CD of Pat's would be a better choice, unless you're a die-hard fan and have all of his other CDs.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|All in all, this is a pretty good movie.  Seems like the only gripe is that when Paul Walker free drives he holds his breath for approximately 8 years.  However, they do explain in the movie that he is capable of holding his breath for 3 minutes, which is not uncommon among people who spend that much time in the water.  Fast paced and entertaining this movie will thrill nearly everyone who watches it.  Oh, that and Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes and will tempt you to hit the pause button several times.

B000002U8G|4.0|This album is really a good album, it's not great but definatly the begining of the Pink Floyd we have all came to know and love, well at least most of us have, but anyone who like Lil' Romeo and 50 cent doesn't deserve to have an opinion because they don't know what REAL music is. The highlights of this album are San Tropez, One of these days, Fearless, and of course Echoes, possibly the best pink floyd song ever, I definatly recommend this album, if you are a PINK FLOYD fan
B000005RST|5.0|I'm not sure how it was out so early over there, but; I can't really say anything wonderful about the CD that has not already been said.  IT IS GREAT!  I remember having the cassette of the original album when it was first released(1992), that was my junior year in high school.  Now about those bonus tracks, it is noteworthy that one of them is in the movie `Sliver'(1993).  In the scene when Sharon Stone gets off the elevator after her date with William Baldwin, and they have an \\"encounter\\" up against a pillar in his apartment.  I think the track even begins with the faint sound of a ding from an elevator door.  As with most songs that catch my attention in movies, this one was not on the soundtrack but I was very excited to come across it on this special edition album.  GOOD STUFF!!!!
B000BBOUU4|3.0|I was really dissappointed in this movie.  I think the original was far better.  Granted this version did a better job following the book, but the whole movie just seemed to be off.  Maybe it is just Tim Burton and all of his weirdness, but this is not a movie I'll be watching again any time soon.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|On one hand, the movie was watchable, however, if you are like me, and like having the snot scared out of you, don't bother.  This is not a good horror movie because it simply isn't scary.  It should be considered more of a dramatic thriller, and using the \\"thriller\\" term is a stretch.  The main reason people watch horror movies is to be taken into the movie and feel fear.  This movie simply doesn't do that.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I got this album early last (2005) year when it was released and listened to it.  It didn't really jump out at me.  But I just started listening to it again and damn it if it's not a great album.  Every song is just perfect.  It makes me wonder why I didn't dig it early on.
0393035158|2.0|There are certain indisputable truths that Sam Harris writes about here. One is that conflict over Religious Belief has been a major source of Conflict and War throughout history. The second is that the world is presently threatened by a form of religious Faith, (Radical Islam) which seems to  know no restraint in destructiveness in order to achieve its political-religious goal.<br /><br />However Harris' major claims are far more extreme and general than this. He believes that all monotheistic religious faith, including what he calls moderate religious faith is mistaken.<br /><br />Harris believes that this faith is irrational and destructive. And that it provides no reasonable way of affirming its basic propositions. He contrasts in this sense Religion with Science which he believes is the rational human way of understanding the world.<br /><br />It seems to me that while Harris does rightly point out shortcomings of organized religion he minimizes the fact that in all these religions there are paths to Faith through Reason. And that even the most seemingly insane and absolutely fanatic religious believer will often have a 'rationale ' and 'argument' a chain of reasoning to justify his action. This of course does not make it right, but rather it seems to me points out that Harris' real Enemy should be not Religion in general, or Religious Faith but rather simply Cruel and Evil Actions whatever their source, and whatever 'rationale 'behind them.<br /><br />Another major point is that most human beings by and large need a connection with the Transcendent. We need God because we will die and those we love will die, and because there is suffering in the world. And because God presents a Hope that no human being nor set of human beings can possibly give.<br /><br />In this sense it seems to me that as long as there is Humanity there will be a need for God and a need for Religious Belief. The abuses of that need and that belief are rightly criticized by Harris, but the understanding of that need is somewhat lacking in this work .eed is somewhat lacking in this work . <br />
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|why did it take 3hrs to tell this story.   <br />i could tell it in 2.2 minutes = <br />maiden voyage of a self proclaimed unsinkable ship, <br />bunch of snooty rich people abord suddenly are in danger because, oh my, the driver probably really was drunk and had too much courage in a bottle and thought he could ram a glacier like  \\"garrr, blasted glacier, get out of me way\\" <br />boat sinks, thousands die. <br />the end. <br /> <br />the best part of this movie was when find reotardo diCrapio frozen in the water.  haha
B00005NGAK|5.0|Michael Flatley did it again. So you liked Lord of the Dance? Now imagine the same except with twice as many dancers on stage! And with more high-tech equipment. Fancier costumes. There are some extra scenes and some that changed since the Lord of the Dance but the story is basically the same. The quality of the dvd seems to be better too. <br /> <br />And yet, if you ask me, I liked the original Lord of the Dance better. Flatley seems to care about all the sparkling and 3-level-stage and whatnot more than being on stage and dancing. He just seemed to enjoy himself more in Lord of the Dance.
0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevalier's style relaxes the mind as you read. I found this book to be a very good addition to my mental library.
0553801503|2.0|It has become abundantly clear, with the recent release of A Feast for Crows, that George R. R. Martin is  little more than TV writer way out of his league. Nearing the end of A Storm of Swords this perception was starting to develop as he killed off main character after main character, introduced one new conflict and story twist after another and essentially setup the bloated mess that is A Feast for Crows.     Martin clearly does not know what to do with the narrative mess he has created for himself. Characters that survived the previous volume, in more than one instance, are now just casually killed off or written out. Interesting story lines from A Storm of Swords barely get mention, relegated to the next volume, leaving the reader with the most weak and tired ones. The Brienne chapters, for example, should have never even made it to press. I understand that Martin was forced to split his 2,000 page monstrosity into to two books, but that should have meant trimming the fat, not feeding it to the reader.     Magic and the supernatural are also getting more and more ridiculous as the series progresses. While it has certainly been a part of each volume, one of the attractive elements of A Song of Ice and Fire was the magic-lite feel Martin recreated. It was a breath of fresh air for a genre that had become comical in its heavy handed application of supernatural elements. A Feast of Crows implies that this carefully crafted 'realism' is going to unravel, lending further credence to the one of two possible scenarios:    1)Martin has no idea what  to do with his story and he is using magic and supernatural to patch up all the plot holes:  2)Martin knows full well what he's doing and has known from the beginning, he's simply delayed the silliness until now.    Either way it does not bode well for the rest of the series.    Ultimately A Feast for Crows reads like a weak season of network television; mundane, aimless, drawn out, with a meandering plot-line and a cliffhanger ending to get you to watch- I mean read - next year.
B000066C1N|5.0|This album is undoubtedly one of the best album of Bryan Adams. The songs are simply \\"wonderful\\" and \\"awe inspiring\\". The songs are well written and one can really identify with them. Perhaps the best collection you can possibly have!
B000002MTR|5.0|Red Hot Chile Peppers - One Hot Minute (1995)<br /><br />Hard for me to believe this album is over 10 years old now. I can still taste the excitement I felt when I heard in '94 that Dave Navarro of alt-metal gods Jane's Addiction would join up on guitar for this record. Such a strange, intriguing proposition . . . and the amazing results do not disappoint! The album is incredibly diverse and colorful, the band simply oozes talent.<br /><br />I find it shocking that vocalist Anthony Kiedis doesn't think much of ONE HOT MINUTE, but apparently it was a difficult time for him personally and he was very distraught over the departure of his previous guitarist, John Frusciante. John is a super-talented but very strange dude. After years of abstaining from drugs, he became disillusioned during the BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIC tour, left the band, and subsequently sunk deep into drug addiction. Thank goodness he pulled himself out of it and rejoined the band to produce the phenomenal CALIFORNICATION.<br /><br />So what we have here is a truly unique article in the RHCP's catalogue; it makes the title seem all the more appropriate. The intensity found on several of these songs seems to reflect that the band knew they were participating in a glorious, fleeting moment.<br /><br />Breakdown (some personal impressions of ONE HOT MINUTE):<br /><br />\\"Warped\\" - a super-intense opener, Kiedis confronts his well-documented struggle with addiction. I don't really pay much attention to music videos, but I do recall this was a wild one, with the band members getting really crazy. I especially love how Anthony Kiedis and Dave Navarro made out in order to deliberately alienate their homophobic fans. *****<br /><br />\\"Aeroplane\\" - this is a light, fun, yet totally rockin' song featuring one of many examples of Flea's mind-blowing and unparalleled bass skills. The track perversely juxtaposes adult themes (\\"pleasure spiked with pain,\\" etc.) and adult language (the \\"f\\" word) with a chorus of young children (OHM clearly should've gotten a parental advisory sticker, but since this isn't rap I guess the censors thought that it wasn't a problem). *****<br /><br />\\"Deep Kick\\" - the fastest, thrashiest thing on ONE HOT MINUTE, save for the opening poetic monologue which admittedly can get a little tiresome upon repeated listens. Basically a fun nostalgia trip about being young and getting yer kicks. ****<br /><br />\\"My Friends\\" - beautiful and sad, this mellow track was a worthy single. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Coffee Shop\\" - this one's a straight-up, balls-to-the-wall funk rocker - a blast! ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Pea\\" - very rude yet charming, this tiny little song features just Anthony singing with Flea playing along. As it's a personal favorite, I'll rate it ****1/2.<br /><br />\\"One Big Mob\\" - a real mind blower! Possibly the most impressive thing on this record. Features a weird extended interlude in the middle with distorted cries from a baby. \\"I am you are me . . . submerge into the urge of we!\\" - killer stuff! *****<br /><br />\\"Walkabout\\" - laid-back, fun and totally addictive funk. Great free-wheeling solo from Navarro in there. *****<br /><br />\\"Tearjerker\\" - sorry die-hards, but this is the only track on OHM I really don't care for. I don't mind the mellow tip; I just don't think it's a very good song. To me, it's rather annoying - too sickly-sweet and flowery for my tastes. For some reason I find it especially annoying when Kiedis says \\"can you turn up the track a little bit please?\\" (did we really need to hear that?) Just an opinion, folks. It's really just a question of taste and it's perfectly reasonable that someone else would enjoy this track, so I'll rate it *** to be generous.<br /><br />\\"One Hot Minute\\" - a stomping cut with a bit of old school rock n' roll flavor. I absolutely love it, although complaints that the final riff at the end gets dragged out a bit too long are justified. \\"Close your eyes and click your heels/ Can you believe how good it feels?\\" ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Falling into Grace\\" - a supremely funky groover, thanks especially to Flea of course. Killer guitar effects from Navarro. Totally infectious vibe. *****<br /><br />\\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\" - a killer funk-rock cut and a scathing indictment of deity-based religions, particularly Christianity. \\"To anyone who's listenin'/ You're not born into sin/ The guilt they try and give you/ Puke it in the nearest bin.\\" An all-time personal favorite. *****<br /><br />\\"Transcending\\" - probably the most sophisticated track on ONE HOT MINUTE. It features an abrupt, dramatic transformation from an intricately played, meditative groover to a sprawling, orgasmic orgy of sound. Freakin' incredible! *****<br /><br />BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIC may deserve its reputation as the best Chili Peppers album, especially from a funk perspective or the sheer enjoyment of grooving to some great music. But personally, I'm even more impressed with ONE HOT MINUTE and it's a strong contender for my absolute favorite from this band. There are always those who insist that the RHCP's early, lesser known funk/punk albums are where it's at and some claim the band sold out when they released MOTHER'S MILK. Just ignore those pretentious weenies who need to feel special for being privy to more \\"underground\\" music. The Peppers just kept getting better and better as they matured, and I maintain that ONE HOT MINUTE may even be the pinnacle of their oeuvre (so far).\\" ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Falling into Grace\\" - a supremely funky groover, thanks especially to Flea of course.

B00003CY6M|4.0|Just watching this movie's opening sequence brings back fond memories of New York City at Christmas.  Add to this backdrop a cast of attractive and believable characters and you have a really enjoyable film about a guy who meets a girl, loses said girl and then spends a lot of his energy trying to find her again.  John Cusack add his \\"special treatment\\" to his lines with funny side comments and rapid-fire dialog analyzing the way women make men crazy. <br /> <br />This is not a deep movie.  It's also not a thin, hard-to-believe film.  Just watch it for what it is, and enjoy the romance...

B000BNX3B4|1.0|I am a John Cusack fan and have seen all his movies since the 1989 classic \\"Tapeheads\\". (I actually am mistaken for Mr. Cusack  on a regular basis since I sort of look like him, but that's a different story.) After watching \\"Must Love Dogs\\", I felt like I was watching the scenes that had been cut from a longer movie, pieced together to fit a fixed amount of runtime.  As other reviewers noted, there is very little character development in this film.  At about the halfway point, you can easily predict what will happen.  Plot elements are inserted, somewhat developed and then discarded.  During a key point in the movie, I was trying to figure out who the character was since he changed from Mr. Good Guy to someone else between two scenes.  The end is predictable and abrupt, as if the director said \\"Ok, we're done.  Let's all go home now.\\" <br /> <br />If you want to see the beautiful Diane Lane in a romantic comedy, see \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\".  If you want to see John Cusack in a similar movie, see \\"Serendipity\\" with the wonderful and gorgeous Kate Beckinsale.  Skip this movie unless you have nothing else to do or you need something to keep you company whilst you are ironing the laundry.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|Much of the Hype is because it is Quentin T.  The film for the entire first half is just a soft porno.  I went with a girl and she was not trying to see that stuff the entire time. After a while the pointless porn gets old.  The movie also takes a while to get started.  At times i found myseld getting board with the oh-so-predictable plot. Guys go to foreign country, guys break up, guys get lost, guys get killed.  It is extremely gruesome.  Most females, mainly the one I was with probably will not want to see all of that gruesomeness.  Overall, the movie was okay. I will never watch it again.   No scenes made me the slightest bit scared nor did anyone jump in the theater. Don't waste your time.  I could have really done without this below average movie. You can too.
B000092ZYX|5.0|All my life, I have been listening to Modern/Alternative Rock bands such as; Linkin Park, Nickelback, and Hoobastank. I have to say, I am fed up with that genre of music. They all use the same style, technique, and cheesey lyrics. I recently picked up this album by recomendation of a friend. I have to say, that this is the best album I have ever listened to. Radiohead uses eerie lyrics and vocals, mezmerizing special effects, and awsome guitar techniques. I know that alot of other reviewers say that Radiohead's previous albums were better. This is possible, but I fell that this album is better than previous albums the Mainstream has had to offer.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Nice album.  Worth the cheese spent.  I wont say tracks 9-11 are bad, but i will say they arent my type of songs.  Those 3 tracks are more throwback rock.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I watched \\"Underworld\\" at the cinema quite a long time ago, despite the fact that the critics had dissed it. I think that critics have a tendency to believe that every movie should give food for thought, whereas I believe that some films that only offer good entertainment should be given a chance, too. At that time, and after some gruelling exams, I was in the mood for some uncomplicated fun, and \\"Underworld\\" gave me just that.<br /><br />I hadn't heard from the director, Len Wiseman, but I must say he did an excellent job with this dark action film that features vampires and werewolves (lycans) fighting a 1000 year war against each other and amid the humans. The story is entertaining and original, something that you will appreciate even more if you have the chance of watching this dvd with the extended cut.<br /><br />One of the main characters in \\"Underworld\\" is Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire and a Deathdealer (that is, someone who hunts and kills lycans). Selene discovers some lycans hunting a mortal, Michael (Scott Speedman), and gets curious. Why are them after him? Of course, everything the lycans want, Selene will have, so she decides to find Michael. By choosing to do so, she will discover a vast conspiracy, the truth about her past, and a forbidden love.<br /><br />If you are fond of unconventional action movies, and don't think they need to be realistic, you are likely to love this movie. If that is the case, try to watch it soon, because the sequel will be released on January 20, and from what I could see in the trailer, \\"Underworld: evolution\\" will be great. So, don't wait, GO and buy or rent it now :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000BMSTMS|1.0|I absolutely loved the first 4 korn albums.  Personally, I think that they help release a lot of pent up frustration and anger (try listening while working out).  So, although I've purchased the last few, I've grown more and more skeptical with the increasingly slow tempos and whiny themes of the songs.  This new album is a huge disappointment.  It sounds like emo-rock (a movement that couldn't go away soon enough)!  It sounds like the group has given up the good fight.  There's no more anger or drive.  There's no need to put your fist through a wall or scream at the top of your lungs.  Let's all just sit on our beds with our arms around our knees and cry a little.  That's what this new album is...a whimper.  I still love korn because of the strength of the earlier albums, but this stuff has to go!
0312323859|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Something Borrowed- I absolutely LOVED Something Blue.  As others mentioned, we couldn't help but hate Darcy in the first and we hate her for much of the second too, but we love her at the same time.  She is so selfish and absorbed in herself but she is so real at the same time and doesn't put on phony airs for others.  It is rare that a book actually makes me laugh out loud but this one did so on numerous occasions.  In fact, my husband finally asked me to tell him what it was about because it was driving him nuts not knowing what was so funny.  Emily Giffin really catches every aspect of the characters in her novels, and we can identify with each character because we know someone like him or her or even see ourself in that person.  Any person- male or female- needs to read these two books if they have the opportunity.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|Whether we like it or not, Korn is still trying to party like it's 1998.  In the wake of the departure of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch (who supposedly found religion when the band stopped raking in cash), Korn has taken a new direction with \\"See You on the Other Side\\", attempting to put an industrial edge on their brand of downtuned nu-metal, and while I actually admire the fact that they're looking to go a different way (finally), it doesn't work.  Jonathan Davis is still whining, and the lyrics aren't anything we didn't hear before from 1994 on.  However, it's not all bad.  \\"Politix\\" and \\"Getting Off\\" are actually pretty solid, while opening single \\"Twisted Transistor\\" is kind of catchy.  Despite that though, \\"See You on the Other Side\\" is a sign that Korn has overstayed their welcome.  Their die hard fans have grown up (pretty much I assume) and the technical aspects of their music hasn't evolved beyond the incorporation of the indistrial aspects.  It's about time to hang it up boys, and hopefully they will before they start touring with Limp Bizkit and Poison.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Even though I live in England, I ordered this magnificent edition (it is not available in Europe, but to hell with the extra cost...it's a MUST have!) and am speechless with admiration at the care taken in bringing this timeless classic to DVD. <br /> <br />I won't repeat all the accolades of other reviewers. I will simply state that THIS is the way all great classic movies should be treated. The SPECIAL COLLECTOR's TIN is an instant collectable, an icon of film memorabilia in itself that I will treasure. <br /> <br />Only 2 quibbles: even though I have a US postal address I cannot order the FREE poster! WHY? <br /> <br />Second, while I much admired Kevin Brownlow's excellent documentary on Merian C Cooper, I would have liked more footage from Coop's extraordinary LAST DAYS OF POMPEII and at least some mention of his weird, compelling 1935 version of SHE (Randolph Scott & the unfgettable Helen Gahaghan) - which is almost never seen today & may be lost. <br /> <br />Aside from that...I loved it all and felt like a kid being let loose in a candy store when I opened it up! <br /> <br />BUY IT WHILE STOCKS LAST!
B000002P2V|4.0|This cd is The Who s' last recordings with Moon. In one of the books about the band i did read that there are other two songs still unavailable recorded for a special proyect with other artists. Keith Moon s' health and power was in decline when he recorded this. In fact, it has been said that on a couple of songs (as well as in By Numbers), Keith did not drummed: it was Kenney Jones (Sparks from the Tommy soundtrack, Succes Story, 905, Trick of the Light for example do not sound like Moon is drumming). John Entwistle is aloud to include 3 very diferent songs here: one is a Heavy sound song \\"Trick of the Light\\" that was released as a 45 (sadly it was not a hit). \\"905\\" is a very good song about clonation and Had Enought was the first single. <br />The rest of the songs, penned by Pete are close related in sound, production and subjetc matter: New Song, Music Must Change, Sister Disco and Guitar and Pen along with Empty Glass. I believe that in some cds the order of the songs gives you the sensation of all the album. In Who are you, the order of the songs feels dizzy because Entwistle songs are so different by themselves and in comparison with Pete s'.  <br />Nevertles WHO ARE YOU is a solid album song by song. It is not THE WHO S' best but is good enought to be considered a \\"classic\\". <br /> <br />For me the songs i like more are Music Must Change, Trick of the Light, 905 and Sister Disco. In particular \\"Trick of the Light\\" is a very very good song (there is a great live version on the \\"Join Together\\" live cd). <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|2.0|O.K. maybe I'm being a little unfair but I'm just SICK of my 12 year old drawing heavy black around her eyes and I'm sick of seeing their faces everywhere I go.  I hate \\"American Idiot\\" but I do like \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\".
B000AP04FG|4.0|Yes, it is stupid. But who cares? It is not movie to make you think, it is movie to enjoy. Too much shooting for me, but I really like the Smiths' dinner \\"conversation\\" (at 7 pm). And, of course, the main reason to watch it - Angelina. Not her best movie (see \\"Gia\\"!), but worth watching. Brad Pitt is good here, too.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Great voice, great music, and great CD!
0553801503|4.0|A lot of readers are dismissing the series as Robert Jordan-esque which, if you haven't read Jordan, means that the series starts off with a bang but then slowly deteriorates, the author drones on and on, the plot becomes pedantic and the characters stagnant.     That is not the case with Feast.      (THE BAD) Yes, Feast does not focus on several main characters (some of whom were my favorites) and yes, it is a little slower than the three previous installments and, yes, I have to agree that the chapters about Brienne were slow going.      (THE GOOD) However, it is still very well-written, the chapters concerning Jaime, Cersei and Sansa are spectacular, there are some big surprises late in the book and we get our first in-depth look at the Iron Islands and Dorne.  Jaime has developed into one of Martin's great characters.     If you can resign yourself to the fact that you will not be reading about Tyrion, Daenerys or Jon Snow and the Starks (save Sansa and a little Arya), Feast is very enjoyable. .

B000A6T1JU|1.0|Like me that is. Don't dump your Paramount DVD of the theatrical cut for this ruined \\"directors cut.\\" If you don't know of what I speak, the films director thought it might be a good idea to add disruptive faux comic pannels between scenes. Was he just ashamed of his film, or was he offered $ to alter it to go along with the recent video game? <br />Ether way it stinks, if you wan't this movie and have a multi-region player, don't suffer through this, pick up the British disk from Amazon UK. I did.
0684824906|5.0|This is an excellent book by Goodwin as she captures Lincoln through the eyes of his Republican rivals for the Presidency. By using parallel biographies, Goodwin is able to frame Lincoln's political growth while also making you familiar with his better-known and more politically powerful candidates within the new Republican Party. In addition, the multiple biographies allow you to appreciate the immense skills and the political connections of Bates (Missouri), Chase (Ohio), and Seward (New York). Common ground covered are Lincoln's early years that are very well documented and interesting as Lincoln makes numerous friends and collects many political favors without building animosity. By the time he reaches the convention, one begins to wonder if Lincoln had the first Illinois political machine.  Goodwin covers well his run at the Senate that makes him a national candidate allowing Lincoln to act virtually as a modern campaigner on the stump in stark contrast to his competition for the Republican nomination.  Goodwin adds a more appreciative look of Mary who she describes as a voluptuous, politically connected and educated young woman who had a sense of humor.  Of course, her emotional break down after the death of her middle son Willie and a less known carriage injury contributes to severe depression adding another tax on `old Abe'. As predicted by the title, the most fascinating aspect of the book is how Lincoln appoints these best men in government to his cabinet including Wells, Cameron and eventually Stanton. Lincoln had political conflicts with many of these men including an embarrassing snub by Stanton, yet he recruited these men, who were rivals among themselves, into an efficient team. Lincoln even included democrats in his cabinet (Stanton for one) to eliminate political polarization. Goodwin uses the wealth of letters written by these men along with tremendous research to demonstrate how Lincoln was able to manage these great and powerful men as an effective cabinet in those seriously challenging times to their surprise and eventual respect. As Goodwin notes, Lincoln had an uncanny sense of political timing and patience and he was particularly astute when working with Chase, who was an excellent Secretary of Treasurer but who frequently resigned due to his own unsurpassed blind ambition for the presidency at Lincoln and Seward's expense. Through this association with the cabinet, Goodwin is able to capture the personality of Lincoln who holds no grudges while dealing with trying circumstances, such as the egotistical and demeaning General McClellan, and he still maintain his good humor, sense of timing and good character to harness the abilities of the greatest men of their generation. The book could also have been called, \\"The Greatest Politically Trapeze Artist in History\\".ve cabinet in those seriously challenging times to their surprise and eventual respect.

1400032717|3.0|This book is okay. I love the asides the protagonist makes about religion, the foolishness of believing in a creationist theory as a way to explain the universe and justify our existance, and his use of logic to overcome fear. That said, it's not like autism just landed on earth with this book. There are other fascinating accounts of autistic people that are written with more flair and imagination. This author is cashing in but, really lacks the talent to meet the hype.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A few years ago I stumbled onto a TV show called \\"Firefly\\".  I was drawn in and fell in love with it.  Then one day it was gone.  Poof!  Just like that.  I never heard why, or heard others talk about it.  I felt like I was the only person that had ever seen it. <br /> <br />Fast forward two or three years and there is a commercial for this movie called \\"Serenity\\".  \\"Hey, that looks like the same cast from that TV show I saw so long ago\\", I said.  Well, needless to say it was. <br /> <br />What a great story they weave!  Very cleverly written with humor and just the right touch of Sci-Fi and even a hint of romance. <br /> <br />I'm not a great writer, so I won't bore you with the history of Firefly as I'm sure another reviewer has done it so much better than I ever could.  Really, I'm only here to lend support for such a great story and cast. <br /> <br />I just bought the DVD for \\"Serenity\\" today and was blown away.  Now that I know they have the whole series on DVD I'm about to purchase it. <br /> <br />I'm so glad I found it again.  I had no idea it had turned into a following.  On the DVD they showed how big this following was, and I was moved by it.  Also was a little sad that I didn't know it existed so I could join in. <br /> <br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  And, I hope even more that we haven't heard the end of this great story.
B000009EUM|4.0|A really strong album. I also find it marginally stronger than their first album, that had a bit of filler. I love 'scoundrel days'. It has that soaring vocal line that I think A-ha were excellent at- similar to 'take on me' and 'there's never a forever thing'. A beautiful memorable song. <br />'October' is also a really strong song. Morten uses a lower tone to his voice and to me, this sounds more like the pet shop boys, which is a good thing.  <br />'Manhattan skyline' begins as a beautiful ballad, but is a multi part song and moves into a really rocking performance, before returning to the softer sections. Also one of the best. <br />I am also fond of the 'the swing of things', which reminds me a bit of 'train of thought. 'I've been losing you' is also strong and rocks quite hard for a-ha. <br />The reason for four stars is that I find the second side strong, but a little weaker than the first. 'Cry wolf' is good but not exceptional. 'Looking for whales' has a melody that will stick in your head, but it is not that amazing. <br />I really like 'maybe maybe'. I think people criticise it, as it is a light hearted style song, not the deep severity of a lot of A-ha songs. The keyboard parts are really catchy and the solo sounds a bit like Erasure, which is also a good thing! The melody is also strong. This is not a weak song, just a different dynamic.  <br />'Soft rains of april' is a really nice title. The song doesn't disappoint. Ambient introduction and Morten sings in the lower, relaxed register, a bit like 'october', and I really like some of the expressive chord changes and the keyboard parts are again really expressive. A really mature recording, and a non-conventional ballad, one of the strongest tracks easily. <br />'The weight of the wind' to me is blatant filler. Again, a few nice keyboard parts, but it is one of those songs that I just cannot remember after I play it, no matter how many times. <br />Still, an incredible album chock full of talent.

B00006L83N|5.0|Music doesn't get much better then this folks.  This is such a terrific record, these guys have talent that is rarely seen in today's world.  Every aspect of this record is done flawlessly, great complex guitar riffs, the keybord is also very well done and the drumming adds well to the album adding intensity at just the right moments.  The lead singer has an excellent voice that fits the band perfectly you can really feel the emotion he puts in.  The symphonic parts give the album that complete epic feel.  I've had freinds say that the title track sounds like a Disney cartoon and I can see how they would think that but once you get into the song you find out just how deep and amazing it is.  This is truly great progressive metal that should not go over looked a gem in the metal scene.
B00026W82U|5.0|this cd seems to be what i've been waiting for without knowing i've been waiting for it. every single song is perfect with harmonies that blends with the lyrics into something unbelievably beautiful. the lyrics themselves are thoughtful and poetic; they speak for a wide variety of emotions that tug at real experiences one feels in life everyday. beautiful, beautiful cd.
038572179X|4.0|I had not heard good things about this book, but decided to read for myself. Let me start by saying the author's literary voice captured me. At times, espeacially early on, the story seemed insignificant next to his prose. This is what kept me reading. The first section of the book did not grab even thought the authors style did. The book became real for me once we joined Robbie on the front. The last part kept me thinking for days. I would recommend this novel for the serious reader who likes to be challnged. Certainly not beach fare for the masses, but the kind of book we need more of.
0385513755|1.0|Couldn't just click \\"yes, I found this review helpful\\" for James Stephen's Mona Lisa Overdrive.  Deserves a lot more than that.  Where's the \\"Jumping Jesus, found this review hilarious, as well as spot on\\" button?  If there was one, I'd click it.  As there's not, I'll just wipe my nose and and get on with my life.  One star for the book.  Five for the review.
B000023VR6|4.0|I'm not into rap/hip hop and could really care less about east vs. west, ghostwriters, the history and everything else people talk about in relation to the genre.  I own less then five hip hop/rap and honestly believe that there is not much talent within the industry outside of a few artists. <br /> <br />That being said, this is an album that rose above it genre in its time to become a modern day classic amongst 20 somethings.  In college this was one of those records we all listened to and put in on in many social situations (namely college parties!)  Many of the songs are energetic and get you pumped up.  The rymes and lyrics are smooth and often funny.  Although all the songs are unintentional self-parodies, this just adds to the enjoyment.  When you don't feel like taking yourself seriously then what better then to listen to people who are so self-involved that they become larger then life. <br /> <br />Almost every song is a winner.  Eminem and Snoop Dogg have numerous cameos and appear in most of the best songs.  Looking back the album is still fun and Whats the Difference, Next Episode, and Forgot About Dre were my favorites as well the heaviest played on the radio.   <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A hip/hop album worth owing for everyone, even if you are white, rythmless and don't like rap.  If you missed this the first time around then pick it up as its become a classic in my primarily alternative and classic rock catalog.
B000068TPN|5.0|Saving Private Ryan spawned the whole bring back of war movies in general.Though many never lived up to Saving Private Ryan,this is no exception.This never was in that category this is a much grittier war film.Depicted with much more realism than many have the guts to do so.<br /><br />During the Vietnam conflict we lost many soldiers and gained many hero's.(I shouyld know as my uncle got a grenade fragment lodged into his eye)As many said this is dead on to the harsh and cruel reality of society and war as a whole.Raising your head or adjusting an uncomfortable strap could be the difference between life or death.<br /><br />The movie starts off alittle slow after a short but intense intro.Once kicked into war full throttle it stays that way the whole film.With miner cut ins of the soldiers wives.(Little but realsitic side plot)<br /><br />Many who fought in the wars look at war films and critique them on the actions and looks given off,because they know what it was really like and the true horror of wondering if survival is questionable or false hope or if anyone in modern day can actually understand the true concept of what these brave men went through.Movies most oftenly never catch that. We Were Soldiers not only shows you the teamwork and epic struggle but the terrifying images of what the soldiers faced to get to that strong bond with oneanother.The movie flickers from one soldiers point of view to another soldiers and then you wonder whats with the random chaos?Squad to squad dead soldier to dead soldier eventually you see all these loosends tie in.When a main character or a well known character dies for his country you always feel that pain and shallowness.One thing i was truly amazed by was the fact that they show you that our (U.S. troops)isn't always ruthless.They show you what some of Vietnamiese had to part with to fight for honor.The soldiers going into battle are young and inexperienced and don't know what to expect,you can see their mistakes and what they learned from them.<br /><br />Movies like this really help those who are greedy or inconsiderate to others,as it teaches you what these soldiers went through and what you take for granted.They are no stronger or smarter then any of us they were working as a family to progress(Wich all of should and can).A really heartwarming and terrifying film all in one creepy way.A must see drama/action film.they learned from them. <br /> <br />Movies like this really help those who are greedy or inconsiderate to others,as it teaches you what these soldiers went through and what you take for granted.They are no stronger or smarter then any of us they were working as a family to progress(Wich all of should and can).A really heartwarming and terrifying film all in one creepy way.A must see drama/action film.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|AC/DC is bar none one of the finest live acts I've ever seen, and \\"AC/DC Live At Donington\\" is proof of this. This is one of the most lively, energetic shows I've ever seen. The band is simply on fire. Each of the 18 performances look and sound great, and command your attention.<br /><br />This new dvd also comes equipped with audio commentary from Angus and Malcolm Young. It is a dvd that belongs in your collection.
0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is a fascinating book that grabs a hold of you when you first start reading; and won't let you got until you finish it. The name of Ender Wiggen has become a disgrace and three thousand years after the bugger xenocide Ender is still looking for a way to redeem himself. The Piggies and the Hive Queen are his only chance for this. The book is very well written and should be at the top of everyone's books they need to read lists. There are some key things in the book that make it so captivating, and they are: Jane, the Piggies, and Novahno and her family. <br /> <br /> Jane is an interesting character in the book. She acts like a human but she is varsel. Because she is varsel she cannot completely act like a human. She is a very important character who has worked her way into Ender's life that neither of them would survive with out each other.  <br /> <br /> The Piggies are interesting characters because we don't know a lot about them. This natural makes us want to know more. They surprise us at every turn of a page because we don't know enough about them. This causes a hunger to know more about them that I have felt in few other books. The Piggies caused me to feel just about every emotion known to man and where at times so amazingly frustrating that I wanted to just stop reading. That was an impossibility because Card had me hooked. There was no way I could stop reading because that would mean that I wouldn't ever know the answer to my questions. <br /> <br /> Novahno is a very interesting character. Her family is even more interesting. Novahno is isolated much like Ender was at the battle school. But this isolation is different because she chooses to be isolated. She can be so amazing frustrating because she chooses to inflict pain on herself. Her family is even more interesting because they are all impacted by her isolation and the pain she chooses to inflict on herself. The family is in a major crisis when Ender arrives and he pulls them outof it. <br /> <br /> There are many other things in book that prevent you from being able to set the book aside, but these are some of the main ones. Ender is an interesting character like usual but it is Novahno, her family, Jane, and the Piggies that truly make the book as great as it is. I highly recommend this book. I also recommend that you start this book during the morning because if you are anything like me you will be unable to put it down until you have finished. <br />
B000AA4LAK|5.0|The Killers are amazing and I personally enjoyed every song on this cd. My favorites tracks are Jenny Was a Friend Of Mine, Mr. Brightside, Somebody Told Me and All These Things That I've Done. On All these things that i've done, i really enjoy the \\"i got soul, but i'm not a soldier\\" part, even though most people i talk to say it should have been left out. Of course who could forget about glamorous indie rock and roll, it's simply a cathy song. I certainly can't wait for their second album. Their debut was extremely successful, but now they have the pressure of making an even better comeback. I recommend people to buy the limited edition hot fuss, for the fact that it come with three bonus tracks. I know that sucks, because if its a limited edition, then it should have included their older stuff. Needless to say, the Killers are an amazing band that is sure to give us great music in the future. They're an eminent promise to the music industry and i hope they keep on making good music.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|Gee...I paid $8 to see soft core porn.I feel so violated...anyways the horror scenes looked fake or were to dark to see. Very obvious movie and well.....preeeeeetty bad. Every person I know who watched it said..wow...that sucked. The idea behind it was good. But the actually script was well..lacking a movie concept. This movie isnt even worth the money to rent it as a new release. Either wait till it goes into the old movies bin or just dont waste your time(download it illegally or summin). Go see Saw 2...now that was GOOD!

B000244FDW|4.0|Of course, nothing compares to Miss Austen's original creation and everything that comes after (books and movies alike) should always be considered as interpretations and judged on their own merit. <br /> <br />I've read and re-read P&P many times in my life, and my first sight of this wonderful work on the (small) screen was with A&E's version (only late last year, actually).  I've admired Mr. Firth's acting talents for a great while now, and I agree with some fellow reviewers that his manner and conduct transition throughout the story much more believable than Mr. Rintoul. <br /> <br />While David Rintoul seems quite handsome enough and his proud demeanor believable, his acting range was very poor indeed.   <br /> <br />First sight of him at the assembly was very good. Haughty, proud and disdainful of anyone outside of his immediate acquaintance was conveyed well enough.  But no developing fascination of secretly observing Lizzy at other Hartfordshire gatherings was evident.  All I could detect was the exact same manner of disdain as seen previously.  I saw no development (not even a secretly subtle change in expression). <br /> <br />His first proposal to Elizabeth was rather dull and not wholly believable that he was emotionally engaged when he spoke how 'ardently I love and admire you'.  Mr. Firth's version, while still holding much dignity and arrogance, showed much talent in barely suppressed emotion and much expression in his eyes (trying to conceal his hope and later his hurt). <br /> <br />Also Mr. Rintoul's expression of astonishment of hearing Eliza's reply was equally unvaried and dull.  While in the A&E version... the camera fixed several times on Darcy's face (pointedly: his eyes) and we are able to see (very subtly) the expression changing from one of hope to agony as he first hears Lizzy refuse him.  I saw no such change in Rintoul's expression.  He just seemed angry from the beginning of the scene to the end. <br /> <br />Even as Rintoul entered the room at the beginning of this proposal scene, he seems just plainly angry and sarcastic in his inquiry after her health - instead of anxiously nervous of the proposal he is trying to form in his head. <br /> <br />I did like Sabina Franklyn's Jane a bit better in this 1980 version.  She had a beautiful air and shy countenance which her role required. <br /> <br />I did prefer Jennifer Ehle's performance to Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth. Ms. Ehle's acting talent is superb and transformation into a sterling example of late 1700's gentle lady complete. Ms. Garvie performance reminded me more like Imogen Stubbs's Lucy Steele in 'Sense and Sensibility' (sharp and calculating instead of level-headed, smart and kind).  Also, in this version I didn't sense a close relationship with her father or perhaps inferior scene set up, acting direction or camera work was at fault. <br /> <br />As for the Pond dunking scene... I agree that this was a big departure from Ms. Austen's book - as well as the fencing exercise.  But as we all well know, the book is truly written from Elizabeth's POV and much that happens outside this realm will always be mysterious.  I return to my comments about interpretation.  I think the A&E story line is better for it with additions the screenwriters take adding Darcy's struggle to try to purge Lizzy from his mind:  Aggressive workout with a fencing master... and we are allowed to see his continuing torment later as he returns early to Pemberly and decides to cool his ardor in the frigid waters of his estate's pond. <br /> <br />Oh and I almost forgot to include:  <br />I was appalled at every scene that included dancing in this version of P&P.  I seemed as though last minute recruits from off the streets were employed.  No one seemed to be enjoying themselves, they often stumbled over each other, and most all the dancers were aged over 60 (ie: not a balanced age range).  I liked both A&E's 1996 and the most recent silver screen version (2005) with their display of wonderfully choreographed dancing.  It was plainly evident more time and care (as well as $$) was spent to choice of music and talent of dancers and choreography.  Possibly this detail was not important enough to the project's whole to warrant a larger piece of the budget to do it justice? <br /> <br />I did like this version well enough, but will prefer A&E's. <br />
B0000029AL|5.0|Still rockin. I bought this album so many years ago and needed to replace it. Always a favorite!!!
0060005424|5.0|When I frist read Sabriel in a school library, I didn't get it. Now, after several years curiosity made me read it again, and I don't regret the choice. <br /> <br />When I first got Lirael, I expected it to be only a few years after Sabriel, not fourteen, with her pretty much the main charecter. So I was disapointed when Sabriel didn't appear as much as I wanted her to. But that was more than made up by a new person, Lirael, whos personality is just as absorbing as Sabriels.  <br />Great job and keep it up, Mister Nix!  <br /> <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|It's my new favorite album! My first Rammstein cd. The only stuff I'd been familiar with were 2 videos - - the hilariously bizarre innui of Keine Lust, and Amerika. I find much in current rock music a letdown from too much focus on speed drumming, riffing, and sheer loudness, while sacrificing actual SONGWRITING. (I.e. a lot of Nu Metal.)  Not that I don't like these elements, but there's gotta be more going on, or my ears suffer from sheer exhaustion and I can only listen to it in pieces and parts. <br /> <br />Yeah it's LOUD sometimes, but...Reise, Reise is also eminently listenable thru n' thru like old-school classic albums, thanks to good SONGS, use of dynamics, solid musicianship with crunching guitars and lush production with keyboards used to good effect, interesting segues, and unexpected elements like heavenly choirs, a blues number (and it works...their way), even an accordian.  <br /> <br />Oh, and it's mostly all sung in German, which simply adds to the whole Teutonic mystique. Translated into English, there's some bizarre lyrics, but  hey, whaddaya expect from the minds of a band that doused a dance floor with gasoline and set it on fire to get bored fans off their arses and dance! <br /> <br />And That Voice. Meine Gott! Till Lindemann, you could sing me a lullaby anytime, and please....in German! (Look, I'm a musician AND female. Metalhead purists who don't appreciate my perspective - - get over yourselves!) Highly recommended.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|This album was my first by DT.  My love for progressive rock might color my opinion, but this album has a very dramatic and \\"heavy metal\\" sound, but undeniable prog elements.  The drama throughout the album feels like a lot of music from the 80s, but that's not a bad thing.  :) <br /> <br />It's a great album.  I'm glad I bought it.  The last two songs are standout hits, but all the others are VERY accessible and likable.  I'm looking forward to collecting more albums by this band.
0061020680|4.0|When Death offers Mort the chance of a lifetime to be his apprentice, Mort realizes that this will be a big chance to prove to his father that he is worth something. But Mort realizes that this job could be killer on his love life and that by defying the rules of reality for love he had just messed things up big time. A story full of Death, love, Death, accion, Death, hourglasses of life, Death, magic, Death, scythes and of coarse DEATH. <br /> I loved this book alot. We got to see a big side of Death, WHO ALWAYS SPEAKS IN CAPITAL LETTERS. Mort remindes me of me, and there is nothing better then finding a character in a discworld novel that reminds you of you. My only problem with the book was that the book seemed to drag on sometimes and it could have been a little funnier. Overall, it was one of my favorites. <br /> I recomend this book much more for Teens of all ages.
B0007XT87G|4.0|I'm a fair weather PT fan.  I like their music, but I don't really LOVE it.  Signify remains my favorite so far. <br /> <br />Deadwing, like In Absentia, was hard to listen to at first.  All my friends SWORE these were the best albums, but I just wasn't hearing it.  I just didn't \\"get\\" it. <br /> <br />But persistence pays.  After many listens, suddenly I hear the genius and beauty in many of the songs (Arriving Somewhere but Not Here comes to mind).  PT plays up the \\"fungus effect\\" where they write music that might not sound so great until you come to KNOW the songs.  Then you realize they're so complex and intricate, that they'll never grow old. <br /> <br />PT may never be at the tippy top of my list of faves, but they'll never be far behind.  Deadwing is almost as good as In Absentia, and in some ways, might be better.  Maybe I need to listen to it some more.  :)
0060012358|4.0|Once upon a time their was a talkng cat, a stupid looking boy, and some educated rodents. What a group hugh. Well they have got a scam and I have to say, it's a very good one. This odd group of beings go to small towns to steal money. How? the educated rodents make a plague and stupid looking boy (Kieth)youses his penny wistle to draw them out. Oh yeah, and the talking cat (Maurice) gets the money. Everything is going well until they enter a new town (Bad Blintz) where there are thousands of poisons and thousands of traps. The rats expierience evil, Maurice learns of fear, and Kieth is not as stupid as we thought. A story of accion, fear, evil, traps, death, fantasy, comedy, and fun. Is the the story of fairy tale of the Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents. <br /> I loved this book because of the wonderful characters. My favorite is Malicia, who thinks everyday life is going to end up as a fantastic fairy tale. But she can't help it, it's in her blood. She's the great Grandaughter of the Sister Grimm. I also like her character because I can relate to her in many ways. Many people say that this book was to much for little kids and did not have the charm as the other discworld novels. And I say yes and no. The book has a lot less of it's grown up humour, but so what. Kids of all ages should be able to enter the wonderful delights of the discworld series. I say no because, the book is not as deep as for example The Colour of Magic or The Truth but it is very dark. In humour and in the story.  <br /> I gave the book four stars because of everything I said in the last parragraphe. But not five stars because it did not have as much excentric characters as the other discworld novels and the whole stupid looking boy thing was kind of lame. But besides that I recomend this book for kids AND adults.

086140324X|3.0|When Rincewind a failed wizard who has got one of the greatest spells of all time locked in his head, he meets a tourist from the Agatean Empire, let's just say. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. This novel contains getting attacked by assasins, a luggage that will eat you if it doesn't like you, monsters, barbarians, dragons and of coarse, the tourist Twoflower. <br /> I did not like this book very much, mainly because that there was no plot, because the whole book is Rincewind and Twoflower almost getting killed and that I could not understand why for heavens sake was the book alled The Colour of Magic. This really infuriated me because I felt like I missed something. Since the novel is mostly about Rincewind trying to save Twoflower and Twoflower looking at things for the first time and bringing out new inventions, the book should be called The Tourist. It makes sence and it sounds nice. <br /> I gave the book three stars because of the lack of plot and the infuriatingly wrong title. I could not go lower because well, I love the writing and he imaginaton. I recomend this book for Teens and Adults for all ages. But please, don't stop here if you didn't like it. The books get better and better and better.  <br /> And to make you feel better about the confusing title, just tape some paper over the part of the book that has the title and write your own title. I havn't done it though but I will if I don't figure out why it was called that. Someone please tell me.
B000301YY8|5.0|What an incredible album, I can't stop listening to it - continuously in the car, at home whenever I have time to myself.  When I am not listening to it, it is often just playing through my mind.  The unforgettable lyrics, the passion in his voice, wow - I am just blown away by this album.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I used to think that \\"Terminator 2\\" was better than this one.  I guess it was because I thought the special effects were better, it wasn't as \\"scary\\", the cinametography was lighter and friendlier and there was more explosive action.  Lately, however, I have questioned that. <br /> <br />We all know the plot so I won't go into that.  But one thing I don't know why people don't touch on is how in this one Arnold Schwartzneggar is actually a Terminator, whereas in the sequels he's not as much a Terminator as a Protector.  In this one his mission is to kill someone whereas in the other movies his mission is to keep someone alive.  It's kind of a contradiction to keep \\"The Terminator\\" in the name of the movies when he's not actually doing that.  Don't you agree?  This is my biggest reason for my dilemma on deciding which \\"Terminator\\" movie was better. <br /> <br />Anyway, this movie is a lot more darker than the other two, which I've come to appreciate more than I did when I first saw this when I was much younger.  This takes place in downtown L.A. whereas the others took place in the suburbs, where there were no bums and gangsters all over the place, not to mention litter.  This movie also was \\"scarier\\" in the sense that the terminations were a lot more brutal, or maybe they just seemed that way because of the darker cinematography and because the characters that were killed were given a lot more character development, hence a chance for us to get familiar with them and maybe even like them.  A good example is the two detectives. <br /> <br />Another thing different in this movie is the level of desparation.  There was more desparation for a human protector than there was for a machine that feels no pain, fear, panic or stress.  You also feel more for a human that gets hurt or dies than a machine, even though we might have gotten attached to Arnie in the sequels. <br /> <br />One thing I also like about this movie is the action and excitement and appeal is based more on the relentlessness and callousness of The Terminator and the reaction of it all by the humans, than on big budget explosions, chase scenes and special effects.  It is very \\"un-Hollywood\\" where as the second one dipped a bit more, though in a reasonable amount, into those things.  The third one dipped a lot more into it, which is something I don't find that appealing. <br /> <br />As for special effects, those really are the worst thing about this movie.  I don't know if they were good for 80's movies but that mask or fake head they made for The Terminator when it got its eye messed up was horrible.  Same with the animation of The Terminator when its skinned got burned off.  Also, the sound effects of the guns were sometimes cheesey (high-pitched whistles like a cartoon) and inconsistent.  The future war scenes were O.K. but nothing to brag about. <br /> <br />However, this goes a lot more into the plot and story of the whole war, the resistance (TechCom), Skynet and the Terminators, as all explained by Reese.  They do that in the sequels but somehow it seemed more appealing in this one. <br /> <br />The acting is great.  Arnold does a good job as an emotionless machine, though I find the few facial expressions he makes every now and then in the film questionable.  Why would a machine need to make a facial expression?  Linda Hamilton does a good job of playing a somewhat disorganized clutz of a woman who is suddenly thrust into this battle.  And Michael Beign is great as Reese, who doesn't play a smooth, confident soldier as would be easy, but rather take the high road as a war-stricken soldier who's not on the brink of losing it but knows just what he's up against and what's at stake.  He's neither confident nor smooth but rather determined and unsure of how he will win and defeat The Terminator. <br /> <br />The script is good too.  The pacing is a little slower in the beginning than in the other ones, just because of the fact that I guess there was a lot more that needed to be shown.  Still, great lines though.  There's of course, \\"I'll be back,\\" which has never impressed me that much, but there's also other good ones, such as, \\"Wrong,\\" (after which he blasts the gunstore seller with a shotgun), \\"F**k, you a**hole!\\" and, \\"You've been targeted for termination.\\"  There are many others too, ones worth devoting the time to memorize. <br /> <br />There's very few plot holes if any, and whatever they are they don't bother you like with a lot of movies.  The actions are simple yet great as for the reasons I stated above.  The \\"coolest\\" scene in the movie is when The Terminator guns his way through the police department, mowing down any cop in his way with no feelings about it.  He looks d**m cool in his sunglasses, which he actually wears for a reason, leather jacket, boots and dual assault rifles, and he does this all without trying to look like some smooth Hollywood action star. <br /> <br />Anyway, I have to admit I'm leaning towards this movie as the best in the series.  I have only come to appreciate it more recently and like it a lot more than I did when I first saw it in the past, which was about 10 years ago or so.  It is certainly the most unique and definitely worth buying.  I hope this helps and I hope I got all my thoughts down.
038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan's bestselling novel Atonement is one that most readers will not soon forget. Part love story, part war story and part fairy tale, this novel earns its place among the classics. <br />Set in the years surrounding WWII and divided into four parts, the plot rises slowly at first, but in a way that enraptures the reader. McEwan's mastery of language and plotline has readers never wanting to put it down but culminates in an oddly satisfying ending. <br />The language of the novel is both soothingly simple and completely moving in a way that simply demands your full attention and leaves the readier feeling the emotions of the characters in a deeply connecting manner. McEwan is no stranger to this technique as he implores similar methods in his Enduring Love novel with also reflects his partialness to an easy foreshadowing.  <br />This novel is one that I would easily recommend to any fan of literature and I look forward to reading many more of McEwan's novels.
0740748475|5.0|I ordered the bookset as my very Christmas gift, and opened it on Christmas night. The books are simply marvellous, the strips are kind of \\"3D\\" on the paper, the print is well done and the paper has good quality. <br />Books are really huge! <br />Even if I'm not a comic lover, I appreciate Calvin & Hobbes and the definitive collection is one of the best gifts I made myself :)

Long live the Corrs!

B000BVQ9JO|2.0|Here are my complaints and compliments for The Strokes' new album, from my perspective as the songwriter for the band The Empty Mirror.  Keep in mind that I really like and admire The Strokes (who else could write Between Love and Hate or Hard to Explain?).  Most of the unpleasant aspects of the album for me fall under the category of the band having lost some of their melodic spark.  The arrangements could often be tightened, too - i.e. does the long, intense \\"you're no fun\\" part of \\"Fear of Sleep\\" really have to happen twice?      COMPLAINTS:  Juicebox:  That intro bass line is cliche, evoking from the start the disapointing feeling that you've heard this before.  In contrast, who had heard any of the sections of, say, \\"Trying Your Luck before?  The simple decending melody to the guitar solo after the first chorus is also a huge cliche.     Razorblade: As many reviews have noted, the chorus rips off the 70's hit \\"Mandy\\".  In my opinion, this \\"borrowing\\" falls on its face, because it doesn't take the original melody anywhere at all.  Julian essentially dumbs it down, looping the decending run of notes from the beginning of the original's hook (\\"oh Mandy, you came and you gave without...\\") over and over.  Keeping an open mind, imagine \\"Mandy\\"'s full chorus being there instead, and it's hard not to admit that the pop hit's full melody was just more varied, natural and original.    Ask Me Anything:  The chorus strongly evokes any number of Magnetic Fields melodies from some of their more standard songs.  Specifically, the end part of the chorus drops right into \\"I Don't Want to Get Over You\\" zone.      Electricityscape:  The intro clearly announces that this is their big minor key song, and alot of reviews have picked up on that, calling it \\"dark\\" and all that.  But there is no more standard minor progression that just going from major to minor on the same root chord like that.    Killing Lies:  The entire song is literally one four chord progression, for nearly fourminutes!   This can sometimes be pulled off well - \\"Sober\\" by Tool is two chords, and \\"Creep\\" by Radiohead is one progression - but there isn't the kind of gripping lyricism, melodic variety and textural dynamics of those songs here.  It is a beautiful progression, but its endless repetition is a sad sign of a half-written piece having been released.       COMPLIMENTS:  The Strokes have always had this, but the interaction of the two guitarists is gorgeous, interesting, and shows that they really do labor on their arrangements.  This especially seems true when you think that a songs with intricate arpeggios like \\"Red Light\\" probably began by being strummed on a guitar by Julian.      Julian's voice is fantastic, and his yelling wail, which comes out alot more on this album, can be genuinely emotional, especially since The Strokes have usually buried his voice.    The drum parts are more musical and memorable than ever on First Impressions, and can be one of the song's main hooks, especially on \\"On the Other Side\\".      \\"Ize of the World\\" is an exceptional song, and the best one on the album, in my opinion.  Dwarfed by the tense, super-long choruses, it's easy to forget how pretty the verses are, with alot of movement in the guitars and in Julian's melody.  This is one song that really feels like it goes somewhere, with the chorus being announced by a classic-sounding lick (hopefully it's not just ripping something off that I haven't heard before).  The resonant thing about \\"Ize\\" is that Julian is unapologetically talking about a wider, panoramic picture of society, which is pretty new for them.        People focus on the guitar sound of The Strokes when they accuse them of being derivative.  That's irrelevant, in my opinion, and nothing compared to the strength of their actual compositions,  like the intricate, effortless-sounding guitar work.  The real threat is of cannibalizing basic elements of their songwriting, like the melodies I've mentioned above.  When thiskind of thing starts happening, you know a band isn't working at their peak.      ~2.5/5
B000065BPB|5.0|Have had these for a couple of years now, and love them. Probably the most comfortable over-the ear phones I've owned. Sound great and knock down the ambient noise pretty well.  <br /> <br />Also have a pair of Sony MDR-V700's which also sound great, but like my old Koss Pro4AA's, squash my ear lobes to the point of pain after a few hours. These Sennheiser's have deep earcups that don't do that. <br /> <br />Haven't had to replace any parts yet, but I really like the idea of being able to do that in the field.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is as good if not better than anything I've ever bought from Amazon.  I can't remember enjoying a show this much since X-files.  How annoying that the suits cancelled it.  I've never watched a single thing that Whedon has done before, but after seeing the movie last Oct., the complete series DVD was at the top of my Christmas list.  When I didn't get it, I used a gift certificate to order it from Amazon.  Do yourself a favor, buy this series! <br /> <br />
0920668364|5.0|This book is a very special book indeed.  It is one every parent should read to their child and I defy any parent to get through the reading without getting teary.  They are happy tears but it is definitely a book that tugs at your heart. Children appreciate the humor that is definitely targeted to their age level and parents appreciate the sentimental story line.  It is a book for both parents and children.  I have given this book to new parents to read to their children and they always come back and tell me how special this story is.  I highly recommend it!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|The opening battle alone is worth seeing this movie, much like Spielberg's Private Ryan.  It's brilliant.  But then the attention to authenticity of the entire film is worthy of Akira Kurosawa and the story seems the work of a well-studied student of Shakespeare--spectacular, but never over the top.  This is a masterwork.<br /><br />Add to that, the added material on the DVD.  Personally, with a great film, I love to buy the DVD instead of rent, watch the film, see the film with director's comments and 'making of' bits, then see the movie again.<br /><br />Sophistication of computer graphics?  I frankly don't care.  But when you hear the director talk about the process of making this film, it's facinating.<br /><br />This is definitely a DVD that has it all, so you can enjoy the filmaking as well as the film itself.  Brilliant.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Excelent Music...for the folks complaining about the copy protected CD...I'm sure there are a lot of programs out there that let you make an EXACT AUDIO COPY of each track to make them mp3s and then be able to transfer them to your ipod...cheers
B000B5QWKG|5.0|Franz Ferdinand's album is similar to the first - and that's not a bad thing: same catchy hooks, foot-tapping beats, and singable choruses. (If you don't tap your foot or sing along, there's something wrong with you).  Anyway, they do tweak their sound some (listen to \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots on\\", a song that definitely has a Beatles influence).  The DVD side is great - behind the scenes footage, an interview, photo gallery, and the music video for the first single, \\"Do You Want to\\".     As for the negative reviews from people who bought the DualDisc format but hated it - hey, nobody forced you to buy it.    If you're considering buying a DualDisc, read the small print first.  I have no problems playing it on my personal CD player and my stereo, and it works well in my DVD player also.    This is one of two DualDiscs I own and I will buy more in the future.  The only downside is that you have to keep the disc in the jewel case when you're not playing it, but it's a minor inconvenience.      If you're a big fan of the band, check out their self-titled 2 disc live DVD!

B00004XQ8E|5.0|Now this recording is out of copyright it is beginning to turn up on several labels (e.g. Naxos).  It is, after all, a classic recording.  However, it was Decca who recorded it and they therefore are the ones who have access to the originals.  So this is probably the best transfer, worth the extra cost over its rivals.<br /><br />Its status as a classic is well deserved.  Walter was a close colleague of the composer, talked through the work with him and conducted the world premiere after Mahler's death.  It was a piece he had lived with for more than 40 years by the time this recording was made and his interpretation therefore at least deserves serious respect.  Of course, it merits much more than that.  Walter loved this music and invested it with all the depth of humanity he brought to everything he conducted.  There is appropriate weight and thrust to the opening Trinklied, a logically consistent flow to the meandering melodic lines of the Einsame im Herbst, Schubertian delicacy in Von der Jugend and so on right through to the yearnings and final resigned acceptance of Der Abschied.  This, as you might expect from Walter, is a Das Lied viewed from the Mozart, Schubert, Brahms end of the telescope rather than as the forerunner of Schoenberg, Berg, Webern and beyond.  To that extent he could be said to smooth out some of the more abrasive orchestration, to soften the impact of the clashing harmonies in the great Funeral March and to try to integrate the often disparate and apparently unrelated contrapuntal melodic lines. For a contrasting point of view, you need to turn to Rattle, Boulez or, interestingly, Horenstein.<br /><br />One of the chief raisons d'etre for this recording, of course, was the special relationship that had developed between Walter and Kathleen Ferrier.  In the unique sound of that voice and in her special artistry, Walter felt he had at last found the perfect vehicle for this piece.  And she doesn't disappoint.  She gives a near-definitive performance of her three songs and especially of Der Abschied.  The last outburst of love and regret for the `liebe Erde' and the ensuing resignation that drifts into an infinity of repeated `ewig...ewigs' over Mahler's achingly unresolved sixths in the harmony, these are heart-rending moments.  If there is just the slightest note of reservation in my praise, it is that Ferrier (as her letters show) was rather in awe of Dr. Walter, particularly in this piece which was so much a part of his life.  As a result she always seems to be following Walter's lead in this performance, without quite allowing herself the interpretive freedom she shows even in her live New York performance with him.  But in her live performance with Barbirolli (on APR) the sympathy - empathy even - between the two close friends leads to greater freedom still, greater risk-taking on both their parts that I find all the more moving, despite the pretty dreadful sound quality.<br /><br />Julius Patzak is also an integral part of this Vienna performance.  The tenor role is a tough one, having to scale the heldentenor heights of the opening movement, the porcelain delicacy of the third and the drunken abandon of the fifth.  Patzak doesn't have quite the ideal heft for the Trinklied and occasionally gets submerged in the orchestral swell, but he does bring a wonderfully plangent colouring to his voice in the `Dunkel ist das Leben' refrain.  There's a wealth of experience behind the subtle word-painting of Von der Jugend, however, and the Drunkard in Spring is also a perfect blend of singing off the words and the notes.<br /><br />This recording is deservedly a classic of the gramophone, a great performance which displays roots that reach directly back to the composer himself.  However, if you can listen through bad sound quality, I'd urge you to listen to Ferrier's performance with Barbirolli as well.<br /><br />The three Ruckert Lieder also included on this disc are also wonderfully done - especially Ichbin der Welt anhanden gekommen.  Um Mitternacht, too, is mightily imposing.  Only Janet Baker (again with Barbirolli) runs them close.tternacht, too, is mightily imposing.  Only Janet Baker (again with Barbirolli) runs them close.
B00001SIES|5.0|I have been dedicated to Muse for almost four years now, since I first saw the amazing video for single Bliss from their second album, Origin Of Symmetry, which was probably the best album of 2001. I bought their 2003 release Absolution on release date, and wasn't dissapointed in any way - again, they'd pulled off what I think was the best rock album released that year. However, I had been somewhat hescitant to buy their debut album, because I had an impression that it wouldn't match their other albums in quality. <br /> <br />I was wrong. <br /> <br />Showbiz features a less matured Muse, certainly, but the quality of the songs is none the less impressive, and with more than 8 excellent tracks on a 12-track CD, this is one you can't go wrong with. Favorite tracks seem to vary a lot between reviewers - which is another proof of the all-around quality of this CD. None of the tracks on this CD is less than good. My personal oppinion on the tracks of this album is as follows: <br /> <br />1. Sunburn. 8/10. Sunburn is a great track, the piano intro is crisp and precise and an excellent opening to the CD. The weakness of this track for me is perhaps that the overall production and arrangement lacks a bit of focus - it's great, but it's not a masterpiece - but still a wonderful song. 4th single from album. <br /> <br />2. Muscle Museum. 9/10. An instant classic, Muscle Museum has everything it takes - great lyrics, catchy melody and daring arrangement. I have actually heard live versions that surpass the album version (go buy the Hullaballoo CD) but this track was a well-deserved break through for the band. 3rd single from album. <br /> <br />3. Filip. 9/10. This is the first song that shows the more artsy side of Muse. The change in tempo and style is brilliant. Also, the song is more focused than the previous two tracks, though I find the intro and outro lacking - with a bit more finish there, the song would have hit a perfect 10. <br /> <br />4. Falling Down. 8/10. This song took me a lot of time. At first I found it quite horrible due to the nearly discordant harmonies of Matt Bellamies falsetto. However, it's grown on me to become a very dear track. And boy what a voice, he could break a heart of stone any time. <br /> <br />5. Cave. 9/10. This track is much less experimental than the previous album tracks, and more like a mainstream rock song. And it works perfectly. The production is immaculate, and for me this is a much better song than UNO - which other reviewers seem to hold in very high esteem. 2nd single from album. <br /> <br />6. Showbiz. 8/10. A very complicated track, lots of layers, and almost frightingly scary. I find the track a bit overproduced - less would have been more, the heavy distortion on Matt's vocal actually is a pity I think. Still, it works, and it works excellently, and a certain proof of how tallented a song craftsman Matt Bellamy is. <br /> <br />7. Unintended. 10/10. Probably best song on the album. Lyrics are tear-wrenching in their beauty, Matt's vocal is so pure he could shatter ice, production is immaculate, and there is not a spot to be placed on this track. Listen and cry! 5th and last single from the album. <br /> <br />8. UNO. 7/10. Stands to many fans as a favorite, but to me the song is one of the weaker on the album. The lyrics are good, but the song in itself is way to repetitive, with the same structure being repeated two and four times - even the lyrics start over and a practically repeated. A blows a good punch, but it's not on level with songs like Cave and the other singles. 1st single from album. <br /> <br />9. Sober. 6/10. Weakest song in the bunch. It's not bad, but imo. it should have been left out for B-side release Recess (8/10) which was much better, both concerning lyrics and music. Sober is a m.o.r. rocker, and has some interesting points, especially in the second half, so it's not a complete miss - but it's below standard. <br /> <br />10. Escape. 8/10. Starting as aquite song, not quite unlike Falling Away, and working into a more rocking track, I think this track is much overlooked. Not the best of the bunch, but works better for me than several of the songs released as single. <br /> <br />11. Overdue. 7/10. Again a solid rocker, but this one works much better for me than UNO and Sober. A short track, but quite catchy and irresistable. <br /> <br />12. Hate This And I'll Love You. 9/10. Last but not least, as the saying goes. This one is actually very close to perfect 10, and is my favorite track next to Unintended. The song is not easily accesible, it has a fairly complicated structure, and the shifts from quit to lout and back again are superb. This is really a show of what was to come with songs like Citizen Erased and Butterflies And Hurricanes from later albums. Matt's vocals and piano on the ending part gives me tears in the eyes, it's so beautiful. The album couldn't end on a better note. <br /> <br /> <br />On the bottom line, I'll just add that it's a wonderful experience to listen to this album. I'd exchange Sober with Recess for the perfect experience, but even as it is this album stands up to repetitive listenings from one end to another. As every Muse album - highly recommended. These guys are going to be huge! <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: 9/10
B000068VHS|4.0|I heard quite a few negative comments regarding the Cranberries' third CD, so when their fourth CD came out, I was initially reluctant to buy it.  However, the reviews were somewhat positive, so I decided to give it a shot.  My conclusion:  I believe the first two CDs they released are better, but this one is very listenable and worth buying.<br /><br />This CD still has some of the angst that seemed to be a common thread of the Cranberries' first two CDs, but some of these songs stray quite far from those heavily angst-ridden songs.  Some of this music is more rock-influenced than some of their earlier music as well.  \\"Loud and Clear,\\" as an example, has overlaid vocal tracks, a fast rock beat, some synthesized horn, though with a relationship theme.  \\"Promises\\" similarly has a heavy rock beat with strident lead guitar; a very impressive song that makes full use of Dolores O'Riordan's vocal talent.<br /><br />There are also songs reminiscent of their first two albums; for example \\"You and Me,\\" though in the case of this song the theme is love forever, a very positive song.  Another lovely song is \\"Just My Imagination,\\" which has a fairy-tale theme, rock-influenced but still solid Cranberries.  \\"Saving Grace\\" is just plain pretty, and another positive song.  This song perhaps could have been released as a single.  \\"What's on My Mind\\" is another positive love song, which again sounds very similar to the music on the first two Cranberries CDs.<br /><br />There are a several other songs I really enjoy from this CD.  \\"Shattered\\" is a laid back song, with an acoustic guitar taking the musical lead with the principal focus being Dolores's voice.  \\"Desperate Andy\\" has a good beat and some interesting vocal effects.  The very last track, \\"Dying in the Sun\\" is principally piano with occasional synthesizer, and Dolores's lovely voice; a gorgeous song for a concert.<br /><br />\\"Delilah\\" is quite an unusual track for this CD.  This song has a little metal flavor to it.  I like the change of pace musically and vocally, though a song like this risks losing traditional Cranberries fans.<br /><br />My favorite song on this CD is also the saddest and most poignant.  \\"Fee Fi Fo\\" deals with the subject of sexual abuse of children.  The vocals and the music here are ethereal, bordering on and perhaps edging into progressive rock.  The song is sad and angry.  You would not want to get into the way of the person singing this song.<br /><br />Not every track on this CD is a winner, but generally there is good quality here.  I think The Cranberries are trying to experiment with their music without being totally commercial.  I must approve whole-heartedly.  They continue to bring their own flavor to a spectrum of musical styles.  I did have a hard time getting into this CD initially, and had to listen to it several times before I finally began getting into the topics and the music.  However, I also was dealing with the paradigm of their first two albums, and was expecting much the same.  While there is some music that is similar to the first two albums, there are some striking differences as well.  I think the Cranberries are making changes that should be positive ones for their future, and I look forward to purchasing their next CD.I like the change of pace musically and vocally, though a song like this risks losing traditional Cranberries fans. <br /> <br />My favorite song on this CD is also the saddest and most poignant.  \\"Fee Fi Fo\\" deals with the subject of sexual abuse of children.

B00000G3PA|4.0|\\"Once again this is rumor control, and here are the facts\\". A review should be an opinion with supporting facts. Unfortunately, many (including the editor above), offer opinion with additional opinions given as facts. I see gripes about the physics and astrophysics of this movie but those complaining have got to get the basic physics correct before trying to address the astrophysics. The effect is that the movie proves its scientific validity to those who know the sciences of it. It's a GOOD MOVIE. <br /> <br />First,before the science part, on stereotyping, most of those stereotyped according to the editor above were characters that may have been seen for MAYBE one minute and you may also notice that they are using their own characters from their typical stand-up comedic professions. Not all are comedians though. For example, the chinese buisenessmen that are clients of Willis' company. I guess to avoid being tossed up as stereotypes they should have been speaking french while visiting the rig in the South China Sea. Or maybe they should have just been of french nationality. Two African American characters are in the entirety of the movie, one, an emotional gentle giant biker and the other is serious and by the book Air Force brass. Yeah, I recall those stereotypes from all over the place. By the way, the brief appearance nationalities are all given as stereotypes but he fails to mention the Russian that becomes part of the mission. The Scottish apparently got pulled into the fray by the character Max saying his favorite dish is haggis. <br /> <br />The editor and some reviewers seem to have led sheltered lives. The character types listed are normal in life, especially in manual labor occupations, and they also would tend to make referances like \\"bitch that needs drillin\\" (Watch your punctuation Mister Ed. and I thought profanity wasn't permitted). I notice that he never mentions the AF and NASA pilots DON'T display the same kind of behavior as the oil drillers. <br /> <br />Now let's hit the science. Shuttle maneuverability. There are no objects of easily recognized scale to use in establishing how maneuverable the shuttles are. The best thing available is the other shuttle and that doesn't help much at all. In other words, you can't determine how much space they are using to make their maneuvers. And I know I never saw any snap rolls or anything like that. They appeared to me to use a reasonable amount of space to make their maneuvers. I grew up in aircraft.  <br /> <br />Gravity equal to Earth in some parts, a lack of gravity in others. This falls under astrophysics so I can only give possibilities based on views. The rotation of the asteroid gets fouled up and it begins to pivot on three axis which to my mind could upset gravitational effects. But more importantly, pay attention to the makeup of some parts of the asteroid like where they were drilling. \\"Compressed iron ferrite\\" and add to it the various types of radiation in space such as electromagnetic that could easily magnetize iron ferrite and cause false gravity by attracting anything containing ferrous metals. As Watts says after they land, \\"The guages will not read. They're all peaked like we're plugged into some kind of god****** magnetic field.\\" <br /> <br />About the shuttle crash-landing at \\"thousands of miles per hour\\" and having survivors. If two objects collide head on, their two speeds are added together to come up with the force of impact. The shuttle wrecks on the asteroid from behind, both traveling the same direction. Therefore, the speed of the asteroid is SUBTRACTED from the speed of the shuttle to get the force of impact. So, the shuttle wrecked at about 500 MPH across the surface which means it is a glancing blow which further reduces the severity. This as compared to say plowing directly into the back of the asteroid which would have been a catastrophic impact at 500 MPH. <br /> <br />\\"And now for something completely different.\\" Why carry a machine gun on a mission in space. How often does the military NOT carry guns? Remember, Air Force is involved. There's the possibility it was on board to be tested on some mission. But the real question here is why would they unload it onto the surface of the asteroid for this movie? They obviously wouldn't have time to even test it on this mission. So, this is a valid complaint. I'm not even sure how the idea of including this part even came to be because it's nonsensical. <br /> <br />NASA mounting a multinational mission this quickly. Multinational? The only multinational part of it is docking with a Russian space station for refueling. Six US AF and NASA and eight oil rig workers from one company (US based). With Earth to be destroyed in 18 days, I would say they wouldn't have a lot of choice but to ditch some safety practices and such and force the mission into execution quickly. Apollo 8 was prepared for in just 4 months and that was only the second manned mission of the Apollo project, most of the equipment had only been used a couple of times, and it was back when we knew so little about space flight. It is a scarey thought these days though after the loss of two shuttles due to idiotic problems compared to the safe return of Apollo 13 in 1970 following its critical malfunction. <br /> <br />The unknown space station with its own gravity. The station has simulated gravity caused by firing rockets that cause it to spin. Did you happen to notice that they never state what station? I don't believe a year was even given anywhere in the movie. These little items are obscured, likely intentionally, to avoid certain limitations. I prefer when they do this. It's like watching \\"Escape From New York\\" now in 2006 while the movie is set in the future - 1997... <br /> <br />Now here's mine. Why didn't the landing gears shatter when the shuttle landed on the asteroid? Unless heated, they likely should have in such extreme cold. But that issue was never addressed. You can assume one way or the other or decide it isn't worth worrying about. Personally, I don't think it's worth worrying about.  <br /> <br />Just a little note on speeds given in the movie. If you've ever wondered about the speeds given in the movie (approximately 22,000 MPH asteroid velocity and shuttles hitting 22,500 MPH). Apollo 10 hit 24,791 MPH on its return trip in 1969. That'd be 2791 MPH faster than the asteroid's velocity in \\"Armageddon\\". <br /> <br />Again, this review is mainly to clear up facts and to show supporting science for this film. This one got hit here as scientifically ridiculous while \\"The Core\\" was called smarter though it is almost pure fantasy. I did a review on it too.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I went out a limb one day and ordered everwood on dvd just from reading the reviews on amazon and I have to say what a show. It is now one of my top ten (just below smallville and supernatural). But here's my problem, I live in Australia and we seem to be a bit behind in what on TV so I'm waiting to see if a certain surgry went according to plan. So please well so one over at WB there please get off there ass and release season's two and three. I will be there ready to buy. <br />
1400032717|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a hilarious story told by 15-year-old Christopher Boone, who happens to be autistic. Christopher is a mathematical genius but he has absolutely no social skills, and to say that he's a handful for his father would be an understatement. One evening, Christopher discovers the dead body of his neighbor's poodle, Wellington. Poor Wellington has been impaled with a garden fork, and Christopher is determined to find the dog's killer. Christopher's detective work leads him to discover secrets about his own family, and he details his investigations and adventures in this book, which a social worker at his school has encouraged him to write.<br /><br />Even though this is a relatively short book, I think it would have been better if it was trimmed back a bit more. The story started to drag a bit once Christopher boarded the train, but things picked up again once he arrived in London, and I was pleased with the way the rest of the book panned out.<br /><br />Mark Haddon does an excellent job of taking the reader into the mind of an autistic person. The novel is narrated entirely by Christopher, who sees the world in an completely different way than most other people do. Christopher's world consists of systematic patterns and self-imposed restrictions, which are expertly detailed in this story. \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is unlike any book I've ever read before. It's brimming with humor, irony, and insight, making it a very unique and interesting read.
B000068IEU|2.0|I bought this movie, along with several others, out of curiosity.  I found a list of \\"banned movies\\" and wanted to see why.  If you're into degradation, domination, rape, murder, and revenge, buy this movie...if not, definitely pass it by.   <br /> <br />This movie is supposed to be based on a true story of the brutalization, rape and murder of two young girls by three escaped convicts, and the revenge exacted by the parents of one of the girls.  It's really disturbing and disgusting, and simply makes you wonder what's wrong with people.  I can't believe I let my curiosity get the better of me and that I wasted my money on this.   <br /> <br />I'll also reiterate what another reviewer said...this movie is a load of bad acting and poor directing.  There are some really stupid scenes where you're just left shaking your head, wondering what in the world the director was thinking.  Case and point...two police officers hear on the radio of the escaped convicts.  They realize a car they had seen at the end of the driveway of the one girl's home belongs to the escapees.  Something happens to their vehicle on a desolate road and they have to hoof it back to the girl's house.  They encounter several potential rides along the way, but aren't able to use any of them for various stupid reasons, the best one being too many chickens loaded on the truck.  It seems like it takes them 12 hours to get back to the girl's home, by which time her parents have already figured out their house guests have killed their daughter and her friend, and take revenge.  The mother bites the penis off one guy, shoots the whacko woman escapee, and the father is finishing off the ring-leader with a chainsaw just as...you guessed it...the two police officers finally show up and burst through the door.  Spellbinding...riveting...NOT!  Take my word for it...don't waste your money on this movie.
1592400876|3.0|This book on grammar is not meant to be a reference book or a writer's guide.  Instead, it is a book of vignettes.  It is like having dinner with your retired great aunt who used to be a grade school English teacher.  The voice is similar as is the amount of time required to read the book.  Enjoy the monologue and diatribe.  Laugh at the stories.  Cringe at her snobbery and old-fashioned attitudes.  But don't expect to find handy writing tips.
B000002BE9|4.0|I bought this disc back in 1996 after hearing a lot of buzz & hype about Fiona Apple.  After my first listen and now 10 years later, I still had the same reaction, \\"Wow - she's only 18 writing songs like this!?\\"  Even today it is so refreshing to hear such poetically beautiful lyrics set to original composition. Her smoky voice is haunting and while she is not the best vocalist I've ever heard; like another great singer/songwriter, Laura Nyro, Fiona sings HER songs with such passion & conviction that eclipses the fact that she's not a vocal powerhouse. I also love the fact that she so successfully mixed different genres of music to create own sound.<br /><br />My favorite tracks: THE FIRST TASTE, SLOW LIKE HONEY, CRIMINAL, PALE SEPTEMBER & NEVER IS A PROMISE.
0446577383|4.0|I just finished The Camel Club and I'm having a hard time reconciling the book I read with some of these reviews.  Apparently the distinction between reviewing and reacting has become rather blurred for some of these folks.  Was it a perfect book? No, probably not. But it had a refreshing mix of characters that were not the standard prescient, infallible, ironjawed or perfectly sculpted paragons.  These were characters who could most charitably be termed 'interesting' in every sense of the word -- folks from whom most people tend to avert their eyes when they pass them in the street.  By going below their superficial ideosyncrasies Baldacci exposes some of the most memorable characters I've encountered in a long time.  And he gives them a setting that is entirely believable for those of us who aren't allergic to any suggestion that (gasp) not everyone in Washington is firing on all cylinders. More, please!

1400032717|5.0|This is a 5-star stunner.  In some ways it's like no book you've ever read.  In other ways it is quintessentially faithful to genre and hence immensely satisfying.  Horace said that art should both teach and please.  Samuel Johnson said that art should be new but also just, i.e., be faithful to (human) nature.  The result is a simultaneous 'why didn't I think of that?' and 'I wouldn't change a word'.  If a piece of art is only novel (in Johnson's construct) it is simply weird.  If it is only just it is simply trite.  The balance is something that Hollywood eternally seeks--something fresh (at last!) but something that works (at last!).<br /><br />Here we have an autistic or limited/autistic narrator who is utterly reliable because he cannot lie.  He is presented with a touching mystery that he seeks to solve.  In doing so he draws on all of his experiences and resources and, ultimately, not only solves the crime (and more) but attains a measure of personal redemption.  He's 15 years old.  He lives in Swindon, Wiltshire.<br /><br />For those who don't know Swindon, it's touted as the gateway to the west country, but it's more industrial than bucolic.  It's the birthplace of Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues and the site of the 'death roundabout', one of the most complex series of traffic circles in England.  More to the point, on The Office, Swindon is one of the locations of the paper company that we see in Slough.  Enough said.  Thus, we also have a moderately gritty setting, appropriate to crime fiction.<br /><br />Note: the book is not ponderous.  It is not preachy.  The plot does not plod.  This is a brisk read.  Hey, it's genre fiction--but not like any other you've read (except, to a small degree, like Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn).  It's not sentimental; it's not politically correct; it's none of the things that you might think it is.  It's just a terrific crime novel with an engaging protagonist.<br /><br />A must-read.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Wow....great movie!! In the beginning, I was immediately turned off the minute I heard Brad Pitt's voice- the character he plays- a pikey-gypsy one-punch-fighter-machine obsessed with caravans- I didn't like it. But it grew on me...and the fact that Brad Pitt was able to pull it off suggests he has great versatility as an actor.    This movie is INSANE from beginning to the end. As another reviewer said- watch it with the subtitles on if it is getting hard to follow. I had to watch the beginning of the movie two times through because there are SO many characters and so many mini-story lines going on at the same time...but all characters DO come together in the end- and that is the best part, seeing how everyone runs into each other in the end.     Of course the movie all centers on this huge big-as-a-house diamond that is wanted by everyone basically (except Turkish & Tommy and then of course Mikey and the rest of the pikeys). What is stolen by Frankie 4 Fingers in the very beginning is stolen by Vince, Sol, and Tyrone. Then Boris The Blade steals it away. Then, Doug The Head, Avi, and Bullet Tooth Tony steal it. Vince, Sol, and Tyrone get it back and are in process of delivering it to Brick Top when Doug, Avi, and Tony take it back again. Then....in the very end my two favorite guys, Turkish & Tommy get it. (Yay!)    This movie isn't really about the diamond though. It's about people getting screwed over, fast thinking, and the occasional weird disgusting thing happening. (Like being shot 6 times and STILL not being killed. Or feeding the people you kill to a dozen pigs. Or of course, being able to knock someone clear out with one solid punch.)    Go see it!! And don't give up on it if you don't understand it- watch it until you understand it!
B00004STDN|4.0|Cliffhanger is an action thriller directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) and starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), John Lithgow (Blow Out), Michael Rooker (JFK), and Janine Turner. <br /> <br />The opening sequence of the movie is true to the movie's title. Stallone's character, Gabe Walker, hanging on a cliff of a mountain, and later, holding on tight to the hand of an unexperienced climber named Sarah as she's screaming and begging Gabe to save her life from the fall of death.  <br /> <br />Gabe leaves his rescue work behind after the fateful death of his buddy Hal Tucker's, played by Rooker, girlfriend because he couldn't save her. Gabe happens to be back in the mountainous region to make amends with his girl, played by Turner, when Eric Qualen, played brilliantly by Lithgow, and his gang of theives hijack a government plane filled with millions of dollars, and crash land in the snow covered mountains of Colorado losing the cases of money in the process. Gabe and Hal are the first to arrive at the scene of the crash for rescue work only to be kidnapped by the gang and used to find the money. Of course, Stallone gets away and plays a cat and mouse game with the gang up and down the mountains. <br /> <br />Cliffhanger is spectacularly breathtaking, and one of Stallone's best action films. However, John Lithgow is the one who steals the show entirely with his menacing turn as the bad guy.  <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B
B00005JOQ9|3.0|I think some hardcore horror fans will be delighted with Hostel, but this movie isn't for everyone.  The first half is softcore porn, enough to push the envelope of an R-rating.  It's about 2 young American tourists, looking for loose women in Europe (they can't get any at home).  They check into a Hostel where they find their girls, but their friend disappears the next morning, followed shortly by one of the American boys.  It turns out they're being kidnapped by a torture-for-sick-pleasure ring.  The second half is lurid, gruesome, bloody torture along the line of Saw and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, enough to break the envelope - it might have needed an NC-17 rating.  I don't have any problem with that except that it is gratuitous violence for the sake of gruesome lurid violence itself, without any point, without any redeeming surprise twist at the end like in Saw.  You might be attracted to the film if you're a Quentin Tarantino fan, but as a whole the movie's not quite as good as some of his others.  And if you're a fan of objectionably pointless gruesome violence, you'll still find slightly better movies for that.  Personally I liked Saw and Final Destination somewhat more.  For the average movie viewer, it's not scary, just repulsive.  I'm not saying that to dis the movie, just to explain why I can't give it 4or 5 stars.  But I can imagine some horror fans will consider it a 5-star instant cult classic.  It is technically a well-made film, and perhaps redeemed by the possibility it can serve as a warning to young tourists travelling alone.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) scored gold when, in 1982, he accepted the role of Medal of Honor awarded Vietnam veteran John J. Rambo who upon arriving back home is greeted with the disgust and disrespect of his own people in the classic motion picture First Blood.    It's not until Rambo passes through a small town in the heart of America and gets harrassed by the town's sherrif Teasle, played by Brian Dennehy, that he finally snaps. Rambo escapes the clutches of the town's law enforcement officers into the nearby forested mountains where he feels right at home considering that he was a green beret. The officers are in for a surprising all out war as Rambo takes them down one at a time and singlehandedly brings havoc to their tiny city that they call home. The only man who can possibly bring him in is his former trainer, Colonel Trautman, played brilliantly by the late Richard Crenna (the role was originally offered to Kirk Douglas but he eventually turned it down).    First Blood is an extraordinary film that reveals how mistreated the veterans of the Vietnam war were. The film also reveals Stallone's action movie star abilities, something he would later be typecast with, and in addition to the Rocky role, the film gave Stallone his second most popular onscreen character as Rambo.     First Blood also began a series of Rambo movies: 1985's Rambo: First Blood Part 2, and 1987's Rambo 3, but neither sequel came close to the brilliance of the original.    Recommended    A-

B000957O82|5.0|From the opening scene in Hitch of Overbrook Entertainment's logo of a record playing with the song Wonderful World (Don't Know Much) by Sam Cooke in the background, and Will Smith narrating what women think of when they wake up in the morning in the opening credits, you know you're in for a really good movie.    Hitch is a romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama) and starring Will Smith (Bad Boys), Eva Mendes (Out Of Time), and comedian Kevin James.    Smith plays Alex Hitchens (a.k.a. Hitch), a love doctor, who helps desperate single men make the right moves and get the women of their dreams. Things start to change for Hitch when he hooks up Albert, played hilariously by Kevin James in his first major motion picture starring role, with the most famous gorgeous woman in New York, Allegra Cole, played by the pretty Amber Valletta, whom he happens to be one of the accountants for. On the other hand, Hitch begins falling for Sara, a columnist for a major New York newspaper, who is following up on a story on Allegra Cole and her unknown hubby, Albert, and one woman who thinks the love doctor is nothing but a manipulative man who tricks women but doesn't know who he is in person. I think you get the picture as to where the movie goes next.    Will Smith is perfect for the role of Hitch, he's charming and has one heck of a sense of humor. Kevin James steals the show with his outwardly funny antics. Those are only two of the reasons why Hitch works.    The movie is simply the best romantic comedy of the year!    Recommended    A-
B000BKJ78U|5.0|I am so glad that I read the good and bad reviews on this item.  It was the good reviews that won out.  If you just enjoy watching Star Wars movies, then this is a good buy.  If you live the Star Wars movies, then goodbye.   <br />I watched the original Star Wars triology when I was young.  As a parent, I have enjoyed watching the newer series with my children.  Having just watched Revenge of the Sith my daughter, I wanted to get the triology to continue the story.  I'm glad I did.  As a family we have watched this triology twice since we purchased it.  We all love it.  If it is not exactly what was shown in the original versions, it makes no difference to us.  These are great movies to watch as a family.

0553801503|5.0|Well, that took long enough to come out.  When I first picked up the series, book three had first come out and it seems forever since then.  However, as much as I wanted Martin to finish the fourth book so we could get on with it, I much rather would have take all the time he needed and give us another masterpiece, rather than rushing through it and giving us a \\"merely good\\" book that would make us wonder what might have been.  As it turns out, publishing constraints made the decision for all of us and apparently what was going to be the fourth book has been chopped in half.  On the plus side, we get the book now.  Down side is, we get only half of it, with the rest to hopefully follow later this year.  This isn't as big a deal as it seems, while I do think it hurts the series in the short term, once the whole series is finished and the books can be read in order and in context, they should all fit together well enough that we might not even notice.  However, that's later and this is now.  And what do we get now?  A great restructuring apparently.  Martin wisely knows that the frantic pace and gripping intensity from the first three books can't be sustained forever and so takes it down a notch.  In the last book, everything hit the fan.  This time, the characters spend their time cleaning up the mess.  It's a much quieter affair, with the focus more on setting up the bombshells that are sure to explode later, developing some old friends and introducing some new characters . . . everyone is still clearly trying to kill everyone else, but they're being a lot subtler about it.  Martin sketches out the new post-war dynamics readily enough and his made up fantasy land still feels as real as anything else that's come along, populated with real people and a history so alive that it makes me want to read a prologue to the series, even though I know it's better this way.  Are characters and plots missed?  God, yes, and the absence of a few characters (Tyrion especially, I miss his droll wit) is a notable hole in an otherwise great story.  Martin's skills are undiminished, his writing still flawless, and his plotting typically deft.  When the plot twists start coming toward the end, they're still punches in the gut and the book ends so abruptly that I kept wondering if I was missing something.  Hopefully those threads will be picked up in book five, but I doubt it and it will be an agonizing wait for book six to find out exactly what happened.  This is one of those series I wish time machines existed so we could go forward and see what the next bit is, but unfortunately we'll have to wait for him like everyone else.  I'm still divided about whether he should have released it as one massive novel, but unfortunately as much as we like to see our Art uncompromised and unstained by concerns from the Man, sometimes reality steps in and I think Martin did the best he could under the circumstances.  Rest assured, this book is not an exercise in treading water, plots are forwarded, not with the breakneck speed of the past, but there's still a sense that this is all going somewhere and where it's going isn't going to be exactly pleasant for everyone involved.  A needed breath of air before we plunge into the rest of the series, with luck the next book won't come out on the back end of forever but regardless, I'll wait and I think in the end it will be worth the wait.ss his droll wit) is a notable hole in an otherwise great story.

0679745203|4.0|Writing is very lyrical, with excellent use of imagery.  Ninety percent of the metaphors work.  However, some of the metaphors do not make comlete sense in context and are mixed (See LRB article by Nicholas Spice).    Although some reviewers dislike the books non-linear storytelling and structure, I thought it worked well.  Each of the scenes feeds into the next and allows reader to get a better understanding of character, events, or themes.  The book is not entirely historically accurate and is more similar to taking a trip inside a very imaginative and talented person's stories based on history. The use of imagery and the creative, if not entirely accurate, use of historical events or people as \\"snapshots\\" that evoke feelings or ideas is a theme that occurs extensively throughout Ondaatje's poetry (ex: \\"Elizabeth\\"), so it is not surprising to find it in his novel.    Another weakness with the novel was that the characters and events often functioned more to explore themes, which made the character behave in ways that would not be truly realistic.  The English patient, Katherine, and Hana and lost some depth becuase of this.  Kip is probably the most multidimensional character in the book.  The movie, especially Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas, did a far better job of bringing the other characters to life.  You would probably enjoy this book if any of the following are true: you like the poetry of Wallace Stevens, you like and prefer historical fiction that is romantic or has strong story telling elements over historical fiction that is 100% true to its time (think Tale of Two Cities, Love in the Time of Cholera, Gone with the Wind, etc.), or you are not a historical event nitpicker.   A novel does not always have to be historically 100% accurate (hence the term FICTION), but is often an exploration of emotions, themes, or ideas.  I enjoyed the novel, even though it was not \\"perfect.\\"

B00079FUI6|5.0|An outstanding series, Desperate Housewives, brings to the screen the parallel stories of (mainly) four women, friendly with each other, living on Wisteria Lane somewhere in Suburbia! <br />Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  Desperate Housewives does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />The setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Desperate Housewives is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!! <br />
B00005JOQ9|3.0|This movie is so schizophrenic that you may think you're in the wrong theater for the first half. A pair of ugly American tourists and their found-along-the-way buddy from Iceland run around Europe in a typical obscenity laden attempt to score as much nookie and pot as they can consume, and are basically rude and spoiled obnoxious turds. (And in typical xenophobic fashion, guess which of the three tourons gets offed first? Hint: He didn't have an American Passport...). In fact, the first part of the film is a cross between a tour advertisement for the gorgeous nature of Europe - \\"Hostel\\" has some amazing cinematography - and a soft core porn flick. B**bies? Everywhere.<br /><br />But then comes the evil that \\"Hostel\\" is being sold as. Those hot babes? They are evil femme fatales selling out cute tourists to a place where you can pay to have your sickest fantasies played out. (And in another telling undercurrent of conscious, is it odd that the only sick designs that anyone has involve the brutal torture and murder of the victims? And that an American victim fetches the best price? No fantasy hot sex? Oh wait, the ones who have the hot sex fantasies are getting murdered! It's back to the old slasher rule of 70's horror...lower head gets too much action, upper head will get decapitated.)<br /><br />Ok, so I did sit on the edge of my seat for most of the film's second and third segments. You don't get much actual horror from the movie itself, there's a lot of obvious screaming and flying body parts, but no direct shot of said torture (like no-one in the theater I was in could tell the difference...pah). By the film's third act, it's devolved into a cat-and-mouse game of escape with revenge as the primary motivational drive.<br /><br />But with the lead characters in the movie being such dorkwad tourist-morons ('tourons'), the early killing doesn't elicit much sympathy. In fact, with the news of 2005 and early 2006 reporting that the American military is all to happy to ship suspects out the country and off of the radar screen to be \\"questioned\\" (hah!) without the quaint regulations of those pesky activist courts, then how hard is it to imagine a place like \\"Hostel\\" in a corrupt county where those rules do not apply? And how disturbed will you be when the scene where the little kids turn from candy-chompers to skull-stompers? Or will you, like some in the theater I saw \\"Hostel\\" in, cheer them on?<br /><br />Maybe the earlier analogy of \\"Hostel\\" to those 70's slasher flicks was not quiet complete. \\"Hostel\\" may be more appropriately compared to those 50's and 60's mutant movies where our national subconscious used atomically enhanced critters to scare us into fearing the Cold War. \\"Hostel\\" uses images of foreigners running a tourist death-camp to remind us that all it takes is one sleazy non-American with a bankroll to off as many citizens and sympathizers as he can, as long as your willing to pay for the privilege. Quentin Tarantino backing Eli Roth to issue political allegory as horror films?

0393327655|5.0|While I do not share all of Sam Harris's views-I DO believe in pacifism being the highest dogma of morality, I DO agree with Noam Chomsky's views on the shortcomings of U.S. foreign policy, and I DO think that war is a failure of civilization-his coherent, logical, intelligently written book was a joy to read. I am a tolerant Orthodox Christian; Harris's poignant statements about moderation in religion, however, were very well taken.    One has to congratulate this author for having had the courage to dissect the often-taboo topic of indiscriminate religious beliefs, with all the implications this has for the rest of us. His work could not have been timelier; we are witnessing an extremely dangerous mixture of religion and politics in our government today! (remember the basis on which this country was founded?)    Does religion have to equate narrow-mindedness in the spirit of the \\"my-God-is-better-than-your-God\\" doctrine? Is extreme faith the result of stark ignorance and does it lead, in turn, to perilous intolerance? Is the inability to accept diversity intrinsic to every religious creed?    If nothing else, this book raises the above questions, and I sincerely hope that it will open the horizons and broaden the perspectives of those who will review it. May it only land in the hands of those who NEED to read it!
B00003CXGP|4.0|Director:  Mary Harron <br />Cast:  Christian Bale, Justin Theroux, John Lucas, Bill Sage, Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Matt Ross, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe. <br />Running Time:  101 minutes <br />Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, drug use and language. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"American Psycho\\" is a disturbing movie filled with the brutal murders and executions of various people (mostly of the female persuasion). What's really scary is that through much of the movie, our funny bone is being tickled. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, in a star-making turn) is a shallow Wall Street banker who lives an empty life. He lives and dies by a soda pop advertising slogan: Image Is Everything.  Set in the late 1980s, he is of a time when style reigns supreme over substance, obsessed with his physical beauty, getting into the trendiest restaurants, and nitpicking with his coworkers about who has the best business cards. Said co-workers (Jared Leto, Matt Ross, Justin Theroux, and Josh Lucas), all have the same haircut and business suits, and for all intents and purposes are interchangeable. Bateman's sex life isn't exactly lacking, by any means. He's engaged to the shallow Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but cheats on her with her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis). He picks up a hooker off the street (Cara Seymour) and gets her in a threesome with another one of his friends, Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner, who co wrote the script).  His secretary Jean (Chloe Sevigny) also secretly lusts after him. Little does she know that he seems to have knocked off his best friend Paul Allen (Leto), a nameless homeless man, and countless members of the fairer sex, all by increasingly imaginative killing methods (staple gun, chainsaw, ATM machine; he tries it all). Eventually he finds he's being trailed by detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), who's investing Allen's disappearance but also seems to know a bit more about Patrick than he should.  From this moment on Bateman's inner demons are unleashed as he descends into an unending frenzy of paranoia and murder. <br /> <br />Directed by Mary Harron (\\"I Shot Andy Warhol\\", \\"The Notorious Betty Page\\") made a clever social satire film mixed brilliantly with horror. This film is loaded with dark humor, while Bale gives a dynamic performance. This independent film has high production values, a fine music score by John Cale and good looking cinematography by Andrzej Sekula (\\"Pulp Fiction\\").  The film adaptation shows the depths of the novel refraining from its cruelty. Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (i.e. the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is. Rather than being dark and ambiguous with respect to the main character, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have chosen to look at him from outside thus exposing his pantheism and twisted sense of reality, therefore avoiding any chance of glamorization of the character, and the film is constantly mocking his yuppie macho conceit, something the novel left the reader to do him/herself. Also, it deserves to be noted that the film is much more woman-friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic. There is no scope for misogyny here.  American Psycho\\" is a movie that pushes the limits of the audience's ability to cope for a number of reasons. A film told from the point of view of a psychotic is harsh enough, but the film also beckons the audience to question their own sanity. You're forced to look at your own sensibilities and morals and put them to the test...can you condone Bateman's actions and thoughts? Do you agree with them? Sometimes you find yourself saying yes to these questions, and for this some people may call it a travesty. By the same token, it pushes the envelope, thus it could even be called a triumph. Be warned:this is not a film for all tastes, but one thing is certain, it is one of a kind.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I was drawn to Oldboy because I had heard that the twist at the very end of this movie was one that couldn't be beaten. I had heard that before, though, so I was skeptical when I bought it. I figured, yeah, the twist may not be as exciting or surprising as some say it will be, but I know that at least I'm getting a good movie. That was true for Oldboy--it is an excellent all-around movie--and the twist itself paid off big time. I've never been floored like that in my life.<br /><br />Oldboy follows the fifteen year journey of a man named Oh Dae-su who is married, has a child, and an obvious penchant for creating problems for those around him. He is suddenly taken from the streets of Seoul, and imprisoned inside a room for fifteen years, given food, TV, writing materials, a shower, everything a person can live off of, except simple freedom and the answers to his questions. During his time here, he trains himself to fight, records everything he did up to his current days of imprisonment, and attempts suicide twice, both failures. But then he's suddenly drugged and hypnotized, and wakes up outdoors, on the roof of a building, dressed in a nice suit with all of the few possessions he had had inside of the room. He soon learns that he's been framed for his wife's murder, and his daughter has been adopted by Swedes. And he has one thing on his mind: find out who imprisoned him and kill them.<br /><br />I won't go on from there, because I may spoil the twist for some people. I will say that the action scenes in this movie are great; it's as if the actors were placed in a room and told to fight for their lives. It looks real. The actor who plays Oh Dae-su plays this role brilliantly. He's funny and dramatic, and carries with him in his appearance all those years of imprisonment. The story itself plays out slowly, releasing tidbits of information, enough to keep you interested long until the next small lump of info. While not an actual mystery, you still feel as if you're trying to solve Oh Dae-su's problem along with him, as he makes it easy to get inside of his head.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough. I wonder why films like this get ignored so easily. Oldboy is smarter than anything Hollywood has made in ages, with superior acting, a great soundtrack, and an intense well-plotted story. If you like good movies, then pick up Oldboy.e trying to solve Oh Dae-su's problem along with him, as he makes it easy to get inside of his head. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this movie enough.

B000AY74OG|2.0|I enjoyed certain parts of this Movie,but there were parts where it didn't have alot of substance whatsoever.the voices were alright,but this film doesn't even come close to other films in the same vein.the directing was nice&I liked the story,but something was just missing for me to fully get into it.not bad,but it should have been way better.

0671027387|4.0|I like Dan Brown's writing style (although, sometimes his endings suffer from what looks likes 'I got bored with the story and wanted to finish the book').  This book is full of adventure, mystery and intrigue.  Sometimes it's a little 'over-the-top', but keep trying, Mr. Brown, you'll get it just right one of these days!
B00000JSJC|5.0|There are two essential film views of the future: life is 'good' and life is ugly. It is the extraordinary SF (Earth based) film that can handle the extremes of a future period and yet stay synched with human reality.<br /><br />This film is a masterpiece because it connects with so many of the hopes and fears related to the future of society. It would be interesting to find out what films the 'one star' critics find worth watching.<br /><br />The use of the \\"squid\\" technology to save and transfer experiences from one human to others is a tremendous 'invention' within the context of an SF film, but it is the way that Cameron and company used it to amplify the razor's edge of technological innovation vis a vis human society (and individuals.)<br /><br />In 1968 I read \\"The Yngling\\" by John Dalmas which also had a device which could empathically broadcast experiences from one human to others, and Dalmas used this brilliantly within his novel. What Dalmas did in 1968 is what \\"Strange Days\\" did in the film medium. Could not have been a more robust exploration of one specific piece of new technology within a future society.<br /><br />A standing ovation for all involved in the production of \\"Strange Days.\\"
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|The Strokes are one of those bands that, although they have proved themselves with their debut alone (which is rare), just won't let up. \\"Is This It?\\" proved them as one of if not the best band around giving the US back the title to The Home of The Best Rock Band after years of The U.K. whooping our behind. Then \\"Room On Fire\\" (although many found it as the B-sides of \\"Is This It?\\") was just as good because they didn't change anything. They kept their sound which is what they should have done for their sophmore release. Too many bands try to go in a radical direction with their sophmore release and it never really convinces the listener. Now here is \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" their third release and The Strokes sound louder, and more talented than ever before. Most bands with the amount of acclaim that surrounds The Strokes would have settled for the average pathway by now but The Strokes continue to develop their sound and the results are amazing. I'm almost reminded of Radiohead (although I think Ok Computer is as far as they should have gone in the \\"electrical\\" direction)when they too took a huge risk by abandoning their \\"Next U2\\" destiny and explored other alternatives. In \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" The Strokes dip a toe in the arena-rock territory by untilizing every intrument (including Casablancas' vocals) much more than they've ever done before. Of course there will be reviews saying \\"well First Impressions Of Earth is no Is This It? The Strokes sold-out! blah blah blah\\" but in my opinion they're right, \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" is no \\"Is This It?\\" because it's better! It happens all the time to bands that continue to stay on top of their game. Critics try to take them a notch down. But pay no attention to them. And as far as the songwriting goes, you can tell The Strokes are growing up. Lyrically and arrangement-wise they sound like they've been around for years. Every single member, particularly Fraiture, Casablancas and Moretti, steps up their game. The Strokes don't need a million \\"Is This It?s\\", really they don't \\"need\\" to do anything, but if they do \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" is it. The Strokes make this album and people say \\"it's too clean-cut\\" but if they made an album like their first two there'd be a million people saying \\"They just keep doing the same thing.\\" The point is not everyone is going to be satisfied with every decision a band makes. But if you're a fan of them or have been since their debut, as I have, you too would applaud the fact that The Strokes are trying to expand rather than sit back and make average records. The Strokes deserve your ears because \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" is The First Great Album Of 2006! By a mile!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD (actually a 2-DVD set) (or the CD) will broaden your understanding of the spiritual power of George Harrison's music because, although he was absent physically from this concert, his spritual power and the force of his wisdom/kindness/musical genius is strongly present in the proceedings.  There is not a weak or false performance in the concert, as you might expect.  But there are special insights provided where you might least expect it, from Gary Brooker (of Procol Harum) illuminating the melody of \\"Old Brown Shoe\\", from less well known English artist Joe Brown, who deserves to be very well known, and provides really the heart of what George was all about in three songs, \\"That's the Way It Goes\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\", from Tom Petty who provides a stunning rendition of \\"I Need You\\", and Ringo with a strong version of \\"Photograph\\" gives you a lift, as long as you don't listen carefully to what he is really saying about the song).<br /><br />Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton give strong performances but were having a hard time hiding their grief.  Come to think of it, Ringo was hiding it too well either.<br /><br />It's a great pleasure to hear the pure melodious voice of Jeff Lynne, who contributed his unique musical gifts to this project to the fullest, with great heart and soul.<br /><br />Ravi Shankar provides his spiritual strength as well as an illuminating Indian composition offered as his perception of George.  Anoushka Shankar plays a strong spirited penetrating sitar piece.<br /><br />Sam Brown (with Jools Holland on piano) delivers a really raucous performance of \\"Horse to Water\\" (co-written by George and Dhani Harrison) that drives away some of the sadness demons that threatened to linger.<br /><br />Another special aspect of the DVD set is that it gives you a chance to see and hear George's son Dhani who appears to be a gentle loving soul of great intelligence.  But as much as I've said here, there is far more to appreciate, including interviews, the theatrical version of the film, and an entire DVD devoted to the whole concert as played.<br /><br />It's very sad to think about what Ringo was saying in the concert when he said that \\"Photograph\\" has a different meaning now, and it's clear that all these people really loved George deeply and really miss him and it's not hero worship it's real affection, but at least you know from these DVDs that he's living on and doing fine in the spiritual world he elucidated in his music.s, the theatrical version of the film, and an entire DVD devoted to the whole concert as played.

B000BVD460|1.0|This album and this rapper has got to be the most overrated in recent music history, I'm glad that this guy is done, he paved the way for even more terrible rappers like 5-0 cent (I Refuse to call him 50 cent) and other terrible trash. <br /> <br />I Hope this is his curtain call, because he will never get the respect again. <br /> <br />Want a real white rapper listen to cage, if you want a real inspirational rapper of 2000's, check out Nas. <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can add little to what others have said. I bought this for my wife based on the reviews here on Amazon and we were completely captured by it. Extremely well-done - acting, photography, etc.  <br /> <br />Some viewers on the BBC website have taken issue with the adaptation from Gaskell's novel, but for the most part, the story coheres and is intact within itself. Only in the last scene does the script and director seem to depart from strict Victorian mores as an accomodation to modern sensibilities. But even then, it's hardly a deal-breaker. <br /> <br />As good as Pride and Prejudice? I can't say that exactly, since P&P was at least twice as long and had more time to be more entertaining. But I will say this -- N&S was far, far superior to most dramas on Masterpiece Theatre in recent years. Certainly equal to Wives and Daughters, and probably better. N&S has the benefit of a better male role in Mr. Thornton, and this production has the indisputable asset of Richard Armitage. My wife really liked him and I think that Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is in serious danger of being dethroned as the 19th Century paragon of appeal. <br /> <br />It seems to me that Gaskell adapts to the screen more successfully than Dickens is. We'll see what Andrew Davies does with Bleak House later in 2006. <br /> <br />Go ahead and get this. You will not be disappointed, I assure you.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I was really excited to see this movie, but I was somewhat unimpressed with it after the movie.  I spent the time watching it, and when I think back to remember specific scenes, nothing stood out in my mind.  About 30 minutes into the movie, I thought about turning it off because it just seemed so slow...  Plus, I feel like there were flashes of Tim Burton in the first part, but he didn't put his touch on the movie in the beginning when it really needed it. <br /> <br />I thought Johnny Depp was great.  He is a versatile actor, and this really proved it.  His facial movements and curt responses were hilarious, and he had the perfect perky/sinister combination that one would expect of a second generation mad scientist (behind Gene Wilder).  He basically carried this film... <br /> <br />I agree with a previous review that the Oompa Loompas really didn't do it for me.  I didn't like that they used the one guy and that they looked so computer generated.  In the first version of the movie, the Oompa Loompas were a little creepy and added to the sinister undertones.  I remember being a little scared of them when I was little.  Now with their pop interludes that were somewhat difficult to understand, I was just kind of put off... <br /> <br />Like I said earlier, I was excited to see this movie, but was wholly unimpressed after watching it.  It is difficult to separate the two movies in one's mind so as not to compare them, but if you're going to remake a childhood classic movie it had better be good, and this didn't live up to its predecessor.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|This movie is about explorers and exploring. Good ways to explore, some of the best places to explore, etc. It's pretty informative and educational. Though I think you should be cautioned that opening up an oxygen tank in a pressurized enclosed space could be quite dangerous. If you are watching this as a family, it would probably be good to explain that to your kids. Other than that, the rest of the movie is very realistic.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Although David Bowie and his band were more polished than the punk rockers, this album is more intense than any punk rock you can hear and it has form and meaning as well.  I've heard that the story of Ziggy Stardust is the story of Jimi Hendrix but I think there's more to it than biography (or even autobiography).  David Bowie created a novel rock n' roll persona with a distinct vision of the world, and a sound that was melodious but was also as thunderous as any heavy metal or punk rock you've ever heard.
B00005O5CM|4.0|What do you do when you boyfriend dumps you? Go to Harvard law school. <br /> <br />Elle (Reece Witherspoon) is the stereotypical dizzy blonde rich girl.  She is attending college to get her MRS.  And she thought she found Mr. Rich Right.  But on what she thinks is her big night, she finds out that he is dumping her.  She goes into a depression until she decides to get her guy back.  The best way to do this is get admitted to the law school he is going to attend, Harvard. <br /> <br />The scenes of her studying for the LSAT are hilarious and her admission video is even better.  (Now in reality, this would not be possible - this has to be done at least a year in advance, not over the summer). <br /> <br />Elle arrives at Harvard and is assessed by everyone as the dizzy blonde that she is.  But more important to Elle is that she never fail.  And she takes everything by storm. <br /> <br />The best part of the film is when Elle is selected to assist on a high profile murder case.  Not only does she blow the main prosecution witness out of the water but she solves the murder. <br /> <br />This film is light as fluff but it is great fluff.  Reece Witherspoon shines as Elle and is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Widescreen side - <br />Commentary with Reese Witherspoon, Director Robert Luketic and Producer Marc Platt <br /> <br />Commentary with costume designer Sophie de Rakoff Carbonell, production designer Melissa Stewart, cinematographer Anthony B Richmond, screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith, and animal trainer Sue Chipperton. <br /> <br />Full screen side - <br />Deleted Scenes - 10 minutes of deleted scenes with director's comments <br /> <br />Inside Legally Blonde - 22 minute featurette on the making of the film with producer Platt, director Luketic, writers McCullah Lutz & Smith and novelist Amanda Brown with stock publicity interviews with the cast. <br /> <br />The Hair That Ate Hollywood - 9 minute featurette on thehair styles of the movie. <br /> <br />Music Video - The Perfect Day by Hoku <br />
B00014K5TQ|3.0|oh every wensday night at limelight, the drugs the crackheads, the fashion messes... This movie makes it look like disneyland some kind of pseudo-studio 54 of the nineties... well WRONG, people that were actually there will remember that limelight was a damp dirty place. Was there a lot of sex drugs and techno? for sure.But most of the time the so called club kids were a mess... clumsy outfits, runny make up, crack smoking, hepatitis infections, etc etc etc... I feel sorry for the young teens who will see this movie and will dream of a world that actually never existed, excepte perhaps on the drug infested brains of the clud kids ( who were actually in their early 30's in most cases). What was really funny was James's jealousy against Michael, who was the actual poser of the story since he copied everything from everyone. Now Michael is in Jail and James has a well selling book.good for him.   I actually recommend \\"Party Monster\\" the shockumentary if you want to see what club kids were really like. It has original footage of parties at Limelight, and Club USA. Those pathetic trashy images could have really helped Nancy Reagan's \\"Just say no\\" campain in the 80's...
B0007VCZ50|5.0|Gigantic as Sting is, for me, he is still in the TDWR category. This exceptional DVD provides an insight into the genius of Sting as a star, songwriter, singer, musician, guitarist and actor. (And I think he knows a bit about bass too) This is Sting \\"bridging the chasm\\", showing his incredibly rich colours as the greatest jazz rock musician ever. Whoa! That's a big claim! Or is it? Does anyone else come close? Well i love Steely Dan, but they don't have the incredible reach of this living legend who has reached ears and hearts in every crevice of the world. And if you count looks, voice and charisma too, then there is no one even remotely close.  <br />  <br />This is a promotional film for the \\"Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" album and also a documentation of a historic concert tour with a band that is made up of some the finest Jazz players of the 70-80 fusion era. Each one plays within Stings unique version of this genre and excels. It would be hard to compliment any one of these musicians, as each is playing at a mind blowing level. Omar Hakim certainly gets a chance to show his awesome prowess, as does everyone else in varying degrees.  <br /> <br />The song line up is the entire DOBT album plus some, ending in what may well have been the first solo version of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" that was to become a Sting concert signature. The transfer is well up to Sting's very high standards, in particular, the DTS audio track. Hey! This film was made in 1985 in stereo, on film! The extras are good fun too! <br /> <br />Sting's acting skills are on display as well, for the 'rehearsals' shown here are probably after the DOBT album was released, which would mean that all these musicians, not exactly amateurs, know the music by heart already. Knowing this titbit however, takes nothing away from this film or the music. In fact, it highlights one more facet of the immense talent of Sting. And some of the script, the interviews, well, this is a movie and it looks like a well made documentary. Congratulations here to Michael Apted on an amazing job. <br /> <br />There is even a section showing the actual birth of Stings child, set to a haunting backdrop of \\"Russians\\". And a glimpse into the photography of 'Mad' Max Vadukul. I mean, how much more could you possibly ask for?!! The whole concert perhaps. But then you may not buy the cd, which is a 'must have' for any Sting fan. And between the 'rehearsals' and the concert, everything is pretty much covered here. Incidentally, the rehearsals are set in a old and stunning Chateau in Paris. Btw, the concert's in Paris too. (!) <br />  <br />To think that this was just the beginning of a beyond extraordinary career, makes it even more staggering. If you consider that this was his first \\"solo\\" tour, so to speak, this is Sting at his musical and theatrical best. If you are a Sting fan, then you already own this dvd. If you aren't...buy it and you will be a Sting fan instantly. And he released 7 more brilliant albums after DOBT! Plus 3 more. Staggering?!!! This Englishman's all over the globe!!  <br /> <br />***** <br /> <br />Apu Sista
B0001I562I|5.0|This movie is about a kid who not only is the navigator but also becomes the pilot. It makes for a good movie but is kind of dangerous in real life. People watching this as a family should be sure to explain to their kids that: <br /> <br />A. People who are navigating in the car should stick to reading the map and not try to drive at the same time. <br /> <br />B. Kids should never drive a moving vehicle until they turn 16 and get their license. ESPECIALLY aircraft. <br /> <br />C. Kid's should NEVER go walking out alone near deserted railroad tracks. <br /> <br />Thanks for talking to your kids about these important issues.
0790731002|1.0|Strikingly cheesy dialogue, lousy acting, amateurish fight scenes that look like they came from some 1970s TV movies, a bloated and schizoid script that bounces all over the place---Joel Schumacher has made what is by far the worst Batman movie in history!<br /><br />What a shame to waste a fairly decent cast: Nicole Kidman, Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey...why on earth they'd cast Chris O'Donnell as \\"Robin\\" (other than to attract pubescent girls) boggles the mind, this kid couldn't act his way out of a paper bag!<br /><br />I rented this movie because I wanted to test out a new subwoofer in my home theater system, thank God I didn't buy it.<br /><br />Especially watching the latest installment, the excellent \\"Batman Begins\\"---the sheer incompetence displayed in every aspect of \\"Batman Forever\\" is just appalling.
B0000025DD|5.0|I am enjoying this album for 20 years now and I should say I enjoy every second of it, even the gap between the tracks! David Gilmours' soothing character evolves in this work and it is actually in this fine piece of art that he proves his style to be uniquely brilliant and adorable. This self titled album is a must for every fans collection besides the album \\"About Face\\". The close harmony to Rick Write is noticeable especially when you play the album \\"Wet Dreams\\" after this one. These are the music that will be enjoyed by generations after generations and we are just lucky to be in the right tide, and watch them live on TV or in Concerts. But does it matter? I don't really think so ... they are the meaning of immortality!
B000001F7E|5.0|This 1971 album is far and away the best Rod Stewart album and one of the Top 10 albums of that decade.  This was only his third album and it went to the top of the album charts both in the U.S. and the U.K., whereas \\"Gasoline Alley,\\" released the previous year had only made it to #27 on the Billboard chart (it would not be until 1979 that Stewart would have another album reach #1, with \\"Blondes Have More Fun\\").  In the early part of his career Stewart managed to find interesting ways of mixing folk, rock, blues and country, both in his single career and as the front man for the Faces, who released both their second (\\"Long Player\\") and third albums (\\"A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse Faces\\") that year as well (\\"Stay With Me\\" was the big hit off of the later).  So for Rod Stewart 1971 was a very good year.<br /><br />The big single off of this album, of course, is \\"Maggie May,\\" hit #1 for several weeks (this was the first song we played for our daughter Maggie, the day after she was born).  This is one of the great songs about being seduced by an older woman.  Two other singles charted, the rockin' cover of \\"(I Know) I'm Losing You\\" originally done by the Temptations, which made it to #24, and Stewart's poignant cover of Tim Hardin's \\"Reason to Believe,\\" which ends the album on a quiet note and made it to #62.  Then there is the exquisite \\"Mandolin Wind\\" (played by some guy Rod forgot the name of) and the frenetic energy of the title track, which lulls you into a false sense of security by beginning with an acoustic guitar part before the drums start drivin' this one hard and fast.  Surprisingly, most of the songs on this one are covers, the exceptions between \\"Mandolin Wind\\" and the title track, the latter co-written by Stewart with lead guitarist Ron Wood.<br /><br />Stewart exhibits a lot of range on this album and for me the only that could possible qualify as a misfire would be the cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Tomorrow Is Such a Long Time,\\" which is a bit ironic because you would think that would work.  \\"Seems Like a Long Time\\" is pretty good, as is the rollickin' \\"That's All Right\\" by \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup.  I even love the sheet music on the \\"back cover\\" (\\"It's Full of Good Things and Loads of Suggestions\\"). As far as I am concerned if your choice is between this and a Rod Stewart \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD, get this one because it is all downhill for Stewart from this point on.bit ironic because you would think that would work.  \\"Seems Like a Long Time\\" is pretty good, as is the rollickin' \\"That's All Right\\" by \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup.

B000065V3H|4.0|this movie is a case of popular girl doesn't know nerd guy that loves her, and then she is forced to be around him and falls in love with him.  it's very predictable but still very sweet and very funny.  seth green gives a small but comical role in this film as wel.  it's well worth watching.  i would highly recommend it.
B000002GY9|5.0|I first heard this several years ago, and it still has not yet stopped growing on me. Right now it stands as my favorite release from Tom Waits, and that is for several reasons.<br /><br />The pure feel of this album ranges from somber to playful and funny at the drop of a hat. The beginning two tracks are a great example of this. The soft and haunting Tom Traubert's Blues starts the album off with that somber note, but the album quickly changes directions with Step Right Up, which features a lively standing bass line along with some hilarious lyrics, most of them seem to be improvised, but I could be wrong. This album takes on many other faces throughout. There's the drunken afterhours at a bar feel, there's the walking down the street alone on a rainy night feel, and there's that classic feel like what you get on Jitterbug Boy.<br /><br />As for the songs, I'll go through them one by one, just to give an idea of what they're like.<br /><br />1. Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen): This is the classic Waltzing Matilda song done with a little of this and that thrown in, in Tom Waits fashion. However, the song keeps that somber feel and really comes out quite beautifully.<br /><br />2. Step Right Up: A fun song, that up tempo bass line on the standing bass is accompanied by some Tom Waits bizarre lyrics, but done with such genius as well.<br /><br />3. Jitterbug Boy: Another softer and more reflective type of song. The lyrics seem to be from someone who lived in the period when the jitterbug was the dance craze, and they speak of all of the things that the person has seen in their life. Another very beautiful song.<br /><br />4. I Wish I Was in New Orleans: Another more somber song, more of the melodic Tom Waits. This one seems to be about what the title itself explains. Yet another of his more soothing works.<br /><br />5. The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me): This one's one of his softer songs, but the lyrics make it quite a comedic piece.Basically a song that describes being pretty drunk in a New Orleans blues bar.<br /><br />6. Invitation to the Blues: More of Tom's more bluesy stuff, this one's pretty slow and has a nice melody in a minor key.<br /><br />7. Pasties and a G-String: Hilarious song with some of Tom's best lyrics ever. It's about watching strippers dance and such.<br /><br />8. Bad Liver and a Broken Heart: Basically a slower song that reminds me of overdrinking and losing a lover. Soft and soothing.<br /><br />9. The One that Got Away: Similar to the previous track, but without anything that reminds me of drinking and more spoken.<br /><br />10. Small Change: The is another that seems to tell more of a story in that bluesy style that Tom Waits does so well.<br /><br />11. I Can't Wait to Get Off Work: I think this song should be going through everyone's head around 4 PM on every Friday. Great way to end the album as well.<br /><br />This album really covers quite a bit of ground in the Tom Waits spectrum, but it mostly focuses on his more melodic stuff, which is what he was doing a lot more of at that time. He does go a bit into some of the percussive stuff that he would do with many of his releases in the 80's, but really just touches on that. As a whole he really manages to take the listener through quite a bit with this one.
B000002NZO|5.0|Many people like Genesis.Their personal Genesis version, of course, with sappy phil's crooning and simplistic and cliche'd \\"love\\" lyrics. <br />   Nonetheless these people have at least half a brain and often more,and who knows, if they gave albums like TRESPASS, SELLING ENGLAND BY THR POUND,or NURSURY CRYME,they could become rabid fanatics of \\"old school\\" Genesis.My view is biased,as I consider Genesis to be the definitive prog band,my favorite band ever.This view is based exclusively on the first 5 albums. <br />   what is to love about these albums? First, they are a thinking man's group, not just from a lyrical point of view, but also from a musicianship aspect.The term \\"classic Rock\\" is often bandied about describing everything from AMERICA to ZZ TOP, but true classic rock, in my opinion is what bands like Genesis,Yes, Kansas,Marillion,Pink Floyd and many others do, is rely heavily on the devices used by classical music composers like Wagner, Beethoven,Barber, Copeland, you know, the romantic or modern composers, and the list goes on, of course. <br />   Now to the heart of the matter, trespass.this is my Genesis favorite as it combines haunting music and lyrics. The track \\"White Mountain\\" reminds me of Jack London novels containing Alpha male behaviors of dogs and wolves, culminating perhaps, in an allegory to human behaviour.(I don't know, many Genesis lyrics could be interpreted various ways)Often I have been preachy about exonorating the virtues of Gabriel's lyrics, but in later albums like SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND, and THE LAMB LIES DOWN ON BROADWAY i find cheesy puns like \\"so they employed me as a karma mechanic with OVERALL charms\\" or, \\"Carl Chessman sniffs the air\\"(Chessman was sentanced to death by gas rather than lethal injection)This stuff turns me off, but none of this appears in Trespass.The mood is like that of a Tolkien or C.S Lewis writing atmosphere, fantasia. <br />   From a musical standpoint, this album is dreamland.Listening to \\"Stagnation\\" about 2:30 into it, is the most hauntingly (Beautiful/creepy?) mellotron organ interlude.I know it's melodramatic, but this is really the most mystical moment that I have ever experienced. <br />  Methinks it is wise to save shillings and pence and buy the remastered version.I would agree with other reviewers this is an album that needs sonic salvation.
0393324818|5.0|The main reason I'm giving this book five stars is that I believe it will strongly appeal to a wide range of different types of baseball book readers, including:  Those who like \\"inside the wars\\" books, amateur statistical analysts, even fans of those How Brilliant Investor X Beat Wall Street type books.  The book has a strong streak along those latter lines:  it's a profile of someone who figured out inefficiencies in the baseball market, and how to exploit them to compensate for other structural disadvantages his team faced. <br /> <br />The book reads very briskly and engagingly.  To the extent that it covers statistical issues, it does it in a way that is accessible to the layperson, and it never disrupts the flow of the narrative.   <br /> <br />The author consistently finds an involving story to demonstrate each point he wants to make.  For example, there's a chapter on amateur draft day: there's something exciting about such drafts, even if it's in a Rotisserie league or a tabletop league; the fun of determining which players you think are most valuable, and spending your picks as best you can. In another chapter, when the author wants to explain how to value pitchers, he charts the career of the undervalued Chad Bradford. <br /> <br />The essence of the book is really a single story:  how an undercapitalized team remained competitive with baseball's strongest powers simply by internalizing many of the lessons learned by an army of amateur statistical analysts over the past 20 years.  The focus is especially on the lessons that collide with conventional baseball wisdom:  because that's where the good buying and selling opportunities come, when your competition doesn't recognize something that you do. <br /> <br />Among those lessons:  the importance of on-base percentage (including the ability to draw walks), the predictive value of minor league and college level batting stats, when it's foolish to run yourself out of innings or to bunt, and how a pitcher's \\"defense-independent\\" stats are the best indicator of future performance.   <br /> <br />The other side of the coin is the stuff that doesn't matter as much as baseball scouts think it does:  raw physical tools, athleticism, speed, strength, etc.  Just because you're swift and strong doesn't mean you can reliably read the location of a pitch and can consistently hit a baseball moving 95 mph.  Or, as one wag once well put it, \\"If you want to produce a big canteloupe, the best thing to start with is a small canteloupe, not a collection of big canteloupe parts.\\"  In other words, pay attention to what the guy did in the minors. <br /> <br />I myself am loosely part of that stathead community; I've published a few articles and used to have e-mail correspondence relationships with at least three of the people mentioned in the book.  So I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did; I expected to feel a bit of a \\"seen it before\\" reaction to the statistical insights. <br /> <br />But I didn't; what made the book work for me is that it's not about guys like me, it's about someone on the inside, actually applying that knowledge, and building that knowledge, in the crucible of major league competition.  That's exciting and fun to read about. <br /> <br />Just one word of caution:  while the author does, I believe, accurately describe some of the analysis that has enabled the A's to prosper despite their small payroll, occasionally the author makes it sound a little more determinative than it all really is.  A few cautions I'd sound: the bunt isn't quite as bad as the author makes it seem, because the bunt often increases the probability of scoring one run, even as it significantly decreases the probability of scoring three runs.  Not every run in baseball is equally valuable, the first few increase your win probability much more than do the 7th and 8th.  Also, while walks are important and do have predictive value, you won't keep walking if you can't hit.  You can't reallybase a major league offense solely on walks, because the other teams won't keep walking you if you don't hit.  So some of the players cited in the book with gaudy OBPs have had trouble maintaining even the walk totals that they had before. <br /> <br />I liked the book mainly because it fueled my fantasies of being a baseball GM. Any book that well feeds such pleasant idle ruminations is, for me, a very fun read.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|The songwriting is there.  The talent and hard worked arrangements are there as well, but it all seems to have lost what we loved.  It has to be in the mix.  This album is really loud, and all of the instruments seem to be jarbeled together.  Julian's voice is often times hard to pick out of the other instruments, and the other instruments all seem to sound the same as one another.  There wasn't that unique tone that I loved about every other strokes album.  Their beautiful attention to tone is what painted \\"Is This It?\\" and \\"Room On Fire\\" into masterpieces.  So if the strokes could just please remix this, maybe add some different effects pedals or somthing, I don't know, just do somethine because it doesn't sound right.  However, don't let all this negativity distract you from the fact that there is some brilliant songwriting on this album, as well as some heartfelt performances by Julian.
B000002UAU|5.0|In classical music, there is Bach, who they are wont to say wrote the rules of composition in stone for all composers to follow. Many composers, in their own era and idiom followed, and were judged accordingly.     I believe that The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is similar in that respect:  that the laws of a well thought-out rock album are subconsciously manifest in \\"Pepper...\\" for all that follow in their own era and idiom.     Even if The Beatles themselves have claimed it was not thought to be any sort of true concept record, there is a mood to the album that is uncanny in its dramatic progression. The songs, beginning with a band concert fade dream-like into realms of imagination, joy, regrets, nostalgia, sexual fantasy, and even self-exploration. Then, \\"A Day in the Life\\" is a jolt of sobering realism with the ending multi-octave G chord, resonating with depth and revelation.    History brings us many firsts that must stand the test of time. Those that survive are the cornerstones of which civilization and culture are founded upon. \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" will forever be exhaulted because it is a standing stone in the history of music where rock music owed up to its classical past.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I couldn't afford to see the Phantom of the Opera when the play was touring the country, but had always wanted to see it.  I didn't even know a movie version had been made, when I happened to catch it on cable television recently.  I am glad I waited.  I don't know when I've seen a better movie, or listened to a better musical score.  Emmy Rossum's voice, although not polished, is PERFECT for her young character, and a very pleasing compliment to Gerard Butler's voice.  Mr. Butler takes total control in the role, expressing more emotion and feeling than I thought any male actor was capable of.  He truly makes you feel everything his character feels, and his voice shows it and expresses it perfectly.  As for Patrick Wilson, he does a very credible job, but in the end, if I were Christine, I would have picked Butler over him any day.  After seeing the movie, all my friends who had seen the play said it was much better, that no one could sing the roles better than Crawford and Brightman.  Well, I bought the soundtrack for the original cast, and I was very dissapointed.  Anyone who can say that Crawford sings better than Butler has listened to too much polished unemotional music and has forgotten what it is to feel passion when you listen to a song.  The same goes for Christine's role...Brightman is too old and too polished a singer for the role of a young 16 year old girl.  Rossum, however, fits the part perfectly and relays the character's innocence.  The director of the movie hit the nail on the head by casting younger actors which were more suited to the role.  The movie version also has some changes in the lyrics of the songs...for the better - the new lyrics express more emotion and fit the scenes better. I absolutely love this movie and the soundtrack - I haven't been able to get the music out of my head.  The extended version is well worth getting...it has hours of history on the development of the stage play, and a wonderful making of feature of the film version.  You get to hear the earlier versions of the songs sung by Brightman, before they hired a new lyricist and changed most of the words...it's nice to see how the roles developed over time. This play has definately been polished and perfected by the numerous years it has played...and in the movie version we now get to see the fruit of those efforts...and it is - in a word - PERFECT!
B00005JNJV|5.0|Great, great film.  The look is at once both dark and brilliant. The casting and acting are superb (nice to see Rutger Hauer finally get a decent role - his best since Bladerunner).<br /><br />This is probably the best comic-book to film adaptation of all time.  The writer and director give us a serious rather than silly, campy take on Batman.  After Joel Schumaker (or whatever his name is/was) destroyed the franchise with his glitzy Broadway-inspired-coreographic crap I figured I would never see another Batman film in my lifetime.  I believed the Warner Bros Batman franchise was dead.  I am happy to report I was wrong.  This film makes up for those debacles and far outshines the Tim Burton films.  The franchise is alive and well. Let's hope they can keep it up.<br /><br />One tiny criticism - you have to buy the special edition version to get any special features. There are no special features on this edition.  Cheap stinginess on the part of Warner Bros.
0156027321|3.0|I picked up this book a year or so ago and couldn't get through the first 50 pages.  Then, this month, it was chosen for our book club.  I was determined to get through it this time, and I did.  I found the dicussion Pi raises in the beginning of the book about practicing three religions insightful and interesting.  It seemed very fitting given the current global unrest that so often centers around religious tensions.  However, once out at sea, the book became tedious and the narrative slow.  It seemed as though the middle section of the book could have been edited down to be more effective.  The ending was very thought provoking and raised some interesting questions about faith and reality.  While in all the book touched on some interesting aspects, it was not a favorite.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|I agree with several critics and a few people here on Amazon that this is not the film promised to audiences. For all the hype about pushing the envelope, \\"Hostel\\" is quite tame folks. There are a few good \\"gore\\" scenes, but I would say all the torture scenes put together would probably only add up to 10 or 15 minutes at the most. The rest of the film is all atmosphere and suggestion (i.e. sounds hinting at what is happening). Honestly, the way people were talking, I expected at least one gratuitously long, horrific, detailed torture scene that was almost difficult to watch. Nope. And during the rather brief scenes, we still see very little...again, suggestion. I still give the film 3 stars because of the excellent atmosphere, which somehow provides an increasing sense of dread before we ever see what happens inside the slaughterhouse. The film also makes you think a little...what if there WAS a place where people could pay to torture people for revenge, sick pleasures, etc? But overall the payoff is nothing like what we people were promised. I will wait for a director's cut (you just KNOW one is coming) and try this film again. That said, I would not reccomend the theatrical cut to anyone expecting an extreme horror film. \\"Kill Bill\\", which is an ACTION flick, is far and away more graphic than this \\"horror\\" film. There's something not right about this!

B000B8QEZG|3.0|Contrary to \\"His (self proclaimed) Majesties\\" bloated ego, and generally warped since of reality...It is Madonna...not \\"Wacko Jacko\\" that is the \\"Gen-X\\" Elvis Presley, or Beatles (aka...King/Queen of pop).  <br />No: you can not serve two rulers! Choose your supreme social deviate wisely!  <br />Eccentricities aside: Of the two, I think history will show Madonna's music (although nowhere near the era's most prolific or accomplished) will be (for better...or worse) more consistently relevant and evocative of the main-stream pop culture of her time. <br />You must confess: Anyone that is old enough to remember a time when lingerie was not considered \\"outer-wear\\" is bound to know they are participating in a culture that is (in some respects) derivative of the influence of this artist. But, more important than making \\"virginity\\" a relative term, Her real success was combining \\"Disco\\" with elements of \\"New Wave\\" and presenting it with a (pseudo) \\"Punk\\" aesthetic. Doing this she single-handedly resuscitated dance music in the early eighties when it was definitely out of...\\"vogue\\". It was a time when \\"Pop\\" radio was especially dominated by \\"Adult-Oriented\\" \\"Middle-of-the-Road\\" schmaltz. By bringing these divergent (and refreshing) \\"Underground\\" themes into the main-stream she not only invigorated her own genre, but opened a path that allowed more progressive artists to find their way onto the airwaves. Always the trail-blazer, Madonna has persistently toyed with our perception of her enigma. With \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" she appears to have decided to stop pulling the cart, and jump in for a ride. It's a pretty strait forward techno/dance affair, which is pretty much what the thing she breathed life into some twenty-odd years ago has since evolved into. To be honest, I don't listen to a lot of this kind of thing, so I don't know how it compares to contemporary artists of this genre. It has some weaker moments (religion and disco do not mix), but I confess...it brought me back to the dance floor...again!  <br />
B000005H4I|5.0|This is my first and still favorite jazz record of all time. My son introduced my to it and I can listen to it over and over. This guy blows sax like nobody's business. Right up there with Coltrane. My regret is that I didn't listen soon enough or was interested enough  earlier in my life. I have the movie 'Round Midnight and don't doubt that Dexter looked better than anyone in a suit including Miles Davis. A must have album for a jazz collection.

0064409422|5.0|It is the classic conflict between Good and Evil. Four school children discover an entrance to a world of fantasy through a wardrobe. It is a world that will change them forever. They assist the golden lion Aslan to defeat the White Witch who has cursed Narnia with eternal winter.... \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was so interesting and captivating that I read it in one day. It is one of my favorite books. After I reading it I bought the other books in the series.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently received the series \\"Firefly\\" as a gift.  I was wanting to watch it before I watched \\"Serenity\\" since they go hand in hand.  I don't what they were thinking cancelling the show. <br />  The cast of Firefly is so well put together and there is so much character base you can't really do anything besides watch.  The interaction between the cast and the character development is very impressive.  Most of the actors have had small roles in motion pictures or been a recurring character on a tv series, so they've all gotthe experience.  In Firefly though it seems that the characters were made to play those roles.   <br />  As far as the stories and episodes go, well they are pretty put together.  Its not necessarily a series that you would be completely lost in if you came in half way through but it is good to have seen it from the beginning.  The story is alittle deeper than most TV series out there right now.  Seeing the way the characters act makes more sense because some background is provided on just about all of the characters.  Also the irony in what they do to survive is great.  All anti-heros whether they like it or not. <br />  In closing I just have to say that this series deserves alot more than what it was given.  Regardless, if you're a sci-fi fan or not, this is something you would enjoy.  If you like shows where you get to know your characters and want to have a good time watching this is the way to go.

0393035158|3.0|This book deserves credit for its strong exposition of the danger posed by those who use religion as a justification for violence, and how these justifications can be traced to the texts of the relgions themselves.  Harris does Christianity a grave disservice by conflating its fundamental believers with those of Islam, but the problems of his thesis run much deeper.  The three rational responses to a belief in no God are hedonism, despair and utopianism.  Harris is a utopian, not of a brutal nature like the original communists, but a humanist.  He believes that the ideal society can be created rationally (in practice, not just in theory), without submission to a higher authority.  Utopians are thus, unlike hedonists or the desperate, people of faith - an unreasonably great degree of faith in reason.  Among the many unreasonable tenets that Sam Harris holds (overtly or by implication) are these: 1) That the spread of Christianity through Europe led merely to the \\"dark ages\\" and not to the establishment of great universities, commerce, science, democracy and the abolition of the omnipresent institution of slavery; 2) That the truth and fruits of religion are to be judged by the most damnable behavior of those claiming it as their inspiration, and not by the most blessed; and 3) That the existence of your appendix trumps everything else you are as evidence that you are not intelligently designed.  The End of Faith is thus a very successful exercise in missing the forest for the trees.

In the explicit version, the phrase \\"flying high\\" is replaced with \\"fu**ing high.\\"  We made the mistake of getting the explicit version not realizing the explicit word was in You're Beautiful.  Ruined the song for us so we sold it and bought the clean version.  Not much different except for that song - but it was an important difference to us.

B00001OH7N|4.0|After the wispy folk of 'Space Oddity', Bowie dramatically changes direction with the bluesy, psychedelic rock of 'The Man Who Sold the World.' Guitarist extraordinaire Mick Ronson pummels the soundscape to great effect with rambling, distorted solos reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page. Bowie brings us tidings of the supernatural in his reedy, Anthony Newley voice. The overall effect is brooding and heavy, lyrically speaking you could call this Bowie's satanic album.  <br /> <br />The opening song 'Width of a Circle' is one of Bowie's most disturbing constructions, depicting a homosexual tryst with God. The centerpiece of the album 'All the Madmen' is another epic, albeit more focused song. Bowie evilly recounts his disintegrating state of mind as his brain gradually degenerates. The final chorus of \\"Zane, zane, zane. Ouvre the chien\\" never fails to put chills up my spine. 'Black Country Rock' is a more straightforward and pleasant rocker, with Bowie humourously impersonating Marc Bolan. 'After all' is a lost, lovely classic Bowie ballad. Other standouts include 'Saviour Machine' and 'The Supermen', which include excellent effects such as timpani and backing choirs. Finally the title track is classic Bowie, in which the protagonist confronts his doppelganger. This song was later covered by Nirvana (although I like the Nirvana version, in my opinion it doesn't hold a candle to the original).  <br /> <br />Although there are a couple of weak spots, this is a very good (and very disturbing!) Bowie album. Highly recommended especially if you're into early heavy metal bands such as Cream, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00004RFFS|3.0|The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film.<br /><br />So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat-- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand.<br /><br />I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in \\"...Vampire\\", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of \\"La Jetee\\" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones).<br /><br />The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time.<br /><br />A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...

B0000AQS0F|5.0|We saw 'Serenity' over the holidays, and promptly bought the 'Firefly' dvd boxed set.  What joy - to discover such a wonderful series now.  What heartbreak - to know that only these few episodes exist. We tried to ration them out to make them last longer, but couldn't stop ourselves from watching another and then another, and another. We just finished watching the last episode and are devastated - there is no more! It went way too fast. Yes, it could be classified as science fiction; and yes, there is occasionally, sexual content, but give it a try. The characters are diverse, yet each engaging in their own way, and the cast is superb. It is a series that is so enjoyable as to almost be addicting.  We are certainly going through severe withdrawal. It is a gem.
0553801503|1.0|Here's what happened to JK Rowling: <br /> <br />She wrote three hit books.  Editors tightened them up and thus cut the length by half. <br />She became a superstar. Gained power to dismiss editorial contributions. <br />Her fourth book was twice as long and not as good. <br /> <br />Same exact deal with Martin.  Except in his case, twice as big meant it was 2000 pages long and it HAD to be split into two books. <br /> <br />Doubt what I'm saying? Take a look at the covers.  On the first three, the biggest type is the name of the novel.  On the fourth, it's this: MARTIN.   <br /> <br />Clear indication that the George Martin brand is now what's being sold, not the book or its quality.  That this book went #1 only ensures the trend will continue. <br /> <br />Predictions for Dance With Dragons: <br /> <br />1. Nothing happens. <br /> <br />2. It takes 800 pages not to happen. <br /> <br />3. The number of viewpoints continues to double every book, so by the last book, there are literally 50 viewpoints telling the story.   <br /> <br />4. The readers, if there are any left, will only care about 5 of those 50. <br /> <br />Time to look for a new fantasy writer...

Can't think of any other singer who does that for me.  When he sings \\"You and I\\" - well  - I can't even put it into words.  It makes me feel like no other song ever has before. What a wonderful gift from God - to be able to make people feel this way! <br /> <br />Michael - you have a fan for life here!  This is one addiction I'm hanging on to 'cause it feels sooooo gooood!   <br /> <br />
0694524743|1.0|I love this particular book in the series and was sooooo disappointed when I began listening to it.  I could not believe that the producer of the audio tapes wasn't cringing as I was every time Michael York slipped into his Aslan, lion voice.... <br />It was really pathetic......I agree with everything the previous reviewer said about the really poor job done on this reading.  p.u.
B0000CAXID|5.0|even though it has the name foo fighters on the front this is not a foo's album as the first offical foo's album was the colour and the shape two years later in 1997 with pat smear-guitars-nate mendal-bass-dave grohl playin' most of the drums   this is dave grohl's solo album of excellance   from the first song \\"this is a call\\" you will be sucked into believing this is grohl doin' another grunge album starin' off were nirvana left off..that is not so this is by far not a grunge album...it has all the charms from the tracks \\"big me\\" with the fluffy poppy guitars and the delightful \\"for all the cows\\"   but also you get distorted guitars and growled vocals   in the shape of \\"alone+easy target\\" \\"floaty\\" \\"oh george\\" and \\"x-static\\" all them songs are grade A++   yeah grohl's lyrics may not make sense but isn't that the point of rock and roll sometimes..yeah it's great to have meaningful lyrics but sometimes you need a bit of fun and goofiness   i think grohl was trying to target the grunge fans who loved nirvana but also trying to get too the pop fans aswell and he suceeded in makin' a great solo album with the foo fighters   P.S greg dulli plays guitar on X-static
0393312836|5.0|What is a clockwork orange? Anthony Burgess, the author of A Clockwork Orange, would seem like the first person to ask such a question. \\"`The attempt to impose upon man, a creature of growth and capable of sweetness, to ooze  juicily at the last round the bearded lips of God, to attempt to impose, I say, laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation, against this I raise my sword pen-'\\" (22). Alex, and his three pals, Dim, Georgie, and Pete, are normal teenagers living in a futuristic world that is somewhat of a nightmare. These boys' rape women, steal, kill, and savagely beat other citizens living in this time; as a solution the government \\"rewires\\" Alex to feel sick when the want to do any of these things occurs. He becomes \\"a clockwork orange\\" in the sense that he doesn't have the ability to decide what is good, or evil, and whether to participate in \\"evil\\" acts. Had the book only consisted of my brief outline above, it wouldn't be the well known and thoroughly enjoyed classic that it is today. Along with an eyebrow raising plot, the style, questioning of morality, and unique outlook on the future, makes A Clockwork Orange, not only an important book, but an entertaining one. I truly enjoyed reading, and re-reading this book. I assume that throughout my progression into adulthood, I will find it entertaining for different reasons than I do now, and I hope to re-read it again, and again. A book that can change, as a person changes, is something to cherish to enjoy. I believe that most people will find entertainment, if not shock value, to this controversial text. I definitely consider it to be one of my favorites, and a must read to all participants of an educated society.
B000020617|3.0|foo fighters have amazed me over the years from the blistering self titled album with it's grunge/pop/rock feel too the acoustic rockin' the colour and the shape and now comes too this album \\"nothin' left to lose\\" you look on the front and you see \\"grammy award 2001 rock album of the year\\" and i thought to myself wow..if it's got a grammy it has too be good oh how wrong can a sticker be...this is far from being good..mildy average if i do say so...firstly what's with the nice and sweet guitars that remind me of busted \\"before they were even creating commerical music\\" and the lyrics some are brilliant then i started too wonder is the grohl man tryi' too be funny or seriuos because i couldn't really decide.. <br />that said the opening track \\"stacked actors\\" is a full throttle drivin' song that's a foos classic that doesn't get much airplay live...the overall feel of the album is that it's forced and marketed for radio..not for the fans too sink their teeth into as it's just nothin' there and i feel ashameed too say that but there's nothin' here of worth to hold the torch for the great name of the foo fighters.. <br />atleast the grohl man redemed himself with the next album \\"one by one\\" a classic this is by far not a classic a mediocre album made for the commerical radio fat cats...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I makes me so sad that Firefly was cancelled after only a handful of brilliant episodes while mind-numbing dreck like Fear Factor and Laguna Beach just won't die!!!  <br /> <br />Okay, if all the praise heaped upon this series for its amazing writing and acting has not yet convinced you to pick it up, then my input concerning those matters will be unlikely persuade you to give it a chance. I am forced to try a different tactic. Say it with me: EYE CANDY GALORE! Joss Whedon has a knack for putting together casts that are so pretty it makes my eyes hurt. The women are all stunningly beautiful, from the delicately lovely Summer Glau and Morena Baccarin, the adorable Jewel Staite, to the Amazon goddess that is Gina Torres. Adam Baldwin is twice my age, but I still swoon and get all flustered everytime he's onscreen as Jayne, the \\"man ape gone wrong\\". Nathan Fillion is all sorts of sexy and alluring as the captain Mal Reynolds and Sean Maher is just way prettier than any girl I know. And Alan Tudyk, way more attractive than most people give him credit for and just as funny. Plus, all these pretty people wielding guns and getting into fights and narrowly escaping death. Who would NOT want to see that? <br /> <br />Okay seriously, not only are they pretty, they are some of the most talented actors working today. The writing on \\"Firefly\\" is impeccable (\\"JOSS IS BOSS\\"), but the characters are what really make the show for me. The actors' portrayals are spot on and somehow, within a very limited amount of time, you get sucked into this universe, and want to spend more time with these people who seem so real and appealing and yes I have a life. The show is just that much wittier, funnier, and more involving than anything on TV today. Give  \\"Firefly\\" a chance and by \\"Ariel\\" (That was when the show changed from good to amazing for me), you too will be in my shoes, begging all your friends and random strangers to \\"Please just watch one episode of the best show ever.\\"
0312995423|1.0|No where near as enjoyable a read as the Da Vinci code and really annoying because he talks about places in Spain, Sevilla as if it was 40 years ago. The way he describes Sevilla as a backward type of place shows the poor or non existant research he did regards the places depicted in the book. <br />I was reading about totally modern problems of cryptology and about up to date computer hardware and it really grated when he spoke of Seveilla as if it was in a third world country. Either he did one of those \\"Europe in 5 days tours\\" that the the Americans seem to love or he looked in an out of date book for information. <br />Frankly I was appalled by this unprofessional approach of a bestselling author. <br /> <br />I hope he did a better job of Rome in the other book of his...
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I'm huge fans of the first two albums and would rate those 5 stars. I would rate this one 4 just because i think it has one or two songs that could have been dropped off the album. With that said it is still a really good record, and I do feel that they push their style into some cool new directions. It's def worth picking up.
015626224X|4.0|In his novel, \\"Down and Out in Paris and London,\\" George Orwell explores the complicated lives of the lowest class in society. For a time, he lives as a tramp to gain the fullest experience possible. His writing serves to inform the public of the difficult lives of the lowest class, and he presents his views in a manner such that it gently reminds the reader of Orwell's experience while educating him or her on the numerous ways that poverty affects daily life. His examples show the complications of poverty that the public would never consider unless experiencing it for themselves. They cover the simple issues of obtaining food on a low budget to the embarrassment and humiliation of admitting poverty to friends and co-workers. Orwell also takes care to mention the secrecy and deceit involved with lack of money, and how the complications that accompany it are inevitable.  <br /> <br />Orwell examines one of the main goals of a tramp: finding a job. He describes the frequent and fruitless searches for a job, and the desperation and misery that follows. Even when he obtains a job at Hotel X, he still speaks of the unhappiness he experiences. He compares his job as a plongeur to that of a modern day slave, and describes the harsh working conditions and long hours. Orwell is constantly tired as a result of working at the hotel.  <br /> <br />To inform the reader of the time spent in between jobs for a tramp, Orwell skillfully describes the spikes that serve as a place to sleep at night and a source of food. With his imagery and figurative language, Orwell paints a desolate picture. The reader is both shocked and horrified to imagine the conditions that Orwell describes; with this, Orwell touches the reader's pathos. He brings to life the characters that he spent time with, during his traveling or at the spikes. His humor causes the reader to look almost fondly upon the characters Orwell includes. <br /> <br />Throughout his novel, Orwell incorporates his opinion of the situation the tramps are placed in. His opinions are not blatantly portrayed, but included in such a persuasive style so that the reader agrees with his point of view before even forming a personal opinion. He makes sure to provide the reader with logic and reasons to back up his arguments, and carefully phrases his personal thoughts. Not only is Orwell extremely articulate and intelligent, but he is logical and emphathetic towards the tramps as well. His novel is certainly a piece of writing that brings light on the world of the lower class for the reader, and presents a heartfelt view of the life of a tramp.
0684847817|3.0|This book was a pretty good book if you wanted to know about goblins and brownies, and there was a few faeries that had good detail but Mr. Froud didnt go in depth about the seelie and unseelie which personaly something I like to learn about. If you really dont care if he included it or not then go right ahead and read it you'll definatly like it then.

I am writing my autobiography and hope I can express what I have been through as well as james frey did. Everyone should read this book. It will open your eyes to the real world of addiction. Congradulations James yo are one in a million. Keep up the good work.
0060254920|5.0|I somehow missed this book when my children were little, but I've seen it recommended so often on Amazon.com that I  finally decided to buy it ... 43 years after it was written! <br /> <br />I notice it's still among the best-sellers of children's books, so that gives me another clue of how great it is.  Now, that's staying power!  <br /> <br />To make a long story short, I finally had the joy of reading it and have passed it on to my grandchildren.  It's a wonderful, imaginative story.  I enjoyed Sendak's style; his streams of consciousness made for smooth reading.  And I can tell my grandkids are enjoying it, too.  Johnny's reading it now, and he has the broadest smile on his face!  (Grandmother's note: His smile lights up the room, warming my heart and making me extra glad I finally broke down and purchased this book.) <br /> <br />Senak is a masterful writer who knows the child's mind and heart.  The illustrations are magical.
B00005JOFO|5.0|WOW!  What can I say.  This is a beautiful film.  The screenplay is perfect, the cinematography is beautiful, direction perfect and perfomances are all stellar.<br /><br />Lee did a marvelous job with this film.  It's a true, pure, love story for the ages.  Every cast member is perfect.  Ledger acts like I nver imagined he could, Gillenhall is charming, Williams and Hathaway are heartbreaking.<br /><br />This is a film that deserves a much bigger audience than it will ever get, but I dare you to see it and leave unmoved.<br /><br />Beautiful scenery, a stirring love story and brilliant acting - do not miss this film.
B000A7Q2DM|3.0|I haven't heard their debut, so I don't know if they've gotten worse or better. This album isn't anything special, the lyrics are far from original or creative, but the sound is a bit unique. This is the first taste I've gotten of this band but it just seems so familiar. Kind of like a rerun of a show you've seen long ago. I wouldn't compare them to the used, and I wouldn't say that they're completely emo BUT it does sound quite whiny in some of the songs. The first few songs are relatively enjoyable, but the album just seems to go downhill and makes me lose any interest I had in the first place.
0393327655|1.0|Please, all those of you who read this book, remember that in the 20th century, tens of millions of human beings died premature and agonizing deaths because of the fanatically secular politicians who led their countries to war. Hitler, Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt, all were secular men. Religion was not an issue when the Turks committed the genocide of Armenians, of Greeks and of Assyrians, when the French massacred the Algerians, when the Japanese invaded China, when the Americans decimated Vietnam or when the Tutsis eliminated the Hutus. <br /> <br />If the human species did not have faith in bigger and nobler values, then this planet would be such a dreadful place to live in, and all hope for a better future would have been lost in the cold meanders of the mindsets of secular skeptics who replace God with themselves.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|The truth is plain; a rock record must be electrically euphoric, have poetic lyrics, each track must sound far from being monotonous, and have uniquely multi-pitched vocals to take all this to its heights. Believe me although this record possesses and misses some of it has more to it than critical truth, like, predictable punk paradox, little romance, and unpredictable romanticism. <br /> <br />The eleven tracks, filtered out from supposedly seventy tracks, make an album worth listening-each one of them, which in turn makes it one of the successful creative attempts last year. A work like this doesn't always get done in a fading world of rock, but comes as no surprise from these gifted sons of British rock. <br /> <br />These acoustic-blended electric noise makers can unexpectedly deliver a piece like The Importance of Being Idle and refreshing Guess God Thinks I Am Abel. Liam can low-pitch craftily to un-annoy Noel's laser-sharp vocals in acoustic ballad Let There Be Love to go onto peaks in Mucky Fingers. <br /> <br />One-liners like \\"you found your God in a paperback,\\" \\"I can't get a life if my heart's not in it\\" and philosophy \\"the world's as wide/as your life is thin/so entertain your goals\\" couldn't have been better placed but in a reckless rock `n' roll lyric; nonetheless, one wants more. <br /> <br />Who are out there saying \\"we are the greatest\\" would indeed get close to being great only when they keep from shouting it and rather let their musical work speak. Here one can venture an electrical ecstasy, yes, but with one's unbelief in truth.  Syme (Ahimaz) <br />
B000BTGY7I|3.0|I have to agree with a previous review.  I have a 2 disc DVD that I bought in 2001 or 2002. It is chock full of stuff and truth be told, I never watch the second disc.  I saw it once and don't need another version of a movie I already have to see something I might or might not watch.  Forget the re-releases - go through the catalog look on the web and release the ones we have on waiting lists.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|I was really disappointed with this movie. <br />The atmosphere, makeup, set decorations were all fantasic! But, unfortunately the script and the director never matched thier quality. <br /> <br />First off, if you are expecting any Grimm tales in this movie, you will be disappointed.  The Grimm tales are just brief snips scatered through the movie, none of them shown at any length. <br />Also, the director can't seem to make up his mind if this is supposed to be a funny movie or a scary one, the result being that it's neither. <br />Great potential in set decoration and scene design that are wasted in a poorly written and directed story. <br />
B00082IJ08|5.0|Like many Gorillaz fans, I was pretty uneasy about the second album considering the changes in lineup.  Right away, I noticed the sound was a little different.  It was a bit more rock-oriented, but still with a lot of hip-hop mixed in.  Somehow it just sounded different.<br /><br />But then I noticed that the album felt more mature than the previous one.  The creative genius really blossomed in this album, and you can really start to feel what Gorillaz as a band is all about.  The music continues to have a wide variety with songs like \\"Dare\\" being like something you'd find in a dance-club, and \\"O Green World\\" being more of a rock song.  Yet, they all fit together seamlessly.  For what it's worth, Feel Good, Inc., Dare and O Green World are my current favorite.  But the rest are not far behind!<br /><br />Truth be told, now that I got use to this album, I like it way more than the previous.  There's just a lot of really good, creative music in this album.  The first album made me a Gorillaz fan, but the second album sealed the deal, so to speak.<br /><br />Definitely check it out.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|Now I have not seen the Japanese version of Darkwater, but this American remake is pretty stale. Jennifer Connelly is a middle aged woman struggling through custody battles with her husband over their daughter Ceci. She starts a new life with her daughter in Roosevelt Island right outside Manhattan, the apartment they move into is old and extremely creepy. Leaks and strange noises are just some of the common problems Jennifer Connelly and her daughter encounter. Now in the opening scene of the movie we see Jennifer Connelly as a young girl waiting for her mother to pick her up from school. Unfortunately her mother forgets about her and she is left to wait with her teacher. Now this scene kinda explains why their new apartment is dripping with \\"dark water\\". Later on we are introduced with the caretaker of the building, he is impolite and very rude. Up above Jennifer Connelly's room was a Russian family with a single daughter also. The two parents assumed that one of them took their daughter with them, we later find out that the father split and went to live with his mother in Russia and the mother ran away. Ceci all of a sudden has trouble adjusting to her new school and talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, (Russian girl). Ceci begins to know about Jennifer Connelly's poor relationship with her mother. We later find out that the Young abandoned Russian girl died on the rooftop and thats why Jennifer Connelly experienced nightmares and hallucinations. The care taker of the building was aware of this death but covered it up saying she was still alive. He just didn't want to let the cops investigate on this tragic death of the young girl. Tim Roth plays Jennifer Connelly's lawyer who helps her gain custody of Ceci and repair the apartment damages. Now the whole point of this ghost story is that the young Russian girl and Jennifer Connelly both had irresponsible mothers. In other words this ghost story pretty much goes unexplained, not too mention there really isn't any \\"jump out of your seat scenes\\" althought there is a scene where Jennifer Connelly is wet in a white t-shirt. The movie is well paced and the acting is pretty decent but the whole story line is pretty poor and fails to capture any real suspense. In the long run, this deff. a rentable movie, don't buy it like I did unless your a die hard Jennifer Connelly fan.

B00004TH7Z|3.0|ive always thought iron maiden had alot of value until i met a person who was obssesed with them kinda ruined it for me im not really a fan of metal music but there are a few stand out artists witch captivate you iron  maiden have alot of qualities im not a metal fan but i think they are good this album is different to there earlier stuff its a bit overproduced having three guitars seems difficult and they are probably not used to it yet and need more time as a recently reunited band to gel has many highlights wicker man for example and also the amazing ghost of the navigator out on a silent plant is good except for the first chorus witch is a bit of a let down because of the timmid drumming makes the second chorus sound better but most of it sounds a little over produced and they attempt to be more arty in alot of there tracks witch they perfected better in there next release dance of death this is worth your cash but it is not an iron maiden classic this may also bring in people who arnt fans of the band worth your money but over production is its main flaw <br /> <br />something to listen to buy dance of death as well it shows them after theyve got used to the 3 guitarist system
B0002OERI0|1.0|This album makes me ashamed that the the word \\"american\\" is being exploited by crap bands such as green gay. come on idiot and stop using auto tune, that is if your a real \\"punk guy\\". Green Gay has been scamming people with their shallow and universally interpreted lyrics for quite some time and it would'nt suprise if this sick cycle continued as long as people were \\"american idiot\\" enough to buy this crap fest of power chord garbage which is over produced, in tune(what???? punk is not sposed to be in tune ie. Naseua). So in other words I'd rather listen to a continuous loop of \\"cocaine blues\\" by the man in black than this ego manical garbage cuz atleast the cash man didn't have auto tune!!!

0140067477|5.0|It's all so simple when you reduce it to the level of Pooh.<br /><br />It's often hard to understand the nuances of religions and philosophies other than one's own. For many people, the beliefs and rituals of faraway lands -- or even of the folks next door -- are a jumble of mixed-up oddities. But understanding a people's system of faith is vital to understanding the people.<br /><br />In the case of the Eastern philosophy known as Taoism, Winnie the Pooh is here to help.<br /><br />\\"The Tao of Pooh\\" boils the Taoist faith down into simple truths, each using Pooh and his friends to explain them in easy, bite-sized pieces. Some of the examples are original to author Benjamin Hoff's book, while others are lifted directly from the original text by A.A. Milne.<br /><br />Passages from \\"The House at Pooh Corner\\" blend surprisingly well with the tenets of Chinese philosophy, including religious maxims and excerpts from the writings of Chuang-tse. The result is a charming explanation of faith that even Pooh -- a notorious bear of little Brain -- can understand, particularly since he exemplifies the Taoist way so perfectly.<br /><br />Those around him -- Owl, Rabbit, Eeyore, Tigger and of course Piglet -- are less serene in their activities in the Hundred Acre Wood. Hoff handily explains why they do not fit the Taoist mold, and how Pooh would have handled similar situations. As he explains on the back cover of the book, \\"While Eeyore frets, and Piglet hesitates, and Rabbit calculates, and Owl pontificates, Pooh just is.\\" There, a lesson learned and you haven't even opened it yet. You'll learn more when Hoff explains the Taoist concept of P'u, the Uncarved Block, and the many facets of Cottleston Pie.<br /><br />At the same time, Hoff avoids diminishing his message by dumbing it down. While much of the slim book is written in the childlike prose of a Pooh story, it is still surprisingly deep, thought-provoking and grown-up at its root. By book's end, readers should have a fairly solid understanding of basic Taoist principles and how they relate to contemporary life.s should have a fairly solid understanding of basic Taoist principles and how they relate to contemporary life.  <br />
B000000WFF|2.0|i used to think this band where less than ok but not awful but when when i borrowed the album off someone i hated it i was young still in primary school about year 6 i listened i thought what a load of crap and gave it back now i dont like this genre of pop very much this is the worst area but has produced a few songs none of them by this band but its influence is undenyable and for that they deserve some credit but the music is pretty dire in my opinion they havnt held back in these songs and have made them incredibly corny like alot of pop i cant dig it but i reckon probably to someone who likes pop this may be a gem because it started off the genre (even i admit there are good songs in the genre as i said before none of them appear in this album) a pretty poor effort in my opinion may be a milestong in the development of how pop music is today but pretty bland and unintresting i have nothing more to say than unless you love pop you wont like this
0393035158|5.0|Thank you Sam Harris. Would Homeland Security please buy a copy of this book for all of the executives in the many disparate agencies so overcome with political correctness that they refuse to profile? Were not the 9/11 hijackers all deep believers in the faith of Islam? They were not a bunch of Methodists off on a vacation trip. <br />Let me just extract some quotes that I highlighted as I read the book: <br />\\"Our technical advances in the art of war have finally rendered our religious differences-and hence our religious beliefs-antithetical to our survival. We can no longer ignore the fact that billions of our neighbors believe in the metaphysics of martyrdom, or in the literal truth of the book of Revelation, or any of the other fantastical notions that have lurked in the minds of the faithful for millennia-because our neighbors are now armed with chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. There is no doubt that these developments mark the terminal phase of our credulity. Words like \\"God\\" and \\"Allah\\" must go the way of \\"Apollo\\" and \\"Baal,\\" or they will unmake our world.\\" (page 13-14) <br />I'm not an apologist for the failure to find `weapons of mass destruction' in Iraq. I'm a realist and believe the statements of the leader of Iran - these are not the rambling of a mad man they are the statements of a believer! <br /> \\"Tell a devout Christian that his wife is cheating on him, or that frozen yogurt can make a man invisible, and he is likely to require as much evidence as anyone else, and to be persuaded only to the extent that you give it. Tell him that the book he keeps by his bed was written by an invisible deity who will punish him with fire for eternity if he fails to accept its every incredible claim about the universe, and he seems to require no evidence whatsoever.\\" (page 19) <br />The problem is not just with Islam, all religions with a strong faith-based component are a threat.  <br /> \\"Our world is fast succumbing to the activities of men and women who would stake the future of our species on beliefs that should not survive an elementary school education. That so many of us are still dying on account of ancient myths is as bewildering as it is horrible, and our own attachment to these myths, whether moderate or extreme, has kept us silent in the face of developments that could ultimately destroy us. Indeed, religion is as much a living spring of violence today as it was at any time in the past.\\" (page 25 - 26)  <br />This is not just Jews v. Muslims in Israel of Christians v. Muslims in Iraq and Bosnia, it is the stupidity of teaching Intelligent Design and stopping research on stem cells. If you want a reason to question Intelligent Design, take a look at the Texas State Legislature. <br />\\"We live in an age in which most people believe that mere words- `Jesus,' `Allah,' `Ram'-can mean the difference between eternal torment and bliss everlasting. Considering the stakes here, it is not surprising that many of us occasionally find it necessary to murder other human beings for using the wrong magic words, or the right ones for the wrong reasons. How can any person presume to know that this is the way the universe works? Because it says so in our holy books. How do we know that our holy books are free from error? Because the books themselves say so. Epistemological black holes of this sort are fast draining the light from our world.\\" (page 35)  <br />Once we are using the Judeo-Christian Bible for the teaching of science, mathematics and sociology these epistemological problems disappear. How far are we really removed from the \\"Scopes Monkey Trial\\"? What are your children learning in public school? <br />\\"Credit goes to Christopher Hitchens for distilling, in a single phrase, a principle of discourse that could well arrest our slide toward the abyss: `what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.''(page 176) <br />Sam Harris is an accomplished author. The bio on the back of the bookdoes not do him justice. This one from [...]%20Harris is slightly more complete: \\"Sam Harris is the author of the international bestseller, The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason.

The album has a Bossa Nova jazz flow, and Regina's vocals gently swing.  A great album~!

YEAH!\\"<br /><br />Really, I've never met anyone that didn't like Karate Kid.  And if I ever do meet someone who doesn't like the movie, I don't want to be their friend.  It's that great.<br /><br />The movie has everything anyone could ever want.  Wax on/wax off has become a part of pop culture, as has the \\"Crane Technique\\".  Billy Zabka cemented his niche as the teenage/college-aged villian.  Pat Morita was at his best.<br /><br />Things to look for when you watch it again:<br /><br />-At the end, when the announcer says, \\"The big event!\\", it sounds like he says, \\"Deep digger men!\\"<br /><br />-Daniel's mother moved across country for a job at a restaurant?<br /><br />-You're the best, around...greatest montage ever<br /><br />-The Asian guy in the final four is actually the person doing the \\"Crane technique\\" on the stump at the beach.<br /><br />-Revenge of the Nerds star Lamar, the gay one, gets hammered in twice.<br /><br />I'd write more, but I'm about to watch Karate Kid again; it never gets old to me.
6302886228|5.0|One of the all-time great concert videos. Even better than the wonderful \\"One Love\\" Bob Marley Tribute, which thankfully is on DVD. For those who can't wait for the official DVD release of this title, you might want to check out [...] (\\"The Genuine Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Celebration\\").
B000AU9UYM|4.0|This movie come close. Damn Close. The early comic book years of the Batman story were serious, but not sufficiently angry to explain WHY he becomes Batman. It was not, in my estimation, until Frank Miller began showing the dark side of the character that Batman became truly interesting. Readers like myself long to see the cold and cruel elements in ths world get what they deserve with the same cruelty they showed toward their victims. <br /> <br />In BATMAN BEGINS, Bruce Wayne is shown as a truly angry character, who with the help of the League of Shadow, finds the path to become \\"something more\\", a legend. Even with this intensity and focus on the revenge Bruce Wayne is compelled to take, the character is still TOO WHOLESOME.   <br /> <br />In the Frank Miller-type characterizations, Batman is borderline psychotic. While trying not to slip into becoming a murderer like the villians, Batman is not above maiming or beating his enemies within an inch of their life (see Dark Knight Returns or Bruce Wayne: Murderer for some truly dark stories in which Bruce says his \\"mask\\" is SLIPPING). <br /> <br />Still, this is a notable and worthwhile restart for the Dark Knight.  I agree with many reviewers who complained that the intellectual and detective skills so prevelant in the comics was overlooked here. But, this can be explored in the follow-up versions. <br /> <br />I hope Warner can be convinced to delve even darker, much like the recent SIN CITY release. If so, true Batman/Dark Knight fans will recognize the franchise as having returned and that Hollywood finally GETS the character.
B00082IJ08|3.0|Its difficult to criticise this CD because its better than most that's out there right now.  Its just that its undeniably trendy.  The singer often sings through a filter like everybody else right now, so that his voice sounds scratchy and thin. I'm getting really bored of that.   <br /> <br />This is Blur with a funkier more eclectic beat.  If that sounds interesting to you, this will be a great CD.

B00076OMW4|5.0|NOTE:  THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE SACD VERSION OF THIS RECORDING, NOT THE MP3 DOWNLOAD.<br /><br />I have several CD's of Dvorak's 9th Symphony but it's unlikely I will play them again.  The performance is the best I've heard and the recording is outstanding.  My wife, who doesn't even particularly like classical music, came into the room when I played this recording the first time and actually sat down and listened to the whole CD.  That might be a first for her and the fact that she was impressed, impresses me.<br /><br />I've been buying a number of the RCA Living Stereo SACD's recently and I'm more impressed every time I listen to them.  I also have a few of the Mercury Living Presence CD's and SACD's which are also outstanding (although the Living Presence SACD's are premium priced).  Considering more recent recordings of the same works, the performances and the sound are both better on the 45-50 year old recordings than on the current DDD's.<br /><br />To those who want to buy recordings of the most popular classical works, I would highly recommend Living Stereo and Living Presence CD's and SACD's.  Of the Dvorak's \\"From The New World\\" Symphony recordings available, I consider this a first choice.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|I have been, am and always will be a HUGE Korn fan, but this last cd is pathetic! Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse for the boys from Bakersfield; they come up with this. After several listens to this cd I yearn for the days of Take A Look in the Mirror (which wasn't too good either). It pains me to think the greatness of Korn has passed, but perhaps the loss of Head will be too much for the band to overcome. I, as a fan, would rather see them \\"retire\\" than attempt to sell us on another album like this one. Jonathon needs to find more of the rage from within and drop more of those lyrics. Poor effort fellas, but I'll still be at your next Indy concert.
B00005MKA3|5.0|Being a huge fan of Bob Marley, I consider this my favorite album of his.  I dig his songs about love and no worries (while many of those songs are deeper than their surface value), but this album just seems to embody his true beliefs on a more serious level.  He was a revolutionary, and with the warrior's spirit in this album, his revolutionary heart will beat forever.  Don't pass up this revolution on a disc.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I'll keep it short. Absolutely flawless acting, great story and one of the top 5 movies I have seen in the past year. An inspiring tale of the passion of the church as well as not being overly \\"hollywood.\\"  Highly recommend !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000BFH2S2|5.0|CD portion - 8 songs sung live and in concert including the smash hit Home. Flawless in his delivery, Michael Buble conjures up memories of a young Elvis crossed with the smoothness of Dean Martin and the zest of Bobby Darin. Being recorded live is the ultimate test of a singer's true ability and Buble makes it clear that he has pipes of velvet. <br /> <br />DVD portion - 15 songs packed with energy and raw emotion - as mentioned previously, to be note perfect AND recorded live is a testament to this man's talent. The banter that runs between the audience and Buble is sweet - Buble has that 'It' factor - he's very charismatic and charming and his love of live performing awesome to behold. He's no ordinary Joe, that's for sure!
B00003CXAE|4.0|The 20th & 25th anniversary have both passed, and there's still no special edition of this. Do we really have to wait until the 30th anniversary? There's so much good stuff that could be put on the DVD, instead we get a lousy songbook. Which is stupid, cos if you've seen the film enough times and have the soundtrack, you'll already know all the words!<br /><br />But still I love the film and always will! I've loved it since I was young, and Sandy & Danny make the perfect couple. There's so much chemistry between Olivia Newton John & John Travolta, not something you see too often in movies. All the supporting cast are brilliant, although only Frenchie (Didi Conn) returned for the sequel.<br /><br />There's been many complaints about the fact how much older the actors are than the characters they play, but so many films aimed at teenagers do this nowadays. There's only two in Grease who are actually still teenagers: Dinah Manoff and Lorenzo Lamas were both 19. John Travolta (Danny) was 24; Jeff Conaway, Michael Tucci, Barry Pearl, and Didi Conn were all 28; Olivia Newton-John was 29; Jamie Donnelly was 30 and Stockard Channing was the eldest at 34.<br /><br />All the songs are brilliant, although I still find \\"Grease\\" and \\"Sandy\\" slightly dodgy, they don't match the rest of the songs. \\"You're The One That I Want\\" is definitely my favourite but Randal Kleiser hated the song saying it \\"sounded awful\\". It also helps the film go out on a high, I don't think it would have done as well if it hadn't featured in the film, as \\"We Belong Together\\" doesn't work as an ending song to the film. Filming of the song took just an afternoon. Of course there's the stunning entrance of Olivia I also love \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\", as it means a lot to me these days.<br /><br />It's a feel good film, and I still don't understand why some people haven't yet seen this movie! It's one of those films you'll watch once or twice a year, but are much better than say the other films that shown annually, like Wizard of Oz, or Gone With The Wind. This will stand the test of time, and is still loved to this day.<br /><br />Normally, when I buy a DVD, the special edition gets announced soon after.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|Takes awhile to get going but when it does NICE, The fight with the T-rex's are GREAT, the tragic end, welllllll abit drawn out to tug on thise heart strings. AND THEN, the line - \\"it was beauty who killed the beast\\".
B0009X75RO|2.0|The story is a juicy one.<br /><br />The plot centres around two scorned woman. The first is Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a famed vaudeville performer who kills her cheating husband and sister. The other is Roxy Hart (Renee Zellweger), a wannabe vaudeville star who kills her abusive lover. Both women battle it out in prison for the attentions of their lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and the media. Being skillfully manipulated by Billy, Roxy becomes a media sensation and major celebrity to the dismay of her rival, Velma.<br /><br />The musicals message is an unpleasant one. Especially when considering that both woman were killers and despite this, they are portrayed as victims and come out on top. Now I am by no means stating that I take offence to the content. It takes a lot more than the glorification of 2 beautiful murderers to offend me. As a matter of fact, since I was never a fan of the musical, the racy storyline was what convinced me to watch this. Juicy tales of murderous mayhem and scandalous, amoral women will be a huge draw for many.<br /><br />With that said, I will never understand why this movie won so many Oscars. Was it Hollywood trying to revive the movie musical by making them popular again? Or is there truth in the claim that \\"Chicago\\" or Miramax bought the Oscars?<br /><br />Who knows but this film was far from being the \\"Best Picture\\" of 2002. Especially when compared to the other nominees. As I have already mentioned, I was never a fan of the musical. I always found the music too bland and other than the show's most famous number, \\"All That Jazz\\", which is indeed great, there isn't another song in the score that catches the imagination. In my opinion, the melodies are forgettable. The film, despite it's glossy exterior was shallow in it's core.<br /><br />The film starts off well, with Catherine Zeta-Jones doing a pretty good rendition of \\"All That Jazz\\". I will admit that Zeta-Jones has great stage presence and a good voice but was it Oscar worthy? I'm not so sure. However when compared to others in the cast, Catherine is indeed, sensational. Renee Zelwegger on the other hand, is a good actress but her voice is too thin and rather unimpressive. It's still far superior and much more pleasing to the ears than Richard Gere's voice which I found to be beyond annoying. Gere's instrument (if I can call it that) was grating and my ear drums suffered greatly. The only other actor in the piece that has some musical abilities is Queen Latifah. Admittedly, she is a charming performer with some real talent. Her solo number is also pretty entertaining but I ask again, was her performance Oscar worthy? I have yet to meet someone who, after seeing this film has firmly answered my question with a convincing yes. As much as I like Queen Latifah, she does nothing here that she hasn't already done in her music videos. Her performance was hardly ground-breaking. Her nomination, along with others in the cast, with the possible exception of Zeta-Jones, caused the elimination of other actors who were far more worthy of it. That's a shame.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones's opening act and Latifah's charming number are definitely film highlights. Another scene that I have to admit is expertly done is the \\"Cell Block Tango\\". It features several black-clad women showing off their fine figures and dancing skills and the scene is enhanced by some great choreography and Zeta-Jones, who is again, fantastic here. The rest of the musical performances are not really worth mentioning. They're glitzy but mindless. All style with no substance. Lacking intricate choreography, emotion and skill. They substitute it with colour and flash.<br /><br />Another problem I had was that this film cheated a little. It seems the makers of \\"Chicago\\" didn't have much faith in today's audience and the genre and instead of making this a straight-forward musical, they decided to justify the musical numbers by featuring them as being a figment of Roxy's imagination. The musical numbers are structured and played out like music videos and I think this was a cop-out. I would have much preferred a more traditional musical theatre experience.<br /><br />Those who love this film, love it a lot but there are a countless others who feel that the much-hyped \\"Chicago\\" didn't deserve all of it's praise. Especially when considering that other film musicals were far greater in scope and unjustifiably hardly got half of the attention.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, it's not Chicago's fault it's over-rated. Or is it?<br /><br />2.5 out of 5xy's imagination. The musical numbers are structured and played out like music videos and I think this was a cop-out.

B000ANXLB2|5.0|Superb rendition in exquisite sound of Beethoven's nine symphonies by the orchestra and conductor who inspired a generation of classical music lovers during the 1960s and 1970s. Having attended live performances of this ensemble under Karajan between 1959 and 1983, this stunning set brings back to me the extraordinary experience each of those concert generated. Highly recommended.
B00003CXDV|4.0|A parody shouldn't be a good film in its own right, but this is. The DVD makes it even better, with a rich menu of extras, esp. supplemental documentaries and outtakes. We can argue about whether the outtakes belonged in the film -- though it helps to see what the director felt compelled to discard (though I think Dr. Lazarus' tour of his quarters was worth retaining). DVD sound and video quality superb.    The actors' backgrounds show how remarkable this film is, in that several dramatic actors -- Sigorney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Alan Rickman -- hand in hilarious out-of-type performances in Galaxy Quest.    Very worth owning. Grabthar knows why, but it is.
0679746048|4.0|A beautiful and relistically written autobiography of nearly two years in a mental institution.  Kaysen jumps around, her thought jump around, making the story even more realistic.  Had it really been necessary to lock her away?  Most of the ailments seem to be the normal developmental issues of a teenager who may or may not be a bit confused. I guess it was fashionable back then to lock people away. Mental institutions were full of people like her, and fortunately these institutions became more closely scrutinized and many of them were closed down permanenetly.<br /><br />Mentioned in the book very briefly is a good observation: analysis became less popular with the advent of the PILL! Now there are anti-depressant, anti-anxiety, anti-everything pills.  What would have happened to her had she been a teenager sent to a psychiatrist by her parents today? She'd probably been given a pill and gone on with her life. Is that better?  Surely for her it would have been.<br /><br />The book is a sad statement of an extreme. It is so easy to call someone crazy or nuts or imbalanced. It takes time to look into someone, and most people don't want to take the time.
B000AYQLX6|4.0|John Lennon after the Beatles broke up recorded several classic albums. This would be one of those classics.  John was on the verge of a 5 year absence from music and this was his last effort before that.  This album includes Whatever Gets You Through The Night which had considerable air play.  Some of the other great songs include, Old Dirt Road, What you Got and #9 Dream. This album in my mind is as good as Imagine or any other album he recorded.   #9 dream to me is very haunting. Right after Lennon died I used to listen to it over and over. I never did understand what the French lyrics meant. The good thing about this re-release is that you get the bonus tracks. Elton John performs Whatever gets You Through the Night with John. This performance proved to be his last live performance.  Nobody Knows When You're Down and out is also a bonus track. This version is more acoustic.  You also get a short interview where John promotes this album.  The real find on this album to me is Steel and Glass. To me John has always sounded very good when he plays acoustic guitar.  This song is no exception and worth the price of the CD alone.  This is a classic............enjoy
B000A59PMO|5.0|I'm not usually a person who likes to write reviews about anything but this DVD makes me so excited that my fingers seem to be typing on their own accord.<br /><br />I never watched Veronica Mars during the first season. I'd flip through channels and see five seconds of this show that seemed so convoluted with names and plot-twists that I felt I just couldn't keep up. It seemed too late for me to jump on the Veronica Mars bandwagon.<br /><br />Then just this year, I started to watch VM's second season. I can't pinpoint when the defining moment was exactly, but I'm guessing after the second or third episode, I was hooked. As someone who unabashedly appreciates television from the outrageously good (BBC's The Office) to the laughably mediocre (Ashton Kutcher's Beauty and the Geek), I can honestly say this is top caliber stuff. The allusions are whip-smart, the dialogue is witty, charming, and believable (unlike, say, Gilmore Girls, which I love but c'mon, no one talks like that) and the show keeps you constantly guessing and almost always delivers (unlike um, Lost).<br /><br />But the best part, in my humble opinion, is the characters. It's not just about being engrossed with what they are going do or say next. You feel for them. Their developments, their losses, their steps forward and back-all of it honestly affected me. These are truly dynamic characters. . .And they're fun too! Try not to go through an episode without laughing. Or giggling. Or at least breaking into a smile.<br /><br />I was reluctant to buy the first season because I already knew the answer to the big Lily Kane murder mystery thanks to the second season. Three days ago I caved and I'm so very glad I did. Even if you know who killed the girl, the ending is so scary, so good, so scary good, that it alone merits the purchase of this DVD. The only problem I had with this DVD set was that it was too short. I tried to save the DVDs for a boring evening but like an addict, I kept popping those discs in and frantically pressing play.<br /><br />So prepare yourself for major VM withdrawal once you're finished. Meanwhile, I'll go back to impatiently waiting for the second season to be on DVD so I can spend another day blissfully not showering, not eating, molding myself to the couch, and not wanting to have it any other way.se discs in and frantically pressing play. <br /> <br />So prepare yourself for major VM withdrawal once you're finished.

B000B63IEI|2.0|I am intimately familiar with the first concerto having played it (there are a couple of different versions with subtle differences), and I must say that the playing here is very flat. The pianist does not instill any life into the piece. I guess for the first concerto there are not as many interpretations and therefore less barometers to compare this to, though I very much prefer Ashkenazy's playing.     The second concerto is much worse. The pianist is playing too softly in the third movement, the orchestra too forwardly, flippantly aqnd nonchalant. It sounds like the performers want to get this over with and go fill out their tax returns. Basically the only thing the pianist is doing is playing the notes. He does not instill any new ideas into the piece. It does pose a problem for a pianist to play a piece as popular as this.... but the solution is not to play the notes and nothing else (maybe this is away of hedging one's reputation in light of critics). The orchestra in the third movement tries to play in a jumpy staccato like fashion which just doesn't fit Rachmaninov at all.   There are many better versions and I would start with Richter and Ashkenazy.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|Though Hostel was supposedly chocked full of gratuitous violence I still felt that it was lacking something in the violent gruesome scenes. The suspense was somewhat lacking, it was more of a cat and mouse chase towards the end of the movie, with the somewhat obvious ending. Though it does have some realisitc potential the movie leaves the watcher somewhat unattached throughout the film, not quite reaching that ultimate climax. Hopefully the unedited version will satisfy the horror movie thrill seeker movie goers a little more.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First to the two nasty reviewers, MONKEY MIKE, and CON TE PARTIRO, let go of all your hostility and down right nastiness.  It is obvious that both you two did not hear the album.  I love it and so do almost 5 million people throughout the world, not bad for an album that's only been out for 2 MONTHS!!! Enough said, the album is infectious, clever and quite enjoyable. As of June, 2006 this album continues to bring joy to all that listen to it.  It never leaves my c.d. player, up to 10 million sold worlwide! Simply put amazing!
B00005JO9J|5.0|Dr. Meredith Grey: \\"Sometimes reality has a way of sneaking up and biting us in the ***. And when the dam bursts, all you can do is swim. The world of pretend is a cage, not a cocoon. We can only lie to ourselves for so long. We are tired, we are scared, denying it doesn't change the truth. Sooner or later we have to put aside our denial and face the world. Head on, guns blazing. De Nile. It's not just a river in Egypt, it's a freakin' ocean. So how do you keep from drowning in it?\\" Ellen Pompeo plays  Meredith Grey, a surgical intern, new to Seattle and Grace Hospital.<br /><br />The shows title is a reference to the famous anatomy book \\"Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body\\" by Henry Gray. Well known by all in the health care field, and very well memorized by all medical students. The music from each show is well worth listening to, most of it is new and on the top of the charts.<br /><br />\\"Greys Anatomy\\" can be a play on words. Meredith is finding herself, not only in the surgical world, but in her personal life. Her mother is a surgeon suffering from Alzheimer's, her father is dead. She falls in love with the handsome Chief Neurosurgeon, Dr. Derek Shepard played by Patrick Dempsey. She later finds out he is married to a pediatric surgeon. Her new roommates are all surgical interns: T.R. Knight as bumbling, inept, George O'Malley; Sandra Oh, as  Cristina Yang , one of my favorites, and Katherine Heigl as Isobel \\"Izzie\\" Stevens. Cristina Yang has a one night affair with the hunky,Chief Surgical Resident, Preston Burke; that moves onto \\"true\\" lust. They are so diametrically different that the old saying\\" opposites attract\\" is, oh, so true.  And, then, there is \\"The Nazi\\",Chandra Wilson as Dr. Miranda Bailey. She whips the new interns into shape and keeps them on their toes. It turns out she has a heart as big as Kansas, but then, don't they all?<br /><br />The show is funny, has lots of drama, unrealistic at times and then more than real at other times. The workings of a real hospital? I will leave that for you to decide. The drama of every day in  the life of a surgical intern. Too much work, too little time, but these interns always find time for the personal stories of their patients and, this is where the shows true colors come shining through. The humanness of physicians and the people they care for; the love and dedication it takes to help someone become well, and the sadness and gloom of a death.  The open heart surgery in an elevator by a first year surgical intern is hard to believe, but somehow it works.  This is a TV show that works as well. The personalities ring true; we like them, we want them to succeed. Highly recommended. prisrobl leave that for you to decide. The drama of every day in  the life of a surgical intern.

B000062YAZ|5.0|What can I say about Slayer that hundreds of people have said before but I will add some more positive things about this band. Reign in Blood is frankly an album that any self-respecting metal-head owns or needs to get because it is a classic metal album that was light years away, even though it came out during the conservative Reagan era. This album was controversial because of its songs dealing with religion and even the classic Angel of Death caught a lot of slack from Jewish groups by writing a Joseph Mengrele song. But this album is a showcase of a 4 piece band that would help establish speed metal and eventually inspire death metal especially with screeching and rapid fire guitar solos, relentless drumming and dark lyrics. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are the epitome of what speed and accuracy of a guitarist and made unbelievable solos that people try to copy and fail miserably. Lombardo is one of my favorite drummers ever, it is worth the adrenaline rush just hear him drum. Tom Araya is a hell of a singer that exemplifies the out of control person you need to be successful although in the bass department he was often drowned out by the guitarists. I just can't say enough on how many Latinos got into metal because of one of first latino fronted bands and for that I am grateful for him for showing the way. Get this album because I want you to think alot that this album was made 20 years ago and the quality has not and never will be diminished.

B000021YQV|5.0|To me their self titled album was a raw, metal masterpiece and their follow up was a great in its own right. This album is way more than the radio or MTV hits(although those songs are still great, kind of overplayed though). The musicianship is still cutting edge, every instrument played to its expectation and Serj delivering a great vocal performance. Every song is politically charged, wacky or bizarre. Well this is my list. <br /> <br />Prison Song- A strong opener, deals with how money is spent incarcirating drug abusers and the negative effects of fighting a pointless drug war. <br /> <br />Needles- A strange look into the mind insanity of an addict. <br /> <br />Deer Dance- A look into police brutallity, inspired by the G8 summit in Seatle in 1999 <br />Filler <br />filler <br />Chop Suey- well this song was maybe the biggest hit of their career and one of the hardest to decifer, is it about suicide and martyrdom, fear of god or an abused girl. <br /> <br />ATWA- A ballad about Charlie Manson, so romantic yet insane. <br /> <br />Science-A belief that science is only in for the money and offer no spiritual solution for the unexplained. <br /> <br />Toxicity-A look into people who who sit around while the rest of the world collapses arund them. <br /> <br />Psycho- Female fans who will do anything to get with a celebrity. <br /> <br />Aerials-In my opinion, a song about abusing nature and not giving anything back to nature.  <br /> <br />Well there you have it a great album and a classic.  <br />
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood (1994) is Tim Burton's best all-around movie. Not his most popular, perhaps not his most enjoyable, but definitely his finest overall. It's the (mostly) true story of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Wood was a rabid movie-lover who passionately wanted to make movies and didn't care what he had to do to make it happen. There was just one problem: Ed Wood had about as much filmmaking talent as the megaphone he shouted through. In addition to his lack of talent, Ed liked to wear womens' clothing. Sometimes, he supposedly even directed his movies while wearing womens' clothing. His first film was a debacle called Glen or Glenda, one of the most painfully inept and mind-blowingly awful movies in the history of cinema. He followed it up with such disasters as Bride of the Monster, Night of the Ghouls and his \\"masterpiece\\" (so to speak), Plan 9 from Outer Space. The latter being a highly-regarded cult classic, often inaccurately cited as the worst movie of all time. Burton's film covers the making of several Wood movies, chronicling his personal struggle to get his films made, his difficulties with women, and his friendship with aging actor Bela Lugosi. Wood doesn't seem to know that his movies are terrible, either that or he just doesn't care. He's just so happy to be making movies that he doesn't care that they're awful. He wanted to be a writer-director-actor just like his idol, Orson Welles. In a way, he succeeded.     Wood is played magnificently by Johnny Depp. I believe this is Depp's best performance. He is wonderful as the passionate, relentlessly optimistic Ed Wood. He disappears into the angora sweater-wearing character. I'm not sure how Johnny Depp didn't get an Oscar nomination. He deserved it as much as anyone that year. However, Martin Landau received a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. Landau's performance is so good that you'd swear Lugosi returned from the grave to appear in the movie. Ed Wood is generally regarded as a comedy, and while it is very funny, it does have many dramatic moments as well. Depp and Landau have some really great, touching scenes together in the movie. Wood was Lugosi's only friend in the latter years of his life and their friendship is at the heart of the movie. The photography and production design are top notch. The look of 1950s Hollywood was recreated meticulously. The black-and-white photography immensely enhances the old-movie feel.     This is a great movie that is so frequently overlooked among all the great movies that came out in 1994. Even in Tim Burton's filmography, the film is often overlooked. Anyone who loves cult movies, or just movies in general should see Ed Wood. It's an offbeat, unusual masterpiece that tells a fascinating story about   a man who made up for his lack of talent with an abundance of passion.
B00005JOII|5.0|\\"Match Point,\\" which is set in London, stars Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Chris Wilton, a handsome but poor young tennis player who has quit the professional tour.  He is marking time at a posh club giving tennis lessons to upper crust clients.  One of his students is the charming Tom Hewett, whose sister, Chloe, quickly falls for him.  Chris seems to reciprocate Chloe's feelings until he meets and becomes obsessed by Tom's fianc&eacute;e, a sultry blonde named Nola Rice.<br /><br />If Chris marries Chloe, he will be set for life, since Chloe's father is willing to groom him for a job in his successful business empire.  As the son-in-law of Alec Hewett, Chris would have prestige, a luxurious home, a personal driver, an expense account, and all the perks that go with being married to the daughter of a rich and generous man.  If he pursues Nola, Chris stands to lose his best chance of permanently escaping the poverty of his childhood.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Match Point\\" is brilliant.  Meyers is mesmerizing as a self-effacing, calculating, and unctuous social climber, whose underlying motives are buried beneath layers of politeness.  Johannson is at her most alluring as Nola, an insecure and penniless American whose sole asset is her gorgeous appearance. She is desperate to break into acting, but senses that she will never be good enough to succeed.  Brian Cox is wonderful as Alec Hewett, Chloe's kind-hearted father who takes Chris under his wing, hoping that this young man will make his daughter happy.  Penelope Wilton plays Eleanor Hewett, Alec's judgmental and outspoken wife, with icy calm.  Eleanor detests Nola and cannot abide the thought that this low class young woman will soon become her daughter-in-law.<br /><br />Woody Allen explores the universal themes of greed, lust, self-deception, and betrayal.  There is an old Yiddish proverb, \\"Better an ounce of luck than a pound of gold.\\"  Chris believes that he can have everything he wants, including the gold, if his luck holds out.  Allen suggests that we may live in a world where justice is an unattainable ideal.  Our fate may be determined as much by chance as it is by our actions or our virtues.<br /><br />\\"Match Point\\" is beautifully shot, tightly edited, and briskly paced.  Since Chris Wilton is an opera lover, Allen provides soaring background music by Verdi, Bizet, Donizetti, and Rossini.  I cannot reveal or even hint at the surprise ending, but the agonizing suspense in this film is at times reminiscent of a Hitchcock thriller.  Although the denouement is not entirely credible or satisfying, I guarantee that \\"Match Point\\" is one of those movies that viewers will be pondering and discussing for days after they leave the theater.gests that we may live in a world where justice is an unattainable ideal.

0316172324|3.0|What happens when you meet someone for the first time, or walk into a house you are thinking about buying, or read the first few sentences of a book? You mind is taking about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions. And according to author Malcolm Gladwell, those instant conclusions we reach are really powerful and really important, and occasionally -- really good.<br /><br />Blink looks at rapid cognition, about what happens in the blink of an eye. According to Gladwell, what happens is perfectly rational.<br /><br />He states: \\"It's thinking - its just thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate, conscious decision making that we usually associate with \\"thinking.'\\"<br /><br />Gladwell analyses what is going on in our heads when we engage in rapid cognition. For example, when are snap judgments good and when are they not? What kinds of things can we do to make our powers of rapid cognition better?<br /><br />Gladwell compares rapid decision-making with the way most of us have been taught to make decisions as children. Often we were taught to gather as much information as possible before making a decision. Gladwell states that sometimes this process is useful, others times it is not.<br /><br />He gives a poignant example of this from the Emergency Room at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. A few years ago, Emergency Room doctors changed the way they diagnosed heart attacks. They were instructed to gather \\"less\\" information on their patients. They concentrated on just a few symptoms: chest pain, blood pressure and the ECG - while ignoring everything else, including age and weight and medical history. The results were shocking. Cook County Hospital is now one of the best places in the United States at diagnosing chest pain.<br /><br />Caldwell examines numerous fascinating stories like Cook County Hospital where the idea of gathering more information is not always the best way to make a decision. Some examples include: marriage, World War II code-breaking, ancient Greek sculpture, New Jersey's best car dealer, speed-dating, medical malpractice, how to hit a top-spin forehand, and what you can learn from someone by looking around their bedroom.<br /><br />Blink contains a lot of psychology that has not been written before for the general audience, but at the same time is a fascinating and enjoyable read.ision.

0743454537|5.0|This is an incredible book.  I picked it up and flew right through it.  It is a great book for anyone to read, but especially for people looking for book club selections.  As I got to the end, I really wanted to talk about it with someone, but at that point, no one else I knew had read it.  I did get my own sister to read it though, and she also loved it and I finally had someone to discuss it with.  The mix of perspectives really adds to the depth of the novel.  Overall, I thought the writing style was similar to The Lovely Bones, which is another incredible novel.
0553213105|5.0|I read this book to meet page requirements for my sophomore English class.  And in the months since have re-read it several times.  This book tells the story of Elizabeth Bennet, or rather Elizabeth's mother's detemination to have all of her girls sutibly married off.  At first I was a bit put off by this stereotypical image that the only place for women in the early ninteenth century was married and in the home,  but the story was very sweet, and beautifuly written [if a bit wordy] with a perfect happy ending.
B00003CXA4|2.0|Was Gandhi a great person?  The answer will always be \\"yes\\".  Was he a leader in a possibly violent country?  This film shows the answer to be \\"yes\\".  Did he deserve a three-hour epic devoted to his life and teachings?  This cinephile believes so.  Did director Richard Attenborough successfully give his audience an unbiased story of Mohandas K. Gandhi, which included a personal element, a patriotic element, as well as a historical element?  Sadly, my response to this is \\"no\\".  There is no doubt in my mind that Attenborough created a beautiful, picturesque view of India controlled by British rule and chose a subject very close to his heart.  There is quite a bit of emotion behind the film itself, but I finished watching this picture with a feeling that I didn't quite know Gandhi himself.  I knew the work that he had accomplished, the power behind his teachings, but who was this little man from India?  That is where I thought Attenborough completely missed the opportunity in this award-winning film.  He gave us the images and the one-sided history lesson, but he completely forgot to develop his main character.  How did this win so many awards?<br /><br />I realize that the first paragraph of this review contains quite a bit of questions, but they were all questions that I had upon finishing this so-called grandiose epic.  To begin, I do not believe that Ben Kingsley should have been awarded what he did for his role.  He may have acted the part of Gandhi, but he (at least in my eyes) never looked the part.  Here was a man who would stave himself for his people, but after such a long fast, Kingsley looked like he had just finished a couple of pizzas.  I think I was expecting a sort of transformation as we saw Mr. Hanks do in Castaway, but alas, my ideas were quenched when Kingsley's belly bulged from his clothing.  Also, who was this man?  I saw so much passion in Kingsley when the film opened, but after that moment on the train, he seemed to be following his lines on script and leaving his true emotion to the curb.  Was he the best actor for the role?  I believe that he did a great job of \\"acting\\" like Gandhi, but I do not think he could be labeled as \\"the best\\".  I needed more, sorry, meat to this character.  I wanted to see Gandhi when he was in school, outside of the passive protests, with his family, but neither Kingsley nor Attenborough could give us this.  I saw Gandhi on the screen, but that doesn't mean that I witnessed a true, strong, character-driven epic before my eyes.  I saw beautiful pictures, but not enough about the beauty of this man.<br /><br />Attenborough has the tendency to build really strong biography epics.  I enjoyed watching Chaplin, though I didn't think it was a powerful enough story on Chaplin himself, it was nonetheless enjoyable.  I enjoyed watching Gandhi, but I just felt that Attenborough fast-forwarded through some of the most crucial elements to this monumental man's life.  One of the scenes that I was most looking forward to was Gandhi's powerful pilgrimage to the Indian Ocean.  I was ready for this emotional tearjerker that would eventually culminate into demonstrating the true power of this little man.  What I instead witnessed was three minutes of Gandhi walking out of his village and suddenly making it to the ocean with no such sign of fatigue or strain.  It was mere minutes, when it should have been a bigger scene in this story.  That is where Attenborough went wrong.  His attention to detail seemed flawed.  He was focused on the bigger picture, thus forgetting the power of the smaller stories.  A great biography will attempt to do both.  It will show the power of this figure on a grand scale, but then zoom in closer to the actual person so that we can see the inner struggles they were facing on a daily basis.  A film that correctly gives us this true mix is Nixon.  Stone's biography picture does a great job in giving us the man and the nation that didn't stand behind him.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was an enjoyable film to watch, but a horrid portrayal of this man's life.  Throughout the film I continually felt pity for the British rule, and I am assuming that was not what Attenborough wanted to happen during this film.  I wanted to see more behind Gandhi, more about the British rule (I do not believe they were as \\"evil\\" as depicted), and more about the people.  I needed more information and less sweeping landscape images.  There were even a couple of scenes where Attenborough had such great landscape happening that it covered up the words of Gandhi ... is that how you build power towards this great man?  I wish I could have seen more about the media coverage of Gandhi's life.  While Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen were interesting in their own roles, I still felt as if they were so underdeveloped.  There should have more connection between these active players and Gandhi.  I continued to feel as if they slipped in and out of the scene as fast as Gandhi's \\"quick\\" pilgrimage.  Gandhi is a man that deserves to have a motion picture devoted to him, I just do not believe that Gandhi was the film to best represent this powerful man's passionate mission!<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****>Overall, I thought this was an enjoyable film to watch, but a horrid portrayal of this man's life.

0684824906|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Team of Rivals,\\" and it is sensational. One would think \\"Why do we need another Abraham Lincoln biography?\\"  Nobody would ask that question after reading this remarkable tome. <br />    Goodwin found an ingenious way to unearth new primary sources on Lincoln---by studying the diaries and careers of his cabinet members.  His exceptionally talented cabinet provided stunning insights into Lincoln, but no scholar has ever really collected and synthesized these viewpoints before in such a marvelous way. <br />   My main impression of Lincoln from the book is simply that he was an incredibly good person---magnanimous, forgiving, shrewd, not quick to anger. I had forgotten that Lincoln appointed Chase to the Supreme Court of the U.S.  Lincoln's forbearance and patience in keeping Chase in the cabinet----in spite of Chase's own presidential ambitions for 1864, are a marvel.  <br />    My father grew up in a small town of 200 people known as \\"Seward, Kansas.\\"  Of course, I knew the town was named after Secretary Seward, but I never knew what a good person Seward was until I read this book.  It makes me even prouder to have roots in Seward, Kansas. <br />   Most of the counties in Kansas (and many of the towns) are named after Civil War heroes.  Getting to know Lincoln better, but also Seward, Stanton and the rest of the cabinet was a pleasure.  This book is one of the two or three best non-fiction books I've ever read.  God Bless Doris Kearns Goodwin.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|This 3rd album is a big departure from the first two albums.  You can see growth as a band in the structure of all the songs. I was glad to see such a change from the last record which was a good album but it was more of the same from what was a great first album. This time out they are willing to take risks and you get the sense that they really went into the studio to not only make a record that was great but to make one that made a statement about what they are capable of and of what we can expect in the future.  Best tracks Heart in a cage, Ask me anything, and Ize of the World.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar tells the story of Esther Greenwood's slow descent into madness.  Really a thinly veiled recounting of Plath's own mental troubles and her first suicide attempt, it provides a disturbingly realistic account of how a smart, talented and promising young woman can fall so far. <br /> <br />Esther Greenwood is a scholarship student at a prestigious Eastern women's college and a talented writer.  However, when she fails to gain admission to a summer writing course, her first inklings of psychological trouble multiply and she falls quickly into despair.   <br /> <br />The book takes the readers into Greenwood's mind.  The slight changes in perceptions, the means of reacting to life's events, the thought processes, change gradually for the reader, as they did for Esther herself.  Only the reader is better equipped to track the changes and to predict the result. <br /> <br />The book describes Greenwood's suicide attempt and eventual recovery.  It likens depression to being inside of a bell jar, which distorts the senses for the person trapped inside of it.  At the same time, it recounts her journey into adulthood, her exploration of her body and sexuality, which remains active even at her lowest points, and definition of herself as a woman.  <br /> <br />At the height of Greenwood's mania, the repeated thoughts of suicide become tiresome.  However, Plath presents both the lead-up to her psychosis and her recovery in a realistic and moving manner.  The biographical note at the end of the book presents a helpful summary of Plath's life.   <br /> <br />Plath's eventual death by suicide at the age of 30 make this work all the more moving.  Despite her struggle to get out from under the bell jar, she couldn't prevent its final descent.  Readers can only sympathize by viewing, through this book, what it was like for her inside the jar. <br />
B00005JOII|2.0|This film has a tired story line, boy (Chris Wilton, tennis pro) marries rich brunette with girl next door looks and cheats on her with a sexy blonde wannabe actress, and then has to deal with the consequences of his affair. Same ole, same ole, you can watch movies with similar storylines everyday on the Lifetime cable channel.    The audience is kept waiting almost the entire movie for something exciting to happen, but it's not suspenseful waiting, it's boring waiting.     If you decide to sit through this dull film, I will warn you that the theatre audience groaned in disappointment when the not very credible ending was revealed. The audience reaction in general   to the film was less than enthusiastic, and I heard negative comments about the acting of Scarlett Johansson, who played the mistress.    This film has all the drama of Allen's personal life; taboo relationship, betrayal, deceit, etc. If I knew that slime ball Allen wrote and directed this film before I bought my ticket, I would have seen King Kong instead.    The bright spots of this film are the London scenery and the touching performance of Emily Mortimer, who played Wilton's wife.
B000001EMW|1.0|Wow. I'm glad I didn't buy this. I just downloaded this a few minutes ago. It's well played, but I can't believe how bad this sounds. It just sounds so unnatural and thin. Just terrible tone. There isn't enough bass and the higher stuff just sounds so thin. Probably some of the worst cello tone I've ever heard. And believe me, being a string bassist...I've heard plenty. I could only force myself to listen to half of a track before I had to just turn it off. This is a disgrace to Metallica, and that's really saying something, considering how bad they are. I know you guys will flame me for not liking this, but whatever. If you think this sounds good, then I don't envy you anyways.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I can't begin to describe how much I enjoyed seeing and hearing Cream play again, and it was obviously just as much a treat for Baker, Bruce, and Clapton.  Their talent, dedication, honesty, and musicianship blended, then and now, to create songs and a sound as unique as it is spellbinding. <br /> <br />If you think they should have worn the same clothes and used the same instruments as they did in 1968, if you feel they should apologize for aging during the last 37 years, then you might want to skip this performance. <br /> <br />If you love the songs and music, here is Fresh Cream.  Amen. <br /> <br />   John <br /> <br />
0062502182|3.0|I bought this book based on the good reviews and the title. I was expecting something more about the \\"inner-alchemy\\" of the human being. I thought the book would deal with the process of transforming the chaotic explosiveness of sexual energy into higher levels of consciousness. I was wrong. For me, this was a cheesy introductory spiritual type book. If you have not fully and consciously started searching for deeper meaning in your life, this might be a great book for you. If you have already started your \\"search of the miraculous\\", this book will be severely superficial. It will be a toy to play with for a few hours while you hope it will reveal something you haven't yet learned. But even toys have meaning. <br />   <br />This is not a bad book, I was just a little misled by the title. I was seeking something a little deeper. I got an inch. Although the book has sold 20 million copies and has been translated into fifty-six languages, I was left thinking, \\"what is the big deal?\\" I guess it all comes down to what stage you are at in your own life. I have actually had the inner-alchemical experience of \\"turning metal into gold\\" and it was the most mystical mind-blowing reality expanding experience of my life. It was union with the divine. I was under the impression that this book might be loosely related to that \\"alchemical\\" process. I assumed that the author was an alchemist and I was seeking more insight than he had to give. <br /> <br />The one inspiration that I did get from the book (an omen??) was that it might be time to finally start my writing career. I could have easily wrote a better book than this based on my own life, creativity, and spiritual journey. 20 million copies? I don't get it!!! The underlying theme of the book is meaningful but some of the writing and the overall flow of the book could have been smoother. Maybe it was the translators fault. <br /> <br />Like most things in life, what you get out of this book depends on where you've been. To theaverage mind, alchemy is a scientific study. For the seeker, alchemy is what creates dynamic and authentic individuals. Alchemy is what creates spiritual giants. This book vaguely touches on the subject of what alchemy is really about. The book didn't carry a lot of meaning for me BUT it could have deep symbols for you and your life. It all depends where you are. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00012QM8G|5.0|this is in no way a bad movie. anyway you look at it, nothing is wrong with how the movie is explained. i don't know how many times i cried watching this, as the horrors of humanity raged on through the entire film. one reviewer said oskar schindler deserved to be hanged for his acts. my response is: HIS ACTS OF HEROISM ARE NOT CRIMES. schindler did in fact make money off the jews but in turn, loses it all to save 1,100 of them. while the number appears small, saving one life is almost saving the entire world. 1,100 saved lives is beyond fascinating. there is no one scene bad in this film. other scenes made me disgusted at humanity and others made me cry. overall, its one film impossible of receiving less than a 5 star rating.

0486274268|5.0|This book is wonderful. I picked it up in the bookstore and couldnt put it down! it is by far the best one i have ever picked up. It for instance not only shows you how to draw a horse or a cat but different types of horses and cats. The action poses are worth buying the book alone. Also the cartoon animals included are helpful. I just bought this book and i will be looking through it for months. If you want to learn how to draw animals i highly recomend this book.

0385510454|3.0|Joel Backman was marketing a computer program that would control a super-secret satellite system deployed by an unknown government.  He was talking to various countries, who all believed that the program was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to them.  He was a lobbyist and was connected to people at the highest levels of the US government, and it appeared that although the US wanted this program, he was preparing to sell it to someone else.  Backman wound up in prison but was released by Presidential pardon at the beginning of the book, brought to Italy in a sort-of witness protection program, and he spent the rest of the book trying to erase the stain on his record, and on his conscience. <br /> <br />But half the book is devoted to a travelogue of Italy, particularly Bologna, and I got the impression that the story was a vehicle for presenting the Author's fascination for Italy, rather than developing the plot. <br /> <br />I expect that the movie will be more interesting than the book.  <br />
B0006L16N8|3.0|I must say that this album has some of their best songs.  Fix You is their best song ever.  Low, White Shadows and Talk are excellent.  Unfortately, there are some really mediocre songs such as A Message and Swallowed in the Sea.  What If and The Hardest Part get old after couple of listens.  I think I would like the Speed of Sound if they've never wrote Clocks.  Listen to Clocks immediately before Speed of Sound.  It's unbearable.  This is not an album I can sit down and listen the whole way through.
B0000AGQ6Z|2.0|Everyone should know this is a fantastic movie in every way.  And nothing brings it to the screen better than Superbit.  But why, tell me why o why, would they cut the movie in the middle of a scene, so close to intermission?  The movie is spread onto 2 DVDs, and instead of cuttting at intermission, a perfect time to interupt the movie, they do it a little before.  This interrupts a beutiful viewing of a fantastic movie, and without reason.
B000BWI9U0|5.0|Let me first come out and say that I used to be a Strokes hater.  I've always thought they were overrated, and their music was nothing but a rehash of older 70's indie rock (Ramones, Velvet Underground, etc.)  I don't understand how you can call something \\"indie\\" when there is nothing fresh about it.  That being said, this new album has a new fresh sound.  Of course, this may turn off their core listeners.  Musically, this is by far their best album.  It's darker and heavier.  Heart in a Cage, their best song.
B00003CWPL|5.0|This remarkable early effort by David Lynch will leave the viewer with emotions that have been tugged at and poked, and maybe even unwrapped,  much like the Baby in the movie. What is it about? What does it mean? It can only be described as being inside of another person's dream, a very black nightmare dream to be sure.<br /><br />It is one of the greatest of all \\"strange\\" films and seems to touch each watcher (as I am sure Mr. Lynch intended) in a different way. The sound and imagery in this intense work of Film Noir are very clever indeed and set David Lynch on the path to his future work.<br /><br />It is wonderful to now have this available on DVD and it is most certainly a must have for the discriminating collector of fine films.

B00004TS0E|4.0|This remake with slightly different plot twists, modernized dialogue and a much faster pace definitely gives us movie buffs something to argue over at IMDB. Each one has its place in the representative period of time. As a baby boomer, though, I have to spend my DVD cash on the original.  <br /> <br />\\"Miracle on 34th\\" has been remade before this one, as a TV version with David Hartman as the lawyer  in 1973 - many normally discerning viewers liked that one too. Fundamentally, the basic story is calls out to almost all of us. We should be thankful that more Christmas movies aren't remade...well, never mind because they all are (I can't wait for Charlie's Angels to have \\"A Wonderful Life.\\") Teens and younger may prefer the faster pace of the 1994 version, but I thought the original had more sincerity, more nostalgia (I remember Gimbel's!), much more heart...and the real Santa Claus.   <br /> <br />All versions of the movie are based on the book of the same name by Valentine Davis - I highly recommend it. It's an easy read and there's a reason we all feel so fondly for one version of the movie or another.
B000002UAO|5.0|Does anyone know if the Capitol US release of Rubber Soul is available anyplace?  After years of hearing that track sequence, I find it uncomfortable to listen to the UK version, which seems disjointed and doesn't work as a whole the way the US version does.

B00005K9LN|4.0|British Steel is not my absolute favorite Judas Priest album, but I do consider it one of their better ones. The songs on British Steel are very concise and tight and heavy and to the point. Much of this has to do with the rhythm section (featuring then new drummer Dave Holland, ex-Trapeze), which had never been tighter. This is one of two or three JP albums where Ian Hill's bass guitar is audible, especially on ' The Rage ', which starts OUT with bass (a rarity in a JP song) and has the band playing in a weird time signature in one section.<br /><br />The newly remastered and expanded version of BS has the songs in a different order (at least it's different than the song order on the original U.S. version) and starts out with one of the album's faster tunes, ' Rapid Fire ', which I THINK is about a steel factory. ' Metal Gods ' (which has cutlery being banged on a kitchen table at the end) is about robots taking over the world...this four years before the first Terminator movie! I love the rhythm guitar playing near the very end. I just noticed this past week (after having the album for twenty years) how danceable the two tunes I just mentioned are!<br /><br />' Breaking The Law ' gave JP a well deserved hit, and though I think it's a mighty catchy song, I do find it a bit silly! ' Grinder ' and ' Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise ' are the two slowest songs on the album and my two least favorite, though I really like all of the songs here. ' Living After Midnight ' is my kind of upbeat party hard rock song, with an irresistably catchy guitar riff and chorus, and a short, but happy guitar solo that says alot. ' United ' may be the only anthem of JP's that I like, due to it's very well sung and emotional chorus. The original LP ends with one of my favorite songs, the very fast paced and furious heavy metal tune ' Steeler '. I particularly love the last part of the song, with the band jamming fast and furious  and soloing their arms off over two chords.<br /><br />The two bonus tracks should have remained unreleased...the patriotic ballad ' Red, White and Blue ' (recorded during the Turbo sessions) and a live version of ' Grinder ', which doesn't sound too much different and is no improvement over the studio version. This does come with a lyric sheet, which is essential for this band, despite Rob Halford's stiff, nearly robotic phrasing at times.<br /><br />British Steel is a must have for Judas Priest fans!/>The two bonus tracks should have remained unreleased...the patriotic ballad ' Red, White and Blue ' (recorded during the Turbo sessions) and a live version of ' Grinder ', which doesn't sound too much different and is no improvement over the studio version.

0679422714|5.0|<br /> <br />Jung Chang's book on Mao has a very simple thesis, Mao's evil. If 10% of what was written in the book is true that Mao deserves the same scorn and derision that is reserved for Stalin and Hitler. <br /> <br />Mao sacrificed millions of people for his personal ambition. For example Chung tells how Mao during the civil war killed most of his regiment by taking them through swamp land a rough terrain. In order that his rivals should not have a bigger and stronger regiment then his own Mao ordered the units of his rivals to travel the same terrain, although they were taking much safer alternative routes. Thousands died needlessly but Mao didn't care because at least he was on top. <br /> <br />Mao personifies evil. It is a disgrace that children around the world learn that Mao was a revolutionary and fought for the peasants etc. This book will go a long way in demonstrating the evils of Communism and Maoism and those who still support it. It can be hoped that more books like Chung's will be written about other  Communist icons like Che Guevara.
0385338686|3.0|...it is a good book, however after reading all four Shopaholics and \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" I thought this one didn't quite hold up to the standard she has set with those. While the book was entertaining and could teach us all a lesson about slowing down, I guess I missed the ditzy humor that ran throughout her other novels. I would still recommend this read, however it is a bit of a let down if you're expecting something along the same lines as her others.

0895260131|4.0|Spencer's P.I.G. to Islam plays an important corrective role in the current discourse, or lack of discourse, regarding Islamic ideology and the problem of Islamism throughout the past 1400 years and throughout the world today. I recommend strongly that this book be read as an introduction to Islam, along with the Koran, the Sira (life story of the prophet first told by Ibn Ishaq), and selected Hadith. Spencer also includes in this book many valuable references to critical books on Islamic ideology and history.    <br /> <br />Much has been said already in the way of praise, and Spencer richly deserves it. Spencer is not only an expert on Islam, but he is also an excellent and clear writer. And he comes across as a likeable, decent person who is genuinely disturbed by the facts. He's not out to demonize anybody; Spencer makes the Islamic texts and the Islamists speak for themselves.  <br /> <br />Here I will explain why I gave \\"only\\" four stars instead of a perfect 5. <br /> <br />1. The Koran (and Hadith and Sira) contains far worse, far more offensive material than is presented in Spencer's book. The Koran contains a doctrine of hate, religious imperialism, religiously-based apartheid, misogyny, and bellicose terror. Much of that material is probably not suitable for a general audience which could include young readers. This may seem hard to believe for those who have been exposed to the Karen Armstrong and John Esposito apologetics. But readers should make up their own minds about the Quran: This link gives some indication of what the Quran is all about [...]  <br />Note that the Hadith and Sira are also available at other websites. Besides a lot of the blood, gore, rapes, etc., that Spencer does not include, you will also not find in Spencer's book mention that there are perhaps 300 separate verses in the Quran condemning non-Muslims to hell-fire/eternal doom, and there are dozens of verses expressing terrible insults against non-Muslims. Spencer does not discussthis thorough demonization of non-Muslims in the Quran, but it is in part this demonization, this hate propaganda, that prepares Muslim believers to more readily kill and mistreat non-Muslims. Possibly, Spencer may show us these even darker regions of Islam when he writes his biography of Mohammad. <br /> <br />2. I was not particularly troubled by the relative lack of so-called \\"good\\" verses, because many of the good verses and Hadith reports only apply to Muslims. There's nothing good for non-Muslims. Spencer does briefly address a couple of the most famous so-called good verses, but he does not go sufficiently into depth to expose the fact that these good verses are not what they appear to be. Although the format of the book requires that Spencer deal with a broad array of topics without getting into too much detail for each, I would have liked to have seen a critical exposure to show that certain often-cited good verses are not so good after all, and are of no help to non-Muslims anyway. <br /> <br />3. Spencer's claim that our present-day western society, with its rights and freedoms, is based in Judeo-Christianity, is somewhat irksome. These rights and freedoms were more due to the contributions of the ancient Greeks and the European renaissance and enlightenment period thinkers. Many advances were (and still are) opposed by Judeo-Christianity.  <br /> <br />4. Critical reviewers who say Spencer is not critical enough of Christianity have a point. For example, the Old Testament (Leviticus, 24:10-16) requires the death penalty for blasphemy. Islam has the same or similar policy: Those who mocked or critised Islam were executed or assassinated under Mohammad's orders. However, I've read the Bible and the Quran, and Spencer's argument that Christianity is morally superior to Islam in some key respects is correct. This is most glaringly obvious when one compares the known words and deeds of Jesus versus those of Mohammad--and Spencer shows us several of these comparisons. <br /> <br />5. Spencer rightly challenges the false trumped-up accusation of \\"Islamophobia.\\" But I would have liked to have seen a more thorough dismantling of this Islamist-propagandist tool. A strong case can be made that the Koran promotes \\"Infidelophobia\\"--an irrational fear and hatred of all non-Muslims (who are considered \\"beasts,\\" \\"evil,\\" \\"wicked,\\" \\"perverse,\\" \\"unclean,\\" \\"friends of Satan who are fighting against Allah,\\" \\"ignorant,\\" \\"fools,\\" \\"liars,\\" and so on. <br /> <br />Bottom line: This is an excellent book that provides much-needed wake-up call to those who are interested in defending modern human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression, equal rights for women, freedom from persecution for religious minorities, freedom to change religions or to choose no religion, and of course, the right to physical security and safety. Unless you are already an expert on Islam, if you are a non-Muslim or progressive Muslim, you should buy this book.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I hate to see Madonna fans exploding this page with hating reviews on Mariah. Why bother, people? The people who visit this page are not stupid. They realize you are here to hate and not give an honest, open opinion about the album. A 1 star review on Amazon would not change the fact that \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is the no. 1 selling album of 2005. So do us all a favor and go review Madonna albums instead. Now about the album... \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is a pure fun record. It's full of hip-hop beats, Urban records and R&B-influenced ballads. The hugely-popular enormously-big record-breaking hit-single, aka \\"We Belong Together\\", is undeniably the album's crown jewel. The song became the hit that it is for a good reason. It has great beats, great lyrics, great vocals. The album spawned several more hit-singles including the bouncy \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"Get Your Number\\". I am crossing my fingers for Mariah to win a handful of Grammy's next month, she truly deserves it.

B0000025T6|5.0|\\"Nebraska\\" definitely came out of left-field considering how depressing and minimalistic it is. Bruce Springsteen usually plays with the E-Street band, but here he's all alone with his guitar and harmonica. Ironically, this actually enhanced the songs as they're mostly about journeying through the midwest all alone and discovering the truth about life. His vocals are also eerily detached considering what the stories are usually about (for example, \\"Nebraska\\" is about a man who's about to be executed, but Bruce's voice is emotionless throughout the entire song - this is a subtly disturbing effect that certainly enhances the song). The lyrics are the key here, and they don't disappoint - they're extremely memorable, quotable and interesting. I would argue that every song here is great except for \\"My Father's House\\" and \\"Reason To Believe\\". They aren't bad, but compared to, say, \\"Atlantic City\\" or \\"Nebraska\\" they just aren't as good. For such a minimalistic album \\"Nebraska\\" hits you surprisingly hard. Folk fans and essentially any self-respting music lover will love this album! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  everything except for arguably \\"My Father's House\\" and \\"Reason To Believe\\"
B000ASATWQ|4.0|The third time sounds to be a charm for roots, rap, reggae royale Damian \\"Junior Gong\\" Marley with his astounding new album Welcome to Jamrock (Universal/Motown). Months ago when the long natty'd Marley welcomed the world to Jamrock he got invited to the mainstream.<br /><br />The addictive Ini Kamoze sample-driven-title-track that set the airwaves ablaze is warmfire compared to the combustible \\"Move!\\" where he chants, \\"Babylon position the queen and set the pawn, And start transform like Deceptacon, Anytime delegates have a discrepance, Well a bare tension with some long weapons.\\" This aptly titled song injects ass and arm credibility to the talents of Bob's youngest son who shares executive production credit with his big-brother Stephen Marley.<br /><br />Silence haters.<br /><br />Yes, Junior samples Daddy's music here and there, but there's no abundant Diddification. And while \\"Move!\\" uses a snippet of Bob Marley's \\"Exodus,\\" please believe the sample only helps make what's already good better. But it's the marching \\"Confrontation\\" interweaving snippets of Marcus Garvey's speech to heavy drum percussions that carries on in the spirit of what Damian is most known for, lyricism. On the militant-minded \\"Road to Zion\\" Nas brings his lyrical-sense: \\"Human beings like ghosts and zombies, President Mugabe, holding guns to innocent bodies.\\" Emcees of a feather stick together, but uncanny is the use of Black Thought from The Roots on the bland \\"Pimpa's Paradise.\\" A guest verse from the Philly MC is normally a blessing and a good look but even Black Thought couldn't save this mundane oh-too-familiar story of a girl lost track. For everyone clamoring to know about the \\"the Bobby Brown song\\", known here as \\"Beautiful,\\" here goes. (Ahem, clearing throat.) It is a jazzy saxophone-infused, a-aight, track that doesn't make, break or shift the album. It's an R&B song more dominated by Damian's silky delivery than Bobby's hook-which sounds like vintage Bobby (give or take a cracking voice at the end).<br /><br />Many try to fuse hip hop, dancehall, R&B, reggae but rarely does it work. Welcome to Jamrock, like Halfway Tree (Damian Marley's 2002 Grammy Award winning album that no one ever heard), stands firm as a blueprint for what fusions can be if done correctly.a cracking voice at the end).  <br /> <br />Many try to fuse hip hop, dancehall, R&B, reggae but rarely does it work.

B000068PQ0|5.0|If you were to ask anybody if they'd heard of The Flaming Lips, most people might say they know the hit single \\"Fight Test\\". While this is indeed a great song, the rest of the album holds up surprisingly well compared to it. The album is essentially a psychedelic rock album that veers off into strange, creative and experimental places, and this makes it fun and very interesting. Every song here is great - they're all very catchy and the singer has a wonderfully likable and psychedelic voice. Up to about the fourth song the album is about a girl named Yoshimi who's trying to battle evil pink robots. This may seem stupid at first, but it makes sense considering how everything sounds - it's certainly weird but it also fits the style of music. After this song is where the album veers off into experimental rock. The musicianship is great here - every track is fun and it sounds like psychedelic/indie/electronic/experimental rock (confusing, I know). They don't sound like any other band you know. Basically, if you like The Flaming Lips, experimental rock, psychedelic rock, or if you're just a music lover than chances are you'll absolutely love this album. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000B8QG0O|5.0|My kids were so crazy about the first Toy Story that I rushed to pick up Toy Story II as soon as it was released. Pixar did an outstanding job on this movie. Most of the original cast participated in this project and did a great job. Once again, Buzz (Tim Allen) and Woody (Tom Hanks) steal the show. The addition of Joan Cusak as Jessie is a real treat. My kids now call this movie \\"The Woody Girlfriend Movie.\\" <br /> <br />The story line is amusing. Woody gets stolen by a Toy Collector and Buzz and the gang go on a journey to rescue him. <br /> <br />This movie is great for kids and parents alike. <br />
B0000C8AVR|5.0|\\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" may not be as consistently catchy as \\"Blonde On Blonde\\", but it's still one of the best albums ever recorded. With its first single, \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", Dylan was launched into stardom as the world's greatest singer/songwriter. This album essentially made folk-rock a credible subgenre as most people turned their heads to Dylan at the time (they were used to the slow and more delicate folk albums by the likes of The Kingston Trio, for instance). Though not every song here is as catchy as this hit, they're all great songs with incredible lyrics (that's the main reason to buy a Dylan album, anyway). This is another extremely quotable and deep album by the master himself. If all you've been listening to your whole life is MTV bands, do yourself a favor and by this album to have your life renewed! Absolutely recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B0002DKCMG|3.0|Ivan Reitman strikes again as the executive producer of this teen sex romp (he did the same for Road Trip & Old School), which is basically a mix of the aforementioned Road Trip, European Vacation (shudder), and American Pie. It's funnier than European Vacation and American Pie, and about on par with Road Trip. Do you care?<br /><br /> Hey, how about the plot: Scott (Scott (!) Mechlowicz) has just been dumped by his girlfriend Fiona, who publicly humiliates him at the graduation party with her boyfriend (a freakin' sweet cameo by Matt Damon) with the song Scotty Doesn't Know. Meanwhile, Scott has been communicating with pen pal Mieke (Jessica Boehrs), who he calls Mike and believes is a guy. When Mieke comes on to him online and Scott turns her down with disgust, though, he realizes his mistake and travels with buddy Cooper (Jacob Pitts) to Germany with \\"the twins\\" (Michelle Trachtenberg, Travis Wester), stopping in Amsterdam for hash brownies (or are they?) and a freaky visit to Club Vandersexxx; going to a nude beach with all guys; taking a train ride with a creepy Italian (SNL member Fred Armisen); drinking with a group of drunken Brits (led by Vinnie Jones); and destroying the Vatican with the fake death of the Pope and a fire. Does Scott end up with Mieke? The makers changed the ending so they do (wow, a big surprise!)<br /><br /> Anyway, this movie is no classic, but it's a lot funnier than the previous effort of writers Alec Berg & David Mandel and writer/director Jeff Schaffer, a little movie called the Cat in the Hat. Besides, a movie with a town in the middle of nowhere that's just getting 80s shows can't be all bad.
B000002J0P|5.0|\\"Crosby, Stills & Nash\\" is just an essential folk-rock album that's filled with tons of great songs (\\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" especially). Every song and everything about the songs is golden - the production, the lyrics, the vocals, the instrumentation...you'll love this! This is the band that inspired so many other bands of its kind when it came out in 1969. The lyrics are wonderfully deep and sometimes even quotable, and the singers' soothing voices only serve to enhance the experience. The musicianship is tight and clean, and although it sounds just a tad dated it has lost none of its charm! It's an extremely mellow album that would make some wonderful background music, too. It's historical influence only adds to its value. If you like GOOD quality music then you most definitely can't go wrong with \\"Crosby, Stills & Nash\\"! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|So many hits, so many memories. There is a lot of positive but a lot of negative to. In my opinion i think they should have taken off from me to you because they already gave us an abundance of the beatles early hits, and added on a day in the life or across the universe, strawberry fields forever, with a little help from my friends, there are just too many to list. <br />Major negative: The ballad of john and yoko? Major hit?  <br />Although i haven't come across a beatles song that i hate, other than this i find this absurd, offensive even. <br />Although for this hits collection they made a lot of good choices, and also a lot of poor choices. What is hello goodbye doing on this album? Yes ilike the song but i'msure they could find a better song than that. Since there are so many great songs on here doesn't let you appretiate love me do as much as you would appretiate hearing it on an album. <br /> <br />That was just mixed information. <br />Here i'll list the negative and positive of this album <br /> <br /> <br />- there isn't that atmosphere of what kind of songs are on the album as there is in well put together albums like rubber soul. <br />-Poor song choices; too many of their early hits. <br />+ an overall good listen <br />+ nice song arrangement and a great ending with the long and winding road. <br /> <br />= a great listen with a decent amount of songs that people with decent enough sophistication will enjoy. <br /> <br />Remember when listening to older bands like the beatles take into account how ground breaking their music was and it was not just slopped together like rap. Anyone who bashes the beatles needs to actually listen to them not just write biased reviews about how great their emo/rap/metal bands are. <br /> <br />              ~Buddha the enlightener~
B00006AW2J|5.0|Like basically every other early Stones album, \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" is another classic that you definitely need in your collection. Every track on here is great, and it also contains some pretty well-known Stones classics (\\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\", for example). Everything is wonderful here, from the lyrics to the instrumentation. The musicianship is excellent (more great Rock & Roll), and the lyrics are very much worth your time to listen to (they're incredibly interesting AND catchy!). Mick Jagger delivers more memorable vocals here on \\"Beggar's Banquet\\". This arguably may not be their \\"best\\" album, but really, there's no use bickering over such little things as they're all great and classics in their own way. All things aside, most people will love this album along with practically every other Stones CD! Absolutely recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B00005Y228|5.0|this cd is filled with fun, techno, dance, pop-like songs that are addicting! i can't get enough! there is no need for songs to grow on you like some other cds...
B0000AQVCL|3.0|Jet's \\"Get Born\\" may have a bunch of catchy songs, but they're so MTV-oriented and dull that they just aren't worth your time. Cameron Muncey has a decent enough voice and the band has potential to be really good, but \\"Get Born\\" just doesn't deliver. The lyrics are pretty forgettable and uninteresting, so it's at least good that the musicianship is somewhat good. There are no \\"bad\\" tracks here, but they're all merely \\"decent\\". Their other saving grace is that it's not as much a guilty pleasure as, say, Idlewild or Nickelback is. You can tell that if they tried harder that they might actually be a pretty good band. Unfortunately, with \\"Get Born\\", all you get is standard MTV garage pop rock. There are MUCH better albums that you could get. Not really recommended.    Highlights include:  the entire album is just \\"ok\\"
B00008972S|5.0|I Love this Film, it is that Rare Masterpiece, One that is truly watchable many times, never boring, Interesting Characters, Plot, and Great Music; Every High School Band has some of these Songs in its Repertoire, Bernstein's Score is Outstanding, and Sondheim's Lyrics Match Note for Note.  The Soundtrack Album was the longest running #1 Album in Chart History (1962), and remained so for some 15 Years untill Fleetwood Mac's RUMOURS Topped it. The Plot outline above, that Amazon gives is not exactly accurate.  The Film is about Rival Gangs, The Jets (Polish/Italian?) and Sharks (Puerto Rican) who eventually Meet under \\"the Bridge\\" to Duke it out; All the action takes place over a roughly 36 Hour Timeframe on a Summer Night in the 1950's, on Manhattan's West Side. Tony (Richard Beyemer) is a Jet who is struggling with feelings of Wanting Out, but agrees to meet up with the Gang at a Local Dance, where He meets Maria (Natalie Wood), The Sharks Leader's Sister; They Kiss after a short dance, then Sharks Members escort her Home, whereupon Tony exits the Dance singing \\"Maria\\" while walking the night streets...it's easy to feel Tony's passion, but intellectually One finds it difficult to reconcile His Falling for Her so Hard and fast! Tony meets up with Maria soon after, atop a Fire Escape by Her Family's Loft, He tells Maria He loves Her, Maria wisely tells Him \\"it's early\\", but She is clearly smitten with Tony, and the next afternoon at Her Workplace (a Dress Shop) She is Giddy in Love, singing \\"I feel pretty\\", Tony Meets Her at 6 p.m. Closing Time and They hold a mock Wedding Ceremony in the Dress Shop...They are CRAZY IN LOVE; Maria asks Tony to stop the planned Rumble set for that Evening, He tries to do so, but a Knife Fight ensues, a Jet is stabbed by Bernardo (Maria's  Shark Brother), and Tony stabs Bernardo in a moment of passion, killing Him...Tony flees to Maria, who learns of the Killing shortly before Tony's arrival, She is Angry for 10 seconds, then Crazy Love takes over, and She and Tony plot to escape, singing \\"Somewhere\\" they can get away and live in each other's arms....an extremely Naive scene, but again, I'm feeling it as I watch, and bleeding a Tear or Two....Tony and Maria sleep a while in Full Embrace, awakened by Maria's Roommate (and Bernardo's Girlfriend) Anita (Rita Moreno)entering the Loft, Tony flees out the Window for the Store where He works, to get Money from His Boss for He and Maria's Escape; Anita cautions Maria, singing \\"a Boy like that\\" will kill your Brother, yet She understands Maria's Wild Heart, as they both finish the Song exclaiming \\"when Love is so strong, there is no right or wrong, Love is Life!\\"...indeed, the feeling that Love CAN and WILL conquer, however Untrue the Facts; Anita has heard that a Shark Member seeks to Revenge Kill Tony, and at Maria's Beseeching (Maria is under interrogation by the Police at this time) goes to find Tony at the Store, where fellow Jets are assembled (Tony is ensconsed in the Cellar)...The Jets toss Anita around, seemingly prepared to Sexually Molest, if not Gang Rape Her, broken up by Tony's Boss who has returned from the Bank with Money for Tony; Anita, angered by the Jets, falsely tells them the Shark Member Killed Maria, Tony's Boss relays that to Tony, who flees into the night, meeting up with Maria who has nearly arrived at the Store, Tony is Shot as He and Maria prepare to Embrace, Maria holds the dying Tony for a few moments, then reaches out for the Gun that Killed Her Love, the Shark hands it to Her, and Maria threatens to shoot all the now assembled Jets and Sharks, hoping there is a Bullet left over for Herself...it's Very Powerful, Maria finally collapses and Tony's Body is carried off as the \\"credits\\" roll, perhaps an untidy ending, but ENGROSSING throughout; BUY THIS FILM
B00004T9UF|5.0|No matter whether you like him or not, Eminem is still one of the best new rappers alive today (and, honestly, I can understand if you don't like him). This is because of several things - A: he has great delivery (as good as if-not-better-than Nas), B: his voice is really really good (he's very unique and identifiable whereas most other rappers (Ice Cube, Jeru The Damaja, Dr. Dre, etc) are relatively similar - he definitely stands out) and C: he's not afraid to offend you. Now this last one might raise some eyebrows, but hear me out - if everyone is afraid to offend you in an extremely disturbing and offensive way (\\"Kim\\" is the most disturbing song I've ever heard in my entire life), then we are limiting ourselves, yes? Artists want to make you think in ways you never had before, and Eminem helps do that. He's not that great of a lyricist (i.e. he doesn't really have anything to say), but he sure can paint an extremely detailed picture with his rap-stories. He's also pretty funny in a lot of the songs, and occasionally pretty deep and meaningful (see \\"Stan\\" for an example of that one). Every track here is good-if-not-great, and the production is just fabulous - practically every track is fun and catchy. It's not for everybody, but if you're a rap fan and you haven't heard Eminem yet then you are truly living under a rock. Rap fans will LOVE this! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B0009WFFS6|4.0|This is an amazing concert.  To see Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton come together again is simply a remarkable experience.  I taped this off PBS a while back, and loved every minute of it.  This DVD looks and sounds a lot better than the \\"Farewell Concert\\" DVD.  The three men look like they are having a wonderful time up there and it is really wonderful to see.  \\"Spoonful\\" and \\"I'm So Glad are the highlights for me.  Any Cream fan will love this performance.
B00005KB9X|5.0|Although \\"Natty Dread\\" isn't really Bob Marley's most famous album, it's still a classic (and most people know \\"No Woman No Cry\\"). It's another extremely accessible and fun album by the reggae master himself - you'd be hardpressed not to like this. Every song here is great reggae. It makes for some great background music, but it's also fun to listen to closely as the lyrics and instrumentation are also top notch (though the lyrics tend to be more catchy then interesting). It sounds like most other reggae albums, but it's just so good and so influential that it most certainly deserves a \\"5\\" star rating. Bob Marley and reggae fans will most assuredly love this album along with most of his other releases. Highly recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Here's the order in which I experianced the world of Sin City: <br /> <br />First I saw the trailer, I knew what actors were in this movie, I got a glimps of what the atmosphere was like, and I had no idea what was CG and what wasn't. Next I got excited about the whole thing and bought all the graphic novels that the movie was based on... and I read all those. While reading them, I applied each actor's face with the characters. So when I came time to see the actual movie, I not only understood what some of the visual \\"oddities\\" where (e.i. Marv's bandages on his face, Contrasting bricks in shadows), but I was actually greatly amused that those details were included in the film. Also, it wasn't hard at all getting used to the casting, since I already had in mind while reading the books. <br /> <br />I must say, that those who haven't read the Graphic novels are missing a small (i repeat, small) edge to the film. It's much more amusing when you're watching the movie and are consistantly reminded of how f***ing accurate it is to the graphic novel. It's amazing... and i'm not even the biggest advocate of extreme-o super accurate adaptions. but this quality of the film cannot go unnoticed.  <br /> <br />As for those who hate \\"this piece of crap\\" film. well, they obviously have tastes should have never got them interested to watch the film in the first place. Also, you really should keep in mind that this is a litteral translation of a few graphic novels. Common folks, it was on the news and in the papers during this film's release; this isn't a normal movie. It transcends beyond all conventional film. Take it or leave it.
B000001E7V|5.0|I'll admit that I hated \\"Maxinquaye\\" the first time I heard it - I was expecting an album similar to Massive Attack's \\"Blue Lines\\" or \\"Mezzanine\\". Tricky was my favorite rapper in Massive Attack, and I was definitely psyched about checking out his acclaimed solo album. Tricky himself hardly ever appears on the album as he is replaced by a female vocalist - she's not \\"great\\", but at least she's likable and fits the music well. The most important thing you need to know about this album is that it's pretty different from Massive Attack - it's still trip-hop, yes, but it's darker, sexier and better suited as background music. This last part is the key - \\"Maxinquaye\\" would make GREAT late-night background music for when you're with a loved one (trust me on this). It's a very sexy and dark album. The lyrics even talk about sex most of the time (sometimes pornographically), which basically furthers the idea of it being used in those kinds of situations. Musically it's trip-hop, but slower and more experimental - he sometimes uses rock and metal influences, for instance (see \\"Black Steel\\"). It's definitely a very moody album that takes a while to get used to. All in all it makes for great background music, and even though most people probably won't like it at first (except for the first two songs - those are immediately catchy and likable) they'll eventually love it! Absolutely recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />\\"Overcome\\" <br />\\"Ponderosa\\" <br />the rest are good, too
B000002WPI|5.0|Wu-Tang Clan's \\"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\\" is definitely a very very weird (and sometimes offensive) rap album that is extremely original. There are nine members here with their own styles and vocals, but you'll grow to love each and every one of them (they are Method Man, Ghostface Killa, GZA/Genius, RZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, U-God, Masta Killa, Raekwon and Inspectah Deck). Every track is great here, but the best thing about this album is how weird, funny and original it is. They clearly love their Asian movies as they talk about them in a lot of the tracks. The songs tend to not be about much of anything (mostly about how cool they are or other random things), but you'll love it anyway. They just have great charisma - once you hear this you'll understand why so many people love the Wu-Tang Clan. This isn't for everybody though as it'll offend lots of people, but rap fans and those with an open mind will love this! Highly recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B00006JJ51|5.0|N.W.A. didn't invent gangster rap (that was Ice T and Schoolly D), but N.W.A. certainly took it to its extremes with \\"Straight Outta' Compton\\". Everything about this album is amazing - the lyrics, the rappers, the beats - unless the lyrics offend you or unless you hate rap then there's no way you couldn't love this. N.W.A. is essentially made up of some of the best rappers of all time - Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E and MC Ren - you'll grow to love each and every one of them. The songs are pretty much all about the hardships of the ghetto and the gangster lifestyle, and they can be pretty offensive at times (\\"F*** The Police\\" started an outrage when it came out). However, those with an open mind will recognize the album's brilliance and creativity. This is one of the few essential rap albums that all fans of the genre should own! Absolutely recommended! If you liked this album I would definitely recommend Ice Cube's \\"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\\", Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\", Nas' \\"Illmatic\\", Jeru The Damaja's \\"The Sun Rises In The East\\" and Snoop Dogg's \\"Doggystyle\\". <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B000000W5L|5.0|Like The Beatles and Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones released an absurd amount of classic albums in their prime. \\"Exile On Main Street\\" is but one out of many Stones albums you should absolutely add to your collection. As with every other Stones album, everything here is great - the production, lyrics, vocals, instrumentation...you really can't go wrong with these guys. Mick Jagger remained a great and powerful singer on this album (though he's obviously not as good as, say, Bono or Sting, he's still very good and, most importanty, likable). This album also a lot of songs on it, and none of them are bad (all of them are good-if-not-classic). It also contains some of their more well-known songs such as \\"Sweet Virginia\\" and \\"Rocks Off\\". As always, the lyrics are fun, memorable and definitely worthy of analyzation. Most people will love this album as well as most of the other Stones albums from their early career. Absolutely recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00026WU82|5.0|\\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" may not be as consistently catchy as \\"Blonde On Blonde\\", but it's still one of the best albums ever recorded. With its first single, \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", Dylan was launched into stardom as the world's greatest singer/songwriter. This album essentially made folk-rock a credible subgenre as most people turned their heads to Dylan at the time (they were used to the slow and more delicate folk albums by the likes of The Kingston Trio, for instance). Though not every song here is as catchy as this hit, they're all great songs with incredible lyrics (that's the main reason to buy a Dylan album, anyway). This is another extremely quotable and deep album by the master himself. If all you've been listening to your whole life is MTV bands, do yourself a favor and by this album to have your life renewed! Absolutely recommended!     Highlights include:   the entire album!
B000024QML|4.0|Dance-pop is a genre that tends to be laughed at by most people, and rightfully so. It's one of those genres that's definitely a guilty pleasure and not for everyone. However, it exists and many people seem to love it, so it's only fair that I check it out myself. So what's so great about \\"Very\\"? Several things: Every track is dancy, fun, and clever - the lyrics are also surprisingly good whenthey really shouldn't be. This is essentially dance music, but probably only for, well...I guess the only way I know how to say it is girls or gay men. For those with an open-mind, however, one will notice just how good this really is. The production is simply wonderful in every song - it's unique and recognizably Pet Shop Boys. Every song is pretty complex and interesting to listen to individually. Neil Tennant has an odd voice, yet he somehow manages to be very likable - I certainly think he fits the music well. The album tends to run out of steam by the end, but you won't really mind I think. All of these reasons, it's uniquness in the dance world and the extremely catchy and accessible tune \\"Can You Forgive Her\\" earn this a \\"5\\". This is basically just for dance-pop enthusiasts, but those with an open-mind should be able to appreciate it to. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />everything except \\"Go West\\"
B00005JGI6|4.0|I would argue that \\"The Invisible Band\\" is Travis' best album, though it's not \\"great\\" per se. Every song here is fun and catchy, even if the singer is a little questionable and the lyrics are usually not that interesting (they can be at times, however). The songs are usually pretty energetic and feature some lesser-used instruments (like the banjo on the first track), but sometimes they slow down a bit like on \\"Dear Diary\\". The best song here is easily \\"Side\\" which has \\"hit\\" written all over it. This is essentially the song that got me into this album. The instrumentation is pretty good, although it's not necessarily new. The singer's reminiscent of My Morning Jacker's Jim James at times. It's slightly a guilty pleasure, but not by a great measure. Overall, if you like pop rock then chances are you'll like this CD. Recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B00026W82U|5.0|I would argue that their previous album \\"Quiet Is The New Loud\\" is the better album as practically everything about it is perfect. Now while \\"Riot On An Empty Street\\" is also a great album, it has a few small errors. It's still mainly a mellow album, but for some reason it seems to lack the great charm and pleasantness of the original. Perhaps its that Erlend seems more front-and-center here and thus louder. Anyway, chances are you'll still find it to be a nice and mellow CD. Erlend Oye still has a great singing voice, and the band breaks free from it's slow and mellow style with the classic hit \\"I'd Rather Dance With You\\" (which is, indeed, VERY dancable). This song is honestly one of the best songs ever written (at least it's one of the most fun). This song definitely helps out the album's appeal as well as rating/value. The lyrics are, once again, interesting to listen to as well as pleasing and sometimes catchy. The album is arguably a tad bit worse than \\"Quiet Is The New Loud\\", but you'll still love it anyway. All in all, I would definitely recommend this! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B000A3DFZE|2.0|While being a perfectly decent workmanlike little collection of songs, some even written by himself, there is absolutely nothing special about this disc, nothing to recommend it...He is, for quite obvious reasons, a guitar icon, so you always have to tune in, just in case...but this, I'm afraid, is not going to be the one to break the somnambulistic spell cast by so many of his recent efforts...
0441003257|5.0|This book represents the best of both worlds in so many ways. The best work of both Pratchett and Gaiman, The best of dark comedy. The best of parody and originality. It is a book that's laugh out loud funny and extremely intelligent and thought provoking. And internally the best of both heaven (Aziraphale) and hell (Crowley). <br /> <br />This is a story about the biblical armageddon. Well it's supposed to be. Unfortumately the Anti-Christ gets mixed up at birth and is raised by an exceptionally moderate rural English family so instead of being raised to a sense of rank and privilege and righteous power he's raised as humble and thoughtful as an 11 year old can be (which isn't that much, admittedly). <br /> <br />On the surface the book is a parody of The Omen. But that's just the starting point. It takes the concept and runs of in a totally different direction following its own internal plot instead of trying to parallel the movie.  <br /> <br />And it's an excellent plot. It has no glaring holes, no jarringly ridiculous coincidences and, despite being part of the central theme, no precisely accurate profecies pushing the storyline around. They're there of course, but since Agnes Nutter didn't understand what she was seeing her descriptions of the modern world from a medieval viewpoint are difficult to decipher so they're only rarely understood before the event they describe (although \\"Don't buy Beta Macks\\" was surprisingly helpful).  <br /> <br />The characters are all brilliantly conceived and sympathetic. The anthropomorphic personifications of the four horsemen were hysterically funny. I particularly liked Famine, with his wry sense of humour; starving the rich by inventing Nouvelle Quisine and writing diet books and starving the poor by inventing burger chains where the food had so much fat and carbohydrate and so little nutritional value that people could get fat and still die of malnutrition.  <br /> <br />I've read the book several times and it bears repeated reading very well. Some minor cracks show up, but more importantly new insights are gained. The parallels between Adam and his 3 buddies and the four horsemen (and even the \\"other\\" four horsemen) took a couple of reading to really register; for instance. <br /> <br />The humour IS very English. Deadpan, often sarcastic, and deeply wrapped up into the plotline. This isn't a Monty Python or Fawlty Towers type farce, this is more like a Spinal Tap, a story that feels real and allows the humour to rise unforced out of the story.  <br /> <br />Douglas Adams is the humourist that is closest to this stylistically and comparisons are often made, although I think both Pratchett and Gaiman are better storytellers. If you didn't like Adams's style of humour you might not like this book. If you liked Adam's humour but thought his storytelling was a bit weak then you'll LOVE these authors and this book in particular. <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|OK, look past the image, with the trampy, completely age-inappropriate clothes, the bimbo-y persona, the superficial hip-hop packaging, the cheesy attempts to keep milking this release by adding extra tracks to subsequent editions, and you're still left with a set of moving and substantive tunes, many co-written by Mariah, and all beautifully sung by her...one of THE great pop voices out there. Very deserving of its chart success, if you ask me.
B000A59PMO|5.0|**Warning:  Some spoilers follow, but the \\"big mystery\\" is not spoiled.**<br /><br />Rob Thomas's \\"Veronica Mars\\" is, quite simply, the best television show ever. The debut season of \\"Mars\\" is almost flawless, with superb writing, excellent acting, and intriguing plots (both main plots and subplots).<br /><br />The show follows its titular character, a junior who was once in the \\"in crowd\\" at Neptune High, a southern California school so full of the rich and privileged that it might as well be a prestigious private school. A year previous to the pilot episode, Veronica's life was good: she was dating the handsome and popular Duncan Kane and was best friends with Duncan's gorgeous and fun sister Lilly. Duncan and Veronica often hung out with Lilly and her boyfriend, Logan Ecchols, whose father is a famous film star.<br /><br />Then, Duncan dumps Veronica for no apparent reason, and shortly after, Lilly Kane's bludgeoned body is found. Veronica's father, Keith Mars--the sheriff of Neptune--believes that Lilly was murdered, an opinion agreed upon by the rest of the community. However, when Sheriff Mars targets Lilly's wealthy father, Jake Kane, as his prime suspect, Neptune turns on the Mars family. Keith loses his position as sheriff, Veronica's mother runs away from the family, and Veronica becomes a social pariah. One night, Veronica attends a party to show that she can still hold her head up high--but she winds up drugged and raped while she's unconscious.<br /><br />All of this is learned through flashbacks, which are interwoven with Veronica's present-day life. Her father has reinvented himself as a private investigator, and Veronica often helps him with his cases--occasionally taking a few on herself. These cases serve as subplots to fill out the episodes and lead Veronica closer to solving the main plot's biggest mystery: who killed Lilly Kane. However, the subplots rarely feel like filler; they are well-rounded and superbly written, and each episode could do well as a \\"stand alone.\\"<br /><br />Helping and hindering Veronica in her quest for answers is an intriguing cast of characters, portrayed by some of the best actors you've never heard of. (One exception to this is Teddy Dunn, who plays Duncan Kane; while he's not a terrible actor by any means, he falls sadly short when compared to the rest of this stellar cast.) Logan, once Veronica's friend, has now become an enemy of the highest order, who resents Veronica for a myriad of reasons. Weevil, a biker boy, both antagonizes and assists Veronica. Wallace, the new kid at Neptune, quickly befriends Veronica and becomes her closest ally. And through it all, Veronica's father is one of her best friends.<br /><br />The mystery of who killed Lilly Kane is compelling, especially since the writers are careful, via the flashbacks, to make Lilly an interesting character. But, unlike \\"Twin Peaks,\\" the mystery isn't the only thing that will keep you glued to the TV watching this show: the writing, the characters, and the actors will, as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this show to any fan of good television. Do something good for yourself: buy season 1 of \\"Veronica Mars\\" now.ould do well as a \\"stand alone.\\" <br /> <br />Helping and hindering Veronica in her quest for answers is an intriguing cast of characters, portrayed by some of the best actors you've never heard of.

B00005JOFO|4.0|I love Annie Proulx's original story of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" more than any other piece of contemporary literature, and I wanted to love Ang Lee's film as much as I love the story. I do like the film a lot, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal embody Ennis and Jack magnificently; they give two of the greatest, most courageous and most moving performances in any recent American film. Yet, in my opinion, the film doesn't quite deserve the highest rating. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana write wonderful dialogue, and McMurtry unquestionably knows more about how cowboys act, talk and think than any other living author, with the possible exception of Proulx. Yet, in expanding Proulx's story for the screen, McMurtry and Ossana add some not-very-interesting new characters, and make some slight but annoying changes to the original that dilute its impact. (Their screenplay is indeed beautiful and tear-inducing, but Proulx's original leaves readers with their guts ripped out.) As for Lee's direction, he obviously is a masterful director of actors; every performance is perfect, and Michelle Williams equals Ledger and Gyllenhaal as Ennis' wife Alma, a nice, beleaguered young woman who discovers her husband's secret in a way no woman could ever forgive. Lee also captures some heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of the Rockies and Great Plains with the help of his superb photographer, Rodrigo Prieto. But he lingers too long on those scenes, so that a film that should have been a punchy, concentrated 90 minutes drags on for two-and-a-quarter hours. The basic story, however, still gets under our skin in a way few stories ever do, and Ledger and Gyllenhaal (as stated before) can't be faulted in any way. Ledger is particularly impressive as an archetypal cowboy--hot-blooded but emotionally reticent, quicker with his fists than his tongue--who finds himself drawn into a love that everything in his previous experience tells him is a death sentence. Gyllenhaal, with his puppy-dog eyes and lopsided grin, makes us feel his character's ardent emotional needs with touching immediacy. I just wish the film as a whole was as great as they are. The relevance of \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" however, could not be clearer: even as all America is weeping over the plight of Ennis and Jack, the Virginia legislature--marching in lockstep with Ohio and other states--just voted overwhelmingly to ban same-sex marriage within the commonwealth. I wish I could find out who the hypocrites are--the delegates who voted for the ban while pretending to have been moved by this film.psided grin, makes us feel his character's ardent emotional needs with touching immediacy.

0805076476|5.0|There is one place in your life that you are free to rid your problems of your empty jobs and routines.  A place where all your frustrations are released in one simple fight.  This very place is fight club.  The Novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk is a powerful and mindblowing piece of writing.  Fight Club is wonderfully written and is guranteed to keep you reading until you reach the exciting finish. <br />       Fight Club is written from the point of view of a man whose life is incredibly routine.  He meets Tyler Durden through a disaster at his appartment and ends up creating an organized group called \\"fight club\\".  I think some of this book's appeal comes from the desire within each of us to be part of something big.  \\"Fight Club\\" develops into an underground society that spreads across the country.  We all wish to be a player in these types of societies.  Not only that, but the novel Fight Club is very interestingly written, with many insides into the main characters mind.  Many people are able to connect with the character and even rebelious Tyler. <br />       Fight Club's plot is probably its best known quality.  The exciting beggining, middle and end are what keeps the reader enthralled.  New action always emerges with every turn of the page.  Finally, the twist in the end is one that ranks high among the most unexpected endings of any novel. <br />       This book is one of the best books i have ever read.  Its action and suprises are by far the greatest in any novel I have enjoyed.  This book however does contain references that could be offensive to any younger readers.  I would recommend this book to those who are able to handle content that they wouldnt normally read about in an average young adult novel.  However for those who can handle it, I can guarantee that they will not regret reading Palahniuk's Fight Club.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have been lucky enough to see the original stage version as well as two more stage productions with different casts, so when I say this movie and this cast is the best, I have something to compare it to.  First, Gerard Butler--yum!  I loved Michael Crawford's phantom, but Gerard brings a sensuality and emotional depth to the role I have not seen before.  I would also say that I enjoyed his singing voice better than any I have heard before because he placed such EMOTION into each song.  He made us FEEL his rage, despair, love and desperation as if they were our own.  Emmy Rossum was perfect as Christine.  She has a beautiful voice that I felt was a perfect compliment for Gerard Butler's.  The entire cast  was supberb in my opinion (foremost was Minnie Driver's hysterical portrayal of the diva of the opera house).  Also, the costumes and scenery made the movie eye candy to look at.  Lastly, have a glass of ice water handy for the Phantom and Christine's sizzling rendition of Point of No Return near the end of the film.  Like a previous reviewer, I, too, would have chosen the Phantom over Raoul any day!  This one is a must have for any musical fan.  Pop it in the DVD player and get ready for a thoroughly enjoyable two hours!
B000002L9J|5.0|Though \\"The Smiths\\" was a great follow-up to this album, I would argue that their debut album \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is their more consistently appealing and satisfying album. Every track is great here as opposed to on \\"The Smiths\\", and Morrissey is much easier to stand here (he was very experimental on \\"The Smiths\\" and very hard to listen to half the time). Everything is amazing on here - the production, the lyrics, the vocals, etc. The lyrics are especially fun and interesting to listen to (and sometimes even quotable). The production and musicianship is crystal clear even on the non-remastered version. For those who aren't that familiar with The Smiths, this album contains some of their hits too (\\"The Queen Is Dead\\", \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\", etc...). This was one of the most influential albums of the 80's and it clearly shows. Most people will really like this! Absolutely recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!

B00005AQF7|5.0|It should be no surprise to anyone that Snoop Dogg is one of the most original and unique rappers alive today. His recognizable voice and his \\"slow drawl\\" rap style are instantly distinguishable and very well liked in the rap community. He plays with the words in ways that no other rapper I know of does. He's certainly one of my favorite rappers (at least in the delivery department). This album is definitely just for rap fans as it's pretty sexist, offensive and disturbing in spots, but those with an open-mind will love it. This album, along with Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\", essentially launched the g-funk genre into critical acclaim and credibility. The entire album is very well produced, especially considering it came out in the early 90's. The lyrics aren't always the deepest things ever written, but they're always catchy, quotable and fun to listen to. Nobody can call themselves a rap fan without at least liking this album. For those who are unfamiliar with Snoop Dogg, his two hits \\"Murder Was The Case\\" and \\"Gin And Juice\\" are on here and should make it a little easier to get into. Overall I think rap fans and those with an open-mind will love this debut! This is a great party album (despite the questionable interludes)! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The first third of the movie focuses on the love story between Justin and Tessa with the political stuff in the background. Gradually, the focus changes and the political thriller takes over with the love story taking a back seat but Meirelles never loses sight of what motivates Justin's investigation and how this affects him.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz have great chemistry together and are very believable as a couple in the way they talk to each other and the intimacy between them feels very genuine. Fiennes turns in another excellent performance as a complacent diplomat whose world is turned upside down when he meets Tessa and this upheaval continues even after her death. The veteran actor conveys an emotional depth and vulnerability that makes us care about his plight. There is a scene where he learns of Tessa's death and it is a beautifully understated yet emotionally powerful one. Meirelles keeps the camera on Fiennes the entire time and we see disbelief and then grief wash over his face as he tries to keep it all contained. We empathize with his situation and want to see him expose the conspiracy that resulted in his wife's death.<br /><br />The Constant Gardener shows the complex, political quagmire that exists in Africa. While its people starve and die from disease every day, their leaders get rich from deals with powerful corporations and American and British politicians. The film sheds light on the problems that plague Africa and why it is taking so long to help these people. It points the finger at the powerful pharmaceutical companies that charge these poor, third world countries outrageous prices and then take their sweet time sending much needed medicine to them. The Constant Gardener is a finely crafted political thriller that starts off as a character piece and then becomes an absorbing thriller that asks some tough questions about what exactly is going in Africa and what is happening to those people.<br /><br />There are four deleted scenes totaling ten minutes that flesh out more details of the story and reveal more evidence of the conspiracy.<br /><br />Also included is an \\"Extended Scene: Haruma - Play in Kenya\\" that features the entire outdoor morality play that was only featured briefly in the movie.<br /><br />\\"Embracing Africa: Filming in Kenya\\" examines what it was like to shoot in Africa in many of the places that Le Carre describes in his novel and this gives the film an authenticity. The film crew worked hard not to disrupt the peoples' lives there as much as possible.<br /><br />\\"John Le Carre: From Page to Screen\\" takes a look at the source material - Le Carre's novel - and how it was adapted into a movie. Hollywood wasn't interested in it because it dealt with Africa and so it took a British movie producer who believed sincerely in the book to get it made with European money.<br /><br />Finally, there is \\"Anatomy of a Global Thriller: Behind the Scenes of The Constant Gardener\\" which is a pretty standard, yet well made press kit that mixes clips from the film with soundbites from cast and crew.leted scenes totaling ten minutes that flesh out more details of the story and reveal more evidence of the conspiracy. <br /> <br />Also included is an \\"Extended Scene: Haruma - Play in Kenya\\" that features the entire outdoor morality play that was only featured briefly in the movie. <br /> <br />\\"Embracing Africa: Filming in Kenya\\" examines what it was like to shoot in Africa in many of the places that Le Carre describes in his novel and this gives the film an authenticity.

B000000OUJ|5.0|Wu-Tang Clan is definitely one of the weirdest and most hilarious rap groups that ever existed, but that's also what makes them one of the greatest. They have a great sense of humor (as seen in their awesome Kung-Fu movie interludes), and GZA/Genius is a funny-yet-great rapper. He's not my favorite, but he's very very good (he seems friendly even though what he's talking about sometimes isn't). The beats here are fantastic, though I'm not sure who the producer actually was (I'm 50% sure it was GZA/Genius himself). The lyrics are always interesting and occasionally pretty funny - you'll definitely love listening to it all. Basically, if you're a rap fan or if you already like the Wu-Tang Clan then you're going to LOVE this album! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00079FUI6|5.0|desperate housewives became abc's breakout hit along with cult fave lost, it mixed in outrageuos humor, sudsy characters, and a mystery to keep you on edge. the show starts of with a bang when mary-alice, a housewive of wysteria lane, kills herself. this then effects her four best friends, stepford wive bree, lusty gabrielle, super mom lynette, and ditsy but loveable susan. each one dealing with diffrent problems on wysteria lane like bree's disitagrating marriage, gabrielle's affair with her hunky gardner, lynette on the verge of a meltdown from her four kids, and susan pinning over the new hot plumber. on top of all that, they must figure out why mary-alice shot herself and handle there neighboors like local slut edie, nosy mrs. hoover, and the mary-alice's strange family. the show also throughs in smart neighborhood humor that made the show really work like gabrielle mowing the lawn in a dress, lynette on kids drugs, bree being such a neat freak that it leads to hystericalle humor, and susan getting locked out of her house naked. this definently made DH one of my favorite shows that leaves me up all night thinking about its ending.
B000002572|5.0|I'll admit that \\"Boston\\" gets old after you've heard it every day of your life on mainstream radio, but does that mean it's bad? The answer is obviously no, as these are just amazing and classic songs (there's a reason this sold 17 MILLION copies). Boston didn't invent this \\"arena pop rock\\" style, but they certainly perfected it in their own way. For an album that came out in 1976 the production holds up remarkably well as everything can be heard clearly - you'll love the instrumentation. Tom Scholz is an exceptional guitar player, singer and songwriter - basically everything about him is fantastic (considering he was self-taught this makes things twice as interesting). His voice is perfect for the band's arena rock style, and most should agree. The lyrics, too, turn out to be surprisingly good instead of simply being a way to make the songs catchier. On top of all of this, every song on the album is a classic - what more could you ask for? Unless you're incredibly tired of hearing them (which is understandable if you listen to mainstream radio a lot), there's no way you won't love this album. Absolutely recommended!

0393312836|4.0|\\"Dad, have you ever heard of the book, `A Clockwork Orange'?\\" I asked my father when I received the book, A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, in the mail as my family and I sat down for dinner. \\"Kinda,\\" he responded, \\"I remembering hearing that the movie was really violent.\\" That was what persuaded me to read to book: the violence. It may sound sick and weird, but I enjoy reading books with plenty of action and some violence. But for the first time, the violence in the book actually prevented me from enjoying this book as much as I thought that I would. <br /> The book is separated into three parts. The first part immediately opens up with the narration of the main character, Alex. Alex is 15 years old and is apparently the \\"leader\\" of a gang that consists of his friends. I couldn't really figure out why Alex was the leader because each one of his friends appeared capable of being able to bring harm upon a person as much as the other. I suppose he stood out mainly because his attitude was cooler, calm, and collected than the others when he made small talk with his soon-to-be-victims. The description of how Alex and his friends commit the crimes that they do and who they do it to is the main focus in the first part, which after a few chapters, can become quite repetitive, but doesn't lose it's shock factor.  <br /> The second and third parts of the book are probably what give the book it's strength because even though they contain as much violence as the first part, they're more \\"random\\" and different as oppose to the usual find an innocent person, beat or rape them, and rob them for all they're worth. Readers also witness Alex's road to recovery from being a sick menace who lives to cause to pain to someone who gets terribly sick at the smallest thought of violence.  <br /> The book has its strong points and weak points. Since there are more weak than strong, I'll start with the weak points. For a book that was said as really easy to get into, I found it terriblydifficult to read past the first ten pages. I feel that it was because of the weird Russian slang that was constantly used. Sometimes I could read through it because I had a basic idea of what Alex was describing, but then no more than seven words later, an even more foreign word would cross my path and I'd have to stop reading, flip to the back of the book to the dictionary section, look up the word, then flip back to where I was, and then try to get back into the plot. I feel that many readers will find this incredibly frustrating at first, until they eventually get a feel for the book and won't have to look in the back as much as they used to. I also mentioned that the amount of violence in the book kept me from fully enjoying the innovative plot. There's just too much of it! It kind of takes away from the book because either it's too much for the squeamish readers or too unnecessary or repetitive for the hardcore ones. It's a good thing that Mr. Burgess didn't rely on the violence alone for the entire plot of the book, although it is one of the main factors. <br /> This brings me to discuss one of the best parts about the book, which is the plot. As an avid reader, the plot of a book can either make it or break it for me. Never before in my entire life have I ever read a plot so vivid and detailed and I suppose, eccentric is the word for it.  This book left me thinking, \\"What the Hell just happened here?\\" after every chapter. I also enjoyed how the book was separated into three parts, which is another way of separating the three main personalities and stages of Alex and his life. Another idea that I enjoyed about the book was how Alex associated classical music with violence. Classical music is often perceived as being a way for those of high society to relax and find peace. But Alex on the other hand, finds it as sort of a spark to violence and doesn't see how one can exist without the other.  <br /> All in all, I recommend this book for anyone who feels thatreading is boring and a waste of time. This plot will open up the minds of those with the emptiest imagination and show them a world of darkness and in a sense, confusion. One should read this when they have plenty of free time and won't be distracted easily, that way they won't be confused as much about what is happening and won't be easily aggravated by the common use of all the Russian slang words.    <br />
0553801503|3.0|Well after waiting a significantly longer time than expected for this book to arrive to market, I must admit I am a bit dissapointed.  The story just does not have the bite that the other books have.  It seems that Martin is setting you up for something to happen, but CONTINUOSLY!! <br />The explanation at the end as Martin indicates that he had to cut the story in half,but not in chronological order, just doesn't make much sense.  There are too many instances of references to things that have happened to other characters not to let you in on the other part of the story. <br /> <br />I suggest to anyone eagerly awaiting the continuance of the story to hold on until the second book arrives.  That way you can get the full idea of how the story moves ahead, without the splotches that this book provides.  Dissapointed!!
0385507755|5.0|If you know ANYONE who is addicted, possibly addicted, or the like, read this.  There are NO WORDS to express how you come to understand what goes on until you read the book unless you are on drugs.  I have a family member in prison for drugs and until I read this, I really had no comprehension as to what addiction could do to the mind and body.  This is a book that you can not put down.  Please recommend it.
1577314808|5.0|My father physically and verbally abused me as a child and I was still carrying around this hurt after 41 years.  I had been to therapists and read self-help books, but had never been able to get past the hurt.  One day in early 2005 while I was reflecting inwardly on this, I found true forgiveness for my father and also for myself.  This resulted in a profound spiritual transformation for me.  I felt a great burden lift and I became enveloped in a loving presence and felt a greater peace than I have ever known before.  I came to know myself at a very deep level of being.  All of my fears, worries, concerns, and negative thoughts vanished instantly.  In fact, all my thoughts pretty much vanished.  I sensed my surroundings through some sort of awareness, not through thought.  I could still relate to everyone and everything as I did before, but now it was on a much deeper level and with a much greater understanding.  I could still \\"override\\" this awareness and judge my circumstances or have negative thoughts or fears, but I knew it instantly when I had done so, because I could feel the loss of awareness and of being.  All I had to do to get back to this beautiful state of awareness is release those thoughts or emotions that took me out of that state.  In this state of awareness, I could feel this deep inner peace and a love that cannot be understood by the mind.  I allowed this awareness to guide me in everything from work to relationships, and even to my food choices.  My life began to transform before my eyes.  I had reached a state where duality did not exist.  Nothing was good or bad, right or wrong, better or worse.  It simply was.  No one could have an argument with me and nothing could disturb me.  I lived my life from moment to moment not worrying about the future, because in the short time I was in this state of awareness, it was demonstrated to me repeatedly that my needs are met even before I ask. <br /> <br />Folks, I am just a regular guy.  I am 42 yearsold and I write software for a living.  I have a family and a mortgage.  I am just like you.  I am here to tell you that the state of \\"enlightenment\\" does exist and is VERY real and it is everything Mr. Tolle says in his book, \\"The Power of Now\\".  For me, this state of awareness lasted about two weeks and those were the most wonderful two weeks I have ever spent.  I am not in that state of awareness now, but I will never forget it.  If you ever reach this state, you will know without a doubt who you really are.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch TV, as a rule, so I missed this series when it aired.  I only discovered it as a result of the Serenity movie.  I bought the TV series, and my wife and I watched every episode TWICE over a long weekend. <br /> <br />Great characters, great stories, and all-around Great Fun.  I'm buying a second set of dvd's so I'll have a loaner set for friends. <br /> <br />The episodes Out of Gas (with its flashbacks to the different crewmembers joining Mal) and Objects in Space (with its philosophizing bounty hunter) are my favorites.
6305095442|4.0|Director:  Sam Raimi <br />Cast:  Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie DePaiva, Ted Raimi, Denise Bixler, Richard Domeier, John Peaks, Lou Hancock. <br />Running Time:  85 minutes <br />Rated R for extreme violence, language, and nudity. <br /> <br />Our hero Ash returns in this 1987 blood bath of a follow-up to \\"The Evil Dead\\". The king of slapstick horror does a bang up job of combining laughs and plenty of gore to create one of the most memorable and beloved horror sequels of all time. What some people may or may not know is, the movie, intended to be a sequel, was actually a revisited version of the first film. In this version, Ash (Bruce Campbell) returns to the dreaded cabin in the woods with only his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) and his infamous Oldsmobile. What was meant to be a quiet, relaxing get-a-way in the woods suddenly explodes into a bloody night of survival when Ash is forced to do battle with the evil that lies within the woods. Possessed trees, zombie mothers, and one demonic hand all set the stage for Ash as he risks life and limb (literally) to make it through the night. Joined later by Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry), the daughter of Professor Raymond Knowby (the man who unlocked the mysteries of the book of the dead), Ed Getly, (Richard Domeier), and two wanderers Bobby Joe (Kassie Depaiva) and Jake (Dan Hicks) Ash and his crew must survive the night, or be dead by dawn. <br /> <br />Despite that fact that Sam Raimi is now a \\"proper\\" director making summer blockbusters like his life depended on it, it is still heartening to see that his frenzied style is still present in his work, albeit it not dealing with such extreme material as that which made his name famous decades ago. While Evil Dead II may be a complete repeat of Evil Dead in terms of the basic narrative and content, it is still worth seeing because of Raimi's skill as director and writer of the film.  Horror fans may find it a little tame by modern standards although I stillfound it to be pretty scary and gory - certainly considering it was made almost 20 years ago with a budget that would barely buy you an A-listed movie star these days. The film is also pretty funny and is full of dark humor and comic moments that make it more entertaining than a gory b-movie has any right being. But here's the thing, the success of this film and indeed the whole trilogy, is mainly due to two people - Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Raimi drives everything with his unique direction that places the action somewhere between a horror and a cartoon. It has great camera work, frantic shots and a real flair for the unreal; it is very hard to describe but it can be seen it many of his films. <br /> <br />Campbell's ongoing cult status has only been helped recently by Bubba Ho-tep but this is where it basically began and part II only sees his continue his good work as Ash becomes more of a hero than he was in the first film. He still has the cowardly quality that I loved in Ash but now has weapons and kiss-off lines to compliment his new status. As before his performance perfectly matches Raimi's direction and I can totally understand why the two have kept their close relationship decades later; they really seem to \\"get\\" each other here. Support from Berry, Hicks, DePaiva, Domeier and Bixler is just about passable for this type of b-movie stuff but really the cast is dominated by Campbell playing his best character to date.  Overall, this is a gory, cheap horror movie that won't appeal to everybody but to those that get it, it will be a hugely enjoyable, gory film with a great sense of humor. Director Raimi and actor Campbell truly makes the film work better than the material would suggest it should and, on the basis of any of the three films, it is no wonder that this is such a timeless cult horror.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|This movie was one of the worst movies of the last 5 years. It stands with 'alone in the dark' as pure hollywood garbage. It is a lame rehash of Indiana Jones, The Mummy, and any other 80's adventure/treasure movie ever made.  I laughed so hard at how lame it was, and then realized that it will one day be on a mystery science theater episode. Yuck!
B0009W5JS2|4.0|First of all, I would like to point out that I haven't seen the first one yet so I can't compare the second one from the first movie, but lighten up people! Movies aren't about reality they are for entertainment purposes only. If you want reality, try watching movies about dead actors or some other famous person. You could try watching the Discovery Channel. My point is, fiction movies are not to be taken literally. For example, the movie, She's All That, let's be realistic here, you would never find the most popular guy dating a geek. It doesn't happen. But the movie was still a good movie to me. Everyone is entitled to their opinion when you do state it, but bear in mind that action movies are just like any other movie, they are fiction. Personally, I thought the movie was a great action movie and in my opinion you've seen one action movie you have seen them all. There is your reality. Some may have more sex in it others may have more things blowing up. Here is what I say, don't listen to what others say about the movie, watch it yourself and form your own opinion. There are some movies people like and some that people don't. I hope this review was helpful.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I wanted not to like it, because I am one of those people too cool to like what everybody else likes, but she got me.  No she is not a singer; she is an entertainer of the highest caliber upon whom all others are judged and compared to. <br /> <br />Go 'head Madge, for those of us who grew up with you and still like you well into our thirties!
0671027344|5.0|When I moved, I had dinner with one of my really close friends and he gave me this book. I wasn't really interested in reading it, but because he got it for me and was so excited about me reading it, I started it. I started reading it on the plane, but couldnt get into it, so I started another book. I had finished all my other books and started this one again and it didn't seem to take any time at all. I LOVED IT!!!!! It is not really a book I would choose to read, but Im glad I did. It really reminded me of a close friend I used to have and it was funny to see Charley kind of transform just as my friend did. I recomend it to everyone!
0780020685|5.0|No doubt, Akira Kurosawa is one of the greatest directors of all time. He not only made films like this, but inspired many directors to make more films based off his stories. This is a must own film, everyone should have it in their collection. The full frame aspect is correct as this was done before widescreen was standard in Japan.
B000067J1H|5.0|...you give it 5 stars when rating it on Amazon.com.  Filmmaking at its best.  For those who appreciate the full cinematic experience, you won't be disappointed by this masterpiece.  Let me tell you why you should own this film: 1) It ranks at the high end of the \\"re-watchability\\" scale; 2) it has the most dramatic lighting effects, which give it an exceptionally eerie feel; 3) it makes disturbingly great use of blood and gore; 4) the acting (as well as Norton's narration) is superbly convincing; 5) this film will PLAY WITH YOUR MIND for days after watching it for the first time; 6) There are at least 3 parts (for me, at least), which make you take a step back and examine your own life; and 7) this is a movie that MUST be watched with the Director's/Actors' commentary for the second pass.  Overall, this film affected me in a way that few films have the ability to.  Note: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN.  Seriously, folks.  Please feel free to disagree with my opinion; let us compare opinions, invite a few more points of view, and debate, like the humans we are.
B000286RNY|5.0|Definitly Stephen Chow's best film. I have to admit I didn't really enjoy Kung Fu Hustle as much as some. I miss the old Stephen Chow and love his older films such as God of Cookery, 60 Million Dollar Man, and Beijing with Love. Shaolin Soccer is right along the same lines. Very funny, and very well done. Miramax actually did a good job with this DVD, as it includes the original uncut version, and the dubbed version. They even included scenes not on the Hong Kong DVD like the dance scene. Very recommended!
B0002S94OS|2.0|In listening to this album, I was anxious, because I had heard so much about how Lamb of God was the next great metal band. <br />Yeah, the music is good, but why is it that metal fans have decided to listen to numerous clones of metal bands with singers who try to sound like Phil Anselmo?  The growling vocals are soooooo repetitive in every single metal band out there, and I don't see how metal fans can think its cool. <br />Back when metal was king, you can't tell me that Dave Mustaine, Tom Araya, and James Hetfield all sounded the same.  Now all metal sounds the same, and it makes me sick.  Metal is dead, and I have heard absolutely nothing from Lamb of God that makes me feel any differently.  I am a Metal fan, but I refuse to fall into the mindless zombified flock of sheep that will settle for the same thing over and over. This album does sound like thrash metal, I will admit that, but the lousy vocals just take so much away from it.  Am I the only one that thinks it no longer takes talent to be a metal singer???  <br />Metal will never be what it was again. <br />I definitely do NOT recommend this Lamb of God album.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I first watched this film when I ordered the 2 Disc set from Korea. I went into the film knowing little about the story. I had read that it was a must see film, and just so I wouldn't spoil the experience I read nothing else. This film is amazing. It may sound boring from the overall description, but it's not. If you are easily offended, I don't think I could recommended it to you. But if you aren't afraid, check it out and be amazed like everyone else who has seen it.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|I have loved this movie since early childhood.  But I was a little disappointed in the Special Anniversary Edition of the DVD.<br /><br />There is a nice little extra feature with Aileen Quinn, but I wish it had been longer and more in-depth.  The rest of the extra features were pretty useless and uninteresting to anyone over the age of about 5 (granted, this movie is for kids...).<br /><br />My biggest complaint, besides the lack of SPECIAL features, is the fact that the language dubbing doesn't match the closed captioning.  If I put on closed captioning in Spanish, it translates the English version of the movie.  But if I switch the audio to Spanish, it doesn't match the captioning- the songs are completely different in Spanish, and I'd like to know the words to them in other languages, but the dubbing isn't of a quality high enough to be able to decipher anything over the music.  And the captioning offers no help at all.<br /><br />Because that's such a bizarre complaint, and most people won't notice or care, I'm still giving it 3 stars- great movie, one of the special features was interesting.
B00066VUPM|3.0|I really can't imagine how anyone is passionate about having all of this band's albums.  It's not so much that they're bad, just kind of forgettable.  The songs tend to drag along at the same mellow mid-tempo and there aren't too many memorable hooks.  Realistically, all I or any other casual listener needs is a CD with \\"Sing\\" and \\"Why Does it Always Rain on Me?\\" with a a few random highlights.  All of that is on this collection... and then some.  Eighteen tracks is just too much when all of the songs have the same kind of adult contemporary, ready-for-VH1 feel to them.  And there are other songs on here other than the aforementioned two that are pretty good.  The problem is that there is just too much unnecessary stuff on here.  At least Coldplay had one decent album; I can't imagine listening to a whole Travis album in one sitting.  It's OK though; I think a lot of listeners will upload the two or three songs they like to the mp3 player and take this one to the retail shop.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|This album is very good musically, but it is almost just too goofy for me. I guess it is their thing to try and be goofy and have lyrics that sometimes are just stupid (even if they do mean something beyond the stupidity). I liked parts of this album that were more dark sounding and not so giddy and yelling about cocks or anything, but that is just my opinion. I would still buy this album just because the guitar work is great. I really liked the songs Question, Sad Statue, and Lost in Hollywood. There were a few other good songs but nothing great.
B000000OTU|2.0|Aerosmith is basically another mediocre, radio-friendly pop band that would have thankfully faded away if it wasn't for the Rap/Rock group Run D.M.C. redoing one of their songs, \\"Walk this Way\\", in the 90s.  Aerosmith owes alot of their success to Run D.M.C., and I doubt they could have made it this far on their own without having been part of the first rap-rock song hybrid, which was originated by RUN D.M.C.<br />Albeit, if you are an Old burn-out living paycheck to paycheck then this album is probably for you.
B00025ETIW|5.0|The passion, energy and depth of this album is irreplaceable. Nothing captures the emotional storm of my own work in philosophy, like this does. The composition is tight, the hooks are marvelous and stick in your head for days. The feelings are a \\"passion in tragedy\\" torn out of you, and if you've been alive at all, you've felt them in tandem with the highest feelings we  can reach. <br /> <br />How wonderful it is to find such expression; it nourishes my soul for all I've suffered, in pursuit of all I've accomplished. For those who've read Moral Armor, (.com), this takes honors in Rock for Self-Made Man's artistic pinnacle. Can't wait for the new release!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Shortly after the release of Born to Run, and having become a devout Springsteen fan, I bought a ticket for his first-ever concert in the Twin Cities. Fate conspired to keep me from attending, and I sadly handed my ticket to my sister. The concert rendered her speechless. She tried her best to describe what it was that she had experienced, but ultimately said \\"you just had to be there.\\" We've both been to subsequent concerts, and while he never fails to deliver, my sister has said they aren't the same as what she saw back in the mid 70's. How could they be? Different man, different songs, different times.<br /><br />Today I watched the concert DVD, and I finally think I have an inkling of what she saw. For anyone who wants to experience the raw, nascent talent of that time, this is a must-see. I am so glad to have this glimpse of something I always regretted missing the first time around. Thanks, Bruce.
0072373350|4.0|This book needs a good professor to go along with it. The examples have little to do with many things in the text and the book fails to emphasize which concepts are the most important.
B000BO0LKY|3.0|i can't even install this damn software:DVDacess, to access mariah's interview!! can't they made this DVD easier? like gorillaz DVD is so easy to access!! no software needed to be installed. wasted 1.5 hr of my life to figure out a way! damn it!! bloody stupid software engineers created this crap!
B0007Y4USW|1.0|Wow, this music sure is generic & pointless.  Here's a little tip for all the \\"music fans\\" out there, don't buy a cd because you like the way a singer looks, just download their pictures off the internet & save some money.
0060825219|5.0|I had never read any of Coelho's novels until it was presented to me recently.  I have to admit, I didn't like the character and found his obsession with himself annoying...but then the wisdom and wonder began and Coelho pulled me in to a world filled with the explorations of what it truly means to \\"know\\" someone that you love and to know the parts of yourself that need nourishment too.  It proved that we can do this together as a couple if there is enough love and commitment and a desire to let the other be free.
B000099T2L|1.0|Just what the world needs, more generic r&b.
B0000634EV|3.0|Like Down's legendary debut, \\"A Bustle In Your Hedgerow\\" (which helped to increase the likeliness of Pantera's break-up) has plenty of meaty, sludgy, Sabbath-indebted riffs. But, unlike \\"Nola,\\" this album has a southern/country music flavor to it. This means that this album draws upon the band's Lynyrd Skynyrd influences for some prog-ish, acoustic guitar noodling in some of the songs, thus making this disc quite a bit more mellow.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, country music and doom metal don't mix well; almost all of the melodic songs on here are disastrous. In addition to killing the album's momentum, songs like \\"There's Something On My Side,\\" \\"Ghosts Along the Mississippi,\\" \\"Dog Tired,\\" and \\"Landing on the Mountains of Meggido\\" are really boring because they're repetitive, overly long, and don't really go anywhere or get off the ground like they should. And, to be frank, some of the ballads just flat-out suck! \\"Stained Glass Cross,\\" \\"Where I'm Going,\\" and especially the atrocious (and ironically titled) sixth track (\\"Learn From This Mistake\\") are all definite reasons why there is a \\"skip\\" button on your C.D. player.<br /><br />Track twelve, the laid back and bluesy \\"Lies, I Don't Know What They Say But,\\" which kind of sounds like Pantera's cover of \\"Planet Caravan,\\" is the only decent melodic song on here.<br /><br />The heavy songs (which compile about half of this album) sound pretty great, however, and will renew your faith in Down. When Phil puts his crooning voice aside to howl on tracks three, seven, and thirteen, his vocals sound top-notch. Plus, tracks one, three, ten, eleven, and thirteen all prove that these metal veterans can still rock profusely and effectively. The first track, \\"Lysergik Funeral Procession,\\" is very sludgy, whereas \\"The Man That Follows Hell\\" boasts a rumbling, churning groove and a wah-wah solo, and \\"New Orleans Is A Dying Wh-re\\" ties together chunky riffs and a lurching rhythm with violent, growly vocals. Next, \\"The Seed\\" has grinding, stutter-stepping riffs, and the thirteenth track, \\"Flambeaux's Jamming With St. Aug,\\" is a crunchy churning rhythm.<br /><br />So, \\"A Bustle In Your Hedgerow\\" is a hit or miss album. It has its ups and downs, but it ultimately averages out to become an OK C.D. If you're a sludge/doom metal fan, or if you're a Phil Anselmo or Pepper Keenan diehard, you`ll want to pick this up. The rest of you metalheads should still definitely hear this album (and maybe download or burn the heavy songs), but be careful about what you're buying.g riffs, and the thirteenth track, \\"Flambeaux's Jamming With St. Aug,\\" is a crunchy churning rhythm.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|Despite the fact that I love Aerials, Toxicity, Chop suey, I never bought a SOAD album before this one.  They were screaming too much for me. Now they have found the right balance between the two vocalists (the beauty being Serj and the beast Daron).    My favorite song on this one is \\"Soldier side\\". I'll buy myself an electric mandolin just to do that song. In second comes \\"Holy mountains\\", to be listen very loud just to hear that scary \\"can you hear feel their haunting presence\\".  \\"Hypnotize\\" is third, but was the reason why I have asked for this album.  The beggining of \\"Kill rock'n roll\\" make me think of \\"Joy division\\"???  I love all songs except maybe \\"Stealing society\\" wich I find very average.    What I like the most about them, is their shifting beauty and beast mood.  They go from absolutely georgous to angry metal.
B00003BDXG|5.0|I've seen this movie only once, but found it to be disturbingly insightful and honest.  The movie, behind a screen of unapologetic violence shows the effects of media on how we view the world.  If you're normally squeemish about violence in movies (and i am) you might have a difficult time sitting through it.  However, i found that the violence was so \\"cartoony\\" that it hardly phased me.  This is possibly part of the point Stone might have been trying to make about media desensitization (sp?).   <br /> <br />A lot of people have a problem with the movie, calling it a glorification of violence.  I would counter by saying that this movie glorifies violence to make its point about the atrocities of violence.  I would also say that movies like \\"Face off,\\" and \\"Die Hard\\" do more to glorify violence than \\"Natural Born Killers\\" ever will.  Please feel free to email me with your responses to this review. <br />nick.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The Strokes came on the music scene ablazing with 2001's \\"Is This It\\", one of those perfect \\"once-in-a-blue-moon\\" debut albums. 2003's \\"Room on Fire\\" was a far too predictable sequel to \\"Is This\\" and thus a disappointment, while pleasant in its own right at times. But it was clear that the Strokes needed to expand their musical pallet. And that, they have!<br /><br />\\"First Impressions of Earth\\" (14 tracks; 52 min.--and that's not a typo!) feels like the first really full album of the Strokes, and not just because of the length of it. Singer-songwriter Julian Casablancas is not rushing songs, instead taking the time to let them blossom musically. I divide the album in 2 halves: songs 1-7 and 8-14. While many feel that the stronger songs appear on the first half, I actually feel differently. Not that the first half is weak. Songs like \\"You Only Live Once\\", \\"Heart in a Cage\\", \\"Razorblade\\" (with the eye-wink to Barry Manilow's Mandy!) and \\"On the Other Side\\" are great songs. \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is a curiosity: just Julian and orchestral instrumentation, if you can believe that. But then the album really takes off: \\"Electricityscape\\" blasts through your speakers with urgency, and you just want to play it again and again. Same with \\"Ize of the World\\", the other truly outstanding track on here. \\"Fear of Sleep\\", \\"Killing Lies\\" and \\"Evening Sun\\" are almost as perfect too. Wow!<br /><br />If you came looking for a third serving of \\"Is This It\\", there is no question you will find this a difficult, if not disappointing, album. I, on the other hand, am excited that the Strokes have matured and expanded musically. \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" is a tremedous, almost epical, musical statement. The Strokes have thrown the gaunlet down early for the best album of 2006. It'll be interesting to see who, if anyone, can respond to the challenge...
0060763280|2.0|As a disclosure, I did not read this book in its entirety nor in numerical order.  I flipped through content in random.  This book does not live up to its title.  Makes numorous references to its seminars that they want you to go to.  One of its declarations is that \\"Rich people are bigger than their problems. Poor people are smaller than their problems.\\"  -and my take on that is Rich people can afford to be bigger than their problems.  Most things mentioned are common sense, no big secrets are disclosed.  I don't want to discourage you from reading it, it may  help you attain wealth but I wish I hadn't bought it.  I think The Millionaire Next Door is a better read.  My secret of the Thousanaire Mind - It takes money to make money.  You heard it here first!
B00005JOFO|4.0|In a town that could not be smaller and under a sky that could not be greater, Ennis and Jack find each other.  Out of work cattle hands, both make their way to the same rancher's office.  They get assigned to Brokeback Mountain, wrangling a herd of sheep so large it seems to stretch from Texas to Canada.   After many weeks with only each other's companionship and one night of heavy drinking, the two suddenly and violently have sex.      I assume viewers know that is coming, as much as they knew Jesus was doomed in Mel Gibson's picture.  Brokeback Mountain has already become a cultural phenomenon as \\"the gay cowboy\\" film, so everyone knows the two will eventually play \\"hide the lasso\\".  Two things about that introduction surprised me.  First, I did not expect the shepherding to be presently so beautifully.  The two men and the endless herd of sheep echoes the relationship of Gus and Call from Lonesome Dove (another story penned by Larry McMurtry) as they drive cattle to Montana.  The vistas fill the screen with a world of infinite space and glory, with two little cowboys as only specs hidden among the evergreens and icy ponds.       The second surprise for me was the lack of tenderness in their relationship before they had sex.   Someone not expecting them to become lovers will be shocked, as nothing suggests they have those feelings.  They just wake up in the middle of the night and go at it.   Maybe that's a heterosexual's opinion, because if one of the boys had been camped out with Natalie Portman that long, I would have expected some action much sooner.      The film suggests this isn't Jack's first rodeo (apropos because he does ride bulls).  Although the lines between classifications blur, Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) seems to be easy to identify as a bi-sexual.   He has relationships (and just sex) with other men during the film, but as with Ennis, he also goes on to marry, have children and enjoy sex with women enough to cheat on his wife with other females.The enigmatic Ennis (Heath Ledger) shatters labels.  He seems to be a straight male who also likes to have sex with Jack...just Jack.    He is uninterested in other men, and viewers may assume he would never have stumbled into another homosexual relationship had Jack not sought him out.   Is it just that he loves Jack?  Maybe.  But he also seems almost content without him.     This love/hate relationship Ennis has for Jack will lead some to view Jack as an instigator, and he clearly isn't as sympathetic as Ennis (Gene Shalit recently described him as a sexual predator, which isn't a baseless accusation).  Ennis is hard to understand completely, everything he does contradicts something else.  He's obviously torn and seems to allow that indecisiveness to contribute to more pain for himself and others.      Clearly, the film sees the tragedy in homophobia.  These two men love each other, but they are unable to be together, to spend their lives as happy as those nights on Brokeback Mountain.  But the film also shows how the pain is not exclusive to the men.  Families are ruined, and women are left believing they are somehow inadequate.    This idea seems to be as much a swipe against gays who try to live as straight males as against homophobia.      I found the middle part of the film to be a bit long.  Doom was obviously approaching, and it took a little too long to arrive.  One less summer on Brokeback Mountain and one less jilted female could have made for a more thrifty and enjoyable narrative.      MILD SPOILERS AHEAD:    The ending was surprisingly touching for me.  It ends with the two destined to never see each other again.  In a search for truth and closure, one of the men seeks out the family of the other and hears how his lover used to speak of the love they shared.   Hearing those romanticized visions of what could have been juxtaposes against the reality of their world, one that would never accept the men for who they were.  A Romeo and Juilet for the 21stCentury?  Maybe.      I liked this film more than I expected, but what I won't like will be the beast it will become.   In the next few months, as it breaks the bank at the box office and wins everything from the Oscars to the MTV Awards, the film will become the bible of the gay rights movement.  Those of us who don't follow their platform will be paralleled to the Randy Quaid character, evil in all ways, including his homophobia.   Those like Shalit who see problems with the film will be shouted down, as dissent will not be tolerated.  You can either love this film or you can be classified as a bigoted homophobe.  That idea frightens me.
B00005JNSK|1.0|This movie was actually pretty good up untill Johnny Depps performance! Don't get me wrong I think he is a good actor but his performance was horrible in this movie. When will hollywood learn and leave classic movie alone and stop making them into S**t movies. Plain and simple: THIS MOVIE SUCKED!
B0002234LS|1.0|This movie has the same lousy plot of another King movie/story, The Night Flyer (1998). The director and actors did the best they could, but ultimately the story just collapses. Avoid.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|Some action, intrugue, and humor.  Overall a very good kids movie that the parents can sit through and enjoy as well.  Good acting and a good storyline that keeps you involved to the end.  Highly recommended for just about anyone.
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|I agree with most of the people saying that this cd was a disappointment. It is. I first heard juicebox, and although its a good song, it was an odd choice for a single. I've listened to this cd all the way through about 5 or 6 times, and just can never get into it. I have their first two cds, and love them. They're last 2 are genuis compared to this. Now, its not an awful album, its just not nearly as good as their last 2. About 4 songs are great, 7 are ok, and the rest are awful. A lot of the songs just dont have the same catchy hooks and beats as heard in reptilla on room on fire. It seems like they tried to do something new, but it just falls flat, and gets boring after the first 4 songs. What a way to start out the new year. I honestly hope this year is better than last year for music, but its not off to a good start.
B000088DTS|5.0|This is an album in which grows on yo0h. I love the fact that Delta sings purely from her heart one hundred precent. Her voice is so pure , no machines just her her instruments etc. But don't be fulled guys. Her albums ballads are ballads you can sing and dance along to then their are the songs which are funky like predictable running away. Her album is so versatile and pure hearted. It sorta sets her apart from the rest , she writes and produces some of her own songs which is why this album is totally her. Her her her no fakeness. Do i hear paris hilton? It's a really lovely albun to listen to while your down or you have friends around or when your like cleaning. The lyrics touch me and their those lovely songs which your oldies n you can both love . Delta is a massive phenomenon she can tackle all sorts of music from rock , to pop to metal to jazz. It's true! Guys just hope you enjoy this album its lovely and warm to listen to.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I love Coldplay to death and this album is, in my opinion the best so far.  Coldplay is one of the great bands of this generation.  Listening to \\"Fix You\\" totally gives me chills. <br /> <br />However, you should be aware that the CD may come with some pretty heinous DRM and no return policy if you don't like it.  Find out more here: <br /> <br />[...]
B0006IF92U|5.0|For that other person who somewhat said you rate it 5 stars just for the cover well you have no heart do you? This is an album in which its deep and dark and not as light hearted as innocent eyes. When you get pissed listen to it you can sing along with the words it will make you feel better. It's really melodical but theirs still the sassy and crazy songs and then theirs the ballads but all of them are probably so much more darker but still their not dark and droopy their so much song arrangements and lovliness in the album  , theirs songs like a little too late really boppy and then their the hidden song which is literally hidden its 2 minutes after the last song , and its really gothic and then theirs the sassy ones electric strom , the deep one Extraordinary day etc, I love delta and this album really made me think. Thanks Delta you should know your rating on amazon are really good. Love ya heapies.... >&lt;\\"
0393327655|3.0|I did not read the book in its entirety because I was more interested in the argumentation the author would give for his position.   <br /> <br />His empirical attack against faith seemed valid, but if you flip towards the back of the book, chapter 6, under a section titled, \\"Intuition,\\" you may find some disturbing opinions. <br /> <br />Here's a passage from the book I wish to comment about: <br /> <br />\\"Whatever its stigma, \\"intuition\\" is a term that we simply cannot do without, because it denotes the most basic constituent of our faculty of understanding.  While this is true in matters of ethics, it is no less true in science.  When we can break our knowledge of a thing down no further, the irreducible leap that remains is intuitively taken.  Thus, the traditional opposition between reason and intuition is a false one:  reason is itself intuitive to the core, as any judgment that a proposition is \\"reasonable\\" or \\"logical\\" relies on intuition to find its feet\\" (pg 185). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, in the attempt to abolish faith he merely provides a foundation for it.  According to the above passage, if faith (i.e. and \\"intuitive leap\\") is required for reason, then faith is applicable to everything where reason is. <br /> <br />However, I will point out that there is no \\"intuitive leap\\" required to understand axioms.  If one chooses to live, one must perforce accept the axioms--Existence, Consciousness, and Identity.  In any attempt to deny, obfuscate, or abolish an axiom, one must first accept its truthfulness (or existence).  This acceptance ISN'T an \\"intuitive leap;\\" but rather, an implicit choice one makes if one continues to live.
B000BWI9U0|3.0|Damn, what a bummer.  As a few other reviewers have noted, it definitely sounds as if The Strokes had their eyes set on mainstream radio.  Everything sounds so clean and glossy...which isn't a good thing.  The production is way too slick, and the lack of that was part of the charm of the first two LP's.<br /><br />The high-volume dual guitars of Hammond Jr. and Valensi are really minimized here and on some tracks placed way in the back of the mix.  WHY?!  That is what got them on the cover of Guitar World magazine in the first place.  I remember when I downloaded \\"Juicebox\\" off the official site in November...I was scared...really scared...because I really didn't like it at all.<br /><br />Now, I find myself skipping more than half of the tracks.<br /><br />The B-side to Juicebox is \\"Hawaii,\\" which is what I LOVE about this band.  Fast, sorta nonsensical with driving guitar rhythms and a great hook.  The B-side is the opposite of most of this LP.<br /><br />I am still gonna see them when they hit the clubs in my area, but I just hope they won't play much off First Impressions....  Give Gordon control again!
B00005N91B|5.0|I love this movie. Sharon Stone use-to be one of the most sexyest women in the world, now she's just old & wreakly. Michael Douglas's performances was great as well. This film has suspense, high tension, catchy and memorable dialogues, great actors, fabulous music score and an excellent director who didn't get scared off by protestors and other hypocrites in my mind, people who watch this movie are ment to be mature, thus denying sex is either hypocritical prudish. The sex scenes are just a few minutes long, (what a bumer).
B000002KXV|5.0|This is a great CD. You can close your`e eyes when you listen to and it will fill your`e soul with happines and pure energy. Technicalwise this is way above much of the other stuff modern so called quality music when it come`s to so called hi-fidelity sound or sorround sound. This one sounds good on a lousy Hi Fi system, because the overall quality of each track. Track 1 IGY realy put`s your`e soul in gear with the laidback jazzy blueeeesy mood. This is \\"urban big city\\" music under the stars. Every track put`s you up on a higer level so you belive in angels (if you dont belive in them before) . There are so many highpoints on this CD. Track 5 The uptempo New Frontier is one of those, which realy stand up as an original and great song.<br /><br />The titletrack 6 The Nightfly has also that quality mark on it.<br /><br /> Sorry to say. This CD is a great listening all trough. So good that the word`s stops sometimes. It`s a great joy to listen to a perfect production by Gary Katz. The echo of Steely Dan shines trough on most of the tracks, and this must be every studioproducers dream to produce a CD like this one. Pure soul magic by Donald Fagen. Should have been a 6 star, but the rating stops by 5. Nothing to do about that.
B000BNI90O|4.0|I picked this up because I am a big fan of the earlier CD releases of Howard Shore's scores for the Lord of the Rings films. If there is one aspect of the films that will age very well, it is Shore's brilliant soundtrack. I believe orchestras will be performing this work in years to come. As some reviewers have mentioned, the booklet that comes with the CDs is excellent, and has a great exposition on the various motifs found in the score, and how they reappear and merge and change over the course of the film. It is, as one reviewer commented, an education in film scoring in and of itself.    I had no trouble importing the CD content with iTunes. The artwork, box, and enclosed snap-in trays holding the CDs are all nicely done, although the package is somewhat fragile and I have had to tape together a torn corner already.    The enclosed DVD is a bit troublesome, though, for several reasons, some of which are within the control of the people designing this boxed set, and some which aren't.    Because it contains the entire score in multiple formats with better audio quality than a standard CD can hold, it is the most valuable part of the set. Yet it is not enclosed in a protective tray like the CDs: instead, the cover of the faux-book box has a cutout with a rubber nub glued on it, and the DVD is stuck onto the nub. It is somewhat unprotected against scratches in this configuration; keep in mind that even rubbing against cardboard can scratch a CD or DVD. The set must involve hand-assembly, and the rubber nub on my set was not properly centered in the cover, and so after removal I could not re-insert the DVD until I peeled off the nub and centered it, which tore up the inside cover somewhat. It is difficult to put the DVD back onto the nub. The second time I removed the DVD, the nub tore off completely, so I wound up just throwing out the nub and sticking the DVD into a vinyl CD sleeve of my own, which I put in the box. The DVD now has a number of fine scratches, andalthough this doesn't seem to affect playback.    It is frustrating to have such a beautiful piece of packaging that is so dysfunctional! I understand the reason for treating the DVD separately, because of the fragility of the spindle holes in DVDs, but this solution doesn't work well. Since I plan to buy the complete scores for The Two Towers and Return of the King if and when they become available, I hope that the people producing the packaging for those boxed sets come up with a better solution. The DVD needs better protection and a place of honor in the set, especially since it is difficult or not possible to back it up by \\"ripping\\" it. Let me elaborate.    Prospective buyers should be aware that DVD audio is not well-supported on as many platforms as CD audio. This is a general problem in the \\"format wars\\" -- there is not a clear winner in the category of better-than-CD audio formats.    My Sony DVD player will play two of the four versions -- I'm not sure which -- but unlike an audio CD, which will play automatically, it is necessary to use the remote control and on-screen menus to pick the mix and start playing the content; you can't just hit play or navigate with the track buttons on the DVD player. That's annoying, given that this is not a movie.    As other reviewers have pointed out, the score on DVD audio sounds fantastic -- the improvement in dynamic range is noticeable esepcially at higher volumes. The content is terrific, too. Whether in the higher-resolution format or plain old CD (does anyone remeber when CD meant \\"perfect audio forever?\\"), the new pieces are great, particularly the Celtic-sounding jig \\"Flaming Red Hair\\" and the haunting choral piece \\"The Passing of the Elves.\\" The additional content is definitely not filler! After listening to this, the original soundtrack album sounds like a Cliff's Notes or highly abridged edition by comparison. I can't wait to hear the next films.    Like many people these days I do just about all of my listening via iTunes and put away my actual CDs to keep them safe. If I don't have the audio ripped, I often just put in the CD and listen to it on a PC or Macintosh while I work. It is problematic to try to use DVD-Audio format material this way. My brand-new Dell PC at work will not play the DVD audio at all, even though it has a DVD drive.    DVD-Audio is copy protected. It may be possible to use some devious software to import the higher-resolution audio tracks into iTunes, and I am looking into this, but it is not supported by default, and the typical computer is not guaranteed to generate clean playback of 24-bit audio (my Airport Express, for example, apparently won't do it, even though iTunes will allegedly support the 24-bit files). If I can't figure out how to import it myself, I will try to find a way to download (that is, \\"pirate\\" or \\"steal\\") an iTunes-importable version of the high-resolution audio data I just paid a lot of money to listen to, so that I can listen to it when and where I want to.    Fortunately you don't need to rely on the DVD to listen to the content. Depending on your usage patterns and how you feel about copy protection, it may be best to consider the DVD an interesting curiosity, and not the mainstay of the boxed set. It is unfortunate that there isn't a widely usable higher-resolution standard, and the \\"format wars\\" also raises the irritating possibility that there may be yet another better-sounding release of this music in the future, on SACD or Blu-Ray or X-Ray or whatever. The next scores had better also come on CD, because I will not knowingly purchase content released in only a copy-protected format, although I would love to have a better format that met my usage patterns and did not take away my rights to use the content I paid for. I've already purchased all three of the original soundtrack albums, and have now purchased this premium offering. As Kay says in _Men in Black_, \\"So now I gotta buy the White Album again?\\" There's anothersaying that also might apply: \\"fool me twice -- shame on me.\\"
0783114893|5.0|A few quick remarks: this is not a horror movie, this is not a remake or tribute to Spielberg's \\"Duel\\" and this movie works precisely because it does not fall neatly into such categories. <br /> <br />The movie's screenplay was said by it's author to have been inspired by the Doors/Jim Morrison's song, \\"Riders on the Storm\\".  One recurring element throughout Morrison's poetry is images of the desert.  Another recurring element in Morrison's poetry is the significance of myth in human life. <br /> <br />So considering the above, the success of the movie is due to the \\"mythical\\" qualities of the screenplay's story and characters combined with superior acting, an excellent and complimentary soundtrack by Mark Isham and vivid and well crafted on location photography. <br /> <br />As for the meaning and philosophical/mythical metaphors of the film, you'll have to e-mail me.  An above average, interesting and unsettling film, if you don't see the quality here, I'd say you just don't get it. <br /> <br />
B00004XOWM|3.0|much like several other artists, particularly rappers who dont rhyme (petey pablo, im talkin about you) but somehow you end up drunk at the bar putting in 50 cents to hear a song that sober you complain about the lyrical content this album is a guilty pleasure.  is it good? not at all.  have i listened to many of the tracks more times than i would ever be willing to admit in polite company? sadly, yes.  if you want something that will amaze you from a lyrical standpoint, pick up something else: Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, or Rage Against the Machine all fit the bill.  if you want something for its musical genious, this album is not for you: Hendrix, Tool, Nirvana, Soundgarden or Pink Floyd would do you better.  however, if you want the musical equivalent of watching Demolition Man or getting drunk with your high school buddies off of liquor you swiped from your parents (ie, fun, stupid, guaranteed to make for embarassing stories, and somehow fantastic) pick it up. what can i say, its amusing.  (by the way, Sly rules)
B000065VB0|5.0|This is the culmination of everything learned about art/prog and new wave throughout history up to 1980, set to practical use.  Just about everybody of consequence short of P. Hammill was put to work on this album.  It is the aural equivalent of, say, the architect Gordon Bunshaft's Lever House in its own time. <br /> <br />Maybe better than Miles Davis's \\"Tribute to Jack Johnson\\" or Emerson Lake and Palmer's \\"Brain Salad Surgery.\\"  Better than even \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway?\\"  Probably.
B00003CWPL|1.0|I saw this movie about 20 years ago at a theatre. I really did not like it then, but it always sticks out in my mind, so that whenever asked, \\"What was the least favorite film you ever saw\\"?...Eraserhead immediately comes to mind...Just can't bring myself to watch it again to see if time has changed my outlook.<br /><br />Must have something going for it since a few people say they thought it was great..I have enjoyed other work by David Lynch,<br /><br />but just not this one. When I picture the movie poster all I see<br /><br />is a younger Don King...
B000C65Z1G|2.0|I LOVE Ralph Fiennes & I loved the English Patient, but I was very disappointed by this movie in the theater. He's wonderful, but too long, too depressing, and it seemed like there was no real chemistry (the're in love, but you don't really understand why or how). I'll continue to watch all of his films, but if considering buying.......pass!
B00030590I|5.0|Hero is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.<br /><br />While a story framework exists (a classic tale of the First Emperor's war to unite China told with a unique twist on the famed Rashamon device of layers stories; an almost chess-match like conversation between Jet Li's Nameless and the man who would be First Emperor) it serves mainly to enable a literal palette of martial confrontation, beautifully choreographed fights in both the Hong Kong and Mainland, Kung Fu and Heroic styles, each matching dress and environment to a particular color scheme (blue robes alighting across a lake, red dresses flickering through the autumn leaves, black suits clashing among buildings of stone, etc.)<br /><br />For fans of the genre, the showdown between Jet Li and Donnie Yen has been long in coming and does not disappoint becoming a quasi-mediation on combat set to string music and the subtle grays of the mind.
B000002KIT|4.0|This live recording of Thin Lizzy is a MUST for any fan of hard driving 70's rock music.  In my opinion, this original lineup of Lynott, Brian Downey on drums, and the dynamic guitar duo of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham (who patented that unique lead/rhythm chorusing sound of guitar layering)was Lizzy at its finest.  Of course, Phil Lynott was masterful with his soulful baritone voice, and this recording is one of those where many of the live perfomances exceed the studio versions.  As live titles go...this one ranks up there with UFO's Strangers In The Night & Frampton 'Alive.  Incidentally..........the latter two are also musts for your collection of timeless 70's LIVE !
B0000542DH|4.0|This review is partly in reponse to the review by \\"Technopagan.\\" <br /> <br />The first DVD release (2000) of Natural Born Killers is in the original theatrical aspect ratio.  The problem with the original DVD release is that it is not enhanced for widescreen TVs (i.e., anamorphic).  This means the film was encoded on the DVD to display within a 4:3 shape using letterboxing on the top and bottom to preserve the proper aspect ratio of the film.   <br /> <br />(Sidenote: That does NOT mean it is a full-frame version with the top and bottom cut off to fake a widescreen image. That is an entirely different issue misunderstood by consumers who don't understand the way movies are filmed.) <br /> <br />Non-anamorphic DVDs appear fine on a regular TV, but they were not designed with widescreen TVs in mind.   They appear \\"stretched\\" horizontally.  Most widescreen TVs have modes to squish or stretch the image into the proper shape, but the results are never satisfying. <br /> <br />In the early days of DVD, non-anamorphic DVDs were common since consumers did not yet have widescreen TVs.   I know this because I've had a DVD player since late 1997 and a widescreen display since 2003.  Anyone who buys a widescreen TV will soon discover a few of these \\"not enhanced for 16x9 displays\\" DVDs in their existing collection. <br /> <br />By the time Natural Born Killers (NBK) was finally released on DVD in 2000, it was inexcusable to make it non-anamorphic.  To add injury to insult, it was released again almost exactly a year later as part of the \\"Oliver Stone Collection\\" and enhanced for widescreen TVs.  My only conclusion is that they knew they would re-release it and wanted to give people even more reason to buy (or rebuy) the newer disc.  <br /> <br />Indeed, the \\"The Oliver Stone Collection\\" release is the version you should buy, especially if you have a widescreen TV or plan to get one eventually. <br /> <br />In sum, in both versions you see the film as it was shown in the theater.  The only problem is that the first release was not designed with widescreen TVs in mind.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wow, this is an amazing soundtrack. I saw the musical in New York with a school group and it was amazing. I was so glad to see that the soundtrack brought out the best of it. Kristin Chenowith and Idina Menzel- their voices harmonize sooooooo wonderfully. The best examples of that is in \\"What is this feeling?\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"For Good\\". I was simply stunned. I really liked how they never stayed in the same key for long, it keeps things interesting and makes for some very powerful songs. Simply a wonderful soundtrack. Couldn't have been happier!
B0002HTZJI|5.0|By far one of the greatest live albums by any band of all time. Amazing guitar interludes, Bass/Guitar duets, vocals, all excellent. Even includes an amazing Drum medley with a round of \\"We Will Rock You\\". <br /> <br />All of the classics from Can't Stop, Around the World, Scar Tissue, and Otherside to Throw Away Your Television, Zephyr Song, Californication, and Under the Bridge. <br /> <br />Introduces new songs \\"I Feel Love\\" , \\"Brandy\\", and \\"Leverage of Space\\" <br /> <br />Overall...Musical Perfection on a CD. <br /> <br />Admiration to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, <br /> <br />-ZenithHeptone
B000002J0P|5.0|Love this album, used to have this on LP myself. Full of folk and religously a hippy album that every yuppy should own, especially for Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, classic. Even for Crosby contribution like Long Time Gone, an anthem to himself respectfully. Lets not forget Nash, Marakesh Express. I have this album, it's worth it.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|im going to keep it simple This live cd/dvd from coldplay is awesome. listen to it and find out for yourself.I highly recommend this one!
B000002UAO|5.0|I love this album, Bob Dylan influence all over it, especially if you have the american version of this album, mostly acoustic. Again thumbs up on musicianship, but a band that is really getting sick of touring, and writting for themselves like In My Life, one of my favorites. I think what I love about this album is commercialism is thrown out the window and ran over by a double decker bus in England. You Won't See Me, great song, hell here's a list.....   <br /> <br />Norwegian Wood...very mellow <br />I'm Looking Through You... better on American album but good here. <br />Think For Yourself.... George getting to the point <br />Michelle.... good love song, got me laughed at in grade school <br />Girl...John, you've got the best voice in the world, god bless you. <br />Wait...psychedellic before it happened <br />Drive My Car....yeah you guys are superstars <br />Fantastic album, go out and get it if you haven't already, note..better if you purchase this in MONO instead of stereo.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The exorcism of Emily Rose was a hard core thriller and the fact that it is based on true events makes it ever more real. I was very sceptical when this movie came out. Its title doesn't really grab you as a scary movie...but as I continued watching it...I became permanently attached to my boyfriends arm. The possession scenes were insane. I'll have nightmares about those for awhile. My advice, watch it...and then buy it!
B000002OX7|4.0|Not a bad set, probally their best album yet. I'm not a big fan of theirs but I'll make exceptions on this album. Behind Blue Eyes, fantastic, My Wife, funny, been there, Going Mobile, hey there you go Pete. Best album by The Who by far.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is really great. My favorite songs on it are these songs. American Idiot, Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Are <br />We the Waiting, St. Jimmy, Wake Me Up When September Ends, & Whatsername. I hope you enjoy it 2. Have a nice day.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is an example why you should never have alternative lifestyles, but a good one at that since I love this album. Agreeable, it's a lot like solo efforts if anything, and each of them really getting on each others nerves slowley, not as bad as Let It Be, but getting there. John Lennon's contributions, awsome, Dear Prudence, subperb, Glass Onion, even Revolution 9, for you avante Garde types or Yoko wanabe's, I still love Cry Baby Cry and Yer Blues, my fave from Lennon on this project. Now lets get to Paul ( the walrus ), Helter Skelter, still jams to this day, just get crazy, Mother Nature Son, awsome for you acustic lovey dubbies, or even for you hokey pokeys Honey Pie, the boy still in him, innocence. George really sprouted, While My Guitar... awsome with E.C. Long, Long, Long, eerie sounding but marv. Ringo, all I have to say is Don't Pass Me By, good, Good Night, O.K. I think though John took the cake on this album, even though flakin out, prove to be interresting as always, god bless his soul. If you're a Beatle fan get this album, very worth it.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|A very emotional movie, a real tear-jerker for me. But the action sequences in the island scenes were a bit over the top.  The non-stop attacks on the female character felt like \\"The perils of Penelope\\"
B0009WFFS6|5.0|First let me say that the only reason I don't give this DVD (and the accompanying CD) 10 stars is that Amazon won't let me. Given some of the pedestrian crap that's gotten 5 stars here, it's an insult to give this performance only five.<br /><br />I saw Cream in 1967. I saw Blind Faith a few years later (pre-Delaney & Bonnie, who were in fact the leadoff act, and pre-Derek & the Dominos). I saw Clapton at the end of a positively awful tour in 1974 or 5 -- he came out drunk at Watkins Glen, played a 20-minute set, and the band was pelted with rocks and bottles -- but the audience in Philly brought out the best in him. He was on fire, he knew it, the audience was hanging on his every note, and he was so happy that he actually stepped back and did a dance routine with George Terry (rhythm) while Yvonne Elliman belted out vocals. Clapton, dancing onstage... I have a drumstick from that concert: the drummer (forget who) tossed 'em into the audience (just as Baker does at the end of \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog, except that mine wasn't broken). It was an inspired (and inspiring) performance by Clapton. When he hit the chord at the end of the second verse of \\"Badge\\" and held it, looking around with a mischievous grin on his face, letting the anticipation build -- as Bowie would put it, \\"he could lick 'em by smiling, He could leave 'em to hang\\" -- and when he finally went into that Harrison-esque solo, the crowd exploded.<br /><br />Ah, those were the days...<br /><br />I know Cream, and I know Clapton. Take it from me, he isn't \\"phoning it in\\" (as one reviewer put it): he's still capable of playing the kind of lightning licks he did when he was 20 (and he does so in many places in these concerts), but he's matured, he doesn't have anything to prove.<br /><br />I'm watching \\"Forgotten Cities of the Heart\\" as I write this, and I'm getting the same kind of chills I did the first time I heard it in '67. I don't even miss the cellos. It's a phenomenal performance by all three of them, and one of the songs by which \\"phone it in\\" and the other criticisms of Clapton are belied.<br /><br />Bruce was one of the finest vocalists in rock; his voice has held up remarkably well over the years. There are places where it's a little rough, but he still reaches for -- and hits -- high notes, and there's more resonance and grit on his blues lyrics (\\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\"). Clapton's voice (e.g., on \\"Outside Woman Blues\\") doesn't have the sweetness that it did when he was 20, but -- like Bruce's -- it's acquired depth and soul: I mean, the vocal on \\"Disraeli Gears\\" is a bit tame for a blues song like this, and the new rendition (and the vocal on \\"Stormy Monday\\") are much more nuanced and -- well, bluesey. Baker doesn't flail away in the fashion that inspired Animal (the Muppet drummer), but he's rock steady and amazingly agile for a constituent leader from Leesdon.<br /><br />Yeah, \\"reunion\\" concerts are often a disappointment and a drag. This is not one of them. The most disappointing performance is the Baker's droning recitation \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" -- but that's pretty much a throwaway song anyway -- and the rest of the DVD (and the CD, which is essentially parallel to it) is going to delight any *real* Cream fan.<br /><br />Bottom line: Cream today is better -- almost 40 years after the release of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" -- than 99% of the bands in the past 40 years have been, and better than just about anyone playing today. Of course, some of the best songs ever written makes it a little easier, but these guys are still virtuosos.

6304712936|5.0|AMADEUS, a great work of cinematic art, brought to the screen by the great Milos Foreman, is perhaps (in my opinion) one of the greatest films of his career.  It was a career-making vehicle for F. Murray Abraham, who went on to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the sadistic and insane Antonio Salieri, a jealous rival of the late, great Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce).  This film is part fantasy (a fictionalized account of the life and untimely death of the title composer, through the eyes of the elderly Salieri, who has been confined to insane asylum (or maybe the better word is \\"imprisoned,\\" from his perspective), part musical tribute to some of the most well-known and beautifully written Mozart compositions.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail about the plot.  That would easily ruin this film for you.  I will say that the acting is great, the music is gorgeous, there are moments of great humor, followed by high drama and the whole plot concept of this film is not so much crafted to romanticize Mozart as a man and an artist (far from it).  Instead, it examines the forces behind evil, jealousy and (ultimately) deception.  This is a very distinctive, evocative and compelling work of art.  I only hope that they re-release it in the movie theaters again.  You can't really experience it in its full glory (in my opinion) unless you have seen it on the big screen.
0307263118|5.0|This is no opusculum.  It is an opus of the highest order. As the back cover promises, the reader will want to read it again, so beautiful and evocative is the writing.  <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|I definitely sometimes enjoy music that still has withstood the test of time. While there are so many acts that have come and gone, there are just very few acts that have remained a constant in this industry. This past year, we've seen acts from the past return with great records like the Rolling Stones, and Elton John. While they have had some moderate success, U2 has still sown their boldness and feeling for fantastic music after all this time. That has been a trademark for Bono, who recently was named one of Time Magazine's People Of The Year, and for the group who celebrated their 25th anniversary. They have still remained definitive, and their latest record shows it.<br /><br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, U2's 2004 record, is a truly remarkable Rock N' Roll album that definitely delivers. The album showcases the group and their style better than ever. The songs here are all fantastic, and deliver a really deep and driven feeling for great records which a lot of manufactured acts like Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez and Kelly Clarkson can't even show. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb includes some eclectic tracks like the driven Vertigo which was used for Apple's Ipod ads, City Of Blinding Lights, the deeply personal and soulful Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, which was dedicated to Bono's dad who died, and their recent single, the simple pop song Original Of The Species. The songs here are all great, and definitely deliver to what U2 has maintained with appealing to all kinds of people.<br /><br />Arguably, U2 was the year 2005 with their music. The feeling of the music on How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is just great. This is a must buy for any U2 fan, and for anybody who hasn't purchased a U2 record yet. I love these tracks, and they are just great to listen to.<br /><br />Album Cover: A 1/2-<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Mastering: A<br /><br />Overall: B+
0385513755|5.0|I read about one fiction novel a year so I usually have an idea what is good before I'll buy it.  So when I found out about this illustrated edition and read the reviews here, I decided this is the book to get and I am glad I got it!!  The movie coming out soon with my favorite actor, Tom Hanks, also motivated me to get the book. Once I started it I wanted to read it nonstop.<br /><br />The religious stories and facts helped keep my interest high too as I am catholic and still learning about my religion.  Every little bit of knowledge helps and this book is filled with stories and facts about the religion, the bible, lots of things and the pictures help you see everything the characters are experiencing.  I can't wait for the movie and hope it does this book justice.  Get this book.  Even if you know the basic premise it is still great reading because there is a lot more to it.
0895260131|4.0|I found Robert Spencer's book to be startling and informative.  While I was aware of the fact that Islam is indeed a religion of war and intollerance, I was suprised to learn that this tendancey toward war and violence has remained consistant since Islam's very beginings.  Mr. Spencer isn't describing a chapter in Islam's history, he is describing how Islam IS TODAY, and alway has been.  He explains very well about how Islam has not been hijacked by a few extremist, but that Islam in fact is extreme by its very nature.  This book should be required reading our elected officials and for those who think we can \\"win hearts and minds\\". <br /> <br />One negative thing I must note:  There were quite a few typos in this book, hence my rating of four vise five stars.  By typos, I mean grammatical and typographical errors such as missing spaces and puntuation, and superfulous words.  I'm no english teacher, and I may have made some mistakes in this very review.  I will not waist space here by listing all the errors I saw in the book since they don't take away from the point the author is making.  However, the editor should again proof-read the book and correct such errors since, with such a subject, credibility is important. <br /> <br />Having perused other reviews of this book here on amazon.com, its clear who have read it, and who have not. <br /> <br />Those of you who have not read the book, but left a review are just plain ignorant.  Ever hear the saying, \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\"?  Don't judge a book based solely on its reviews either. <br /> <br />Those of you who DID read the book and still complain about how bad it is, or how INcorrect you think it was, do nothing more (in my opinion) than prove some of the points made by Mr. Spencer in his book. <br /> <br />Some minds will never be changed, and some people are just plain inncapable of seeing things as they are no matter how authoritive the facts may be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I must agree whole-heartedly with what many others have said.  This series is a must-have on DVD.  Having not been a fan of Buffy or any of Whedon's other works, I actually came into Firefly expecting very little.  By the time I was done with the first episode I was very optimistic.  When the series was through I was floored.  I pray as many others do that this series has a future on Sci-Fi, though the prospects are bleak.<br /><br />A word on special features: I am not much on special features, I will rarely watch them even on DVDs of my most favorite of movies.  I have not touched them on this collection because the episodes themselves are just too great!
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|I'm not against a band changing its sound to stay fresh, and the Strokes haven't changed all that drastically on this one, but the quality of the songs themselves is downright AWFUL in some cases. Slow, boring, and often annoying.  <br /> <br />First listen: Not impressed, but not willing to make a judgement after just one. Second listen: Oh God, it still feels the same way. Third listen: Yep, they've got a stinker on their hands. No love here.  <br /> <br />I was wary about the whole thing when I first heard 'Juicebox' - sounds like Julian's been listening to a bit too much Franz Ferdinand. '12:51' was a bitchin' opening single a few years back. 'Juicebox' is lukewarm.  <br /> <br />The album as a whole is tepid.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I'm watching these people disgrace a great new band and I have to defend them.  This album has great climaxes that follow through.  You often hear a band that can bring a good climax but mess it up in the end.  The Arcade Fire comes through. <br /> <br />They are a little reminiscent of Pink Floyd during The Wall, even up to the vocals.  A little mellow yet it comes at you and kicks you in the arse!  Kind of a vintage sound without going over the edge.  You can definately feel the passion that the artists put into the music. <br /> <br />I am very careful when it comes to new music because there is so much competition and a lot of bad stuff out there.  But if you like the indie scene and enjoy the beauty of bands like Radiohead, Pink Floyd, U2 and the like, you will definately love this album.
B000089CJI|1.0|It is an appaling age in musical history when synchopated beats like those emenating from the Postal Service are held in  high regard by people who usually have good musical taste. Let us compare the teeny-bopper sounds that Give Up produces to some of the previous and current music that is available so that we can realize that this band is really not worth listening to.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|Why can't they all just get along? The Vampires and Werewolves \\"at each others necks\\" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones, teaming up and feeding on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly.<br /><br />Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? And without the war there would have been no action-packed thriller about this war called Underworld.<br /><br />The effects are great in this flick. There's suspense. The DVD comes in a brilliant HD transfer with terrific 5.1 sound. What more could one ask for? How about a sequel/prequel?...Due out about a week from this writing....Hence, my decision to do this belated review.<br /><br />This DVD documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter marrying a Wolfman several centuries back. Flash back to the present and Kate Beckinsale is a death dealer/Vampire that hunts the last of the Lycan. Scott Speedman is a mortal (for now) that holds the key to end the war, and he takes some licks (and a couple bites...key words: a couple) protecting that key.<br /><br />All in all a very well done story that will likely spawn many more modern day Vampire versus Werewolf movies to come...like Van Helsing, and, oh, the sequel!...Underworld: Evolution!<br /><br />The sequel holds much promise actually. All of the key characters are back played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel (looks like kind of a prequel too).<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution apparently continues the story of the war between the Death Dealing Vampires and The Howling, and also traces the beginnings of the fight between the two mythical, legendary monsters. But that'll have to be another review entirely.<br /><br />So if you've not already, get Underworld into your collection, or at least view it before seeing the next installment. It's definitely a keeper for those into the genre.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Spinning this record around in the stereo is like crawling out of bed at exactly midnight, walking into the kitchen for a midnight snack and seeing a box of delicious candy sitting on the table. You don't know exactly how it got there or who brought it but damn it is good! A welcome treat! Ego tripping at the gates of hell is very similar to watching your favorite Sunday morning Sesame Street episode, but this time you're on acid. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots part 2 is like being inside a colorful lava lamp. It is very enjoyable!

B000B8QEYC|4.0|I'm caught in between with this album.  It's been so long since there has been a full Enya album that almost anything would be a delight.  And, since this album is almost entirely mainstream Enya I am delighted to have it.  After all most of these songs are exactly what I've expected from Enya all these years, so why shouldn't I be.  She remains a power in making songs that appeal for our need for harmony and melody.<br /><br />Perhaps my issue is simply that I expected a bit more after all the time she has taken.  Certainly, her single work in the time between albums has been exceptional, including Lord of the Rings in her credits.  This album is almost a return to tradition - Celtic tonalities and melodies, romantic or mystical lyrics, and Enya's unmistakable music making.  An effortlessness that belies the fact that Enya plays all the parts on her albums.<br /><br />Perhaps The River Sings, which recalls an almost martial Celtic syncopation is the most unusual of the songs.  Although it took a while to get used to it, set in the middle of several very fluid songs as it is.  Yet the translated lyrics are by far the best of the album, matched only by Sumiregusa (Wild Violet) that is sung in Japanese.  If you listen closely you will also hear a few jazz riffs sliding by, as in Someone Said Goodbye.  Something is brewing on this album, but I think it's still to flower in the future.<br /><br />Interestingly, in the time since Enya's last major release, I've been listening to her sister, Maire Brennan's, solo work.  It's a bit unnerving because their voices are so similar.  Brennan, who is best known for her work with Clannad, covers a wider breadth of material and has become as strong as her sister Enya, although a bit less predictable.  This points to possibilities for Enya as well.  It's certainly good to have her back again.
0920668364|1.0|I will never read this to my daughter.  I got creeped out the further I read.  Someone told me it was good so I picked it up for less than $5.00.  Worst $5.00 I ever spent.  Again...I will NEVER read this to my child.  Good message sort of.....but conveyed in a ridiculous and creepy manner.

B0000029DD|5.0|I will never forget the first time I heard Jeff Buckley's music.  I had always known of the name since the time he was touring but I was too young to appreciate him at the time.  Sadly, I was only 14 when he passed away and didn't care too much about music at the time.  Anyway one night his name popped into my head so I decided to check him out and the first track I listened to was Hallelujah.  From the first plucked string I was drawn in to that haunting guitar.  And by the end of the song I was in tears.  I'd never heard such a beautiful piece of music in my life.  Needless to say I wanted more.  I listened more and more to whatever I could get my hands on, and then I discovered Dream Brother and that was the one song that really intrigued and showcased something really special.  Eventually I went out and bought Grace and was completely blown away.  The opening track, Mojo Pin started the album off so beautifully with that soaring vibrato easing it's way in from a distance.  Song by song I was growing more amazed with the arrangements but even more so, Jeff's unmatchable voice.  Some songs at first didn't really strike a chord with me, i.e. Corpus Christi Carol.  It was completely different then anything I had ever heard.  Over time and with more listening I grew to love the song and appreciate Jeff even more because of his eclectic ability to sing and play and genre of music flawlessly.   <br />If there was only one album I could recommend to someone, it would undoubtably be Grace.  It truly is the most, incredible, serene record ever written.

B000002H33|5.0|This album is amazing obviously.  Sure, some people may not like it.  Some of those are probably saying so just to go against the grain.  Some of the ones that say \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is better are probably saying so just to go against the grain as well, though I'm sure many sincerely feel that way.  But this is a great album.  Overrated?  Perhaps.  It's not without a few flaws but what album is?  Those flaws are dwarfed by the overall power, beauty and brutality of this masterpiece however.  After this, or at least after \\"Justice\\", however, they went downhill faster than a redneck gets to a Nascar event. <br /> <br />All the songs are great.  The only real exception would be \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\".  I've never really gotten attached to this song, although it has the great line of, \\"Drain you of your sanity/Face the thing that should not be\\".  The rest are all good to excellent.  James' voice sounds the best on this of all their albums.  He doesn't sound like he's singing out of a well or a cave as much.  But like their other albums, Cliff's bass isn't as audible as I would like it, and I'm sure you would agree.  I'm tired of people comparing \\"One\\" to \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" and saying how \\"One\\" is so great.  The latter is a very bada** song and the chorus is better.  Oh, and please stop crying over how the riff is only 7 notse.  So?  It's a great riff.  It doesn't need to be the most complex thing in the world.  It's not repetitive or anything so why all the b**ching?  Another great line, one of my favorite of all the Metallica lyrics, is \\"I was born for dyiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!\\" on \\"Disposable Heroes\\".  That line never gets old.  I'll stop there though. <br /> <br />Anyway, there's no convincing necessary.  Just get it.  Everyone else has and you don't see them complaining, do you?  No!  You only see 5 stars, every now and then 4.  The ones below that are just from morons who prefer bands like Korn and Static-X, and you aren't gonna listen to them, are you? <br /> <br />Now, the guy below me is a moron.  The idiot can't even use a d**m period.  We're supposed to read your stupid review with no periods?  This is English, buddy.  We use periods in addition to other puncuation, such as capital letters.  He also gives \\"Kill 'Em All\\" only 3 stars and compares it to the \\"Black\\" album.  \\"Kill 'Em All\\" is infinitely times better than the \\"Black\\" album.  \\"But it doesn't have melody or ballads!  Wah!\\"  So?!  It has f**king raging riffs, awesome lyrics and it's actually THRASH!  Oh, yeah, the solos are also easily 100x better than those on the \\"Black\\" album.  Kirk didn't play ONE good solo on that entire thing.  That's when he REALLY became a wah whore. <br /> <br />So, yeah, he gave the album 5 stars but he writes like a 2-year-old and he gives \\"Kill 'Em All\\" 3 stars, so he can go to Hell.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|The original Chinese dialog with English subtitles is much more enjoyable and entertaining than the poorly dubbed English dialog.  Many of the more humorous scenes are those which are not spoken, like the one that mimic's Bruce Lee's threat by waving a fist.  <br /> <br />The characters are matrial arts superheroes with special powers that have some very well choreographed fight scenes.  The night battle with the musicians is awesome.  There are also sequences that mimic the Matrix. <br /> <br />There are many scenes that imitate the Road Runner and Coyote.  Other physical humor scenes include trying to light a cigarette, trying to put a fire out by using alcohol.  But one of the funniest sequences is how to try to keep a snake from biting you. \\"handle, who is throwing a handle???\\" <br /> <br />The extra footage and behind the scenes and enlightening and provide a fun way to learn how the movie was developed, actors selected, and movie filmed.  The behind the scenes footage is really informative, but the dialog is in Chinese, thank goodness for subtitles. <br /> <br />The actions sequences were rehearsed by the same artist from the Matrix.  How tough is the fighting at the end, it is so much that the bad guys are raining like cats and dogs. <br /> <br />The classical Chinese string instruments and orchestra really make this movie more authentic to it's 1930's theme.  <br /> <br />Overall, a good solid purchase that will surprise many and entertain.   <br /> <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|It's hard to talk about Illmatic without going into the usual cliches. Yes, it's the greatest debut album by any individual rapper. It is a masterpiece, in the purest sense of the term, as the album has no weak tracks, no weak beats, no sloppy rhymes. Though it didn't produce any hit singles like \\"Ready To Die,\\" which was released in the same year, there is hardly a rapper who cannot trace some of his influence back to Nas and this perfect 40 minute album.  <br /> <br />This album is separated from other key staples of the rap catalog, such as Straight Outta Compton or Paid in Full, by its brevity and the sense of a perfection being achieved before your ears. At the time of the album's release, Nas' name was known around fans of rap's underground; Nas' appearance on a track in Raekwon's Built 4 Cuban Linx whet the audience's appetite for the delivery of this hot new phenom.  <br /> <br />Illmatic's release ushered in praise almost immediately, being given 5 mics out of 5 by Vibe Magazine, an almost unheard of praise for a new album. The album's tracks, esepcially the now classic \\"NY State of Mind\\" became staples on radio stations in New York. If you listen to it, the hard-core realism, the verbal technique, and the potent phrasings (\\"I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death) remain largely unrivaled, and to this day, widely imitated.  <br /> <br />There is a reason why this album has a five star rating on amazon.com, despite being reviewed by over 490 people. Not even the Beatles have a single album, as of this writing, that has been designated an average 5 star rating. And rap, being the contentious genre that is, where for every Tupac fan you have somebody else burning him in effigy, such an accomplishment must be noted for its notable breaking of barriers, it's skill and deft, being acknowledged by a universal audience. Get the album. At 7.97, it's about as cheap of a masterpiece that you'll ever find.  <br /> <br />Hip-Hop does not get better than this.
B00005VPI6|5.0|The first time I read Cotillion I found myself a little disappointed. Perhaps because Freddie isn't really the sort of hero I go for (The Marquis of Vidal, Marquis of Alverstoke or Earl of Worth from Heyer's novels spring to mind here), perhaps because Kitty wasn't the usual intelligent, witty heroine, perhaps because there were lots of different stories which diluted the overall effect.<br /><br />I read it again, two months later and completely changed my mind. Freddie IS a great hero because of his sweetness of nature, self-awareness and the way that he rises to the occasion when it becomes necessary and saves the day in so many ways, but humbly. And as for the hero character, Jack Westruther, who you might expect to be that - he isn't; we hear of his rake lifestyle and it's offputting. However, Freddie's father makes a fascinating side-character with his sly wit and amusing turn of phrase; Lord Legerwood definitely adds a spice to the book and he's now my hero of it, alongside his son.<br /><br />The period detail of Heyer's books is of course fantastic and this one is no different. What stands out for me in Cotillion is that Heyer is able to portray many different people, some of whom are simple or at least not particularly intelligent, with real veracity. Kitty's young and bighearted and is utterly convincing; Freddie isn't particularly intelligent but has a lot of common sense and worldly knowledge and he is convincing; Freddie's sister whose husband is away and is flexing her flirting muscles is convincing - all the characters we come across in Cotillion are different from each other (and from other Heyer characters) but work. No mean feat!<br /><br />I recommend this book very much, and it definitely improves with subsequent reading.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|the first hour of this movie i thought i was watching american pie 4 (goofy guys meeting hot chicks, tons of nudity.. never a bad thing) then the last half hour felt like saw 3 (eerie enviroments with gore and torture.. i like) good movie.. i like the story but could care less for these characters
6301971558|4.0|MOGAMBO is a remake of the 1932 classic \\"Red Dust\\", based on Wilson Collison's Broadway play.  John Lee Mahin re-tooled his original screenplay, and Clark Gable returned to reprise his role of a rubber plantation owner (Dennis Carson in \\"Red Dust\\", but called Victor Marswell in the remake).<br /><br />Clark Gable's performamce is amazing.  How often does an actor have the opportunity of revisiting a character 20 years later, and use their maturity and experience to flesh out the role to a greater extent than they did before?  In \\"Red Dust\\", Gable was magnificent, but here in MOGAMBO, he is positively magnetic.<br /><br />Ava Gardner plays Eloise Kelly (`Honey Bear') who battles with crisp Linda Nordley (Grace Kelly) for the affections of Victor.  Gardner is more than a match for Jean Harlow; and Grace Kelly, in one of her first big important roles, is fantastic in the part originally taken by Mary Astor.  Filmed on location in Africa, director John Ford brings a lot more action and cinematic thrill to the story, but the central love-trilogy remains the focus.  Highly-recommend, but if you haven't seen \\"Red Dust\\", I recommend that as well.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|At last, one of the old school manages to sucessfully embrace contemporary sounds & go somewhere fresh. This is a really self-assured effort, lush soundscapes with a rock/blues heart beating underneath. There are some truly bizarre rhythms going on, and while baffling - to a rhythm-challenged soul like me at least - they enhance rather than detract, saving this from being just another Kashmir-blues rehash. <br />It's tempting to think this is where Zeppelin might have been in 2005, but it's moot. Jeff Martin from the Tea Party will be kicking himself when he hears it...  ;-) <br />This is indeed a great record, great songs, great sounds, great performances, & doesn't overstay it's welcome. Enjoy. <br />Steve
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I never watched the show. I didn't know anything about it. I also didn't expect much. I thought this was a very good and entertaining movie. I put it heads and tails above the crap that George Lucas has put out recently to his throngs of mindless fans that eat up anything that he spews out no matter how bad it is. Serenity is fun to watch and has good characters and a good story. It has just enough tongue in cheek humor to give it another angle that makes it enjoyable.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to both sci-fi fans and people who aren't. I enjoyed it and so did a lot of my friends who were as in the dark about the concept and the show as I was.
B0000UJL96|5.0|Although not my favorite trek movie, this picture touched me more than any other, due to the beautiful but painfully sad goodbye in the end.

Some of my most beloved heroes for 35 years.
B00000IGGA|4.0|If there's anyone in the music business who's managed to fend off the over-the-hill label, it's Tom Waits, and 1999's Mule Variations is one of the most compelling documents of his staying power. Even in his forties, with a huge body of work already behind him, Tom Waits was putting out the kind of seminal albums that most acts are lucky to put out once in the prime of their careers. I wouldn't say this album is guite as great as Rain Dogs, Bone Machine, or Real Gone, but it still sits comfortably right below them, which is saying something.  For a contemporary comparison, even the vaunted current runs of the White Stripes and Wilco aren't in the same category as the string of classics Waits has reeled off since Rain Dogs. Most of his songs aren't particularly complex, but (at least from Swordfishtrombones on) Waits has proven to be a master at crafting distinctive, memorable music with nothing more than his gravelly baritone and some rock-meets-blues-meets-folk-meets-country backing sounds. And of course, there's his vocal range, which covers everything from atonal rasps to achy crooning.<br /><br />Waits's notorious drunken-werewolf howl actually doesn't make too many appearances here, although it is on fine form on the evil mutant blues of Big in Japan, Eyeball Kid, and Filipino Box Spring Hog. These three songs nicely showcase the noisy, cantankerous arrangements that have made Waits such a renowned experimentalist, but overall this album is more notable for its eclecticism and inspired vocalizations than for its sonic adventurism. Even more than with Bone Machine and Real Gone, you get to hear Waits from pretty much every conceivable angle here. Yes, much of it's pretty low-key, but at sixteen songs you'll still find plenty of high-quality stuff, even if Mule Variations does contain my least favorite Waits song in the form of House Where Nobody Lives. Much like Rain Dogs, this album doesn't just contain many of Waits's best songs, it contains next to none of his worst.<br /><br />After firing out of the gate with the aformentioned Big in Japan, Mule Variations tones down the volume a bit for a while, but what it sacrifices in volume it more than makes up for in atmosphere. Low Side of the Road unfolds into a swampy, minimalist, horn-fuelled crawl that gets under your skin and stays there. Hold On could almost be described as radio-friendly, what with its encouraging message and readily accessible structure, but its shuffling beat and Waits's world-weary storytelling style elevate it well above the status of mundane balladry. Of course, the positive vibe doesn't last too long, as Waits reveals his scarier side once again on Get Behind the Mule, an eerie, smoky little tune whose subtly creepy instrumentation is the perfect complement to the foreboding imagery of the lyrics. Pony is yet another masterpiece of Waits minimalism: a few supporting instruments drift in and out of the mix, but Waits's scratchy vocals and sparse acoustic guitar picking are all that's needed to create an ambience of disillusionment and hope at the same time.<br /><br />It's after Pony though, when Mule Variations enters its second half, that Waits really starts digging into his repertoire like a veteran pitcher forced to get by on smarts. As the number of tracks gets into double digits, Waits unveils no less than three piano ballads, and while they're hardly among my favorites in his catalogue, they're still notable both for the conviction in Waits's voice and the different mood he manages to bring to each one: hopeful on Picture in a Frame; mournful in Georgia Lee; and (most surprising of all) romantic on Take it with Me. At other times Waits gets just plain weird; as evidence witness the clanging backbeats of the paranoid, spoken-world What's He Building? and the decidedly unorthodox religious reflections of the country-blues tune Chocolate Jesus. And since you can't have an authentic Tom Waits masterpiece without a moving anthem to conclude things, he delivers perhaps his finest such moment here with the rousing, infectious Come on up to the House, a seven-man romp with some of his most strangely inspirational lyrics. He even manages to drop a Thomas Hobbes quote in there without sounding pretentious, which I wouldn't have thought possible. But then, this is Tom Waits we're talking about, so I guess anything's possible.ude things, he delivers perhaps his finest such moment here with the rousing, infectious Come on up to the House, a seven-man romp with some of his most strangely inspirational lyrics.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|For the past four years I have been living outside the US. So, I missed the first run on Fox. The SciFi Channel was the reason for buying cable when I returned a few months ago. The \\"Serenity\\" movie looked great so I bought it and was amazed. Yesterday I bought the series collection and spent the day and most of the night watching nearly all of it.  <br />\\"Firefly\\" presents a future that I would like to live in. Ragged around the edges but with virtue. <br />Great characters, brilliant pictures and a theme that borrows a bit from my favorite, \\"Cowboy Bebop\\". Well worth the price. Let's hope that there is a follow up to \\"Serenity\\".

B00005JOHI|3.0|I admit it, all right, I liked this movie more than I expected to.  When I first heard that they were making a new version of Pride and Prejudice, I was excited.  Then when I heard that Keira Knightley was playing Elizabeth, I was put out.  Understand, please, that while Knightley is just fine as a pirate-movie chick, I do not believe she has the acting props or even appreciation of the character she is playing (don't take it to heart, Elizabeth Bennett is, you know, the most complex and thoroughly likeable, believable female character in literature.).  She was ok, a little better than I thought she would be, but I did not recognise Lizzy Bennett in her.  Matthew MacFayden I liked more the second time through, but really thought basically the same of him as of Keira Knightley, that he was more a pretty face to put on the screen than a serious competitor for the \\"perfect\\" Mr. Darcy.<br /><br /> Perhaps my favorite part of the movie was Jane Bennett, who is played very well by an actress whose name I don't know, but who loks and acts the part sublimely.  Sometimes it's hard to like Jane in the book, because she's just too perfect, but she makes you realize why it is that everyone likes Jane, and it was a joy to watch her performance.<br /><br />  As for the soundtrack, it was very pretty, but I kept on thinking to myself, \\"if you're going to sound exactly like Chopin, why not just use Chopin?  He's dead, he's not going to care.\\"<br /><br />  Anyway, it was a very enjoyable movie, I went to see it twice and liked it both times, but when you're dealing with a classic like P and P, I think a little more care would be in order.  I have certainly seen worse ruination worked on a book in a screen version however, so some credit goes to the director for restraining himself as much as he did.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I preordered this CD two years ago. I am always looking for new music, and I loved the powerful vocals of ATDI so I took a gamble and bought this CD on the basis that the best parts of that band were returning.  When it came, I was suprized.  This was not what I was expecting, but still remained some of the most unique and innovative music I'd ever heard.  But it was so muich so that it saw limited playing time in my regular rotation.  I lost my origional copy and essentially forgot about TMV.  Then I got a new one for Christmas and my god has my oppinion changed.  This is absolute brilliance that cannot be ful;y realized at first.  It literally took two years for the greatness of this album to penetrate my psyche.  Buy this, listen, freak out, dismiss it and return when your brain has settled to find true musical perfection.
B00005MP58|4.0|Naturally, to make a perfect adaption of Pride and Prejudice would be more than impossible, but this one really does come as close as any I've seen.  Jennifer Ehle is a very convincing Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth surprising good as everyone's favorite, the ingeneous Mr. Darcy.  This version stays religiously close to the text, if I am not much mistaken there is not a single line of dialogue changed or ommitted, and if they are the changes are so slight that the most grumpy critique couldn't quibble over them much.  Mr. Wickham and all three of the younger Bennett sisters are very well cast, although Jane was in my opinion a very poor choice, and my biggest problem with the movie.  Mr. Bingley was not what I would call an excellent casting choice, but he was not horrible either, excepting the fact that he looks like he has 'fro, and it doesn't suit him.  Lady Catherine is very very good, at least I thought she was, although I have heard opinions to the extreme opposite.  It really depends on if you like that sort of Lady Katherine or go more for the Judi Dench sort.<br /><br />  Mr. Collins is very painful, very good indeed.  Mrs. Bennett I thought a little over-played, if that is possible, Mr. Bennett on the better side of middling.<br /><br /> However, the story is very respectfully handled, which is to me the most important thing.  I can freely recommend it.
B00008MZ0O|1.0|I can't give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there's the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling \\"1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!\\" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer: <br />Give it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I can't believe all of the positive reviews of this film...I saw it in the theater back in 1984 and hated it, then saw the extended version on TV, hoping for better, it wasn't...frankly this film blows...I love the books, have read them all and was looking forward to the film from the moment I heard that David Lynch was making it...it was the biggest disappointment of the 80's.  The TV miniseries has it's flaws but is Oscar quality compared to this. Wish I could give it 0 stars.
B00005JNTX|5.0|When the tv show Miami Vice first became popular, a colleague described it to me as the \\"triumph of style over substance.\\" What he meant was that the window dressing - clothes, cars, music, setting - was more important than the stories.<br /><br />Today this phenomenon is so familiar that we frequently confuse veneer with content, especially in cases where there is no content - read Paris Hilton among others. In Sin City you find the full flower of this evolution.<br /><br />Rodriguez has taken the two-dimensional comic images of Frank Miller, (in combination with the one-dimensional characters and plots), and succeeded in making them even more two-dimensional. The film is visually mesmerizing, a spellbinding combination of heavily made-up actors, digital backgrounds, and high-tech special effects. It has the flatness of a comic, and like a comic, it is impenetrable.<br /><br />So compelling is the visual style achieved here that you quickly forget that the plots are moronic, the characters both ludicrous and repulsive, the reliance on exhausted stereotypes pitiful, and the entire vibe simultaneously decadent and corrupt on one hand, on the other self-satisfied and smug.<br /><br />Sin City is a place where everyone is guilty, every day is dark, and every problem is solved through violence. Rodriguez and Tarantino are still the two bad 12-year olds who must be separated because they are disruptive to the rest of the class.<br /><br />If you want to see another example of what happens when these two miscreants collaborate, check out From Dusk Till Dawn, a film which certainly has earned a place on any Worst Movies Of All Time list.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The most popular superhero makes his way onto the screen with this extraordinary motion picture directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) and featuring a star studded cast including Academy Award winners Marlon Brando (The Godfather) and Gene Hackman (The Unforgiven, The French Connection), Christopher Reeve (Deathtrap), Ned Beatty (The Toy), Valerie Perrin (Lenny), and many others.    Superman is one of the most exciting superhero flicks ever, and one of the best movies ever made!   You all know the story already: young Superman, Kal-el, the son of Jor-el, played remarkably by Brando, is sent to earth by his father right before his planet Krypton bursts into smithereens. He lands in a small town called Smallville, picked up by the Kent family, and raised as their own child that they name Clark. Clark grows up with unexplainable super powers, like scoring touchdowns all the time, kicking a football across the state, and racing trains and winning. Clark discovers a piece of kryptonite in the barn of his earthly parents' farm that tells him to head north, where he, or the toss of the kryptonite, builds his new home Krypton on earth where he meets the image and voice of his father who expains to him that he is not one of the humans. Years later, he's wearing tight blue pants, a red cape, and shirt that has the sign S on it. You know the rest of it so I'll stop right here.    Superman was a major motion picture event when it was released back in 1978. It still is today despite the more advanced special effects in movies today. Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luther, Superman's nemesis who plans to destroy the world and take over, while Reeve, in his first major starring role, shines as Superman, a role he would find hard later on to escape the shadow of, and pass away nearly 26 years later and be remembered for nothing more than that.    The film is electrifying, entertaining, engaging, and absolute fun for the entire family.    Recommended    A
B000063DFQ|2.0|I LOVE MAIDEN!!!! <br />But this was not that good of an album. <br />It was okay, but the only songs that I can say I like are: <br />The Trooper, Flight Of Icarus, Die With Your Boots On, and Where Eagles Dare. <br />If you want to get a Maiden album, get Number Of The Beast or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.
1402714572|4.0|Treasure Island  <br />By Owen Moynihan <br /> The book Treasure Island is a very good book.  It is written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The book is about a boy, named Jim, whose family owns an inn for sea travelers. One day a strange sea captain comes and takes a room. Eventually the captain's old crew comes for the treasure map he has. The captain never paid full price for the room he stayed in, so Jim takes the treasure map and calls it even. Then the doctor, the Squire, and Jim decide to find Treasure Island, where the treasure is hidden. They buy a ship and hire a crew. The voyage starts out well enough, then things take a turn for the worse when Jim falls in an apple barrel and hears the crew and the cook, Long John Silver, talking about mutiny, once they found the treasure. Jim tells the Captain and your going to need to read the book to find out the rest! <br /> <br /> The book was very exciting to read because every time one problem is solved, it wasn't long until a new one comes and the problems get more exciting each time. You almost never could guess what would happen to the characters next and you would need to be very lucky to guess it. You could feel like you were in the book because the author was very good at giving just enough detail to everything, so you could easily picture it. All the characters were incredibly realistic; you could see these people, or people similar, probably walking around during the time of this book. The only time I didn't feel in the book was when the characters talked, because the author wrote it to sound like how people talked back then. That was confusing. The main conflict was very interesting because it just kept changing and each time got more exciting. You would never be able to predict it. The characters were very realistic. The author gave very good detail about the characters and their personalities, so you got to know all the important characters very well. The book's ending was very satisfying and quite funny. Itwrapped up everything very nicely and made you laugh quite a bit. I was very pleased the author didn't screw up the ending like other books I've read.   <br /> <br /> The author's voice is first person through the main character, Jim. In a few chapters he switches over to the first person doctor but he tells you so you are not shocked or confused. The author uses the same vocabulary they would during the time the book is set. It is confusing to understand a good portion of the time but he explains some of it and that helps. The author really did capture the way people spoke and used it very well in the book but it was hard to follow. The author was very good at describing and giving good detail to the things important to the story and not too much on minor things. The author uses very good dialogue to advance the plot and let you learn about the characters. Some conversations were a bit hard to understand but it was still a good book. The author gave detailed descriptions of characters and the setting. He never did too much or to little to anything in the book, it was just right. The author's writing is unique because of the reasons above and he made a great story about a boy following his dreams and succeeding against all odds.  <br /> <br /> Compared to other books I would give this book a eight and a half out of ten, only because the conversations were hard to follow and annoying to understand.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books and to anyone who likes book about buried treasure, the high seas, and pirates. Hope you enjoy the book.
B00005JOQ9|5.0|One of the best gore/horror movie todate. If you are into this kind of movie genre, Just watch it!! if not, see a love story movie.
B000A59PMO|5.0|OK, I have to admit I only asked for the First Season DVD's because I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon. To be quite honest I hadn't heard much about this show, but I figured if Joss liked it, it had to be good. I was mistaken... It was FABULOUS!!!!! I am a huge fan of shows that center around the characters and not the story or action. The characters in this show are very 3 dimensional. Kristen Bell who plays Veronica Mars is one of the best actresses I have seen in a long, long time. The story is extremely well thought out and obviously not made up as they went along (ie: Lost, Alias comes to mind) Also you get the <br />goods by the end of the season with enough clues along the way to keep you interested. I couldn't recommend this show enough. If you haven't already bought the Season one DVD's I suggest you do. You won't be disappointed! I also want to give a little shout out to Jason Dohring who could have easily just been the token Jerk of the show, but plays his part with such depth as to actually make you both love and hate him at the same time. Keep up the great work guys!

B000AADYRQ|4.0|I had heard of Death Cab a while back, but first heard Soul Meets Body on the radio the other day.  I was interested enough to go out and buy the CD yesterday.  I've listened to it a couple of times now, so this review is based on that amount of exposure. <br /> <br />Plans sounds like a mix of Coldplay's sort of dreamy, melodic vocalizations and American Analog Set's mesmerizing style of repetition.  Nothing on this CD rises far above the rest in terms of songs that you can't get out of your head, at least not after only a couple of listens.  If you're willing to go along, though, Plans is a 45 or so minute joy ride.  That alone is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />Plans is interesting enough that I will be checking out their older material in the near future.  For a band that has just made the leap to a major label, that has to be good to hear.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Okay, I'm not really sure what to say about this cd except for that it is incredible.  The lyrics on every song are amazing, most of the skits are funny (except for Ken Kaniff, which is nasty), and all of the beats are incredible.  I can only say that so many times, the beats and lyrics are both incredible.  This cd is one of the best rap cds of all time and it is Eminem's finest moment, in my opinion.  The Slim Shady LP was classic, and so were the Eminem Show and Encore, but this tops them all.  I highly recommend this cd because it is insanely awesome.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Since 1977, there has not been a sci-fi film that captured the magic, romance, humor, and adventure as well as Star Wars.  Serenity has turned that all around.<br /><br />Joss Whedon is a genius.  He \\"gets\\" life, and he \\"gets\\" the pathos required to make a character truly lovable.  This is a movie for intelligent, mature, movie lovers.  If you are one of those people who think XXX is a good flick, or think that Fight Club was really about fighting, OR, if you're someone who only watches those \\"slice of life\\" films (which are good in their own right), you won't understand this film and shouldn't bother.  But otherwise, go for it and buy several copies.  Support this type of creative and artistic direction.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|A surprisingly good remake of the classic 1933 film, Peter Jackson's King Kong, provides another take on the big ape that we all know so well by now.  When a film crew arrives on a mysterious island to shoot a movie things get a little out of hand as they soon realize that all is not what it seems in this exotic part of the world... <br />There are slight hints of Tales of the Golden Monkey, Indiana Jones, and Congo, so the movie falls into that type of action/adventure category. <br />Naomi Watts (who at times brings to mind Nicole Kidman), Jack Black, Adrien Brody, Andy Serkis, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING!) allowing for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! <br />The plot, the setting, the special effects, and the music are all EXCELLENT!   <br />Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4 Stars <br />
B0001I55OC|5.0|Even though Timeline is based on the page-turning best-seller by Michael Crichton, this movie would be completely forgettable (maybe even laughable) if not for the ravishing performances by Gerard Butler and Anna Friel (who, incidentally are not the stars???) as Andre Marek and Lady Claire.   <br /> <br />Both actors possess the 'X' factor in abundance, and make you want to rush out and buy everything in which they have ever appeared.  One particular scene -- in which Butler's lovely face registers an epiphany of his true identity -- is so over-the-top charming, even my 70-year old mother said it was the 'cutest thing she'd ever seen.' <br /> <br />Buy this movie -- and enjoy Gerry Butler and Anna Friel over and over again, along with lovely epic-style romantic music in the backdrop. <br /> <br />My five-star rating reflects the fact that Butler, Friel and a charming turn by Billy Connolly -- oh, ok, the costumes are great too -- make this worthy of the rating.
0553801503|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars because it wasn't as excellent as A Storm of Swords, but that would be hard to top.  The title to me refers to the opportunistic scavengers picking over the remains of the seven kingdoms, and the book has plenty of that imagery, with some newly powerful and predatory powers (such as the Iron Islands and Dorne) setting up the groundwork for moves that will likely prove important in the future.  It took me a while to get involved with the new characters he was introducing to set up future events, but everything had the feeling of necessity and I wouldn't have wanted any of it edited out. <br /> <br />I would also like to put a word in for Brienne.  She might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I don't find her boring and have grown attached to her.  It's refreshing to have a woman warrior who doesn't wear a cleavage-exposing breastplate while exuding beauty and sex appeal and cutting to mincemeat anyone who makes fun of her gender or casts doubt on her abilities.  While a character like that might be fun once in a while as a guilty pleasure, I appreciate one with a developed character and conflicts so much more (like Eowyn in LOTR, though she had the advantage of beauty on her side).  If Brienne didn't have fears, her actions wouldn't be as brave. <br /> <br />Jaime has developed a lot, and I used to love to hate him, and Cersei has developed too, though she is still readily hateable.  The book reaches a climax of sorts but then doesn't really resolve it, leaving me waiting once again.
B00005JMXX|1.0|The last time I attempted to review this truly offensive Hollywood fake n' gooey claptrap I was sensored by Amazon.com for using a bad four-letter word minus one vital letter.  We'll see if I clean it up a bit if they let me in the club this time.  I really don't care to discuss the much beaten, stirred n' shaken human relations story line in my review, you can read the short blub at the intro to these \\"open\\" reviews if you'd like that.  I'm simply here to stear you clear from wasting some of your valuable time, or at least to help you waste it in a more entertaining fashion (which would be any other activity you can think of). <br /> <br />The basis for the movie, as you probably know, is the weather patterns everywhere go bizerk for a few days because of the awful misuse of technology and what-have-you by humankind.  The meterologists at The Weather Channel must have cringed all the way through TDAT, which would be more aptly descibed if you replaced that \\"D\\" with a \\"W\\" in the aforementioned acronym.  In this hair-brained, ultra-dull Californiafied mess, the impossible becomes reality in a amazingly short amount of time.  Also incredibly, this movie seems longer than the several day time span than it supposedly encompasses. <br /> <br />When it comes to the acting itself, you'll see the spectrum from adequate and predictable from Dennis Quaid to annoying and overwrought by Jack Gyllenhaal.  You've seen Dennis give these horrified/perplexed looks throughout his disaster-flick riddled career.  And Jake, well.... he's the brainiac kid that could have saved the world if he could have just got them all into a gigantic underground room with a generous fireplace.  Possibly this movie could have earned two stars if they would have brought in Quaid's brother Randy for a little comic relief; warning us all that there is a giant \\"dung\\" cloud coming, just as he did in King Pin (good flick).  But alas, this is one more global crisis movie with no sense of humor.  It did make me think for a minute about taking a vacation in Mexico during this nice Jersey winter.  Turn up that fire place and make some travel plans!
0307276902|1.0|I can't begin to describe how hard it was to force myself to read this book--not because it's riveting or shocking, but because Frey is such a horrible writer and rambles on for three hundred and some pages before it finally gets mildly interesting.  How can anyone actually say he can write?  I don't know many paragraphs I skipped because he'd say something over and over and over.  For example he goes to breakfast and repeats what's been served; over and over in three paragraphs.  Also, I thought good writers would have, I dunno,  metaphors? poetic language? Hmm, guess all you need to do is say the same things and capitlize the hell out of things.  Does car need to be capitalized? Probably not. <br />As for the story, it's alright. would have been better if it wasn't four hundred pages.  Most of the first half is him detailing his routine at the clinic and throwing up. <br />Oh, and how sad it was to read the smoking gun website and realize he's a fraud.  What a shame Frey didn't do a better job lying about his arrest in Ohio, where he apparently hit a cop with a car and was found with crack.  Smoking gun tracked down the cop who said he's never been hit.  Frey lists felony charges he said he had from Ohio, like rioting, possession of drugs, and Felony DUI -which didn't exist in Ohio until '96- and felony mayhem-which still doesn't exist in Ohio.  Apparently, Frey initially said the book was fiction, but after being reject it suddenly became nonfiction-but with fiction. <br />So good luck for anyone who actually enjoys this book.  I'm not sure whether I should feel proud of myself for finishing it or regret wasting the time.
0446613444|1.0|I've been reading the Bosch series out of order and recently decided to go back and read everything from the begining.  In The Black Ice, Bosch doesn't quite seem like the same man I read about in Black Echo or in later books.  This story, at best, was boring and really didn't make sense.  At the end Connelly just admits he has no idea why our corrupt cop turned.  I'm sorry but this such a cop out.  Plus-from the get go, I thought the cop crossed but then in the middle it was like some epiphany.  I thought I miss something.  Plus, the folder the cop made for Bosch didn't make sense.  It's like Connelly started something that he later changed his mind on.  There were a lot of holes and things that didn't make sense.  Plus, am I to really believe all of this took place in a week?  Going to the dry cleaners, the bank, and the grocery store takes all day for me, but Bosch can get what takes a normal cop months to do in a mere day.  Plus, Bosch was a man-ho, sleeping with two different women within days a part.  Who does he think he is: A NBA star?  Since when did cops get so much booty?  Okay, I'm nick-picking now.  Over all, this wasn't a very good book.

1400032717|5.0|Out of all the many books I have read, \\"The Curious Incident\\" easily becomes one of my favorite books of all time.  The book centers around Christopher Boone, a 15-year old boy who is autistic, lacking any knowledge of social connections, hating the color yellow and brown, screaming whenever he is touched (even by his own parents), and using his Swiss Army knife for protection against innocent strangers.  When he finds his neighbor's dog impaled through a garden fork, Christopher goes on a Sherlock Holmes-like detective adventure that extends into something much bigger. <br /> <br />Although Haddon uses Chris's autism as the main fountain of the novel's comedy, the novel altogether goes on a much higher level than Christopher's autism, and brings forth many thought-provoking and moving concepts in life, seen through Christopher's eyes.  From how metaphors are lies and how hating things (like the color yellow) makes decision-making easier, Chris states the excrutiatingly honest truths of life in this painlessly quick read.  However, don't let book's short length give you the wrong impression; it's as short as it is riveting. <br /> <br />There's really nothing wrong about the book, except for the fact that it's extremely short.  It's obvious that Haddon is setting the new trend in contemporary literature: an eccentric, spellbinding story, filled with little tidbits on the blunt, honest facts of life, with pictures here and there, letting the reader see Christopher's confusing, perplexing world right through his eyes.  Highly recommended for everyone to read.
B000006O7C|5.0|I'll add a few thoughts for the person considering this CD, particularly who only knows the album Grace:  The first disc of this set is a relatively finished product produced for Buckley by Tom Verlaine (with some subsequent minor clean-up).  The second disc consists mainly of rough drafts for unrecorded songs, and should be considered as such.  The second CD is not easy listening, and is really for the most devoted fans only (as is fully disclosed in the liner notes). <br /> <br />It is said that Buckley was dissatisfied with the Verlaine sessions.  I recall that Buckley's biographer reported that Verlaine told Buckley, essentially: \\"If you don't like the tapes, destroy them, or they'll find their way into the public eye eventually.\\"  Buckley didn't destroy them.  He and Verlaine worked on them in Memphis, then Buckley set them aside. <br /> <br />Buckley chose Verlaine to produce the sessions.  Verlaine produced Buckley's music with a far more stripped-down sound then you find on Grace.  Buckley and his band (save for the drummers on the tapes) had been touring for quite some time, and were deeply attuned to one another's playing.  They had a wonderful sound, simple, centered on electric guitars (played with relatively few effects), bass, and drums, supporting Buckley's vocals.  This is the sound that Verlaine, and perhaps Buckley, wanted to capture.  And they did, very well. <br /> <br />I describe the sound as \\"simple\\"--what I mean is that the ingredients were as straight-forward as your basic bar band.  What they did with those ingredients was 10 levels beyond your basic bar band.  Buckley had developed into a first-rate writer of deceptively complex songs.  A song, like \\"The Sky is a Landfill,\\" might start out rather like a basic rock 'n roll song, but pretty soon you're in another place...the verse-verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure generally vanishes; the 2 guitars (sometimes more) and bass play off of one another (with considerable panache and skill) intodifferent layers and blends, and Buckley sings his serpentine melodies, unflinchingly exploring his uniquely wide range and timbres.  It still rocks, and often pretty hard, too, but it requires, and greatly rewards, attention.  (There are several ballads as well--not surprising for Buckley, who was a master of the form.) <br /> <br />None of this is utterly different from Grace, but Grace was more heavily worked in the studio, with considerable multi-tracking of vocal parts, multiple and various-sounding electric and acoustic guitars (some \\"treated\\"), some keyboards, strings, etc.  And Grace is terrific.  But so is Sketches...even though Sketches is thought to be something of a rough draft.  In terms of the way it sounds to this listener, it's not that rough--certainly no \\"first draft.\\"  Maybe more of a \\"works in progress,\\" by a band that, like any really active, working band, is always somewhat \\"in progress.\\" <br /> <br />But what about Buckley's dissatisfaction?  Is it possible that we're dealing with an end result that, though excellent otherwise, just didn't match his vision for it, and thus simply disappointed him at the time?  Is it possible that he would have turned to it later and been pleasantly surprised?  We'll never know.  But he didn't destroy it.  And now we have it, and can be grateful for it.
0316857750|1.0|I feel bad for the people who gave this book a good rating. That shows how financially ignorant they are. First of all this book is pretty useless. It is especially useless to those who are going to think it is good, people who are clueless about money. He gives absolutely no advice on where to invest your money. The examples he he uses of how he supposedly amassed his fortune via investment are impossible, incorrect and even fraudulent. As a finance student, I can say that some of his examples are ILLEGAL, such as his suggestions which are basically promoting insider trading.  <br /> <br />I can guarentee none of the people who gave this book a good rating are educated in the financial/investment/RE realm as there is nothing in this book which would be consistent with how things are done in the finacial/investment/re world. Not to mention the fact there is absolutely nothing in this book that would be useful to anyone who was knowledgable about finances, investments or RE, except it would be good for a laugh. I shudder to think of all the how many audits this book is going to be responsible for. Robert seems completely unaware that the IRS exsists and even grossly invents tax rates and encourages tax fraud. A person who is not knowledgable of tax code could get into big trouble taking his advice and would really be duped. <br /> <br />If you want to make money, it is clear that the best thing for you to do would be to write one of these hack self help motivational books. This book is definately not going to improve your net worth. But many of you will buy it anyway.  <br />
B000002KDX|5.0|This first album/cd from the trio (now a duo) America features fine playing, great harmonies, and nice songs; which have helped by great followups. Besides the hits: A Horse With No Name, I Need You, and Sandman, other wonderful songs are on this record: Here, Rainy Day, Never Found The Time, and the oddly named, but still great song, Donkey Jaw. Formed by three Army children, who \\"hooked up\\" (as they'd say today) while in England, and taking the name America, put together a fine debut lp, and later cd, which is a great place to experience their genius. Get it.
B00005K3NR|5.0|that's right.This movie is a cult classic. It was made back when Stephen King used to write entertaining horror books and when Brian de Palma was making interesting movies. <br />Oh the glory of the 70's! How can you not fall in love with Sissy Spacek's performance as an abused teen girl with telekinetic powers? To all of us who hated school, Carrie became our personal hero. She sure gives them a lesson in the end, and boy I still jump sometimes when i watch the last scene of the movie.That bloody hand coming from hell after Sue...a true masterpiece: fantastic acting, highly stylish flick.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Jameson Thottam for the Constant Gardner <br /> <br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" features two of the best performances of the year in one of the most intelligent thrillers I've ever seen. That being said, the intelligence factor is so high, that it totally lost me the first time I previewed the film. After it came out, I researched a little into the subject matter and the novel by John Le Carre. The film is so realistic and organic, almost documentary-style, that all the plot points occur very subtly. The film's style imitates real life, and it is truly frightening how intelligent and knowledgeable the director, Fernando Meirelles, and author are on the subject of drug company partnerships and the AIDS medicine crisis in Africa. Let me say, the film is above most people's intelligence level. I don't know if any of it is true or there's any gravity to it. But I do know there are two stellar performances amidst the headache of history and information that is \\"The Constant Gardener\\".  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Here's The Scoop\\" Jameson Thottam <br />Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a diplomat with the British High Commission. He meets Tessa (Rachel Weisz), an activist, at a press conference after she attacks him and Britain's foreign policies. They end making love, getting married, and having a baby on the way. Tessa wants to accompany Justin to Kenya to investigate what drugs pharmaceutical companies are testing on the poor. Once there, she and her driver, Arnold (Hubert Kounde), are murdered in their vehicle.  <br /> <br />Justin begins an investigation and personal odyssey to discover what got Tessa killed. He wants to understand what she knew and what she was keeping from him. His colleague from the Commission, Sandy (Danny Huston), discourages him, as well as the Commission head, Sir Pellegrin (Bill Nighy), who Tessa had constantly confronted. The many facts, information, letters, associates, computer videos, and threats Justin uncovers occur in the last intellectually challenging half of the film.  <br /> <br />\\"Don't want to Reveal too Much\\" James Thottam <br />I haven't revealed much by saying Tessa is murdered, since it takes place during the first scene of the film. The story is told in fragments, past and present, looking back at Tessa and what she knew that got her killed. As mentioned, the last half involves Justin's investigation, and it is during these scenes audiences will decide if they like the film. For it is these scenes that really explore the subject matter in an oftentimes brutal and cynical way.  <br /> <br />\\"How about the Performance\\" Jameson L Thottam <br />But plot aside, what about the performances? Both the leads give Oscar-caliber performances that absolutely give this film a different level. Fiennes is at once charismatic and diplomatic as Justin. He projects a controlled sadness and rage. He always makes his character interested, as well as interesting to watch. When he learns of his wife's death early in the film, watch his expression. It is totally controlled, and we immediately feel sorry for him.  <br /> <br /> <br />But it is Weisz, as the activist Tessa, who gives \\"The Constant Gardener\\" purpose. The actress is on-screen for less than the first 45 minutes, and she is able to emit kindness, love, concern, and controlled anger all at once. There are two scenes that really did it for me. While she is in the hospital, she has just been through some mild trauma, yet she is still able to pull over Sandy, Justin's colleague, and announce the doctors are killing their patients with test drugs. Weisz plays the character not in a begging type of way but a concerned way. She's an activist who acts, even as she lies in the hospital bed under emotional distress. The other scene involves her and Sandy again. Tessa wants Sandy to give her a letter but Sandy refuses. Tessa offers herself in exchange for the letter. Weisz announces Tessa's offer of adultery so plainly that it is terrifying. But we understand the stakes and what she really cares about. It is an outstanding performance.  <br /> <br />\\"Conclusions\\" Jameson Thottam <br />Two great performances to be exact in a pretty good movie. \\"The Constant Gardener\\" will mean different things to different people. Deciding the film wasn't clear enough in its information to be labeled a great film is my opinion. The direction is still top-notch and controlled. Meirelles knew where he was heading with the subject matter. The last few scenes, in particular, are directed, edited, and handled so well that you forget you had to go through the many investigations of Justin to get to this point. Want to test your intelligence level? Go see \\"The Constant Gardener\\".  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam

B000002IU9|1.0|I guess it depends on your perspective.  The first track is hysterical and probably worth your time, but the humor seems to wain shortly after.  It's simply one of the worst albums I've ever heard in my entire life.  It's so ridiculous it's awesome.  The band tries to mask their inadequate songwriting  with frequent flashy solos that have absolutely no meat to them.  Technically they aren't even impressive.  I can't tell you how many times the guitarists repeat the same riffs in their solos.  What they are good at is double picking vamps. <br /> <br />There are strong similarities between certain passages in this album and Celine Dion.  I'm not kidding.  How can these guys have the balls to get the \\"more metal than thou\\" platform?  Let's not even get into the lyrics.  They make Helloween and Blind Guardian look like gifted lyricists. <br /> <br />I'd save money for that fantasy sword that you're saving up for. <br /> <br />
0553801503|5.0|The few reviews that I've read so far have been completely ridiculous and unjust. Comparing him to Jordan is only possible in the sense that they are both fantasy writers. Thats it. Writing style, characters, elements of fantasy are all completely different.  <br /> <br />Most of you who complain about there not being enough in the book are clearly not reading well enough into the whole thing, Martin clearly states at the end of the book that it's not all there for a reason. If he had put it all there, you'd be here complaining that it was too big and that you couldn't handle it all. Catch 22. You're damned if you do, damned if you don't. Look at the big picture. <br /> <br />Too those of you who are candidly reading these reviews, I say too you that you cannot read \\"A Feast\\" without reading the previous books. It's not stand alone, especially this one. I say to those of you who have read the previous ones, this one will dissapoint in the sense that your favorite character is not likely there, but all the elements of the past three are there. The human interactive element is there and thats why most of us read these books. The human interaction in a different world. People screwing each other over. Buy it in hardcoer alone too support the efforts of GRRM, but also but it because it's part of one of the best series in fantasy or any genre of writing currently.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is a collage of bittersweet revelations. Joseph Heller shows you fault after fault in mankind, but does so with such enjoyable dry wit that you hardly realize he's pulling apart your perception of reality at the seams. It's a good thing, too, since otherwise it would be 430 pages of despair and hopelessness. By the end, perhaps, you might even be glad he flipped  your view of life upside-down. <br /> <br />The majority of the plot focuses on Captain Yossarian, a lusty bombardier who's convinced that everyone's out to kill him and wants nothing more than to be sent home. He's stopped at every turn, however, by the titular rule catch-22. Heller doesn't focus on the actual rule itself--it's mentioned by name only a few times in the entire novel--but rather on what it embodies and stands for. It states that for an officer to be grounded, he must be crazy, but he has to ask for it, though if he asks to be grounded on the grounds that he is crazy, he must not be crazy. Throughout the novel, catch-22 mutates into a way that the military can justify whatever it does. To quote Yossarian and his friend Doc Daneeka, \\"That's some catch, that catch-22.\\" \\"It's the best there is.\\" (Heller, 55) <br /> <br />Between Yossarian's storyline are dozens of smaller stories about everyone around him, from his commanding officer Colonel Catchcart to the chaplain. These, along with the rest of the chapters, occur only in partial chronological order. For  every set of chapters that appear in order, Heller throws in a story completely out of order. Sometimes they help explain the events of the surrounding chapters, but other times they seem to be shuffled around capriciously. The side stories also have a tendency to grow somewhat tedious, mostly because of a lack of dialogue and movement. It isn't unusual for Heller to continue a single paragraph for several pages; he has a liking for run-on sentences as well. Still, none of them are unbearably long or boring and they do give the reader a chance to see events from the multiple characters' points of view. <br /> <br />Most of the book takes place in the Air Force base where Yossarian lives, but there are a smattering of scenes set in Rome and smaller locations throughout Italy. Heller obviously did his research on WWII, as there's very accurate descriptions of technology from that era. Unless the reader was there themselves, they might come out wondering if Heller was actually a bombardier himself. <br /> <br />Catch-22 is the epitome of military satire, but Heller doesn't let his choice of setting limit himself. Nothing is safe against ridicule: society, bureaucracy, and humans themselves all fall prey to his dark wit. Still, for all his jabbings in the ribs of life, his humor usually stays well away from being tasteless. If you do throw Catch-22 down in disgust, it's probably because you just realized how incompetent man really is. In that way, his style is somewhat similar to Douglas Adams, though more subtle and less quirky. Heller's sense of humor may be so subtle, in fact, that readers more used to conventional and obvious humor may completely miss some of the implied jokes. Mixed in with the biting comedy are ideas that really make the reader think: \\"You're inches away from death every time you go on a mission. How much older can you be at your age?\\" (Heller, 48) At times it seems like Heller is softening the reader up with humor just so he can blindside them with a ponderous thought. <br /> <br />Despite it's age, Catch-22 is a surprising accessible read. It's hardly a book for young adults; Heller obviously wrote his most famous work for a very adult audience. There is some rough language and adult themes. Some readers may be intimidated by it's length, but aside from a few sluggish parts, the book can get rather exciting.  <br /> <br />Readers with a bit of patience and an open mind will probably enjoy this novel. Heller will make you laugh, cry, and possibly rethink your outlook on life. Even before you turn the last page, you will understand why Catch-22 has earned its influential place in literature history.
0316172324|4.0|Jameson Thottam: Don't blink or you'll miss a truly good read <br /> <br />Do you ever wonder why you have such strong instinctual responses? Ever curious as to why your gut feeling is almost always right.  <br /> <br />For those of us who fell in love with his Tipping Point, it was big news when Malcolm Gladwell announced that he was tackling the topic of thin-slicing. In plain english, this book is all about how our mind makes snap decisions, and what we can learn about that process to make ourselves better decision-makers.  <br /> <br />What's it about?  (James Thottam) <br />Much like Tipping Point, this book is much more observational than conclusive. Gladwell's stated purpose is to make us more aware of the thin-slicing we do on a daily basis, and to understand the pros and cons of this natural behavior.  <br /> <br />Method of Teaching (Jameson L Thottam) <br />The way the book teaches is through groups of anecdotes, each focused on a different facet of thin-slicing (reading faces, understanding vocal nuance, etc). Generally Gladwell will tell a \\"framing\\" story, outline the teaching point and then reinforce it with a number of smaller examples that prove the same point holds true in a variety of environments.  <br /> <br />The War Games Story (Jameson Thottam) <br />Personally, I found the war games story that Gladwell dissects to be most informative. Focused on the Millenium Challenge, a competition in which a retired military officer know for his lack of process went head to head with senior armed forces leaders who had the benefit of a staggering amount of tools and data. The key there is staggering, and as we watch the inevitable defeat of the better educated team we learn a number of critical lesson about why learning to trust the ability to thin-slice can prove more valuable than any artificial thinking or technical solution we can develop.  <br /> <br />The Main Opinion (Jameson Thottam) <br />I strongly recommend this book, which is a very quick readby the way, to anyone who is interested in better understanding human behavior or looking to refine their own self. Also, this is nearly guaranteed to be a business \\"it\\" book in 2005, so you marketing/strategy/sales folks should be prepared to talk about it at cocktail parties and strategy sessions all year long.  <br /> <br />Strengths: (Jameson Thottam) <br /> <br />1.The stories that Gladwell uses are incredibly engaging and the run of topic areas. Something here for everyone (romance, military, medicine, etc).  <br /> <br />2.Stylistically, this is one of the most engaging books of its type that I have read. Crisp, clear and written in a colloquial narrative style, it's actually fun to read.  <br /> <br />Weaknesses:  (James Thottam) <br /> <br />1.As I have said before, Malcolm Gladwell is the John Grisham of the non-fiction world. If you are looking for a strong ending or a conclusion that will distill this books teaching points, you are in for a disappointment.  <br /> <br />2.Outside of the facts of the anecdotes themselves, Gladwell doesn't bring much hard data to the table to enforce his wider hypotheses regarding quick decision making. <br /> <br />Enjoy the read, <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam

I was sure I was in for a disappointment but was I WRONG as were all the other negative critics! THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM!! It's catchy, fun to listen to, etc....just like all the other Strokes ablums but with a different sound...different in  a good way! I love it!! Check out \\"razorblade\\" or \\"heart in a cage\\".....great songs! You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|At the beginning of her career, I didn't really care too much about Britney Spears at all, due to my hatred of bubblegum pop.  But as soon as I heard \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Overprotected\\", I began to change my mind.  And then I heard, \\"Me against the Music\\" and then decided that I loved her music.  In the Zone is so different from her previous albums.  My favorite tracks are:  <br />Toxic <br />Outrageous <br />The Hook Up <br />Touch of My Hand <br />Me against the Music <br />Showdown <br />Shadow <br />Everytime <br />Early Mornin' <br />Well, I love all of them, but I fell in love with those the fastest.  However, I didn't like Brave New Girl at first, because it reminded me of her first two albums.  Many people think Britney Spears is a fake and not a real musician because she doesn't write any of her own songs.  I say that is a huge load of bullcrap. She co-wrote 7 of the tracks on the album. A whole lot of artists out right now don't write their own music.  Anyway, In the Zone is a great album and you should buy it.

0307276902|1.0|If you want to read a biography that is completely fictional and you don't mind helping a liar to earn a buck, then by all means, order this book. <br /> <br />But if on the other hand you would rather read an honest biography, you'd better look elsewhere. The lies that this man has told concerning his criminal past are well-documented when contrasted against actual police reports that are now widely available to the public. <br /> <br />Of course, this tactic works well in church testimonials also. \\"I was REALLY sinful. You wouldn't believe how sinful I was!\\" A story about a person who sinks really low and then rises up is without a doubt much more exciting than a person who never got addicted to drugs in the first place. <br /> <br />Don't believe the hype. Remember this guy fooled Oprah, too. It just goes to show you that you should be very careful about who you lend your sympathy to and even more careful about who you look up to as an inspiration. This guy is getting rich off of his lies to you, the reader.  <br /> <br />And now we have reviews from Oprah-sycophants who are in denial - standing up for the guy without seeing any of the damning evidence against him. Just because \\"Oprah liked him\\". It just shows you how stupid it is to place your undying faith and loyalty in talk show Gurus.  <br /> <br />I am surprised that this guy's book made it on her show without her people doing any background checking at all, though. Doesn't Oprah pay people to do stuff like that for her?
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Well I guess to start off I should tell you that the Strokes are one of my top 2 or 3 bands. I was super excited about this album. I even bought the Juicebox EP to get a taste of it. Unfortunately, this album bares little resemblence to its predecessors. A few of the songs here, yes, are very catchy. But in Is this it or Room on Fire every song was catchy. The general sound of this album is a lot more refined, produced and slowed down then the previous ones. Darker, too. <br /> <br /> <br />You Only Live Once: closest they come to to that \\"classic sound\\". my favorite song on the album. The jerky rythym is really neat. Reminds me of some of the other post punk stuff out there. 5/5 <br /> <br />Juicebox: very different than anything else, but the hooks here are still pretty cool. The end of the song is really the only thing short and dramatic on this album. 5/5 <br /> <br />Heart in a Cage:pretty close to classic Strokes. It is slated for the next single. Reminds me of Television. Nick Valensis guitar runs are really fast and clean. 4/5 <br /> <br />Razorblade has a catchy synthy guitar riff in it that reminds me of 12:51. I like this song a lot. 5/5 <br /> <br />On the Other Side: catchy guitars and a great chorus. A great example of how Julians voice has improved. 4/5 <br /> <br />Vision of Division: this song is weird. It starts off slow, then goes to a big rocking chorus, then goes to a middle eastern sounding guitar solo. Doesn't work for me. 3/5 <br /> <br />Ask me anything: Julian + Mellotron = cool song. This song is very neat. It is just Julian and a Mellotron. It reminds me of some ballads by the Beatles. 5/5 <br /> <br />Electricityscape: This song shows how much the guitarists in the strokes have improved. As a guitarist, I think the solos here are very unique. This song has a dark sound to it, kind of like Radiohead-ish. 4/5 <br /> <br />Killing Lies: This song could have sounded a lot like old songs but the drums are way to loud. 3/5 <br /> <br />Fear ofsleep: Good thumping bass part, but no real hooks. 3/5 <br /> <br />15 Minutes: Slower song at the beginning, just long enough to make you lose interest. Then it speeds up. Too little too late. 3/5 <br /> <br />Ize of the World: Great song. Begins with great feedback, then goes into a cool classic Strokes groove, akin to something off of the first two albums. In the chorus Julian does a major scale with his voice, really cool. The guitars in the song are amazing. 5/5 <br /> <br />Evening Sun: Slowest song on the album. Really, really slow. No real hooks here, and the guitars are kind of all over the place. Still pretty, though. 4/5 <br /> <br />Red Light: Awesome guitars (that synthy sound, a la 12:51). Full of hooks. Great closer. 5/5 <br /> <br />So I guess in conclusion is that this album could have been a masterpiece, but it was edited very poorly. It is about as long as Is this It and Room on Fire combined. If they would've taken out there iffy stuff and left the awesome stuff, they still would  have enough material for an album. This album sags in the middle. Call the slow down creative improvement, a new direction, or what not, but this album really has too many influences in one place.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you needed more proof that the \\"Power that decide\\" know nothing about TV, stories, writing (you name it), check out Firefly. The BEST Sci-Fi series since Babylon 5. Lovable characters, great plots, cool dialogue, intelligent stories. And the Execs killed the show before all episodes were aired. WHAT???
B000BGH22W|3.0|WARNING: Long review. <br /> <br />All right.  I got this soundtrack about a month ago, and it disappointed me deeply.  I was in love with John Williams' work in the first three movies, and I didn't learn that he wouldn't be scoring Goblet of Fire until shortly before it came out in theaters.  This didn't bother me, really-composers that didn't do the original had done well in sequels to other films.  I fully expected Williams' themes to be integrated into the music, at least.  Again, I was disappointed.  The music is done completely from scratch by Patrick Doyle.  Someone told me that \\"it sounded like Doyle did it in his sleep, in one night,\\" and I was inclined to agree.  A few songs, especially THE STORY CONTINUES and THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, stuck in my mind.  A month later, the score sounds a lot better.  I've stopped comparing it to Williams' work, which may have helped.  It just takes time to get used to, because this soundtrack is NOT memorable nor is it a very good listen right away.  I'll review most of the songs below and give you my impressions. <br /> <br />THE STORY CONTINUES - A short intro piece that inevitably caught my attention early on.  It begins buoyantly, then drops in pitch as the logo appears in the movie.  Still, it causes memory recall of the movie and I consider that a lot in how good movie music is. <br /> <br />FRANK DIES - Another short piece of the intro, which I think could've been added to THE STORY CONTINUES.  It crescendos from very soft to a more moderate tone before a sudden dark boom at the end. <br /> <br />THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP - I wish this song was longer; it's one of my favorites in the soundtrack.  We start with the Irish team's theme, a light and airy Irish song, then it jumps to the dark Bulgarian theme.  I love the Bulgarian half a lot; it's the most memorable part of the soundtrack for me. <br /> <br />THE DARK MARK - A suitably dark, fast-paced song.  Background music, though.  Not memorable. <br /> <br />RITA SKEETER - Bright and perky, like it should be.  I would have liked a perkier remake of GILDEROY LOCKHART (Chamber of Secrets), but this works well for Goblet of Fire's background music. <br /> <br />SIRIUS FIRE - This track has the constant feeling that it's going to jump into faster, darker music-a great use of musical tension that fits well with the movie scene.  It's not much to listen to, though. <br /> <br />HARRY SEES DRAGONS - It sounds like an introduction to GOLDEN EGG, really.  Gentle crescendos, similar to FRANK DIES, until the end becomes darker and could easily explode into GOLDEN EGG (which comes right after in the soundtrack). <br /> <br />GOLDEN EGG - The song I was looking forward to the most in this soundtrack.  I was disappointed at first, like most of the music.  The song is all dark, brooding music, aside from the explosive beginning (which I did like).  However, I was hoping for something more similar to the previous monster-battling themes-DUELING THE BASILISK (Chamber of Secrets), which has become my favorite Harry Potter song, and THE DEMENTORS CONVERGE (Prisoner of Azkaban).  GOLDEN EGG is not bad, not by a long shot, but it is background music.  It has little stand-alone quality.  The music feels far too dark for the scene it is connected to.  Taken away from the movie and the Harry Potter franchise, though, it has some merit. <br /> <br />NEVILLE'S WALTZ and POTTER WALTZ - Both of these songs are basically traditional waltzes.  They aren't very original or memorable, unless you like waltzes. <br /> <br />HARRY IN WINTER - This song finally brings some connection to the original Harry Potter music.  While it doesn't carry over exactly, it is similar to HEDWIG'S THEME (Sorcerer's Stone).  It's a beautiful song and has repeat quality. <br /> <br />THE BLACK LAKE - A very dark piece that works well for the movie's background, but doesn't remind me much of water.  It does have some memorable sequences and seems much more well-done than most of thesoundtrack's major songs. <br /> <br />THE MAZE - This piece came out far too dark as well.  It's not as memorable as THE BLACK LAKE, and I still classify it as merely background music. <br /> <br />VOLDEMORT - For a graveyard scene, this did not inspire the sense of a graveyard at all.  It feels more like a darker, less sporty rehash of GOLDEN EGG.  I have heard several songs that have a definite graveyard feel, especially LYCHFIELD CEMETARY (Fable) and ONE-WINGED ANGEL (Final Fantasy VII).  Both of these incorporated Latin lyrics and dark undertones, while simultaneously throwing in brighter instruments that made them sound very nice.  I think the major problem I had with VOLDEMORT is that there are no choir vocals at all-choir, in my opinion, heightens the sense of drama and despair that this piece should certainly have.  As it is, it is more like nine-minute filler music. <br /> <br />DEATH OF CEDRIC - This song jumps constantly from a beautiful, sad melody to darker music.  The sad music is grating, and would easily get on one's nerves if it was alone.  This is another song that should've had choir, and yet was thrown off by Doyle's lack of it. <br /> <br />ANOTHER YEAR ENDS - This melodic piece plays very nicely.  It is less like background music compared to most of the rest and has higher playback value. <br /> <br />The final three songs were done by the Weird Sisters for the ball scene.  While not necessarily bad, if you like that kind of music, they weren't part of the score and I've never listened to them again after the first time. <br /> <br />Overall, this soundtrack pales in comparison to Williams' works in the previous three movies-but then, who could truly compare to him?  I wish Doyle had tried to keep a Harry Potter feel to the music, though.  His lack of choir also hurt the score badly.  I recommend this only to Harry Potter fans, and those who liked the movie (I'm sure there are some out there).
0618526412|3.0|This book is awfully dull. When I started it, I went around telling everyone how great it was! The two deaf mutes made a funny, quirky couple. Then a second character was introduced: Jake Blount the drunk. His story was interesting also and I really cared about him. But then another and another character are introduced until we get nothing but character introductions and little to link them (they all talk with the deaf guy). There's a side story about a black man who wants his children to grow up as scholars which I found generic. He was so contrived and I couldn't believe how superior the author tried to make him look by having him give a speech about the values of Karl Marx at a Christmas party, while all the other negroes just stood by passively and asked dumb questions. <br /> <br />The book is so boring that at the halfway point there is a shooting of a young girl and I was happy about it! Finally some action! But then nothing becomes of that and we're back to the humdrum story. <br /> <br />To sum up, it was dull, contrived and generic. It was like reading Faulkner for Dummies, with every message slapped in your face instead of implied. <br /> <br />Only recommend as a character study.
0679731369|5.0|I don't have much to add that other reviewers haven't already written.  But I still wanted to comment on how enjoyable and memorable this book is.  I bought \\"Madame Bovary\\" at the same time, but decided to read \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" first. I can't wait to get started on \\"Madame Bovary\\", and hopefully some more of Flaubert's novels.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|When I saw the film, I was stunned. It was a haunting and emotionally moving experience. The soundtrack captures the mood of the film, especially the beautiful instrumentals by Gustavo Santaolalla. Every track on here is great listening, and will stay with you, just as this movie does.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Straight from the hearts, souls and nimble fingertips of The Cure comes Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, an eccentric album of joy, sorrow, anger, dizzy love, and outright insanity.  This, The Cure's 8th studio album, is packed with goodies to suit every mood; from the classic, doom-ridden Goth that made the band famous, to the exceptional '80s synth pop that made them versatile, and everywhere in between.  Every song is interesting, to say the least, and most are outright gems. <br /> <br />1. The Kiss <br /> <br />An interesting choice for the opening track on the album, The Kiss is tense, dramatic and eager.  It follows the format of many previous Cure songs: long, Gothic intro, followed by a short set of lyrics and a fadeout.   <br /> <br />The Kiss chronicles a bitter, sadistic connection, and a sexual relationship that is used to express hate and contempt, designed to hurt and maim, rather than the sharing of a beautiful, mutual love and respect.   <br /> <br />It's an intense listen, but it effectively lets you know what to expect from the album; it tells you that Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me isn't just a collection of silly pop works. <br /> <br /> <br />2. Catch <br /> <br />A sure departure from the previous track, Catch is a sweet, sad tale of an unrequited crush.  Robert Smith's voice is melodious and gentle, gliding reflectively along the innocent, cute lyrics.  The smooth, easy guitar work, punchy percussion and bittersweet strings pull you into the mind of a man who is reminiscing about (and longing for) a strange, untouchable girl.  A mellow pop ditty that you'll find yourself humming all day, this one was meant for the couple's skate at a roller rink. <br /> <br /> <br />3. Torture <br /> <br />What do you do when you know that someone is a poisonous creature who can do you know good, but is so infectious that you can't give them up?   <br /> <br />Torture is a tale of spending one more night with such a person, and is delivered with just the sort of excellent, driving bass line and howling, provocative vocals that people have come to love and expect from The Cure.  The momentum is great; you can feel the sweet torture for yourself. <br /> <br /> <br />4. If Only Tonight We Could Sleep <br /> <br />A crawling, crazed wish for peace and beauty in an ugly, dissatisfying world.  With despairing instrumentals infused with Middle Eastern style, and vocals full of lament and sorrow, this experimental track will handily complement any reflective mood.  <br /> <br /> <br />5. Why Can't I Be You? <br /> <br />Why Can't I Be You is the first really upbeat song on the album, and one of The Cure's most synthed-up works.  The sound is magnificently big, making it almost impossible to keep from bopping around in your chair, and almost as difficult to keep yourself from jumping up and dancing. <br /> <br />The lyrics do a great job at telling of someone who is so incredibly beautiful and perfect that the singer and listener alike have to wonder what it would be like to be so grand.   <br /> <br /> <br />6. How Beautiful You Are <br /> <br />Don't let the title throw you... this is no \\"Your Song\\".  This track is about falling out of love. <br /> <br />The story follows a young couple walking hand in hand in Paris.  When confronted by a poor family who admires the girl's beauty, she views them with disgust and contempt.  How Beautiful You Are is a telling of how selfishness and disrespect can tear a couple apart. <br /> <br />The involved bass work, punky guitar stylings and generous sprinklings of classical violin, piano and accordion will pull you into a decaying Parisian street at sunset, and the passionate emotions behind the couple's interaction.  Robert Smith's staccato vocals may throw you at first, but after a listen, you'll realize that they are needed to express the intense heartbreak and disappointment behind the lyrics. <br /> <br />Catch, Why Can't I Be You, Just Like Heaven and Hot Hot Hot where the four tracks from thisalbum that were chosen to be made into singles.  Though they are all excellent songs, How Beautiful You Are deserved to be in the mix.  It is truly a masterpiece, and, though it's difficult for me to choose a song from the album to be my favorite, this might be it.   <br /> <br /> <br />7. The Snakepit <br /> <br />Hisses, rattle and booms set the mood for this pensive anthem of dissatisfaction and contempt.  The lyrics follow the realization that the storyteller is leading a hollow, empty life; an existence without meaning.  Though he's surrounded by party animals and having a stereotypically \\"good time\\", he is drowned in the shallow pointlessness of it all.   <br /> <br />This is a great listen for the days when you just need a breather. <br /> <br /> <br />8. Just Like Heaven <br /> <br />Pure magic.  Just Like Heaven is a love song filled with ingenuity and wonder.  By far the most atmospheric track on the album, The Cure brings you out into the open with this gorgeous work.  A fresh, clear blend of acoustic guitar and rolling drums, sprinkled throughout with light synth work and simple piano, sets you atop a seaside cliff for a beautiful day with a loved one.  Robert Smith's vocals on this track are the clearest and brightest on the album.  Pure, clean and elegant, this spinning ode to amour will make you want to lock lips with the nearest person. <br /> <br /> <br />9. All I Want <br /> <br />Pure sexuality, expressed without profanity, is a rare thing to be found in modern music.  But the band pulls it off in this soaring, aching track.  All the storyteller wants is to be with the one person who makes him feel sane and complete. <br /> <br />The highlight of this song, is, without a doubt, the excellent, garage-inspired (or inspiring?) guitar work.  A listen would suggest that this one sounds even better in an arena.  <br /> <br /> <br />10.  Hot Hot Hot!!! <br /> <br />An undeniably dance worthy funk work.  Hot Hot Hot sounds almost like an inspiration for Red Hot Chili Peppers.  The tight, punky guitar strumming, orchestra-inspired synthesizers and strong, domineering bass are the perfect sounds to complement this obscure song.  Robert Smith's fevered, quavering vocals are meant to symbolize a man who has been struck by lightning, and, from what I can guess, they are apt.  With lots of bounce and energy, this track parties down deliciously. <br /> <br /> <br />11.  One More Time <br /> <br />An ode to child-like wonder, in true arena ballad fashion.  With playful flute work, sparse, booming drums, and a soft guitar riff, this song is a strange break from the extreme pop, doom-ridden Goth and acoustic rock that comprises most of the album.  It is an interesting, mellow, cute little tune, which might remind listeners of the soundtrack from Never Ending Story. <br /> <br /> <br />12.  Like Cockatoos <br /> <br />Knocking, busy percussion, steady acoustic strumming and a sliding bass line help set the perfect \\"the end\\" mood for this rainy day break up song.  In the dead of night, under a pouring rain, a man promises never to speak to his lover again.  Though we're never told what she did to upset him, the city background noises and closing orchestral work somehow serve to make you glad he's leaving her. <br /> <br /> <br />13.  Icing Sugar <br /> <br />Weird, man.  The Cure glorifies urgent, girlish adolescent lust with furious drumbeats, screeching saxophone notes and a quick set of lyrics, delivered breathlessly.  Hot, heavy, fast and naughty, you might need to take a few deep breaths after hearing this trippy ditty. <br /> <br /> <br />14.  The Perfect Girl <br /> <br />She really is!  Sweet strings and tinkling piano mix gorgeously with bopping drums and simple, steady guitar work, while a harpsichord further convinces us of The Cure's originality.  Robert croons madly over a strange girl, whom he finds himself falling in love with.  Strange looking, strange acting, and completely out of this world, she's a breath offresh air, just like the song that was written for her.  Beware of the power of this song: it has been know to cause silly dancing. <br /> <br /> <br />15.  A Thousand Hours <br /> <br />Heartache drives every synth note, even piano strike and every lyric in this sweet, introspective cry of unrequited love.  Every day seems to last a thousand lonely hours when you have devoted yourself to someone who doesn't care. <br /> <br /> <br />16. Shiver and Shake <br /> <br />With superior drumbeats that shimmy effortlessly, and fast, angsty guitar work, this is a worthy ode to fury.  If you've ever met someone whom you wanted to kill, you can appreciate the curt, indignant lyrics and passionate animosity epitomized here. <br /> <br /> <br />17. Fight <br /> <br />The Cure's unprecedented venture in powerhouse rock begs you to never give up when the world turns on you. Robert Smith basically yells at the listener, but his reasons are justified.  Stabbing, continuous synth notes, pushing lyrics and cutting guitar bring home a sense of resolution.  Fight is a great closing track, with a great message.  Never give in to pain and sorrow. <br /> <br /> <br />Though each track is unique, they seem to belong together, like a wonderfully dysfunctional family.  Each song glides elegantly along our musical palates, as every work is relevant to what every person has felt at one point in time.  Whether you choose to imbibe a few tracks at a time, or go for the gold and devour each song at once, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is a true anytime listen, and a sure new wave masterpiece.
B000BJS4BM|3.0|I'm not really sure what to do with this cd.... the \\"special edition\\" doesn't really come with a case to keep it in, and it's not really good enough to leave in my cd player all the time........ not Madonna's best work, although..... it is better than most of the digital pollution floatin' around these days
B00005JL78|3.0|A very sleek and beautifully shot piece by Spielberg who does once again take a step farther away from what he is so known for.   Like Total Recall, and Blade Runner before it, the story was adapted from the work of Philip K. Dick and like those films it offers many interesting subjects that can be viewed as challenging. <br /> <br />I am not a fan of Tom Cruise, who to me, doesn't really bring much to this role, however he does not ruin this piece.   I find myself unfairly judging this film because it isn't Blade Runner, and because it wasn't done by a modern visionary like Steven Soderbergh or the wonderful and overrated (as of now anyway) Darren Aronofsky.   I recommed this highly for anyone who enjoys somewhat intelligent sci-fi, while the film hipster may find way too many flaws to be able to enjoy this, the average Joe may like it a lot. <br /> <br />Don't expect Blade Runner, but do expect possibly one of the closest films to date to get the cyberpunk energy right, so just sit back and enjoy this as Hollywood fluff with just a little bit of artistic integrity behind it and you will enjoy. <br /> <br />-Thomas Galasso
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Um, amazing. <br />Thats it. <br />Buy this movie.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|I see a number of essay-length reviews of this movie, which makes sense, as the movie is indeed deep and complex - yet for the sake of those simply seeking a concise review, I will keep it brief.    The movie has a dark and uncollected tone.  Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznick, a man who is unable to sleep and who has become malnourished and emaciated.  His inability to sleep causes him great trouble and leads him in and out of reality until he is brought back to the source - that which has caused his troubles and his insomnia: his guilt.    Bale gives an unbelievable performance in this film.  I can't imagine it ever being worth what he did to himself physically, though.  He simply starved himself for the role.  You would think this would have horrible repercussions (and I'm sure it did), yet he seemed to have made a full recovery by the time he played Bruce Wayne in Batman.
B000063DHL|4.0|Originally released in fall, 1986 as 'Somewhere In Time' looks to be Maiden's sixth studio lp. In my humble opinion, it's about as potent as their previous efforts like 'Number Of The Beast', 'Piece Of Mind' or 'Powerslave'. But these British merchants of metal mayhem seem to have put out SO many releases now, I've sort of lost track. Best thing about 'Somewhere' is they'd decided to now employ a synthesizer in their sound, very wise move. Tracks I remember the most off this CD reissue are the album's single \\"Wasted Years\\", \\"Sea Of Madness\\", \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" (love the old MTV video) and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\". Cut to the chase, if you were a fan of '80's metal (like I was / still am), then you should check out this catalog title.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Where to begin ?   12 Monkeys is an exceptional work from acclaimed director Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Brothers Grimm, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas etc.), a work that challenges the mind in more ones than most people would like. <br /> <br />The film is loosely based on French filmmaker Chris Marker's silent short La Jetee.  Heavily inspired by the New Wave films of the 1960's most notably Alphaville, 12 Monkeys is a sort of existential science fiction piece one that deals with time travel, biological terrorism, the health system, and paranoia among other things. <br /> <br />We follow mental patient by the name of James Cole (Bruce Willis) who is sent back in time to the 1990's to try and stop events that will lead to an apocalyptic virus that wipes out more than 90% of the Earth's population.  Again I will not spoil this for those who haven't seen it. <br /> <br />From a visual standpoint once again Gilliam proves to be an innovator.  He tends to shot at odd angles which create a sense of discomfort for the average viewer, it heightens the sense of somethng not being right, or not normal.   Again we are treated to many rather odd bits of technology that seem overly complicated and antiquated, another thing that seems to puzzle many viewers.   When the average person thinks of the future they always tend to imagine sleek, beautiful sterile environments but with Gilliam we take a trip back into the Machine Age, back to expressionism. <br /> <br />For those wondering what exactly a man like Bruce Willis does in a science fiction art piece without much action or any one-liners, well...he pulls from his repeated viewings of De Niro in Taxi Driver and creates a very disoriented slightly off, and out of touch main character that at times one cannot tell what his motives truly are.   In essence a very odd character that is full of emotion and raises many questions. <br /> <br />See this if you have not, every film student should be in the know about this Gilliam effort. <br /> <br />-Thomas Galasso
0895260131|5.0|Prompted by the first Gulf War, I have read several scholarly works on Islam and its history.  While Spencer's is more lurid prose than the professors', he is right both on the facts and their interpretation, so far as I can tell.  I believe that any reader ignorant of Islam and its history, will get a true picture of it from this book. <br /> <br />If this book scares you a little, I say that at the right time and for the right reasons, a little fear can be a good thing.  If ever there was a time for this book, now is that time. <br /> <br />Finally, to the reviewer who claims this book slanders Muslims, I would remind him that in any slander case, truth is a complete defense.
0312995423|1.0|This book made me more or less mad with all logical errors and stupid things. I read it all the way, even though I really thought the story sucked. Save your money and time, read something else! <br /> <br />One example of the lack of logic... one of the characters of the book is running through a room where all kinds of alarms and sirens are flashing, roaring and things are almost burning of heat, the air is full of smoke. It is a matter of seconds for the person not to be caught in flames so he's running as fast as he can... and his cell phones rings... so he stops to answer...  <br /> <br />If he at all would hear the phone in the alarming noice (he wouldn't!), would he stop to answer in a situation like this? Nope! Whould he at all be able to hear the other person talk with a 130 decibel siren nearby? No way! <br /> <br />So that's on of the logical errors...
B000B8QF14|4.0|This is a DVD of one of Green Day's first stadium shows ever, and it comes with a CD of all the songs too.  Interspliced with the footage are interviews with all the dudes and some short clips of them doing funny stuff and touring a war museum. <br /> <br />If you like Green Day's live show, you will like this DVD, and it definitely captures the essence/power/emotion of the event.  They play the songs well, but Billie Joe runs around doing the whole rock star \\"HEYYYY, HOOOOOO...\\" thing.  I'm not so into that.  The interviews offer some pretty good insights, but then again, there is some more rock star posturing mixed in there. <br /> <br />Anyway, I liked this DVD/CD combo, and I recommend it to Green Day fans.  It's pretty good overall.
B000003TA2|3.0|This album is not excellent nor is it bad, just good. It's the bands first major label album and it holds it's own. Worth looking into, but overhyped.  <br /> <br />For truly amazing Sonic Youth ablums, look into their 80s career.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I have to say Brokeback Mountain was a really good movie. I knew it was a short story book that came out in 1997 but I had never got around to reading it, so when I heard it was going to be released as a movie I was thrilled. Brokeback Mountain has garnered up many awards and nominations in the past few months. Many people have a problem with the film simply because it is what they call a \\"gay love story\\". This film is about 2 man having to come to terms with the love they feel so strongly for each other in a society that does not accept things that are not considered the norm. In the movie the men marry women and have kids, and try to live as normal life as they can only seeing each other a few times a year on what they refer to as fishing trips. Yet as time passes them both by they never forget how love touched them that one time and is lasting them through there lifetime. I highly recommend this movie and encourage anyone with an open mind to check it out. Brokeback Mountain is a movie about 2 people who fall in love and despite what labels people may give it thats truly what this amazing film is about. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give amazing performances especially Heath. I believe this film is going to sweep the Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards not because it deals with 2 guys who love each other but because of the way it deals with the universal thing we all know and that is 2 people being in Love. Not everone can choose who they choose to love.
B00025ETIW|1.0|many people would agree that I have great taste in music. pretty much one of the many reasons I study music in college, along with being a musician. So listening to this album...I found so much wrong with it, musically. Didn't pay too much attention to the lyrics, but I can say the vocals did not redeem what I heard. Overall, the album is very sloppy. In their songs, they cannot stay on a consistent path or style. Their sound will not give you a chance to set it into your ears before it either goes soft or really loud, and you can't really understand whats going on. Not necessarily my prefered guitar style either. I can't believe Fall Out Boy said this band is better than them. At least Fall Out Boy stays a constant, steady path, with good lyrics, and if they change style, it's at the end, and it actually makes sense. Moral of the story: don't try to make all your songs sound like a quick paced medley, popping in about 10 melodies per song.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|while i have difficulty getting into some Ry Cooder albums, this one is starkly different.  I consider this album to have some of the most important guitar works that i own, the compositions and his guitar tones are immaculate.  This album and of course the Bueno Vista Social Club are the ones that do it for me.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|When we sat down to watch this movie together as a family I was pleasently shocked!  I think all athletes, as well as parents, and coaches should watchi this movie.  It shows the imporatance of an education.  That we shouldn't just push kids through school to get rid of them thatwe should accept OUR responsibilities that we have in life.  I was very impressed expecially since it was based on a true story.  All I can say is Coach Carter thanks to you those boys have something good in their lives!  God Bless you Coach!
0671015206|4.0|This is a good book.  I would recommend it to anyone who feels that they just aren't doing well despite a good income, or for young people just starting out who are interested in financial advice. <br /> <br />The main point of the book is that high net worth individuals don't always have the material trappings of wealth.  In my career I worked for clients worth between 1M-10M and reviewed many of their financial profiles.  The findings in this book are, generally, consistent with my experience.  These people do not all own fabulous houses, they don't all drive the latest model car and they're probably less fixated on the acquisition of consumer goods than the average American.  Of course, the story about the woman who happily sat clipping coupons when her husband told her he'd just given her $8M of stock?  Um, sorry, that's just queer.  As others have mentioned, the anecdotes in this book can be a little bizarre, serving at times to overstate whatever statistical trend the data and analyses have revealed.  That said, I'm glad this book is out there saying what needs to be said: Americans do have a gross misconception about how one gets wealthy and how the wealthy in America live. <br /> <br />I do have one major gripe with the book.  The authors at times step beyond discussing \\"here's what millionaires are like\\" to \\"this is the way you should be.\\"  That is, I think, a huge leap.  The authors assume that anyone reading this book is doing so because their goal is to BE wealthy.  It is true that financial independence and securing a comfortable retirement are important, and accumulating net worth is the only way to get there.  Yet for some reason the authors do not feel the need to even pay lip service to the idea that some of the patterns of millionaire behavior are (or should be) undesirable.  Just as happpiness does not derive from the accumulation of consumer goods, neither does it derive from the accumulation of wealth for the sake of wealth alone.  Does anyone wonder why these authors didn't collect data on the charitable giving of affluent Americans?  The statistics I've seen show that those in higher income groups tend to give less as a proportion of their income than those making less.  This is to be admired?  Emulated?  The authors mention in cursory fashion that receivers of gifts give twice as much to charity as non-receivers.  Yet these authors tend to discourage gifting to individuals because gifts breed ongoing dependence and are often consumed rather than properly invested as they would be in the hands of the donor.  Perhaps giving breeds waste.  But perhaps it also breeds giving.  Maybe those with a propensity to provide \\"economic outpatient care\\" to their children and grandchildren are willing to risk fostering overconsumption if it means that they are are modeling generous behavior that those descendants may emulate.  Perhaps they are teaching them that you should never love your money so much that you won't give it away to someone who needs it more.  Personally, I don't think I would much enjoy the company of the millionaire painted in this book who (in the words of the author) \\"is a tightwad... [and] his own favorite charity.\\"  <br />    <br />Overall, a great book for people looking for financial guidance.  But consider it a book on financial management, not an instruction manual on how to live your life. <br />
0307276902|5.0|It had been a long time since I read such a good memoir.    After reading this book, I was swept over with many emotions.  I felt sad, hopeful, distraught, happy, anguished and content.  It's just that kind of book.  I dont think its the kind that you enjoy or relish.  It's the kind of book that you have to put down quite a few times, because Frey's style of writing takes you to a personal, intimate level, where you almost feel like a voyeur peeking into someone else's daily life. And often you need a break. His writing is intense and passionate, and often morose.  He talks about life, death, god, religion, as if they are mere pawns on a chessboard. His realistic approach to life is haunting, yet so true.      I was bothered to see other people commenting and criticizing Freys portrayal of addiction and how simple his solutions seemed.  This book is a MEMOIR, he's not trying to present truth or accuracy.  He's simply telling us his story, his life for six weeks.  We dont need to relate to him to understand his struggle.  Everyone deals with addictions and traumas differently.  This was Freys way.  If you want a book about facts and statistics, then get an informational booklet or pamphlet at the nearest clinic, but don't expect that in this book.  This book is about more than just a man's addiction to drugs and alcohol.  It's about a man's struggle with himself.  A man's desire to be whole, to be loved, to be free again.    If you like books that touch your heart, and change how you see life if only for a brief moment, then read this.
B000CSH800|5.0|This is a heavy, well made watch that I wear all the time. I never have to set it because it is fully automatic.I liked the Seiko  SKX007 model so well that I bought another diving watch from Seiko, the SKX009 model. I can depend on these watches because I work outside in all types of weather. Also, the bands are made of heavy duty rubber. A real tough watch. I bought my first Seiko in 1969. It was an automatic that ran for 23 YEARS, before it stopped. Took it to a Seiko dealer, who fixed it and it is still running today.
0307276902|1.0|If it were possible to rate this book NO stars, I would have done so. All you need to know about this book is that its a complete FAKE that has been exposed by TheSmokingGun.com. They checked police records to verify events described in the book and discovered that Frey made them up. This fooled Oprah and millions of readers, and made the guy wealthy and famous. As TSG states, the publisher must have known this too, since the book was first submitted to them as fiction and was rejected. When re-submitted as NON-fiction, they published it. Don't waste your money on such trash.
0062502182|5.0|When someone sees the same people every day, ..., they wind up becoming a part of that person's life, and they want the person to change. If someone isn't what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own. <br />At a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.  <br />When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.  <br />If you start out by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose desire to work toward getting it.  <br />When each day is the same as the next, it's because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that sun rises.  <br />It's called the principle of favorability. When you play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner's luck. ... There is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend; it whets your appetite with taste of success. <br />You cannot trust a man if you don't know his house. <br />Every blessing ignored becomes a curse. <br />When someone makes a decision, he really is diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.  <br />Intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it's al written there.  <br />Those who have responsibility for understanding can understand.  <br />If you can concentrate always on the present, you'll be a happy man.  <br />Revolver ... Helped me to trust in people.  <br />Now I'm beginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I'm happy at least I didn't wait twenty years.  <br />He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn't separate them. <br />When you are in love, things make even more sense.  <br />If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better.  <br />That whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them. <br />To die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day.  <br />Courage is the quality most important to understanding the Language of the World.  <br />It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil, ...It's what comes out of their mouth that is.  <br />Love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it's because it wasn't true love. <br />One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.  <br />There is only one way to learn, ...It's through action.  <br />Wherever your heart is, that is where you'll find your treasure.  <br />Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say. ...That way, you'll never have to fear an unanticipated blow.  <br />People are afraid tom pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them.  <br />Tell your heart that fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.  <br />Every search begins with beginner's luck. And every search ends with the victor's being severely tested. The darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.  <br />When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.  <br />Your eyes show the strength of your soul.  <br />When someone evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well.  <br />Anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own. <br />There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure. <br />Usually the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives. <br />The world is only visible aspect of God. <br />When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there's no need at all to understand what's happening, because everything happens within you. <br />You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance. <br />When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.  <br />When we love, we always strive to become better that we are.  <br />Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.  <br />No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.  <br />Be aware of place where you are brought to tears. ... that's where your treasure is. <br />
B00097DXZS|2.0|When I first heard Supernatural I immediately knew it was going to be a classic. Then, Shamman came and, although good music, it turned out to be a little boring. You never know with Santana so I was eagerly awaiting what the master himself was conjuring for a new album.  \\"All That I Am\\" came and, as an old Santana fan for over 30 years, I went ahead, without reading the reviews, and bought it.  The album pleasurably starts with a a-la-Santeria song. Nothing better to commence an album moyubando the Orishas. But then, it goes downhill with pop-rock radio music. Why does it have to be that way? I still have hopes that Santana will surprise all of us with his next album. He needs to do it so he can reconnect with his musical roots.
0806930152|5.0|I would rate this ten stars if I could. Speaking as someone who has gone to some school and trying to complete my portfolio through books and tutorials, this book is absolutely indispensable. Its a little hard to understand as navarro states earlier. But once you actually work through an exercise, any exercise, his method clicks very quickly and easily. I am amazed by the amount I learn and skill I gain with every page of this book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in any area of art.
B00000099Y|5.0|STAY AWAY from this product of sheer genius, it's highly addictive!!! There should be a health warning on this, not a crappy warning against \\"explicit lyrics\\". What is that anyway? Ever watch MTV these days? No, me neither. Bummer, could've told you about the you-know-what \\"artists\\" showing y'all how to you-know-what fully dressed and in groups...  <br />Back to \\"Aenima\\": bought it the day it came out and it still is my favorite album. Maybe it's my ONLY album? Uhhhmmm, nope. Hardly.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I had purchased this upon hearing from some friends about an Opeth release that will totally surprise me. It is excellent for those kind of gray slight chill in the air nights. This c d is perfect and stll loyal to Opeth fans.Im not going to go into long detail,you'll just have to buy it.This is what music is really about.....surprise.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This film is two fantasies in one.  The first half of the film is a romantic comedy.  Guido's (Roberto Begnini) car breaks down and he meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) at her family farm.  For him it's love at first sight but he will never see his \\"princi pessa\\" again.  He continues to Rome to work for his uncle as a waiter.  And who does he run into, Dora.  He sees Dora again at the restaurant.  The only problem is it's her engagement party.  This does not deter Guido and he pursues her and eventually wins her love. <br /> <br />Five year passes and Guido and Dora are deliriously happy and they have a son.  The only problem is WWII and Italy's alliance with Germany.  Fascism and anti-Semitism are in full swing.  Guido does everything to protect his son from this.  But eventually, it becomes too real and he and his son are deported to a concentration camp.  Dora, who is Catholic, will not let her two men go alone and she goes with them.  (This is where I have a small issue, as she is Catholic, the boy would have been raised Catholic and I don't think the church would have let the boy be deported). <br /> <br />They arrive at the camp and the Guido and his son are separated from Dora.  Guido is warned not the let the boy leave the barracks.  Guido tells the boy that this is a game and tells him the rules, including that the winner gets a tank (This is a hilarious scene.)  Guido does everything to shield the boy from the reality.  Eventually, the Americans liberate the camp. <br /> <br />The one thing that I hated about the film was the ending but this film cannot have a truly satisfying ending.  Therefore, you have to live with the ending. <br /> <br />As I stated at the beginning, this is a fantasy.  The second half of the film could never happen but this is a film about love and you must look at the film from this point of view.  The moral is that with love anything can be accomplished and that is why Life is Beautiful.  This is a great film and must be seen by everyone. <br /> <br />Note: I have only seen the subtitled version and have been told that the dubbed is not as good but still is excellent.   <br /> <br />DVD EXTRA:  Making Life Beautiful - A 23 minute making of featurette with interviews with stars Roberto Begnini and Nicoletta Braschi and actors Walter Matthau (costar of Little Devil) and Michael Keaton. It also includes a bio on Begnini. <br />The only thing they missed was his wonderful Oscar acceptance speech!
B00005JNTX|4.0|The Bruce Willis section didn't do anything for me.  I thought the sections with Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke were much better and more fun to watch.  It truly is a wild ride!  Very creative movie.  They could have made a whole movie with the Mickey Rourke character.

0307276902|3.0|OK I admit, I bought the book because of Oprah. I hope she doesn't say tomorrow that it is healthy to eat lard from a jar, because before this book, I just may have done it. My wake up call. This book is just ok. Nothing special. As a matter of fact it took me over a month to read it because it was so darn repetitive I couldn't get through it. Yes there are some great parts, and the sequal My Friend Leonard, far surpasses this book, but it is not the \\"great\\" book Oprah declares. Perhaps she saw some of her own addictions with food in this book and how it overtook her life. I dunno. In any event, it was ok, a bit long and a bit boring. If you get this book, get it to understand the characters for the sequal My Friend Leonard, it is MUCH better.
B000002U82|5.0|This is THE album. Pink Floyd are by far one of the best bands ever, and for good reasons. Dark Side Of The Moon was definately their best album but my favorite will always remain Wish You Were Here. The sounds on this album are anything but filler(as many people would insist), they all mean something and fit into the songs and make them very good. Time is by far my favorite song on Dark Side. The guitar solo from Dave is kick @$$, and the lyrics are something we can all relate to. Money is the highlight of the album with its bluesy tune and slezzy sax solo-along with a killer solo from Dave. Us and Them is another amazing song... quite possibly the best song Pink Floyd has EVER made! Brain Damage is terribly underrated. It talks about someone lurching into insanity. Eclipse sums the album up-one of the ONLY  song that can be repetitive yet still be amazing.<br /><br /> Dark Side has sold 15million untis in the US, and 40million worldide. This is, by no means, an album for potheads(the people who say this is a pothead album are the ones doing pot, for it's the only explanation for disliking such an amazing album). Some say that the Dark Side of The Moon is about the war, others say it's about the cycle of life; but the truth is: nobody knows what it's really about. I wouldn't be surprised if Roger Waters himslef said he didn't know what it's about. My favorite songs on Dark Side are Time, Any Colour You Like, and Us and Them. Of course, all the songs are incredible and deserve a listening.<br /><br /> Ignore all the 1-star reviewers. They are either emos or losers whose religion is MTV and think that Ashlee Simpson created rock 'n' roll. This is a musical JOURNEY, and deserves to be owned by every last person on the planet. Buy this. buy this as soon as you can. You'll never look at music the same way again...
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Enya has been in my music library and often in my cd changer since 1987. I have to say that I am a huge fan and it is hard for me to be overly critical of her, since I think everything she sings is golden. However, this cd leaves me with a big question mark. Yes, some of the songs are classic Enya, but most of the songs are in english and that is not classic Enya.  I hate to say that this cd doesn't have the feel of her whole heart and soul as do her previous albums. Perhaps this cd was rushed as Enya fans (like me) waited five patient years? In any event, I do need to give the cd more time and perhaps in a month or year, I will change my tune about this album. But, for now, it is not her best. If you are new to Enya, start with Watermark or A day without rain, both are A+++.
B000AP04FG|1.0|A Brad Pitt fan, I looked forward to this movie. <br /> <br />After viewing it, it was one of the few movies I put in my discard pile. <br /> <br />The plot was very thin, the special effects and noise were too much, and the overall impact was utter disappointment.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved the movie. I loved the few episodes I saw on TV. I started watching the TV shows because Alan Tudyk was in it, and I loved him in everything I had ever seen him in.  <br /> <br />I didn't see all of the episodes and forgot about it when it wasn't on TV anymore.  Then I saw the trailers for the movie.  I wait for movies to come out on DVD then watch them at home.  At last, there the DVD was, and I bought it.   <br /> <br />I loved it.  Watched it twice, within a few days. Then I bought the Firefly complete series.  I love everything about this.  The humor, the characters... loved it all. <br /> <br />I can't wait for more.  I'll take movies, tv series or books.  I loved it, and these characters are so alive.  I couldn't believe that the \\"Wash\\" character was killed, especially since that is why I started watching in the first place.  The character to kill to me would have been Simon.  He was kind of flat, but oh well.  I still love it.   <br /> <br />The only complaint I have about this is the amount of profanity in the bonus features, and the kids can get to that.  I watched a bonus feature with my nine year old daughter and Nathan dropped a big fat ugly word before I could turn it off.   <br /> <br />That issue is not singular to the serentiy/firefly dvds... its an issue in general.  And no, my nine year old didn't watch the movie or series, I was just looking at the bonus features when she walked into the room.

B00005JL2O|3.0|Mike Myers, next time you make an Austin Powers film, do not have pop star idiots. Beyonce absolutely sucks playing Foxxy Cleopatra. they should have used Diana Ross or any other African-American girl that sung in the Seventies. Beyonce was born in 1982. what does she have to do with the 1970's ? I said it before, and i'll say it again: Destiny's Child SUCKS! and I'll say this for the record: Britney Spears SUCKS too!
B0000024IE|4.0|Nah. But Fear of a Black Planet is Public Enemy's most focused, commercially successful, and controversial album. In fact - trim off some of the fat here and you've got one of the best rap records ever.<br /><br />The album kicks off with my personal favourite PE track, Brothers Gonna Work It Out, a high-octane track with loud bells and screaming guitar licks; musically dense as a track off It Takes a Nation, yet, a little more polished. Another Bomb Squad production masterpiece and Chuck does his thing once again. This song loudly screams, \\"PE IS BACK\\". While the rest of the album doesn't quite live up to Brothers Gonna Work It Out, that's similar to saying Nas never lived up to Illmatic, because this is a top-notch album. Welcome to the Terrordome and the title-track, Fear of a Black Planet are both classic PE tracks, and War at 33 1/3 sounds about as urgent as a timebomb. Flava Flav gets ample chances to shine on a couple of tracks as well; mocking the police on 911 is a Joke, and just cold lampin' on Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man.<br /><br />And what would this album be - (or what would PE be, for that matter) - without the finishing blow on this album, Fight the Power; perhaps the quintessential PE track. Highly, highly recommended, but It Takes a Nation of Millions is better.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Anyone whose seen Batman Begins probably didn't notice the score in the background that much until the movie's credits. It is there that I desired to get the score for this outstanding film (Ironically before the movie). That said, Hans Zimer and James Newton Howard created a stunning score that is worthy of anyone's collection of scores. The music ranges from silent, mournful, terrifying, and grippingly full of pulsating action with most of the tracks that play the Begins theme with such strength its hard not to become giddy over the mere hint of it. There are 12 tracks in total. All them quite lengthy in their own right and never sound as though they've been cut short for the soundtrack (much like my favorite soundtracks \\"Fellowship of the ring\\" - \\"The Two Towers\\" - and \\"The Return of The King.\\"         Howard Shore's score is simply amazing as a stand alone, even after the film is over. The fact that the best of this score played in the movies weren't included in the soundtrack as well bothered me). Though the only gripe I have and its a numb one, is that they didn't include the end titles theme from the end of the movie; It showcased some of the best filler music in the film (excluding the cue used when Batman struggles to get aboard the train his father built to stop Ra's). The sound affects add atmosphere to the already creepy soundtracks that reminded me of Arkham and the Scarecrow. However, its hard to tell what track played in a particular scene due to the technical bat-named tracks (and the reason as described above), which isn't a bad thing. I mean it certainly is better than \\"Rachel in Arkham\\" or \\"Batman Battles Ra's al Ghul\\" if you know what I mean. So the track names have me guessing which ones I was listening to since I don't have them memorized in my head that well. Speaking of tracks:        (1). Vespertilio - The introduction of the film as well as the soundtrack. A nice starting to begin with that slowly eases into the theme of the song that will be the most heard of in the soundtrack aside from sweet melodic theme used to indicate Bruce's memories, Rachel, or his parents. It really gives you a sense of determination in Bruce Wayne (in my opinion) and what he readies himself to do for Gotham. 5/5          (2). Eptesicus - Bruce and the aftermath of his incident in the well and another assortment of melancholy moments in the film. As mentioned before, this is a beautifully composed melody that sends a sort of reminiscent feeling through me. The best part of Eptesicus is when the Begins theme rises slowly in volume and doesn't cease to do so until the end of the track. - 5/5          (3). Myotis - My second absolute favorite track on the soundtrack. You literally can illustrate the scene in your mind in which Bruce denies his right to join the league of shadows by refusing to execute the farmer that became the murderer. With a slow and ominous start of things to come, once Myotis throws you into its action theme (in its entirety), its hard to keep from pressing the 'repeat' button just hear it again. In spite of the musical breaks between the action that shifts to different rift, Myotis is the best action track next to \\"Molossus.\\" - 5/5          (4). Barbastella - Barbastella is relatively long in feeling for me, so I do no know where it ends of where it begins. I enjoy it nevertheless. This track empathizes on the angsty and slightly vocalized theme of Bruce's parent's death in the alley at the beginning and his short time spent at Gotham P.D. with fellow police officer Jim Gordon. The theme kicks in once again, but this time with much more passion and strength behind it. From there the more darker tone of Batman Begins kicks in. I enjoyed this one overall.  - 4/5          (5). Artibeus - Introduction to Batman's full costumed appearance and the fall of Carmine Falcone. Unwittingly this track made me jump in fright with the beat of the sound affects which overpowered the sparse music one some notes. It falls into the dramatic melody once again when the sound effects are said and done. Its a nicely crafted track for the most part, but it simply wets your tongue for the tracks following after it. - 3/5          (6). Tadarida - I basically dubbed this the \\"Scarecrow theme,\\" due to the scene where Batman is caught off guard by Jonathan crane and is gassed by the toxin that causes delirium of sorts. The beginning starts off with another sweet and sorrowful melody before falling into the darker tone set. The sound effects are heavily empathized in this track in a second before the music kicks back in and recreates the atmosphere of that scene through your speakers. - 5/5          (7). Macrotus - This track sounds like a simple assortment cues from scenes to which I cannot remember clearly. Its over seven minutes long in length, the cellos used in this track intensify with volume with every note taken. The theme of Bruce's memories of his parents and Rachel plays out the strongest in \\"Macrotus.\\" The league of shadows scenes is heard afterward (when Bruce faces his second to last test: facing his fears). - 5/5          (8). Antrozous -  \\"Antrozous\\" is a warm up to the two tracks after it. The action theme roars to life at the beginning of the track, with a slow paced beginning (Bruce reveals himself to Rachel) before diving head first into the pumping theme that ends far too quickly in my opinion, boiling down to slight calm. - 4/5          (9). Nycteris - Introduction to Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne's meeting. This track carries a sort of espionage type tune at the beginning that more than a real treat to listen to. - 4/5          (10). Molossus - My first absolute favorite track on the Batman Begins soundtrack. For the entire four plus minutes it's nothing much non-stop pulsating action orchestrated wonderfully by Zimer and Howard. Carries tunes of the climax of the film and the TUMBLER (sighs) scene, it simply sends excited chills down my spine everytime I hear it. - 5/5(11). Corynorhinus - This is basically prelude to the end of Batman Begins, the memory/Rachel and Bruce theme can be heard with a major change to it and the best part of the end when Batman converses with Jim Gordon on the rooftop is also included in this track. Its easily my third favorite track on the CD. - 5/5        (12). Lasiurus - I'm not really sure what to say about \\"Lasiurus,\\" in all honesty. Its not my favorite track and the cellos can be a bit overpowering and loud (even with the volume down a bit) at times on the speaks of the radio. Of course that's not say that its a horrible track, on the contrary. There are stronger emotionally moving moments in this track than the whole CD put together. But the last track is rather hard to identify thus, making it a half-and-half situation in some cases. On a final note \\"Larisurus\\" ends repeating the very introduction and Batman Introduction to Faclone aftermath in such a cool way, that I'm glad it ends on such a note.        All in all, \\"Batman Begins\\" is an excellent buy for those looking for a major change in the Superhero score department. Its defiantly not fore die-hard Elfman(?) fans looking for the overused Batman theme from the previous two original movies directed by Burton and the animated series. Batman Begins It certainly wouldn't have you questioning your spent money like \\"Spier-Man/2\\", \\"X2\\" (I recommend buying Michael Kamen's \\"X-Men\\" score over that) \\"Fantastic Four\\" or \\"Superman\\" would. ----- [a 5 out of 5]
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of the most exciting and thought provoking movies that I have ever seen.  At times it is very spooky, and the first part of the film started to give me the shivers ... why is that girl following Joel on the beach ... why did that person approach Joel in his car (we later discover why).<br /><br />For me, this story has some important messages, for example:<br /><br />How can a man who is obviously talented and inteliigent discover some meaning in his otherwise dull life?  (answer - find a weird girl to love and respect).<br /><br />How can you toss aside all the layers of tedious, boring and unpleasant memories to reveal those memories which really mean something to you?  Too often, our thoughts are full of unhappy memories which do nothing to affirm our lives and relationships, when deep down there are valued memories which can brighten our hearts.  (answer, you must try hard and dig deep to recover those memories)<br /><br />A wonderful positive film with a serious positive message.  I found John Malkovich too negative for my liking, though equally powerful.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This movie was my favorite of last year... a joyous account of love, peace, and bohemia that resonated powerfully with me and with others. (It's a shame that Ebert, and the other critics ravaged this fine piece of work, that showcased Chris Columbus's best directing yet... and yet the Golden Globes and other critics loved the ghastly film version of \\"The Producers\\", the Globes providing it with nods for Best Pic, Actor, Supporting Actor, and Best Song.) <br /> <br />My personal wish for Sony is that you will release it on a collectors edition, and not go bare-bones with it. Please, please, please give the people who loved the film a joyous amount of material. Last years \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", if you remember, was similarly ravaged by critics, yet audiences found it, and while it didn't make a great amount of money at the box office (though 50 million is rather good nowadays), it became one of the top sellers this year at Amazon.com. <br /> <br />Sony... please release this, and please go full out. <br />And please don't forget Rosario doing \\"Goodbye Love.\\" If anything, please don't forget that.

0780622650|2.0|Mis-cast, badly written, and little if any direction made this movie seriously disappointing for the Lost In Space and science fiction fans alike.  <br />William Hurt stars as the father of a family who volunteered (by the father) to be put into suspended animation on a spaceship headed for the other end of the galaxy to habit (and eventually ruin) yet another planet.  His wife is played by actress Mimi Rogers. These two have less chemistry together than your average glass of tap water from New Jersey.  <br />Enter undersexed pilot, Joey Tribiani, I mean, Don West, played no where NEAR the tv character by Matt LeBlanc, who is ordered to fly the ship to its destination.  He uses this as a lame excuse to make the worst come-on lines ever to Judy Robinson, played by rollergirl Heather Graham.  The other two kids (Lacey Chabert as Penny and Jack Johnson [not the singer] as Will) seem to be directed to be annoying throughout the entire movie.  Lord PLEASE let Lacey grow out of that annoying nasal voice of hers.  <br />About the only good thing in the movie is Dr. Smith portrayed by Gary Oldman.  But not even Gary's acting can save this stinker.  <br />The dvd extras are a lot more interesting than the movie.  There are 'Where are they now' updates on the tv cast of Lost In Space, as well as a list of the tv episodes and synopses.  <br />June Lockhart, Veronica Cartwright, Marta Kristen, and Mark Goddard make cameo appearances in the movie; but, they're smart enough to keep them short.  <br />Movie warnings: bad writing, editing, and directing, scenes that don't make sense together, and possible nausea after viewing this movie.  Ack!  <br />
0446577383|1.0|First let me say that I have liked \\"Last man standing\\" and \\"Split Second\\" by Baldacci.  Camel Club is a hack effort.  Having terrorist that don't kill? Nuclear warfare that looses communication and has no redundancy?  A bad guy (Carter Grey) who pays for- killing the lead characters family (Oliver Stone), ruining countless lives, and wants to kill the president- his major act of redemption is resignation???  Aldelphia is never really explained and developed as a charachter.  why is she so anti-abortion?  I was very disapointed.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|If you can fast forward through 3/4 of the movie, the remaining bit will shock and stay with you.  The majority of the film that you'll be skipping will include: driving, driving, oh, and more of Vincent driving. The shocking parts will include a gangbang and fellatio.   Unforgettable yet forgettable...all at once.  Quite a feat.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|You will se many reviews in this space about how Muse \\"sounds like radiohead\\".  True, they do sound like Radiohead circa 1995.  They also have a propensity to be bombastic, self-absorbed, paranoid, and a tad pretentious.  Let's be honest, however, those are ingredients for great music; which is exactly what Muse is.   <br /> <br />Alternating between hard rock and complex instrumentation, Muse creates soundscapes which have the ability to engage the listener.  The songs also have good hooks, which makes this album particularly fun to listen to over and over again. <br /> <br />If you like Brit-rock and are in search of something new (but not totally original) to listen to... this is your ticket.
0380713802|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. Bill Bryson is undoubtedly a very witty writer and somewhat open to adventures (although it would be nice if he could tackle at least one foreign language in all of these years of \\"Weltenbummeln\\"). Unfortunately, he often comes across as the very sort of narrow-minded American tourist that he himself criticizes with gusto. He goes for the usual cheap shots of calling all Parisians snotty, as well as bringing up Nazi war crimes when confronting Germans. The worst part for me was when he was fed up with the French (who deigned not to speak his native tongue) and wanted to \\"remind them that we liberated them\\". (When will this whinging war cry ever end?! When are the other Allies EVER going to get any credit?) This is precisely the sort of smug behaviour that makes Americans universally detested abroad. Sure, he often changes his mind and mellows out after a few beers and a good meal, but those comments sting, and I'm not even European (I just live here). <br /> <br />I suspect that this book would have had a less isolated and more entertaining tone if Mr. Bryson had taken the beloved Katz along for the ride. Now that would make a great book!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I'm a Joss Whedon fan but not a browncoat. I'd never seen Firefly and was a bit skittish about going into Serenity knowing none of the backstory. But by and large it didn't hurt. I'm sure there'd be much more subtext to many parts of the film but it stands fairly well on its own. My only gripes are about some scenes in which you cannot understand the dialog (and I'm not talking about the Chinese bits!)<br /><br />I am somewhat amused but mostly dumbfounded by people saying \\"If Serenity were any good, it would have made more money in theaters. Therefore, why bother seeing it?\\" That's so foolish. It's like saying the big, delicious hamburgers at the corner diner can't be better than a Big Muck because if they were they'd be selling billions of the diner burgers instead. Well, just because one product has better marketing and more people consume it doesn't mean it's of higher quality.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me is the unknown actor factor. One reviewer here gave Serenity's cast an unintentional back-handed compliment by saying, \\"Even though I knew virtually nobody from the movie ... the fact that I was unfamiliar with most of them did not bother me.\\" This mindset (\\"Even though they weren't overused famous people, they did alright\\") is at the heart of why good movies rarely get made and also why you see the same 15 actors in every major studio release. The average moviegoer, when given a selection of movies to attend, doesn't ask \\"What's it about?\\" or \\"What happens in it?\\" They ask \\"Who's in it?\\" as if that will automatically make it good or bad. It's obvious that many people looked at Serenity's ads, saw no recognizable names, and said \\"What else is on?\\" This killed its box office take. If Whedon had recast it with Owen Wilson as Mal, Halle Berry as Zoe, and Ashlee Simpson as River it would have done three times the business. But it would not have been a better movie. It would have been worse. They aren't right for those roles! Familiar faces can get in the way of the story. You end up watching their prepackaged persona, not the character as it was imagined. For example, in The Fugitive (which I liked by the way) you never once felt you were watching a medical doctor on the lam. You were watching \\"Harrison Ford\\" fighting bad guys.<br /><br />My point is this: Don't follow the media hype. Try the diner down the street versus the prefab burger joint. You may like it. You may not. But at least you thought for yourself.ory. You end up watching their prepackaged persona, not the character as it was imagined.

0802130208|5.0|This book presents the story of a slovenly but educated young man living in New Orleans, suffering the slings and arrows of a world that doesn't understand his superior intellect. He abuses his mother and any other poor soul that crosses his path. In his travels he interacts with a cast of characters that shows us how much he can twist simple expectations of him into assaults on his distorted view of the world and gastric health.<br /><br />John Kennedy Toole put together a  brilliant book bringing characters to life in a way you can see and hear them. Some may find his characters negative stereotypes and possibly offensive; I believe these are just characters in a farce and don't represent his feeling of their race or sexual orientation.<br /><br />New Orleans plays a  significant part as a setting for the book, it is timely to read it and consider another view of this city and its cultural diversity we may lose.<br /><br />It is also fun to imagine this as a film. From my first reading many years ago, I have mentally cast many actors in this as a film. Think of John Candy as Ignatius. And as his girl friend and foil Gilda Radnor.<br /><br />This book is not to miss, it is a hilarious diversion.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|There is plenty to nitpick about in this three-hour adventure epic, but I would be hard pressed to challenge the expansive power of filmmaking wunderkind Peter Jackson's imagination and how he is able to translate his vision so vividly on film. Even more than the unstoppable special effects and state-of-the-art computer graphics, what I appreciate most about this 2005 version is the respect Jackson obviously has for the original 1933 film classic and his innate understanding of what still works from that story. The smartest decision he made was to leave the story's setting in 1933 rather than try to update it (as was done in the greed-oriented, oil-crisis-focused 1976 remake - which is ironically the most dated of the three versions). In fact, Jackson, along with his \\"Lord of the Rings\\" co-screenwriters Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh, have remained amazingly faithful to the original story and concurrently expanded it just enough to bring a greater depth of character development, even to Kong himself.<br /><br />The familiar plot begins with unscrupulous filmmaker Carl Denham who steals his film from studio executives who are tired of his endless safari footage. Denham desperately needs a leading lady who will fit the costumes for his new film and finds down-on-her-luck vaudeville performer Ann Darrow. He also has playwright Jack Driscoll help with the script, but then Jack gets tricked into accompanying Darrow and the film crew on a tramp steamer headed for Skull Island where Denham wants to shoot his film. Once they reach the island, they are met by savage natives, and Ann is eventually captured to be offered up as sacrifice to Kong. Smitten with Ann, Jack sets out to rescue her, while Denham's target is capturing Kong. Dinosaurs and other unsavory predators intercede on the island, and Ann becomes beholden to Kong for saving her from ensuing peril. However, ultimately Denham is successful in bringing Kong back to New York. Finally enraged by his enslavement, Kong breaks free and escapes but meets an inevitably tragic fate.<br /><br />Although he doesn't make his entrance until well into the second hour, Kong is not as imposing as I would have expected. What impresses me is the acrobatic dexterity of the creature and its lifelike characteristics, courtesy of images animated from the likeness and movements of Andy Serkis, who not only was Gollum in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" but also is the steamer's cook in this movie. Avoiding the ironic humor arising from humanizing Kong (a big misstep with the 1976 version), Jackson keeps Kong's behavior consistent with a gorilla's albeit one who has become the last of a gigantic, aggressive subspecies. The film's most resonant aspect is the unconventional love story between Ann and Kong - not a ludicrous manifestation of primal urges but an almost old-fashioned courtship that is equal parts Dion Fossey and old Hollywood movies. Jackson and his crew somehow make it all credible.<br /><br />Give major credit to Naomi Watts, who brings an alarmingly natural quality to a most unnatural situation as Ann. Not only does she have the becalmed beauty and vulnerability that makes Kong's attraction completely understandable, but she has the wherewithal and piercing intelligence (even juggling rocks and doing clumsy somersaults) to make the story move with some semblance of reason and emotional motivation. Jack Black is an inspired choice to play Denham, as his trademark manic energy and psycho-stare seem well suited for the part. At times, he seems on the verge of parody, but he plays the more unsavory moments with convincing abandon. As Jack, despite a too-contemporary look about him, Adrien Brody shows himself to be leading man material, even though he is overshadowed by both his human and computer-generated co-stars. Granted it's not his fault that Jack's romance with Ann is secondary to the plot.<br /><br />The expected set pieces on Skull Island are effectively terrifying from the foreboding rocks tothe spooked natives (who oddly disappear later on) to the series of dinosaurs, bats, spiders and other odd creatures that chase and often mangle their human prey. My one nagging feeling is that too much time is spent on the island with the sequential chase scenes becoming too numerous, especially as Jackson obviously likes doing variations on the same theme. However, one particularly effective scene has Ann, Kong and three dinosaurs getting caught in a tangle of vines down a ravine during a major battle royale. For all of the deadly fauna of the island, I am even more impressed with the recreation of 1933 Manhattan, in particular Times Square, the authentic-feeling detail of which is mind-boggling. The last scenes with Kong reunited with Ann work magically, even the potentially ridiculous scene of them on a frozen Central Park pond and most poignantly in the last aerial-bound moments. While it's true that the computer animation gets too obvious at times, especially in the avalanche of activity on Skull Island, we still reap the benefits of Jackson's successful realization of his vivid imagination around the King Kong fable. He is like a modern-day Cecil B. DeMille with Spielberg's more whimsical savvy, and his movie is masterful popcorn entertainment.isappear later on) to the series of dinosaurs, bats, spiders and other odd creatures that chase and often mangle their human prey.

The concert frist of all is beautiful....and powerful...watching it is so perfect it put me in an unexplainable feeling...The whole concert is one giant music video in which the band plays many of their hits (before x and y). <br /> <br />Also which makes this Dvd even more perfect is the tour Diary. This is a documentry which follows the band though the tour... Watching the tour diary it helped me realize that Coldplay are just 4 really great friends who just happen to have one of the best jobs in the world.... <br /> <br />I hope that there is more Dvds to come for Coldplay because this one was so nice...

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is totally original.  If your someone who loves the creativity of sci-fi this is the moive for you as it is really a kind of genre hybrid of sci-fi and western.

B00005OWEG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Coppola's vision. Hell, this movie almost single-handedly fueled my interest in movie directors/direction....That being said, let us discuss what Mr. C. decided to add to the mix (as I remember them) <br /> <br />1.) The added Duvall scenes: At first I thought it was brilliant. I actually laughed my ass off. But a couple fellow freaks of the flick tried to talked me out of adding them. It's an obvious attempt at humor in a movie that is decidedly not going for that vibe, they said....I say keep them. I found it very funny.... <br /> <br />2.) The new bunny footage : Does show how F***** up war can be, but I could live with out it....Ex Ney on the Bunnya <br /> <br />3. The imfamous French Plantation scene : When I first heard of this extented scene, I thought it was going to be another surreal slice of the horrors of war. What I got was a preachy, over, overlong scene that should have probably been burned. And plus, I hate the french....  <br /> <br />4. The new Brando stuff: Get rid of the extended news paper reading, but keep the views of him and the village kids peering in at Willard. I found those to be creepy and added an interesting view of Kurtz's control over the \\"village\\" <br /> <br />Thats it as I remember them.....I would like to see the death of Hooper's character, as one thoughtful amazon reviewer said he had seen on some \\"rough cut\\" version (5.5 hrs long)  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I went with my two grown-up kids (18 and 21) to see this movie. None of us had seen the Firefly TV series, so we did not know what to expect. Within a few minutes of the start of the movie we were laughing harder than we had all year. We were delighted with the originality and humor of the film. It has the funniest dialogue I have heard in a long time. Kind of reminds me of Episodes IV and V of Star Wars in that respect. Very appealing collection of diverse characters. Very sad to see two of the most interesting characters killed off. But on the whole, this is very well-put-together film. <br /> <br />After seeing the movie, we went out and rented, watched and then immediately bought the DVDs of the original series. The stories and special effects are not up to the level of quality of the film, but they are still excellent. Most importantly, we found ourselves becoming hard-core fans, and developing a real loyalty to the characters. Again, sad that two of the best characters were killed off in the movie; but that did not stop me from buying it and watching it repeatedly. Maybe the next movie can be a prequel, so the killed of characters would still be alive. <br /> <br />I was staggered to see that such an excellent film did so badly at the box office -- especially when so many lame movies have done well. But I am very happy to see that the DVDs of Serenity and Firefly are doing really well in sales and rentals. Right now I and my kids are fervently hoping that sales are good enough for long enough to get a sequel made to this excellent movie -- or to bring the series back to TV. <br /> <br />Check this movie out! And spread the word! It is up to us to make sure that originality and quality don't just get swept into the trash bin.

B00005JOIF|5.0|Just shy of three hours, Munich is an excellent film that is causing a lot of controversy among Jewish groups in the US and Israel, and among Palestinians. By upsetting both groups, director Steven Spielberg has found elusive middle ground that saves the film from being Oliver Stone-preachy while weaving tension and moral ambiguity, from beginning to end. <br /> <br />This is the second film based on the 1984 book Vengeance:The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team by Canadian journalist George Jonas, the first being the 1985 HBO made-for-television movie, Sword of Gideon. <br /> <br />Mossad agent and ex-bodyguard for Prime Minister Golda Meier, Avner Kauffman (Eric Bana), is asked to head a secret unofficial team on a very dangerous mission that would take him away from his pregnant wife for many months, if not years. He is assigned four other men, most of whom are seemingly unlikely members of an elite hit squad. The only other athletic person is Steve, aggressive and feisty, played by a crackling, magnetic Daniel Craig, the new James Bond. Craig, blonde with deep blue eyes, as revealed in a sniper scene, looks ironically like a perfect example of an Aryan. Ciarn Hinds, who played the Russian President Nemerov in 2002's The Sum of All Fears, is the clean-up guy who removes evidence. Mathieu Kassovitz plays Robert, the toy-maker turned bomb disposal expert turned bomb-maker. Hanns Zischler is Hans, the document forger. Showing up occasionally as the official liaison between Mossad and Avner's team is Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim. <br /> <br />Prime Minister Meier endorses the mission by saying \\"...every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.\\" Other dialogue in the film that resonates with the Israeli perspective includes Avner's mother saying that the Jews had to create their own homeland since no one was going to give it to them. These are examples of why Palestinians groups see this film as biased towards Israel, butto dismiss it as such is to sell it short, as it offers dialogue that neither side supports, and that those without a stake in the middle-east - most viewers - will chew on it, right to the film's end. <br /> <br />Early on, Avner finds a mysterious source of intelligence who is willing to find the locations of persons of interest who have gone underground, but only on the condition that Avner is working for no government. While he doesn't give up that he is unofficially tied to the Israelis, it's obvious that he is probably Mossad since all his desired targets are Palestinians. <br /> <br />As the team assassinate the bad guys throughout Europe, they also learn that the Palestinians retaliate, killing off magnitudes more people. Not mentioned in the film are the Palestinian refugee camps in Syria and Lebanon bombed by Israeli jets in retaliation, four days after the massacre, which was in turn condemned by the UN Security Council. They begin to wonder if their mission is worthwhile and even moral, with arguments about why they aren't just arresting people for trial. <br /> <br />Also, some of the Palestinians they kill are shown as being regular humans with families, or cultured and intelligent, rather than as one-dimensional bad guys. They feel guilty about some of their killings and one of the characters becomes very heavily burdened. It's this moral conflict that brings the film its best tension. In one of the most electric scenes, Avner, mistaken for a German, has a conversation with a PLO team leader who explains and justifies the Palestinians struggle with Israel for a homeland. This is one of the scenes that is generating criticism among Jewish groups, even though the director is a prominent Jew and supporter of Israel. <br /> <br />    Meir Jolobitz, executive director of the New York-based Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), told Aljazeera.net: <br /> <br />    \\"First, the film which claims to be inspired by true events does not reflect true events. Spielberg is inventive. <br /> <br />    \\"Secondly, he tries to humanize Arab terrorists by legitimizing their murder of Jews as their only way to establish a Palestinian state.\\" <br /> <br />    The ZOA has called for a public boycott of the film. <br /> <br />At one point in the film, one of the team members talks about how the Israelis could end up becoming killers like the people they are hunting. Team member Carl replied that they have long been like that, since they had to be killers in order to establish the state of Israel. Now, this sort of statement would be seen to be anti-Israeli since it equates the blood shed by creators of modern day Israel to the Palestinian terrorist - a moral equivalence that some will find outrageous. <br /> <br />The film didn't seem like almost three hours long to me. I was totally drawn in as the film unfolded within the murky confines of international betrayal with its lack of assurance. Is the family that sources valuable information playing all sides? Do they betray friends for money? Are they really Mossad operatives carefully feeding the unofficial team the finest information? Or, are they helping the Palestinian leadership do a little house cleaning? The flashbacks to the massacre itself are also riveting. There's a lot of juicy, factual story not included, such as the Israeli offer to send in one of their experienced commando teams, which was rejected. The German offer to trade money for the hostages and then have high-ranking German officials switch places with the hostages, also wasn't mentioned. <br /> <br />By not pleasing either the Palestinian or the Jewish communities, and yet ironically supporting both by presenting two sides of the dispute in the film, Munich offers a timely opportunity for discourse about sacrificing values in the face of conflict for survival, the increasingly popular moral equivalency debate and on a more basic level, the future of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, especially in the post-Sharon era. <br /> <br />Here's some interesting information from the Wikipedia entry about the Munich Massacre. In the book Striking Back : The 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and Israel's Deadly Response, published December 20, 2005, by Aaron J. Klein, the author contends that the Mossad only killed one man directly tied to the Munich Massacre, and that was in 1992. He mentions that the real planners had gone into hiding in Eastern Bloc countries and that the ones who were killed off were lesser Palestinian activists. The Mossad made them out to be some of the planners and the PLO trumpeted their importance so the legend of the power of the Mossad grew. <br /> <br />The website also contends that in the 1999 book by the only surviving planner of the attack, Abu Daoud, Memoirs of a Palestinian Terrorist, funds for the attack were supplied by Mahmoud Abbas, who is currently the President of the Palestinian Authority.

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This is exactly the album that I wanted from The Strokes. While the first two albums were brilliant, yet similar, this album transcends time and the mind. That phrase might sound like overkill, but \\"15 Minutes\\" epitomizes what The Strokes were trying to do on this album, combine dreamy choruses with rock substance not seen since the late 60's. A classic album, in my opinion, comes around maybe once or twice every five years. I have a gut feeling that this is one of them, we'll all know in five years.
0743454537|5.0|I like this type of story,(human suffering through everyday trials of life) so when I say heartbreakiing and give a five star review it's a good thing.  The story is written from several different points of view and she carefully picks apart this family and gives each character more depth every time you hear from them.  Some of the plot twists I saw coming, the ending came out of nowhere and is unlike most stories of a young girl with a terminal illness.
0307263118|4.0|Yes, John Banville's prose in his Booker Award-winning novel, \\"The Sea,\\" is pompous and prolix, and there probably is a metaphor or simile in every sentence, but readers who are critical of the book overlook the fact that it's a first-person narrative, told in the voice of a self-absorbed character who is both pompous and prolix himself. In fact, he's a bit of a charlatan, as we learn. He's writing a monograph on Bonnard that he doesn't expect to finish, and he married above him in order to escape the poverty of his childhood. He has even changed his name. Luckily, however, Max Morden (now there's a name worthy of Nabokov) is also a charmer, in his way, and often \\"mordantly\\" funny. Consider his Proustian ruminations on the character of Connie Grace, the mother of Max's childhood friends, twins Chloe and Myles, and the object of Max's first crush: \\"Yet for all my disconcertion it is the mortal she, and not the divine, who shines for me still, with however tarnished a gleam, amidst the shadows of what is gone. She is in my memory her own avatar.\\" Some readers may argue that it's not worth winding one's way through such tangles of prose, with its awkward syntax, others will see the journey as evidence of Max's pomposity, not to mention his inadequacy as an \\"avatar\\" of memory. Sometimes the shifts of prose become playful, as when Max puns on the name of a character nicknamed \\"Bun,\\" a rather obese woman \\"as unmissable as the late Queen of Tonga,\\" with \\"cork-coloroured\\" legs \\"like two gigantic bungs protruding from her nether regions.\\" Max also toys with modifiers; for example, when I first read the sentence, \\"I think it must be that we were both only children,\\" I took it to refer to Max and wife Anna's age. Almost immediately, however, Max clarifies that we \\"were both the only children of our parents.\\"  The reader has entered an Escher-like world of prose riddles that is sometimes difficult to sort through, and one might question whether \\"The Sea\\" is worth the effort.  I would argue that it is but that one's final estimation of the book may depend upon how one interprets the ending. I was, frankly, a bit disappointed by it. But I had enjoyed the ride up until that point, and I can recommend the book to others who, like me, enjoy superior wordplay and erudite prose puzzles.would argue that it is but that one's final estimation of the book may depend upon how one interprets the ending.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|Gerard Butler is a very good looking actor whose appearance changes so much from role to role that it's the character that stays in your mind.  His performance here as the Phantom is an amazingly devoted and humble piece of work, as the character is stripped of his protective theatrical persona and revealed as a sorrowful loner at the end.  Butler didn't have to go for that depth in the performance, but he did, and it's an amazingly deep, detailed act.  Every gesture, every movement contributes to the portrayal; it's stunning.<br /><br /> It's also overlooked.<br /><br /> The filmmakers could have expanded upon the famous broadway show and given us some backstory to help us clear up the mysteries of the other characters, but they didn't. Why does Christine thnk the Phantom is her father? How, exactly, does the phantom conduct those music lessons? How old IS Raoul, and what was a boy his age doing hanging around a girl Christine's age when she was little---he had to have been an adolescent.  Who is Raoul, and what's going on there?  Waht about the war that's going on at the time?  The phantom builds up their lair under the opera---exactly how, anyway?<br /><br /> The movie itself is visually gorgeous and if you don't take it seriously it's very enjoyable.  Minnie Driver gives a wonderfully gawdy performance as Carlotta and Simon Callow Ciaran Hinds mug it up as the managers.  The quiet standout was Msr. Reyer, the conductor, who has as few lines as the Phantom but manages to give a wonderful little performance as a musically-inclined mouse in a maestro's suit.<br /><br /> The probelm with viewing this as camp is that Butler's performance is entirely sincere and honest, and every time you find yourself sneering at the gaudiness of it, his acting is enough to pull you up short.<br /><br /> Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum play Raoul and Christine, and they were evidenlty hired for their singing. Both have fine voices, Wilson particularly so, but to be fair neither part offers much.  However, neither much tries, either.<br /><br /> What a pity they didn't try and make something more of this than they did.fair neither part offers much.

0960191038|4.0|I purchased this book primarily because it was referenced by several authors of other Mckinsey books that I've read. I was taken aback by the price of the book but I'm of the school of thought that great ideas need not come in large packages. As like many of the other reviewers, I found this book a tough read and had to break it down into smaller bite size readings. What I did that help me tremedously was build a Pyramid chart capturing the SCQ ---Answer using sticky notes. Once built, I was able to easily see the ideas she was presenting and was able to clarify my thinking and writing substantially. <br /> <br />For years I struggled with getting my ideas out of my head and onto paper coherently. Now, I have a great tool that speeds this process up and get my point across succintly.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|Quentin Tarantino presents. That's intimidating. A talented director supporting a horror movie. Must be good, right? The trailers looked awesome and the reviews were very positive. So, I decided to watch this (instead of Munich!Doh!) with high expectations. I was expecting a movie like Saw. What I got was half American Pie/ soft porn and half good horror fun.   This movie is 1h35 min. long. The first 40 minutes flat out suck. Sure there were some hot babes, all naked, but I went to this movie to see a horror movie.   The plot centers around 3 friends traveling through Europe wanting to get stoned and find some hot babes. They find themselves in Amsterdam and have a little fun before some guy tells them to go to Slovakia to find the best girls. They find them, have fun and then things go horribly wrong. The only problem is tha it takes half of the movie to get there.   The opening sequence of the movie acts like we're going to be in for a great ride. Don't trust it.   For sure, they picked some gorgeous women to be in this movie. So for sure, they're some really nice women naked. But the problem is that I wanted to watch a horror movie not Euro Trip 2.   Once the movie kicks into gear, it's great. The ending is also great. One of the 3 friends manages to escape from a basement full of psychos and executes sweet revenge. Anf boy, the revenge is gory as hell!  The movie also is powerful. It had a very powerful message. These 3 friends are lokking for a good time but they end up in a very sick world. Kind of like 8mm but on a much larger scale. Sick, rich freaks pay other psychos to murder people in horrific ways. The best part and creepiest may I add is that everyone is connected. And once you get towards the end, you'll see that everything was set up and everyone was in on it. It's very disturbing and sad.   My recommendation is to rent it when it comes out on DVD. The first half isn't a horror movie, the last is. What a shame.   But the 2nd half will please for sure.While the movie isn't scary but flat out gory, the 2nd half is still good. And if you liked Saw, the 2nd half is a good appetizer while waiting for the 3rd one (if you saw it, you'll know what I mean).   So, Hostel is a powerful movie with a great second half filled with revenge at tis finest. The final sequence is great and gory and it will make you scream: kill that stupid piece of sh**! Kill him!  Hostel is dissapointing and I nearly left the theater. But thank goodness I didn't because the 2nd half is a true horror movie. Too bad the entire movie wasn't.   Now I know what Tarantino should do. He should take Uma Thurman (Beatrice Kiddow from Kill Bill) and throw her in this sick little torture place. That would make for great fun! Please mr. Tarantino, make my day, we want to see Uma kick more a#$!
B000002MFN|5.0|I think this is one of madonna's best albums. The music on this album is very different from anything she came out with before and after and anyone else as well. I think people didn't buy this album because of it's first 2 singles erotica (sex) and deeper and deeper (homosexual) and some parents probably didn't let there children buy the album cause, madonna had quite a few teen fans. Let's not foreget she also released a sex book. Madonna was one of the first ranchy artist. She spoke her mind, showed off her body, and didn't cared what people thought because she was the first cream of the crop it cause her some failures but eventually became the way of our music world today. <br />I also think she released the wrong singles i'm not a big fan of fever, rain, and deeper and deeper. <br /> <br />with the exception of bye bye baby this album gets good after deeper and deeper the rest is a masterpeice. <br />best songs: <br />bye bye baby <br />bad girl <br />waiting <br />why is it so hard  <br />words <br />in this life <br />
0525948023|4.0|I really loved this book. Like the Power of Now, it's a clear, vivid and almost transmission-like text of simple Presence, the essence of all spirituality; at least it was for me.  But Tolle doesn't consider the how, the path aspect- the devil in the details.  The danger in presenting such a fruitional, 'heavenly' view is that people might think there is nothing to be done, and rationalize any predisposition towards a laize-faire, New Age approach to spirituality.  A whole wheat doughnut with an empty center and a good cup of black coffee will give you a buzz, but if you don't use that buzz to go shopping for something with a little more protein, you're not going to go the long haul.<br /><br />The book's simplicity is it's best asset, but also it's biggest danger. For folks with an established and disciplined spiritual practice, I think this book is gold. It could be a great start for others, but might make the spiritual path seem maybe a bit too easy, simplistic.  Ultimately it is since it is our true nature; relatively it is not.
0385504209|1.0|At first, I was proud that I was not among the 25 million or so people who have allegedly read this book.  But since I am an art history buff, and I like Ron Howard's films (and his film version of the book will be coming out later this year), I thought I would give it a shot.<br /><br />You have to hate a book where you figure out the riddles pages and pages before the main characters do.  And I am certainly not a cryptographer, a symbologist, holy grail expert, or genius.  It's simply that these riddles were written to fool the lowest common denominator.  It barely held my interest and I almost did not finish it.<br /><br />Save your money on the book and go see the movie instead.  I suspect it will be far better because of the excellent cast and director.  It will also probably be shot in a way that does not make the riddles seem so obvious.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a classical. Taking apart the fact that Tom Hanks is one of my 4 favorites actors (TH, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro y Robin Williams), this is one of the most touching and innocent movies I have ever seen. The messages are so subtle and nice, it makes you laugh and makes you cry....it is so beautiful. I love this movie. And of course, it has a special place in my personal collection.

0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is an excellently written book that any reader would enjoy. Pi Patel is a God-loving boy who is the son of a local zookeeper, living in India. Pi not only practices his native religion of Hinduism but also experiments with various others, much like Gandi. Among these are Christianity and Islam. In India his father is constantly teaching young Pi the dangers of life and of the various animals in the zoo.  <br /> <br />When Pi is sixteen years old, his family and the zoo that they own decide to emigrate over to North America. They go aboard a Japanese cargo ship named the Tsimtsum. During the voyage, the ship tragically sinks in the middle of the Pacific ocean. Pi is the soul survivor of the wreck and ends up in a lifeboat with a viscious hyena , an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and an enormous Bengal tiger. Later throughout the novel all the animals are gone, except the Tiger, named Richard Parker. Pi must figure out a way to survive certain death aboard the lifeboat with the tiger.  <br /> <br />The book is catching and captures the reader to a point where he or she cannot put the book down. It is written in such a way that it leaves the reader guessing what will happen next and longing for more information. The book leaves the reader with a discreet question at the end making him wonder if the events actually took place. Did Pi actually survive 227 days in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger? I am still attempting to figure out the answer even after reading. Excellent book!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I have always heard of damian marley but only listened to his song \\"it was written\\" with Capleton and Stephen Marley. However, I dont know anyone who does not like this album. As a native jamaican, this is one of the best albums i have listened to by a jamaican artist. His words are a deep reflection of the greatest reggae artist his dad Bob Marley, especially in \\"For the Babies\\" Jamrock, and his beats and lyrics are much better than the ones on his Half Way Tree album.  Best songs are Move, For the Babies, There for You, Khaki Suit, Beautiful, Hey Girl,and All Night
B00006AW2J|1.0|This album is excellent and worth 5 stars. This is a review of the format. The title claims that this is a HYBRID SACD. It is NOT! It was encoded using DSD which is the same process used to make an SACD but there is no high resolution SACD layer. It is well mastered and sounds excellent but it is not an SACD. Do not buy this thinking it is an SACD. If you just want a good recording then you will be happy.    EDIT (April 2006)  Steven, if there is an SACD version of this I'd love to find it. I ordered mine from Amazon and it was NOT an SACD (I am referring to the abkco version). I DO have an SACD player and not only was my copy single layer it didn't even say it was an SACD on the case or have the logo. I also note that Amazon no longer lists this as a hybrid SACD. When I purchased my copy around Dec 2005 it said SACD in big title type - not any more.    As I said before, GREAT album and GREAT sound but not SACD. I also give it 5 stars now as it no longer claims to be what it is not (don't seem to be able to change that though). It is a 5 star CD and I highly recommend it.    EDIT (May 2006)  Okay, a bit more info. I have now learned that the original release of most if not all of the stones on ABKCO back in 2002 were in fact hybrid SACD. However, most, if not all, are now out of print. Instead, they have released NON-SACD remastered versions which do sound good. You can apparently tell the difference from the packaging. If it's a digi-pack then it is (most likely) the now out of print SACD version (some may still be in print - I don't have details on all of them). If you buy this now you will probably not get the SACD version - although some may still be in the amazon warehouse and it could be hit or miss (I missed on this one). You might also be able to find them in some stores as many people pass up the digi-packs and there are still some around (I bought Satanic Majesties Request just today in a digi-pack and it is a hybrid SACD). None of the digi-packs say anything about being an SACD on the outside but there is a little note on the disc itself. Unfortunately you will have to open it to verify.    Hopefully this helps clear things up.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|At the end of \\"Bridget Jones's Diary,\\" the aforementioned Ms. Jones believed she had found eternal happiness in the arms of her new boyfriend, civil rights attorney Mark Darcy.  But at the beginning of \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason`\\" she seems not to have achieved the happy-ever-after ending that both she and we thought she had.  After only a short while together, Bridget suspects that Mark may be cheating on her, and Mark seems embarrassed by all the social faux pas Bridget commits while in public.<br /><br />Even before the opening credits had ended, I had a premonition that this film might be a stinker when I noticed that no fewer than four people were credited with having had a hand in the screenplay - a sure sign of trouble if ever there was one.  And I wasn't wrong, for \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" stinks to the high heavens.<br /><br />And what did these four talented, highly paid writers come up with for all their efforts?  A patchwork mess consisting of preposterous situations, boneheaded dialogue, and thoroughly unappealing characters, that`s what.  Frumpy, shrill, desperate and wracked with insecurities, Bridget comes across as the kind of needy, high maintenance girlfriend that would send any reasonably self-respecting man racing not for the altar but for the exits.  It's amazing Mark puts up with her for as long as he does, yet, in all honesty, he`s really no more appealing than she is.  All they do is fight then make up, bicker then reconcile for nigh unto two hours with no rhyme or reason to any of it.  Every moment in the film feels pre-fabricated and arbitrary, with no connection at all to the real world or recognizable human emotions.  In short, as romantic partners, the two of them are so insufferable that I kept wishing that they would put their relationship out of its misery before some desperate soul in the audience did it for them.<br /><br />Renee Zelwegger and Colin Firth are annoying and grating as the ill-fated pair, and Hugh Grant sleazes his way through the part of the slime-ball news reporter, Daniel Cleaver.  All three actors deserve much better than being mired in a hopeless misfire like this one.  Instead of giving us believable characters in believable situations, the filmmakers pile on scene after scene of inane, embarrassing slapstick routines:  Bridget jumping out of an airplane, Bridget racing uncontrollably down a ski slope, Bridget getting drenched by passing motorist, Bridget getting arrested for cocaine possession in Thailand etc.  Then, in order to cover up for the emptiness of the screenplay, the filmmakers ladle on an endless series of golden oldies to fill up the soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" is about as bad as a romantic comedy can get.  Let's hope some merciful soul over there in Jolly Olde England has the decency to toss Bridget Jones' next diary into the nearest incinerator before it can find its way to the screen.l-fated pair, and Hugh Grant sleazes his way through the part of the slime-ball news reporter, Daniel Cleaver.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|A lot has happened to Korn over the last two years. They released their seventh studio album in 2003, compiled their first greatest hits album in 2004, ended their contract with Sony records, and lost one band member. Korn's famous seven string guitar duo was cut in half when Brian \\"Head\\" Welch found God and exited the band, leaving James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer as the band's sole studio guitarist.  <br /> <br />Korn's 2003 back-to-basics disc, \\"Take A Look In The Mirror,\\" was a good listen, but it was ill-fated. It's low record sales proved that nu-metal was dead and buried. It also proved that Korn needed to evolve and expand their sound a little bit. Well, that's exactly what they did! Almost everything about \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is experimental (including the Pink Floyd-y title, Tool-like packaging, and trippy artwork).  <br /> <br />But this, their seventh studio release, differs mostly because it is definitely Korn's most progressive and least-heavy album. Before the album was released, I knew Korn were down to only one guitarist, so I was worried about the rhythm section. And, now that I have heard \\"Other Side,\\" I can safely say it definitely does suffer. It's almost as if Korn are afraid of writing riffs and making heavy music again, because they can't do it without Head.  <br /> <br />Jonathan's singing style is also a lot more melodic. On the album closing song, \\"Tearjerker,\\" his cleanly sung voice goes falsetto at times (yes, falsetto), and, at other times, even sounds a bit feminine! \\"See You On The Other Side\\" has drawn some comparisons to Marilyn Manson, but if I didn't know better, I'd swear I was listening to a H.I.M. record.  <br /> <br />The album preceding lead/hit single, \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" which should be an instant dance floor hit, is sort of in the same vein as 2004's cover song, \\"Word Up.\\" And, with insanely catchy singing and guitar noise, it might be the most addictive song Korn have ever recorded. \\"2-Way,\\" \\"Throw Me Away,\\" and \\"Love Song\\" are all very atmospheric, with buzzing guitars, weird sound effects, spacey drum beats, wind wooshes, and dreary vocals. Track six, \\"Throw Me Away,\\" also begins with (what sounds like) a bagpipe solo. Elsewhere, song numbers eight and thirteen, \\"Open Up\\" and \\"For No One,\\" end with melodic instruments, including what could be a piano (!), and \\"Interlude #2\\" has a catchy clapping pattern. But, unfortunately, the rest of the songs just can't match the hooks of \\"Twisted Transistor.\\"  <br /> <br />There are a few songs that bring the old days to mind. Munky's guitars make their first real entrance on track three, \\"Hypocrites.\\" This song, which might be a swipe at Head, has a chunky rhythm with funky, almost galloping riffs. Next, \\"Coming Undone\\" has a couple of violent growls, and \\"Getting Off\\" boasts bobbing, moderately heavy guitars and some crazy (albeit brief), \\"Follow The Leader\\"-esque scat. Finally, the guitars on \\"Liar\\" make an irresistible, grooving rhythm.  <br /> <br />But even with a few old-school-like moments, by the end of the first disc, you know these songs are a step forward, creatively, for Korn, but you also want something to satisfy your head banging needs. Luckily, the bonus disc IS worth buying, because the three new songs, \\"It's Me Again,\\" \\"Eaten Up Inside,\\" and \\"Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Mort),\\" are angry songs with bottom-heavy, lurching riffs, and prove that Korn can still rock quite proficiently. The two remixes of \\"Twisted Transistor\\" are also pretty cool.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is definitely Korn's most experimental album to date. It's also their most unique and eccentric album, and it kind of sticks out like a sore thumb when you listen to and consider Korn's other albums. And, while some people (who don't like Korn's first six albums) will enjoy this new sound and applaud the band for evolving, many longtime fans are sure to be alienated by this album and hate every second of it. Personally, I am somewhere in between. I kind of want some old school, heavy stuff to snap my neck to, but I also have got to give props to Korn for making a record that was so experimental and daring. Let's just hope the rhythm section improves a little bit for their next release.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Watching Kerry Conran`s \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is like seeing one of those beautifully illustrated sc-fi adventure comic books from the 1930's miraculously brought to life.  Unfortunately, that turns out to be something of a mixed blessing, since the film captures some of the weaknesses as well as many of the strengths of that particular genre.<br /><br />This is the first movie ever made in which the actors were filmed entirely in front of a blue screen, so that nothing we see, except for the performers, actually exists in our three-dimensional world.  In terms of its visual design, the movie is a gorgeous combination of art deco architecture and sepia-toned cinematography.  Whether it's a bird's-eye view of the Manhattan skyline or a bi-plane soaring majestically through the clouds, the effect is eye-popping and dazzling to say the least.<br /><br />However, once the novelty of the look wears off - and that happens about 15 minutes into the movie - we're left with the storyline and characters, neither of which come close to matching the beauty of the visuals.  The plot, about a mad scientist who sends out killer giant robots to facilitate his plan for destroying the world, comes across as an odd sort of precursor to Spielberg's later \\"War of the Worlds,\\" with bits of \\"Lost Horizon,\\" \\"King Kong,\\" and other early twentieth century movie classics thrown in for good measure.  The characters are mere cardboard cutouts - appropriate given the nature of the enterprise, perhaps, but not very compelling for the audience watching them.  Thus, while the movie LOOKS like a comic book, it also, unfortunately, PLAYS like one, giving us little to hang on to in the way of human interest or human emotion.<br /><br />Jude Law plays Sky Captain Joe Sullivan, a crack pilot determined to bring an end to this Teutonic reign of terror, and Gwyneth Paltrow is Polly Perkins, a newspaper photographer and occasional love interest, who goes along for the ride.  Law and Paltrow deliver stiff, arch performances, partly because that's what the style calls for, and partly, no doubt, because it must be awfully tough for an actor to develop a meaningful performance with nothing but a blue screen to interact with.  I guess that, with this film, it's finally official; after years of Hollywood edging us in that direction, the actor has become little more than just another special effect after all.<br /><br />\\"Sky Captain\\" is an awfully nice try at something new and innovative, but it's a little too old-hat - apart from its visuals, that is - to be truly groundbreaking.long for the ride.

0684800713|5.0|From Hemmingway's \\"Death in the Afternoon:\\" \\"If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eight of it being above water.\\"<br /><br />Like the iceberg, Hemmingway only describes a small part of Jake and Lady Brett Ashley's relationship. Although they have obviously had a long history together, Hemmingway leaves most of it up to the imagination. Similarly, much of Jakes personality is not directly described, but left to the reader to infer based on his interactions and descriptions of Cohn. Hemmingway takes a \\"Skinner behavioral\\" approach to motives and cognitions; he only describes the stimulus and the behavioral reaction with no attempt to describe feelings, perceptions or intents.<br /><br />On my initial reading of the Sun Also Rises when I was in college, I think I was drawn to the party atmosphere of the book. It's the life I would love to live if I didn't need to work and had lots of money. Across country lines and from one fiesta to another, how great. Jake constantly is socializing, drinking and meeting new people. He often enters a bar with one group of friends and leaves with others. The book describes a better spring break than any MTV reality show. Subsequent reads of the novel bring out much more intimate study of human personality.<br /><br />The climax of the story occurs in Pamplona, Spain at the Fiesta of San Fermin. A radical festival takes place in which the people of Pamplona play the leading part, but in which the characters come to full physical and emotional conflict. Hemmingway's description of the activities and emotions of the quasi-religious festival brought the running of the bulls and bullfights into the American conscious.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises is existential in its approach to life. Jake claims to be a catholic and goes to church several times. Within the story there are several references to Catholicism and catholic colleges. However, Hemmingway aims to describe life, as it should be, with no regard to an after life. As a man, you are judged based on how you conduct yourself on the earth during your life time. Based on The Sun Also Rises, a ranking system of \\"manhood\\" can be constructed according to three factors: 1) grace under pressure (in face of death), 2) level of passion (aficion) for which they live life and 3) by their response to the man-eater Lady Brett Ashley. Brett is a \\"Circe\\" who turns men to pigs, often bringing out the worst in the best of men.<br /><br />\\"Real men\\" as ranked by Hemmingway<br /><br />1. Robert Cohn: Lowest level of manhood. May seem like a likeable and insightful fellow, but becomes irritating over time. A bookish man who excels at things (boxing, writing) for not passionate reasons. He lives life like watching a movie rather than experiencing it. Considers bull fight s to be \\"boring\\" - a blasphemy for Hemmingway. In relation to Lady Brett Ashley, he is a \\"steed.\\" Has an affair with her, but acts like a puppy dog. Follows her around and acts \\"terribly.\\" A constant brunt of the mocking by Jakes friends.<br /><br />2. Mike Campbell: A generally rough and ready type guy who experiences life to the fullest. However, he becomes drunk too easily (a sin for Hemingway) and \\"acts badly,\\" often antagonizing other people, even if he is correct in doing so (like to Cohn). Overly protective of Brett, and she does not like to be possessed. Responds horribly to Cohn's affair with Brett. Bankrupt and drunk, she ditches him. Later returns to him, so she can continue to be safe and irresponsible.<br /><br />3. Jake Barnes: Passionate about life. Enjoys bull fights, the landscape, soaking up the afternoon sun on a sandy beach. Aficionado of bull fighting. Unfortunately, he is apostate due to injury suffered in war, therefore can not consummate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley. So, to Hemingway, there relationship can never be complete despite their love for each other and he is banished to the role of eunuch. Jake can serve her only as confidant and pimp. Lady Brett Ashley is both agony and ecstasy to Jake.<br /><br />4. Pedro Romero: Young Matador at the top of his profession. Not just an aficionado, he actually faces death gracefully in the ring with the worst of bulls. Handsome, graceful and competent. Brett falls for him hard and runs away with him. He dominates her, actually rejects her for her hair (too short, boyish). Ultimately, she must leave him because she cannot be a \\"b-tch\\" and destroy him, like she has all other men.war, therefore can not consummate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley.

B000BNX3B4|1.0|AH-1Z's review below is pretty much spot-on. If you like this movie you probobly also enjoy movies about talking babies and flying dogs. There is no hope for you. <br /> <br />The one star goes out to the guy plays Diane Lane's father.
0307276902|2.0|This is a good read for sure, but the problem I have with this book is Mr. Frey has no problem discounting a higher power/God, etc. and is willing to throw the Bible in the trash with used Q-Tips and used tissues, but he is eager and willing to take advice from Leonard - a cold-blooded, vengful killer, as well as adopt Leonard's catch phrase, \\"Just Hold On\\".  Good advise for sure - I even saw a young man on the Oprah show tattoo this phrase on his arm.  Good advise or not, the fact that this is where his inspiration is found says a lot about the author.  I wish him well and I hope he continues his life of sobriety and continues to help others...whatever works I guess?
B000AWYOGE|3.0|A great mood is set. The performances are top notch. In fact, the movie is actually good... for what it is. But, before watching, you need to realize what you're watching. Because if you're watching it for the proper reason, you may actually really like this. If you're watching it because it's supposed to be scary and scare you... YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. If you're watching it for a neat little ghost story, then you may like it. Because it is.<br /><br />BUT, for the most part, DARK WATER is very slow moving, dark, drab, drudging movie. It has some interesting points to make, but it waits way too long to deliver the goods and doesn't truly capitalize on the moments that should have been scarier then they were.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is a women in a custody battle with her ex-husband for custody of her young daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade). In her attempt to find a suitable home and a place she can afford on a meager budget, she finds an apartment in a rundown apartment building outside of the city. What follows is A LOT of hints and question marks that have you wondering if the apartment building is haunted, or if Dahlia is out of her mind.<br /><br />You may very well find that you love this movie. I mean, it has a great cast. John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Tim Roth, Dougray Scott & Pete Postlethwaite. They are all fantastic and there's a good story here. Just don't go in expecting a scarefest, because you won't get one.
0307276902|5.0|I loved this book. I felt it. I have a hard time believing any human who ever had a struggle of some kind wouldn't grasp onto this book and not put it down until it was finished. MY FRIEND LEONARD is equally as entertaining and real. I think if one doesn't, they are either too \\"normal\\" to get it, or are in incredible denial about their own life and perhaps addicitons.<br /><br />James Frey nailed it. If he were to \\"embellish\\", don't you think it would be a lot nastier than this? Brilliant.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|Alright, first of all, all these reviews from people telling KoRn to \\"retire\\" and to \\"give it up\\" have got to stop. Yes, this cd is quite possibly their most experimental yet, but I think it's ingenius. I'll admit it, when I first bought the cd, it took me a couple times of listening to it to get used to it. It was just shocking to me because of the fact that they had us all used to one particular sound. And on this cd, they don't have that sound... as much. Yes, they've lost their guitarist and it's defintely not the same with Head. But that doesn't mean they should just quit. I have been a huge fan of KoRn ever since they came out and intend to be there when they decide to call it quits. But until then, you can guarantee I will be behind them 100% no matter what they decide to do with their music.
B00001OH7O|5.0|this album is a roller coaster epic masterpiece. not epic in the same way as mettalica are or any heavy metal band but just the sheer quality of this music. im not putting above all my faverote bands but of this area in my taste he is amazing there is noone like bowie on the planet.The music on this album is melodic hitting and danceable .i dont really see a single artist around now who isnt influenced by bowie in some way or form.now you may just go down to the store and buy his greatest hits and be content with that. if you do your missing out on alot of good stuff this album is good enough to be most bands greatest hits collection to be honest.i can only do justice to this album by reviewing it track by track    changes 11/10 atomospheric beging broken up by moments of catchy boogie riffs .as soon as bowies voice comes in the verse is melodic slowely has some clever lyrics then the irresistable chorus as good as anything the beatles ever recorded.     oh you pretty things 9/10 quirky piano at the begining slow verse again verse a bit boring although the chorus is as catchy and as infectious to the one in changes (you may of already heard changes)    eightline poem 10/10 lovely bluesy guitar at the begining .with a slow piano backing good music to listen to while relaxing in the bath .then bowie sings in a relaxing tone of voice very different to the one changes and the chorus of oh you pretty things.its a very slow track and is very guitar bases moving on.    life on mars 11/10 this song is extodanarily antemic and emotional beats. any power piano ballads of any era this has yet to be bettered by anyone .beaufiful epic passionate lovely melodies and meaningful lyrics and those arnt the only words i can use to describe this artist.    kooks 9/10 this one reminds me of the coral for some reason(the coral a much later band) i have no idea why i think its the base sounds a bit like a teddy bears picnic but more tuneful has some nice jazz piano fiqures    quiksand 10/10 starts off alot like kooks in the verse but the chorus is more like life on mars. the closing of the chorus is just so soothing another one to listen while relaxing or dancing.    fill your heart 7.5/10  i like the bit at the end that about saves i like the vioins but genrally lacks something the others have.lacks that class.    andy warhol 11/10 ok the bit at the begining with the annoying ring tone sound that sounds like happy birthday is extremely irritating could put you off .the song its self is brilliant.the ring tone sounds are instantly forgotten when the song starts a phenominal riff witch sounds heavy metal before if even exsisted i can tell mettalica where influenced by the spanishy guitar of bowie.    song for bob dylan 10/10 the quitar at the beggining sounds like the music you get during cough a porn film (not that i watch them) its about dylan again with most of the bowie songs has a really mermorable chorus. although the chorus sounds a tiny bit like country music (witch i hate ((no prejudice in the mix whatsoever)) on the the next song.    queen bitch 10/10 very much like the stong this song simple riffery and simmilar vocals.very rock n roll.    the bewly brothers 9/10 this is a likable track cept for the gravy bit at the end. witch is to wierd for my tastes youll understand when you hear it.the first time the chorus comes the noses in the back ground sound amazing a good end to the album.      now bowie is an amazing artist and this album is ONE of his best bowie has many classics and even if you dont like this there is something in the bowie discography for everyone
B00005JOQ9|5.0|I like this kind a genre type of movies and I will definitely recommend to all same, after all you know who's behind this production, no other than Quentin Tarantino!! I have to give a five stars for this for its gruesome gore and grossness, but for quality academy type kind of movies, it might not pass he he he!
038533348X|5.0|This is the first time that I've read Vonnegut and I must say that I was deeply impressed.  He managed to cover some of the most important philosophical, religious, psychosocial and ethical questions of the times.<br /><br />Can science and religion coexist peacefully?  Can most people accept reality or do they prefer to live with their delusions?  Is there any point in reading history, let alone writing it, if humanity's track record is such that we appear to be doomed to infinitely repeat our own mistakes?<br /><br />Vonnegut covers these tough issues and more in an entertaining and ironically humorous fashion.  Although the book was published in 1963, his preoccupation with substances that could obliterate the species is every bit as relevant today as it was then, if not more so, and his characters are quirky yet believable.<br /><br />He spins a tale about a writer named Jonah (John to be exact)who becomes fascinated with the Hoenikker family: the children of a late scientist who co-discovered the first atomic bomb and an even more lethal substance called ice-nine, which could freeze all of the rivers and streams.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, Vonnegut's doomsday scenario has yet to play out.  Perhaps it's just a matter of time but hopefully, people and nations are smarter than Vonnegut gave them credit for.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald<br /><br />Author of D'Amour Road
B00006690G|5.0|It just can't beat The Marshall Mathers LP. That isn't saying anything bad though. The Marshall Mathers LP is my favorite rap album of all time. I couldn't imagine Eminem releasing an album that would impress me more than that album did. How can you top Stan? The Real Slim Shady? Who Knew? The Way I Am? Kim??? You can't. But you keep going, and hopefully you produce something memorable.<br /><br />There's really nothing to complain about here. Dr. Dre and Eminem are on their toes here, oblivious in no way to being at the front and center of their genre. From the opening track it's apparent Eminem is heading a new direction. His career is now a carnival. I suppose I'd make a carnival out of my career if I dropped an album that broke the record for most albums sold in its first week. I'd clown, go crazy and do whatever I wanted to do. That's Eminem here. He just doesn't care. He understands he's the best. Nobody can compete with him. As far as he's concerned, he's just fooling around.<br /><br />But something's missing. He's self-centered as usual, angry as usual, frustrated as usual... but the intensity... it's there, just not as much. Maybe the mom and girlfriend talk, the daughter talk, the quintessential Eminem talk is getting old to Marshall. More than on the first two albums, Eminem goes gangsta. I've never appreciated Eminem for being a gangsta. I've always appreciated him for being raw, pissed off, frustrated, and vengeful. Don't get me wrong. This album is pure quality... but the soul of Eminem is lacking in comparison to his first two commercial releases.<br /><br />- The intro lets the show begin and...<br />- White America begins with a plane crash into a building. Eminem is back. Eminem comes with his follow up to Who Knew, only this time he's screaming that he did know! Mrs. Cheney gets it, Mrs. Gore gets it, and he calls the U.S. \\"the divided states of embarassment.\\" Excellent track.<br />- Business is Shady flowing like butter. Here we have the best of the best claiming he's exactly like that. Dr. Dre jumps aboard as part of the \\"Dynamic Duo\\" again. Dre's production on this one is great. Great track.<br />- Cleaning Out My Closet isn't one of my favorites. It's a good track, compelling in its insight to Eminem's background. I'm just not a fan of the production of the song. The beat is too simple for me. However, \\"I would never dis my own mama just to get recognition,\\" was a line I'd been waiting to hear. Good track.<br />- Square Dance is an awesome track. This is Eminem straight rompin & stompin. With references to the war on terror, the U.S. military, Anthrax, Amtraks crashing.... this is sure to catch your attention. \\"Go to Beruit and do a show there.\\"<br />- The Kiss works brilliantly as a skit leading up to the next track.<br />- Soldier is a very good song, but it should raise a few surprised eyebrows. Here is Eminem in his absolute gangsta persona, claiming he's itching to get his gun off. The production here is immaculate. The sound effects accompanying the lyrics work perfectly. Here's a great song with a great hook.<br />- Say Goodbye To Hollywood is a good track. It's wacked out choir over the chorus is a nice touch. It's apparent that Eminem really was frustrated with the life fame gave him, releasing his Greatest Hits album and calling it quits in 2005. Guess it took a few years for him to really call it quits.<br />- Drips is downright nasty, but that's just what the album needs at track 9. Hate it or love it, Eminem & Obie Trice explore the dark side of good sex here. Good track.<br />- Without Me was inevitable. Once an album, now and forever, Eminem has to become Slim Shady and be a pest. I love it, but I don't love the techno stab.<br />- I don't know what to think of the Paul Rosenberg skit... but<br />- Sing For The Moment is a classic track. Aerosmith's accompaniment (Steven Tyler's lyrics &  Joe Perry's music) only reminds me how popular Eminem has become. Even though the lyrics aren't always congruent with the chrous, I get the idea.<br />- Superman is the untouchable sleeper track here. In retrospect, over my three year history of owning this album, this track has probably been played the most. This song has far and away the illest beat on this record. Dr. Dre is straight up gangster for his production on this one. Every guy knows what's up on this track. This is as good as Eminem gets.<br />- Hailie's Song is a good track. It's slower and more sentimental than the others. It's amazing how often Eminem makes strong references to his family members. I'm sure he's stepping out of the limelight so he can spend more time with them.<br />- The Steve Berman skit is hilarious...<br />- When The Music Stops is one of the least notable tracks on the album, but it's a decent track. D12 fans will be happy to hear them here.<br />- Say What You Say is a hard beating attack on Jermaine Dupri. I'm not a fan of Dupri, so I'm not offended. This track is actually the hardest beating track on the cd.<br />- 'Till I Collapse is one of those \\"I can't take any more of this crap and I'm ready to kill some people\\" songs. Eminem calls everyone out here, flowing so furiously his mic must have been doused in spit. This is an ill track. Nate Dogg's appearance let's you know. I love this song.<br />- My Dad's Gone Crazy... ahhhh... if only we had an album devoted to this Eminem. I had the most fun with this track, and apparently so did Mr. Mathers and his daughter. Jokes about coming out of the closet and Afghanistan make this track hilarious. The beginning of the second verse and the break are both priceless. Vanilla Ice's son? I get the point. Classic track.<br />- The curtains close and a friend of Shady's steps up to the mic. Classsic ending.<br /><br />This is a great album. As far as rap goes, I don't expect many near-future releases to surpass this. This is classic hip-hop from the greatest. Even though it's not better than The Marshall Mather's LP, this release is downright essential. If you don't have it, buy it now.ouchable sleeper track here.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The new strokes album is diffrent. Diffrent in a good way. this just shows their not afraid to take chances , and what comes out is brilliant. The lyrics are just amazing. The vocals are nice and without the distortion casablancas sounds diffrent but better.I mean my mom heard it and asked if i was listening to u2...crazy. The whole album is just interesting.To me the rythem section really stands out more on this album it is much louder.I think it runs about 52 minutes which is kinda long. While it might be a bit long it still keeps you entertained and changes pace alot. I am a little dissapointed to see their old sound change. thats probably why im giving it a 4. At the same time im glad that i got somthing new and diffreent. I mean Is this it and room on fire just have a diffrent sound and i was afraid i might be bored if they did it another album like those two. Some of the later songs might seem a little like filler at first...but they get better with time. some bonuses are the artwork in the cover, all of it awesome. <br />key tracks:you only live once,vision of division,electricityscape
B00000JHAU|2.0|...but every song on the album sounds the same. And I happen to like them. Disappointed.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I realy liked The Darkness' first album, Permission To Land, but One Way Ticket is ever better. If you like The Darkness' unique blend of pop-retro-metal with blazing guitars and falsetto vocals, One Way Ticket delivers the goods. I love every track on this album. Standouts include the title track, Knockers, and Hazel Eyes.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I been looking at the websites about \\"Battle Royale\\" and they might bring a BR 3 out. BR II was a great movie too. But the origional is the best. When I first watched this I didn't get it. But I watched it again like 5 months later and I loved it! I just keep watching it over and over again. I also got this DVD for christmas. If people like gore and action movies then you should see this. You have to have the subtitles on though.
B000B8TOH6|5.0|The Greatest hits cd, is what it is......If you are a big bon jovi fan you will love this cd, Personally I love it! Thats why I gave it 5 stars! Nice job bon jovi!
B00062J00S|5.0|What a waste of money it was to get Universal's version of \\"it's a wonderful life\\" - a horrid blurry transfer with a greenish caste to it. The republic version, aptly described as being derived from the original negative, has rich tight blacks and is sharp as a tack. A great movie to have in any collection
B00005JOFO|5.0|Overall, I think this movie was great. Ennis and Jack discover their affection for one another as they work together during the summer as sheep herders back in 1963. After they had their sexual encounter, Jack is not afraid to share his feelings. And  deep down inside, Ennis has feelings for Jack, but he rejects the idea of having a life together with Jack. He rejects the idea because he is reminded of a hate crime that occured when Ennis was a child, where a man was killed because he lived with another man. Ennis knew that society would not be ready to accept him and Jack living together either. When I saw the ending of the movie, I thought it felt awkward and left me feeling empty. And as I read in another reviewer's comments on another site, the ending is supposed to leave you feeling empty. But I think the ending fits in with Ennis's character as he still tried to be involved with his children to some extent, which happens throughout the whole movie. And I didn't think of this until today, but it's ironic at the end of the movie how Ennis's daughter announces she is going to get married, and she's all happy about it. Yet, Ennis is all alone and does not have his true love with him. <br /> <br />I also wanted to comment on a couple other reviews I had seen on this site. <br /> <br />One person had commented that Ennis and Jack never seemed to age over this 20 year story. On the contrary, I felt that the make up artists did a good job at making them look older, particularly with Jack having the moustache and a little bit of grey hair. <br /> <br />Another reviewer had commented that they felt this love story was not as romantic or as endearing as they thought it would be. And perhaps it is not as romantic or endearing as you might think with having seen the previews. Although I do feel there were a couple scenes where they kissed and cuddled, which I thought was somewhat romantic. And I thought it was touching when Ennis cried after their summer of sheep herding came to an end. And it was even more touching as Ennis hugged Jack's coat towards the end of the movie. However, I think these reviewers who were expecting a highly romantic movie need to step back and think a little. This movie is NOT a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" movie where everything is all romantic, poetic, and flowery. It's a movie about 2 cowboys who discover they have feelings for each other while working together as sheep herders back in 1963. Being a gay man myself, I know that when you first discover you have feelings for another person of the same sex, this can be confusing. And it certainly must be a confusing thing for 2 cowboys to have feelings for each other and not understand them. Plus the fact that this story takes place in 1963, when homosexuality is not widely discussed, and certainly not accepted by society. And just like there are varying types of love and relationships amongst straight people where some couples are romantic and others aren't so much, the same can hold true for homosexual relationships too. <br /> <br />At any rate, this movie was well worth seeing, and I hope to buy it when it comes out on DVD! And I also hope that this helps to change society's view on homosexuality.
B000BP86OG|4.0|I mean really... were the ticket ONE way, just how would the bearer get back? Takes me back to a certain film titled \\"Airheads\\", with a band called the Lone Rangers. <br /> <br />But I digress. The music here is actually quite good and truly stands out amidst much of what is being processed via cookie cutters these days.
0451191153|5.0|I first read \\"The Fountainhead\\" when I was in my early twenties and it changed my view of the world forever.  I finished the last sentence of the book at 4 a.m. on a work night and was so moved, so enthralled, so changed, I started reading it again right away even though I was exhausted.  In the intervening twenty years I've read it a couple of other times and have become more aware of Rand's eccentricities and failings as a writer, but it is still a powerful story, one that expresses ideas one is unlikely to encounter anywhere else and that everyone should read in their late teens or early twenties.  I do recommend reading Rand's \\"We The Living\\" before tackling \\"Fountainhead\\" (\\"We the Living\\" shows where Rand came from and why she became the extremist she did) and, if you're still motivated, read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" afterwards.  It's the order her novels were written in and they all definitely make more sense if read in that order.  Are there things to disagree with in the book?  Of course. Was Rand an extremist screwball? Definitely.  But what world changer ever wasn't?  Read these books, give them to all the young people you know when they are at the proper age to appreciate them.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|I have to start off this review by saying that I have never seen the 1974 original with Burt Reynolds, who also shows up in the update as the inmates coach, so I can't compare the two movies. This could be a good thing because most reviews I read always stated how much the first one was better. Granted I can still compare this version to the other Adam Sandler football movie, The Waterboy. It's odd that no one complained about Sandler playing a linebacker in that movie yet everyone jumped on him for trying to be a quarterback. And he was a washed up one to boot so I really didn't have a problem with it. <br /> <br />Of course the movie is about the washed up QB in prison but how he gets there is great with cameos by Courtney Cox's newly enormous breasts and Dan Patrick, who apparently didn't get the memo that the movie would be set in present day as he instead chose to go with the 70's gay porn mustache with a dash of the Village People. But from there Sandler is shipped off to a Texan prison where the warden pulled some strings in hope that he would help out with the prison guard's football team. And what would be better practice for the guards than a little warm up game against a team of inmates. <br /> <br />Even though most of the inmates and guards are played by former football player, pro wrestlers and other non-actors, most of the characters are so well written, it makes up for any lack of acting experience. Ultimate Fighter Bob Sapp is great as the mentally slow Switowski, Michael Irvin in a role before he started holding onto his buddies narcotics plays a con who still doesn't trust Sandler after selling out his teammates in the NFL, and the giant Dalip Singh English was so bad they had to subtitle everything. As for the guards, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Brian Bosworth, who was always a better actor than football player, but that isn't saying much, and Bill Romanowski all play their tough guys well but I bet Romo was mad that Stone Cold got to utter the racial slurs and not him. But the standout of the guard is Kevin Nash who even though goes into every clich conceived is hilarious after the inmates replaced his steroids with estrogen. <br /> <br />But not all the characters are well flashed out. It's hard to relate to Nelly talking how poor his character is when he has a couple gold teeth and Goldberg one running gag that his, um, chariot swings low, so to speak, gets old before it starts. The cast is filled out with more traditional actors with Chris Rock channeling Morgan Freeman as Caretaker, Terry Crews, who has gone on to play Rock's dad on Everybody Hates Chris, is hilarious as the cheeseburger dude, as is Nicolas Turturro as the early recruit who is quickly benched as more black inmates show up.
B00005JO9J|5.0|The special features are good, with insight into the writing. The extra scenes are good, though i wouldnt buy the DVD purely for them -- buy it for the show.<br />  I have seen every episode of the first season, and it's addictive!! Very funny, heartwarming and just all around enjoyable. The actors are great, my favorite character is George, because he seems so docile, but can be pushed to insanity. Best quotes, great writing and gripping. It's anything and everything you could want in an hour. I recorded this show on a whim on my DVR, and once I got into it I couldnt stop and watched the whole season in a sitting. I think this show differs from most medical dramas because it centers more about the lives of the interns, vs the big head surgeons, who are just supporting cast. It's not as straight drama as ER, and not as comedy as scrubs, it's just in the middle, and it's perfect.
B00008CQS0|5.0|I ordered the 23-track version from Amazon.co.uk two days before Christmas and received it in less than two weeks.

B0006IUDXA|4.0|Dana Alcar guest's in Pilot as a completely different character other than Pete Thornton, whom he'll come to play later already in Season One.  The back-story (lore?) for Mac was not yet quite in place and so is a bit uneven -- and, frankly, Richard Dean Anderson hadn't quite gotten the rhythm of his character until about half-way through the season.  By pilot of Season Two -- THAT is the start of classic Mac.  But unless you are a MEGA-Die Hard Mac fan, you'll be quite satisfied to skip Season One and go right into Season Two where the first episode gives just enough back explanation about Pete's role at Phoenix to get you off and running.  (Wish I'd known that before I bought the set!)<br /><br />Though, I must say, the first episode with Penny Parker, the first episode with Mac's Grandpa Harry, and the episode with the Fire Ants are among my favorite of all-time Mac episodes, and they are in Season One.
0064471837|5.0|How do you begin?  Sabriel is the best book that I have ever read.  It is full of suspense, adventure, magic, and many other things that only Garth Nix could come up with.  It is pure ingenious.  I just finished reading the trilogy over again for a third time and want to read it again.  The way he writes and describes things its as if you are in the story and with the characters.  Garth Nix is the truly the best author.  I would also recommend all the other books that he has written-they are all excellent; but I will have to say that Sabriel beats all!

Now so many others will get to experience the lives of these rich and earthy characters and oh and ah at the way McCullers puts ordinary words together that roll off the pages in a very extraordinary way to make this an unforgettable story. Don't pass up an opportunity to read this book; its one of those rare books that you will hardly be able to wait to go to bed with. <br />
B000002HK4|3.0|Awake was a stunning album. This isn't. Those 7 words pretty much describe A Change of Seasons for me. New boy Derek Sherinian is on keyboards for this album, and he's not a bad keyboardist. The fact is, there is 1 original song on this whole album. The rest is a bunch of covers, and I find that pretty boring. A Change of Seasons, the 24 minute title track is an interesting piece of musical art. It skips around with a lot of musical ideas, and eventually it ends up as a cohesive piece. The classic rock covers really just get boring after a while. I wouldn't recomment this album as a must have.

0393312836|5.0|Although in Mr. Burgess' introduction, A Clockwork Orange Resucked, he rambles on about how much he doesn't like this book, I read it and was nothing short of amazed.  <br /> <br />In a world where criminals rule the street after dark and anyone standing in their way will get killed stands young Alex and his \\"droogs\\" (invented slang for close friends) are young and bloodthirsty teens who go about every night robbing, beating, and raping innocent people. This part was extremely disturbing, as they involved terrible acts of violence, such as the beating of an old man, the robbery and beating and raping of a couple (the husband was writing a book called \\"A Clockwork Orange), and the drugging and violent raping of two ten-year-old girls. Finally, after beating an old woman to death while robbing her house, Alex is caught by the police and sent to jail, charged with mainly murder.  <br /> <br />Here the book takes a very personal turn, and really shows you how Alex feels, and exposes the real person inside him, not just a ruthless, violent child out to terrorize the world. In jail you get connected to him as he gets disconnected from the world.  <br /> <br />In two years time it seems like Alex has really cleaned up his act, and is released to a group of doctors who will test a new technique where they are able to program the violence out of Alex. They succeed in doing so, but now Alex is not a real person, for he cannot chooses how he wants to live. He is now a free man who can walk the streets alone, but now that he's been reformed into an ordinary citizen, nobody wants him and he has many encounters with previous victims, including F. Alexander, the author of A Clockwork Orange, who Alex beat up and raped his wife (along with three other guys). It's revealed that after being beaten up so badly and raped so fiercely, the wife died.  <br /> <br />This was probably the strangest part of the book and one that really crawled under my skin.  <br /> <br />Alex is now repeatedly betrayed by people and finally, in an attempt to end it all, jumps out a window. <br /> <br />But Alex does not die. He wakes up in the hospital weeks later and finds out he's back to normal.  <br /> <br />The book ends where it begins, for the most part, but, although it sounds awful, this book was really well written.  <br /> <br />It is very sad, tragic, and true, but also makes you think about certain things that you usually do not. It's hard to explain, but, read the book. It will do you good.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I remember when I heard that Peter Jackson's next project, after hitting big with The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, was going to be a remake of \\"King Kong\\".  Quite frankly, I couldn't believe my ears because what else could be made out of the simplest story ever: a giant ape that falls for a blonde...an interpretation of beauty and the beast.  Then I thought to myself that Jackson could create a new vision with the help of the wizards of WETA, and since he wanted to set the story back to the New York of 1933, I couldn't help myself but wonder.  One thing was for sure: this new remake was going to be at least better than the 1976 version.  And God, I wasn't wrong!!<br /><br />In my personal opinion, this happens, hands down, to be the best movie of 2005 (CAUTION: I still haven't seen \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" or \\"Munich\\".).  In spite of the three-hour length, Peter Jackson presents his view on Kong beyond my expectations.  All the characters are interesting and well-depicted: Naomi Watts' performance as Ann Darrow is fantastic, showing frailty, charm, and strength -all in on one single package.  Adrien Brody is nice as playwright Jack Driscoll.  Jack Black surprisingly demonstrates that he can be more than a comedian, he can be a great actor when he wants it and be on the same level as Bill Murray or Robin Williams.  And it would be very difficult and long for me to describe the rest of the supporting characters because each and every one of them has something to make you care for them.<br /><br />Hell, even Kong has a tremendous personality.  Call me stupid, ridiculous...whatever -I quite frankly don't care.  The magicians at WETA's use of Andy Serkis for Kong's movements is astonishing.  You can laugh at Kong turning his back on Ann after rescuing her from the T-Rexes.  You can be afraid of Kong when he displays his rage.  You can be happy when Kong is happy, specially in that Central Park scene.  And, more importantly, you can feel sorry, pity, or sad when Kong meets his end.  Everything in here is indeed marvelous.<br /><br />Once again, I dare say that \\"King Kong\\" is a masterpiece of its own.  A great homage to the 1933 original.  This film proves that Peter Jackson may become the George Lucas of the 21st century.ything in here is indeed marvelous. <br />Once again, I dare say that \\"King Kong\\" is a masterpiece of its own.

B000A35VTW|5.0|This is the second book I've read from this author, and I am quite stunned by how different \\"The Alchemist\\" is from this book, \\"Eleven Minutes\\".  Yet, even with their many differences, there is still the similar thread of telling a story that will make the reader think about their own lives, their own beliefs & their own thoughts...<br /><br />\\"Eleven Minutes\\" is, on the surface, a book about sex - and all the good and bad associated with it.  However, if you're able to get through the more graphic parts with an open mind, you will find that this is more a book about love - and how we confuse sex & love - and how we no longer seem to be able to find the love in sex...<br /><br />It is about one woman's journey from an innocent young girl who believed that she had squandered her only chance at love, to a young woman who chooses the life of prostitution, to a woman who, although still young, has decided to open her heart again to allow \\"real\\" love in.<br /><br />Although I found this book to be really interesting, I have to point out that it's not for the \\"faint of heart\\", nor is it for people who believe that sex is a sin.  In fact, I believe that the only way one can gain anything from this book is if they approach it with a totally open mind, and allow the author to take you along on this journey, and to help you learn what you will along the way...<br /><br />An interesting side note is that this book is based on a true story.

B000AP04FG|4.0|this movie was definitly fun to watch. it was a bit slow in the beginning but once you got a bit of background on their secret lives things picked up. some of the shooting near the end dragged on but maybe thats just because im not a big action fan. <br />it was even funny in some parts and i loved the tension between them, especailly when they danced. i also loved the last line.  <br />overall it was obviously not to be taken seriously but well done for what it was.
B000002UUX|5.0|Anyone who criticizes great bands and loves corny bands really should not have any credibily in reviewing albums. At first I was like whatever with ILFOB, but then you accuse the metal community of being idiots and having poor taste in music. You probably are a girl, mid teens amd think My chemical romance Invented rock, pop is great and Kanye West is a lyricists. I don't know whether to laugh or vomit reading your reviews because you really don't know nothing about Megadeth or Dave Mustaine or great metal in general. Just see how many positive reviews this album has and they've been around over 20 years and bands you like will dissapear after the summer is gone. Dave Mustaine could whip any emo bands, pop artists or modern rapper just by snapping his fingers.

B00003CXMG|3.0|I neither loved nor hated this film.  I can't say much bad about it, and I can't pinpoint many things I liked about it either.  Guess it's just not my kind of film. <br /> <br />But there were some good points.  The acting is top notch.  The dialogue and direction is natural and engaging.  There were one or two moments that made me chuckle with their gentle humor. <br /> <br />But there were bad points too.  I liked the viewpoint character, but the rest were remarkably unsympathetic and often mildly annoying.  Although no one else seems to think that, so this criticism can be disregarded, I think.  Also, I didn't like the mother at all.  Not one little bit.  Judgmental, pretentious, obnoxious, Yech. <br /> <br />Also, the production design and costuming is exceptional, but the 70s was such an ugly decade that it kind of put me off.  That's not really a fair complaint either though. <br /> <br />A good film, not great.  But then again, it's not my thing so if it is your thing, I do recommend it.
0553801503|1.0|Some think the book is about character development, which shows the depth of Martin's writing.  I think Martin has no idea where the story is going and just writes to get a book out.  It was 800 pages about second string characters and subplots at best.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Silly humor is probably one of the trickiest art forms.  Parodies also fall into that category.  And this film is a perfect examples of what separates an amusing movie from a classic. <br /> <br />To begin with, a lot of this humor is just too lowbrow.  I have nothing against lowbrow, but gross out jokes get old real fast, so you've got to have something else.  Unfortunately, this movie has too many one joke scenes that stretch on too long.  It's a very fine line between funny and kind of stupid, and clearly the Wayans Bros. don't always know the difference. <br /> <br />The other fatal flaw involves parodies.  When you make a beat-for-beat parody, you risk losing the part of the audience that hasn't seen what you're making fun of.  There were jokes here based on fads I had to strain to remember.  And we're talking about a movie made about five years ago. <br /> <br />It's an okay film with a few chuckles.  Nothing special.  If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably enjoy it once or twice.  But that's about it.

0792846303|5.0|A small seaside community is engulfed by an eerie glowing fog which is said to be the spirits of dead lepers, who were killed by the town's residents from 100 years earlier, coming back for revnege. John Carpenter has crafted a masterpiece of an old-fashioned ghost story. Possibly my favourite horror movie, THE FOG possesses everything a fright flick should have: excellent cast and characters, suspenseful screenplay, atmospheric and haunting music score, moody cinematography and ghosts who actually manage to scare the wits out of you. I'll admit it is somewhat of an \\"obvious\\" ghost story, but what horror film doesn't have any predictability within it? VERY highly recommended to horror fans and filmgoers alike! A truly great horror film!

0764005685|4.0|Jennifer Connelly stars as a girl who attends a creepy boarding school for girls in Switzerland, where several girls have been slaughtered by a killer. She soon realizes she has the ability to telepathically communicate with insects and uses this power to track down the killer. Laced with unusual touches that make the film seem dream-like, Dario Argento creates yet another spectacular masterpiece. The acting is impressive (although the dubbing inevitably leads to some cheesiness in some scenes), the music score is one of the best horror movie scores ever, and the film is stylish and downright scary. For those interested in the gore, there are some devilishly creative death sequences which are sure to please. Possibly even better than SUSPIRIA.
0143034901|5.0|This book seems to inspire strong feelings--from the reviews I've read, people either love it or they hate it.  I happened to love it.<br /><br />I won't summarize the plot again, that's been done a number of times already.  But I want to give it my highest praise! This story was fun, engaging, intriguing...I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />The characters are fascinating, you can't help feeling something toward them. The story pulls you in, and while Zafon's writing is very descriptive, the story still moves at a fast pace. I never found myself getting antsy, wanting the plot to move along.<br /><br />People have compared Zafon to Eco, Marquez, Perez-Reverte. I can see how that's possible, but Zafon really has a different feel. It's lighter, and although he definitely has things to say about humanity, the meaning of life and our experiences, the story doesn't get bogged down by that. Even at its most intellectual, his writing never gets tedious. Something interesting is always going on.<br /><br />So I loved this book! I would put it in my top 10. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery, drama, stories about relationships, how they change over time and how they affect who we become.  I can't wait to see what else this writer gives us in the future.
B00000F6FN|4.0|Haunting Italian production still terrifies today with its stunning colourful cinematography, eerie music by Goblin and several of the most frightening and original death sequences ever to be put on film. Dario Argento directed this seemingly modern fairy tale about a girl who attends an elegant dance school in Germany where, after several people are murdered, she realizes the staff is made up of a coven of witches who are after her next. Don't let the dubbing take away from the excellent performances that still remain in the visuals. The only problem is that there are still some plot holes at the end, but they are very minor. One of the best and scariest movies ever made. Highly recommended!
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP Is a very strong album. This albub was put out before eminem went mainstream pop. Not that i blame him, how much money does he have, i would have done it. With that being said, this Cd covers all fellings, Hate with a passion on \\"Kill  You\\" to \\"Who Knew\\" where he talks about how every one wants to be done with him know that he's a popular rap icon. Then you have \\"Stan\\", a song about a crazed fan that takes everyone Em says to seriously, and wants to be just like him, to the point of almost stalking. Then you have \\"Marshall Mathers\\" where em tries to tell everyone hes human just like the rest of his. Btch please II is a classic, as is my favorite song on the album, Criminal, the beats are awesome, his lyrics are deep and meaningful, this is easily eminems best album to date, i would reccomend this CDE to anyone. <br />

I thought the intro was good but I skipped it because I wanted to get to the actual songs. It surprised me, i was expecting a \\"screamo\\" type (because that's the type of music my friend listens to) but it was a kind of a dance-rock that I had never heard before. They don't really sound like any other artist which is good, very original.

6301969294|4.0|\\"The Fountainhead\\" and marble rocks have this in common: elements are mashed together, and something different comes out. <br /> <br />Of course you can't expect the entire novel to be converted into a movie. That's almost never done, and for a good reason. And there were a lot of elements from the book that couldn't make it into the movies in 1949, like the Peter Keating-Dominique Francon divorce, her rape at the hands of Roarke, nude statues, etc.  <br /> <br />But other scenes were converted quite nicely, especially the fireplace scene, where the nature of marble is described. Another excellent scene is the courtroom, where Roarke makes his defense, and praise of individuality and excellence.  <br /> <br />So while it's an uneven adaptation of the book, the movie itself as some good elements. Away from the rather clipped pace and dialogue, it's an interesting look into the world of Ayn Rand.
B00005JLT5|5.0|and lives of their families to help him. The same<br />is true of practically every Polish Jew that survived<br />Nazi occupation of Poland. However inadequate those<br />efforts might have been they remain a testimony that<br />in in the darkest of times there are people who will<br />defend what they consider decent and human - at all cost.<br />I am very grateful that Polanski broke from Hollywood<br />blueprint of portraying Poles as spineless collaborators<br />of Nazis and presented more balanced point of view.<br />And put \\"Warsaw Uprising\\" back on the map - most sources<br />only talk about uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto in Apr 1943<br />and never mention the \\"gentile\\" uprising that lasted from<br />Aug to Oct of 1944. 260,000 people were killed during that<br />struggle - by comparison total war US casualties were 418,500.<br />But enough history lessons.<br />The Pianist is excellent in its super-realistic portrayal<br />of survival told from a first person perspective.

B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie... is an album that was much acclaimed on its initial release, becoming a huge hit and developing an immediate reputation as something of an alt-rock landmark.  Subsequent years have seen the Pumpkins become less fashionable, and their albums (this in particular!!) have been criticised for being nothing more than sprawling, self-indulgent odes to Billy Corgan's rock-star apathy, and sense of creative pretension.  Whether this criticism holds true is really down to the individual listener... to me, it still sounds good, even if this kind of store-bought angst doesn't really ring true in an age where the word is threatened by something much more uncertain (and much more dangerous!) than rampant self-pity. <br /> <br />The album holds together exceedingly well, which is surprising given the tendency for double albums to wane slightly at certain points of the running time... Mellon Collie just about works, capturing the same sense of mystery and archaic wonder suggested by the retro-style cover art, whilst aurally conforming to the fuzzy-distorted style of guitar-driven alt-rock popular in the last decade.  There are, of course, deeper musical references to be found beneath the grungy veneer, with Corgan and Co. drawing on elements of shoe-gazer dream pop, 80's style electro, 70's prog and indie-orchestral... managing to find a comfortable middle-ground between Black Sabbath and Procol Harum, whilst simultaneously pointing to My Bloody Valentine and British label-mates The Auteurs (particularly their mid-nineties opus, After Murder Park).  Some songs are better than others, which is to be expected of an album that clocks in at almost two-hours, with Corgan really pushing the light-grunge distortion thing on the first disk, offering up live standards like Jellybelly, Galapogos and Muzzle, as well as the singles, Bullet with the Butterfly Wings and Zero. <br /> <br />There's also the beautiful instrumental title-track, which shows the Pumpkins moving into the realms of melody and atmosphere... something that had often been buried beneath the layers of angular guitars and piercing percussion.  Then there's that other great single, Tonight Tonight, a string drenched ballad that is cinematic in the best possible sense (the video, which captured the hand-cranked, colour-tinted style of films like A Trip to the Moon, remains one of the greatest music videos ever made), and does act as the calm before the raging storm that developed throughout the next four or five tracks.  Other highlights from the first disk include the raging and pulsating Love (a song that has fierce droning noises and angular samples that seem to evoke dentist drills and tattooist's needles), the lush To Forgive (one of Corgan's most beautiful ballads) and the gentle James Iha penned closer, Take Me Down. <br /> <br />The second disk is more varied... Corgan and his co-producers (Alan Moulder and U2/My Bloody Valentine collaborator Flood) incorporating more electronic samples, slower tempos and traces of light-jazz (most apparent in that gorgeous track, In The Arms of Asleep).  The most iconic moment here is the ber-hit-single 1979, Corgan's anthemic ode to apathetic youth and listless abandon, which still stands up exceedingly well ten-years on, even if it does lack the musical adventurousness of certain other songs found on the album(s) in question.  Thru the Eyes of Ruby is an epic stadium-rock ballad that begins well, but quickly becomes a mess of repeated choruses and repetitive solos, until the end when it suddenly becomes a beautiful acoustic downer, and, for one brief moment, begins to make sense... much better is the pulsating Where Boys Fear to Tread, the fantastically sinister Bodies (perhaps my ultimate favourite song from both albums), the bleak and remorseful Stumbleine, and the closing track, Farwell and Goodnight, which is really the best place to end. <br /> <br />Between those highlights there are a few other hidden-gems (X.Y.U., Tales of the Scorched Earth, An Ode to No One, Beautiful, Lily..., etc), but really there's too much to mention.  You could argue that some of the album's heavier tracks now sound dated... or that the mid-90's vogue for all things self-pitying (a trend that reached it's nadir with nu-metal) sounds a little embarrassing in this \\"indie-saturated\\" day and age.  Regardless, I think Mellon Collie is a great piece of work... an epic and ambitious project that shows Corgan and the Pumpkins moving away from the anthemic grunge rock of Siamese Dream and embracing prog and almost psychedelic influences.  In fact, the only thing missing from the album to make it more authentic (in a late 60's early 70's sense) is an overriding concept... however, that said, many have take the sequencing of the record (and the two-disk subtitles Dawn to Dusk/Twilight to Starlight) to imply a conceptual feel. <br /> <br />Whether or not you approach the album this way is completely down to you... though for me, the album seems to be about the idea of dreams and nightmares, and how even the most beautiful of dreams can be as troubling and as upsetting as even the most terrifying of nightmares.  It's hard to believe that this album is already ten years old.  I remember listening to it a lot through school and college, but then, sort of forgot about it sometime a few years ago.  Reacquainting myself with an album that played such a large part in sound-tracking my adolescence was a strange experience... and although I feel I probably enjoyed it a lot more as teenager, I feel that it's an album that justifies itself perfectly, featuring a handful of great and/or interesting songs, and proving once and for all, that the Pumpkins where a greater and more creative band that most would ever give them credit for.
B00005JOQ9|2.0|Gotta blame Jim Carrey and Steve Martin.  These dudes' latest box office clunkers were showing at my local theater--leaving HOSTEL the lone remaining alternative inside Theater #1.  I didn't know much about HOSTEL; heck, I didn't know anything about<br /><br />HOSTEL.  But I do like staying in exotic hotels, so what the hey?  I realized this film was produced by Quentin Tarantino, but for all I knew the controversial director/producer could've had a change of creative heart and made a movie about room service and breakfast buffets. Was worth a look, anyway.<br /><br />Well.  HOSTEL, at least at first, was like Comedy Central's \\"The Man Show\\" on acid:  three dweebs (two Americans, one Icelander, all unlikeable) traipsing through Europe in pursuit of the ultimate hedonistic high.  The bongs and the broads are plentiful, but our three protagonists (Have I mentioned they're unlikeable?) want more.  They are told of a special hostel in an eastern European country behind the old Soviet Iron Curtain.  They are shown some pics of naked vixens taken via a camera phone--taken allegedly at the hostel of Paradise--and the three guys are on the next train headed east.<br /><br />As predictable as predictability itself, all is not well at the hostel of Paradise, and the three travelers, one by one, fall prey to a meat grinder torture chamber--a warped and demented establishment where patrons from the world over pay exorbitant sums to slice and dice unwilling (and screaming) victims.  One of our three \\"heroes\\" manages to catch a break during his fun session and escape (or at least, run around from room to room, from incinerator to parking lot, and back again, and to parking lot again, ad infinitum); the plot then takes on a morbid cat-and-mouse chase, until our \\"hero\\" extracts a totally unbelievable and out-of-character pound of vengeance flesh.<br /><br />Writer/director Eli Roth bombards the viewer with blood and wounds and gore galore--yet the carnage looked like something a group of junior high kids would come up with by raiding their folks' freezers and slinging the stuff around.  In fact, the gore very much reminded me of Peter Jackson's early horror offerings (and that's pretty sad).  As another fact, I wasn't sure--by all the nonsensical slipping in pools of blood and split-second amputations and groping for appendages and so on--if Roth was really trying to present a horror flick, or a parody of a horror flick.  And if HOSTEL is a parody, it's a bad parody; if it's a horror movie, it's even worse.<br /><br />But still better than Martin or Carrey.<br /><br />--D.

B000002L68|5.0|Despite being a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, producer, performer of impeccably high standards... I've never been fully able to take Prince entirely serious as an artist.  Perhaps it's because of the mystique surrounding him, the whole look and persona, the over-sexed lyrics and perfectionism bordering on egomaniacal megalomania?  Or perhaps I'm just jealous that I'll never write a song as universally affecting as When Doves Cry, I Would Die 4 U, or Purple Rain?  Regardless, if we can forget about Prince the performer for a moment and concentrate on Prince the songwriter, producer, instrumentalist, then there's much to enjoy with this album. <br /> <br />Still probably best known for its relationship with the film of the same name (which I haven't actually seen), Purple Rain continues the pop-direction that Prince had been moving towards with 1999, with songs like Little Red Corvette and Lady Cab Driver being taken to their logical conclusion with songs like Let's Go Crazy, the first track on the album, and that perennial favourite, When Doves Cry.  I love the way the album begins, with that slightly gospel sounding synth-organ and Prince preaching the opening lines \\"dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life... electric word life means forever and that's a mighty long time, but I'm here to tell you, there's something else... the after world\\" before the whole thing takes off in a shimmering burst of production-heavy pop. <br /> <br />Certainly, the production is a little dated in many places, particularly on a song like Take Me With You, with Prince and his band relying heavily on dreamy keyboards, synthesisers, drum machines and a dominant bass, with interweaving female harmony vocals (in the case of Take Me With You, curtsey of Purple Rain co-star and Prince-protg Apollonia, but also iconic turns from Wendy and Lisa, most notably in the intro to Computer Blue) and the odd stab at the guitar breaking through the 80's slush.  As a result, it may sound a little anachronistic to listeners weaned on more recent acts, though certainly, from a rock and pop perspective, if you can overlook similarly dated arrangements of certain albums from Madonna, The Cure, Kate Bush or any early electro-act, then you can probably over-look the production/instrumentation here. <br /> <br />Prince elevates at least three of the songs to a more epic, cinematic sphere by adding string arrangements, sometime organic, sometimes synthetic, but always adding a further layer to the songs and the overall mood of the piece.  The Beautiful Ones is a great ballad that has a much more organic sound that the previous tracks, and features a fine falsetto vocal from Prince and some great instrumentation, whilst Darling Nikki, at the time the album's most controversial moment, is a great grinding, seedy, sexed up vignette that finds a libidinous Prince playing every instrument himself and, in the process, creating a remarkable album high that manages to sound humours and edgy simultaneously.  This brings us to When Doves Cry, one of the three or four solid classics on the album and easily one of the purple one's defining moments. <br /> <br />When Doves Cry seems like a more personal song for Prince, or perhaps he's just expressing the themes and ideas of the tie-in film (I don't know... I'm not that familiar with the man's biography), but regardless, his vocals are fantastic, his range of instrumentation (once again, a track that Prince played every instrument on) is peerless, as he creates a contrasting drum/keyboard hook to complement the lyrics, and adds some outstanding heavy-metal style guitar playing.  Certainly, this could be considered one of the greatest American pop singles of the 1980's (...or, of all time) and really, hasn't dated in the slightest.  Baby I'm A Star is a nice bit of fluff, nothing remarkable, though it does act as a nice coda to that other great single, I Would Die 4 U (I fell in love with acover version of this from a few years back... and then discovered Prince's original), an up-tempo pop song with lyrics that seem culled from the most heartbreaking of ballads. <br /> <br />Speaking of which, we then have the closing track... eight and a half minutes of searing emotion, fantastic playing and a great overall performance from Prince and the Revolution.  Along with Let's Go Crazy, Darling Nikki, When Doves Cry and I Would Die 4 U, Purple Rain is another fine reason to buy this album.  The vocals are impassioned, the instrumentation minimal and in keeping with the emotion at the heart of the song, and, if that wasn't enough, the storming (and decidedly epic) guitar solo during the last few minutes is perfectly judged and shows that Prince's musical influences go beyond pop, funk and old style R&B, to embrace rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and (if we recall the other guitar solo on When Doves Cry) early Van Halen. <br /> <br />As I said before, I tend to prefer more stripped down and personal music, in which we can hear the songwriter really expressing something personal... a style that Prince doesn't necessarily favour.  Regardless, if you can overlook the occasionally 80's style production and look beyond the bombastic arrangements, you'll find a great, up-tempo pop album, with some absolutely astounding (and really quite beautifully created) pieces of music.
0307276902|1.0|I read this book in about a day after hearing about him on Oprah.  The first couple of pages brought serious doubts to mind about the authenticity of his \\"story\\". <br /> <br />I have since learned that Mr. Frey fabricated a majority of the things that happened to him and attempted to sell this book 17 times as a work of fiction not non-ficiton. <br /> <br />I feel duped because as a consumer I thought I was reading a true story. <br /> <br />Would not recommend this book to anyone.
B0000X61UU|4.0|I first started doing this tape almost 10 years ago and it's still one of my favorites.  There's great leg sections that build muscle with lunges, squats and kicks.  The ab section is extensive and is combined with chest weights.  The arm section is really the best thing about this whole video....it's really helped me develop some great muscle tone in my shoulders and back.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for more cardio then this tape isn't the best it's more about strength so you'd have to add some other kind of cardio like running to get a total body workout.
B00000JH09|5.0|This is by far systems best album!!!  All the songs are unique and kick some serious ass!!!  This is a lot different than the newer System records such as Mezmerize and Hypnotize...so don't expect that sh**...so if u want to experience Mind Numbing head rushes and disturbing hallucinations, CHECK THIS OUT!!!!!!!!!
B0000AOV85|4.0|First consumer beware!  If you are lookng for a DVD with all the fantastic video clips of this legendary recording, this is not what you are looking for.  There are short clips taken from the videos on certain selections.  If you were interested in what was the mind set of the band members and the driving force  behind this great album you found what you are looking for.  This is one on one interviews with the band members, production personell, and entertainment journalist of the time.  You will learn what makes this recording one of the greatest of all time.  After watching this video myself, I have enjoyed listening to the music more.  You start to hear the little things that define Pink Floyds music that you may have never really noticed before.  understanding the music will bring a greater appreciation to it.

B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is the best sequel ever made in my opinion.  This movie had it all, more aliens lots of gung ho soldiers and a cute little girl who shames Paxton with her courage.  Couldn't of asked for more from a sequel.  Now what came after in the other installments is another story.  What they should have done or should do if they ever make another installment is to have it where Earth actually finds the home planet of the Aliens and sends in an a large force to destroy the horrible creatures for ever.  A good title would be called \\"Aliens Genocide.\\" Lots of action and you wouldn't even need to have a good plot, just shoot em up bang bang. <br />Or you could have where we capture an alien and bring it to Earth for study and it gets loose and runs amuck, but that would surely be horrible but you can expect something like that.  Go with the Home planet idea. {:~) <br />But I won't hold my breath.
0446677450|4.0|This book does a good job detailing Robert T. Kiyosaki's childhood inspiration. Like the Donald Trump books before Rich Dad, Poor Dad is not intended as a financial guide. Mr.Kiyosaki raises the possibilities of real estate as a means to achieving millions; the gist remains his childhood experiences which can be worth untold millions. A great mixture of inspiration and un-common financial sense!
B0000640VO|5.0|You've gotta love Ameile.  This movie is so heart warming it can bring tears to your eyes, really.  This is the opposite extreme of A&I, Vanilla Sky, and Requiem for a Dream; all great movies but extreme downers.  Well Ameile is a great movie that makes you feel good all over.  A must see for any fans of feel good films.
B00006AG5N|4.0|I bought this CD last week and I was very impressed with the selection of songs as well as the sequence. Its very well put together in terms of fast, slow, mid tempo and all kinds of numbers that showcased Elvis eclectic style. I wont say its the absolute definitive Elvis Album because it doesnt include most of his very early work from Sun Studios. However, this has all the best known and best loved Elvis songs put together in a very fine package. The bonus track at the end: \\"A little less conversation\\", adds flavor and shows that Elvis's is a timeless voice that will last forever.
B000065R0C|5.0|This is a brilliant film.  Lola the played by Franke Potente is a Red Haired (not natural if you know what I mean)freaky type who gets a call from her boyfriend Manny who is frantic telling her he lost a bag of money that he was taking to Renni a bald headed cimminal type.  He states he has 20 minutes to get the money to Renni or he is a dead man. Lola tells him to stay where he is and she rushes out of her home to find $100,000 or is it in Deustch Marks?  Anyway this is a very clever story that takes place in real time.  So you may be thinking if the movie takes place in real time does it only last for 20 minutes?  HMMM, you will have to see the film.  The highest recommendation.  I would watch it w/o subtitles first then watch it with subtitles.  German film 5 plus stars  No need to watch it before you buy it.  It is easily worth the money
B00000293E|5.0|Willie Dixon is one of the few that could name an album \\"I Am The Blues\\" and not have it be a brash overstatement. Where would the blues be without the songs on this collection, every one of which he wrote himself. The proof is the number of artists that have covered his songs over the years: The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Magic Sam, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Sam Cooke, just to name a few. Willie Dixon was an integral part of the Chess records label and the Chicago blues scene, but also could deliver as a performer. Unlike the Amazon reviewer, I found this collection to be worth getting. While Dixon may not be the greatest blues singer ever in terms of technique, he delivers with heart and feeling, which is what the blues is all about. The backing musicians are talented too; my only complaint is that the personnel and the recording dates are not listed in the liner notes. Aside from that though, this disc is a chance to hear a blues legend play some of his best known material, and if you are a fan of the blues (as I am), you will enjoy this one.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and a very talented actor, but like someone else stated that was not enough to save this film.  Enough of the Japanese remakes.  The Ring was a great remake of Ringu.  But  The Grudge, Dark Water, and many others need to just stop it.  I am just waiting for Hollywood to Remake Tommy a very played out Japanese series of flims about a girl who won't die and keeps getting reborn in strange ways.  There are about a dozen of them literally; Tommy, Tommy Replay, etc.   <br />I just hope Hollywood doesn't touch Spiral a great Japanese film.  The Ring was great but let's leave Well enough alone. <br />If you want to see Jennifer Connelly in a great horror Film, rent Creepers by Dario Argento, she is about 15 or 16 years old and is excellent in this film.  Strangly she doesn't look much different back then than she does now which is kinda creepy in itself.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I guess the professional critics have read their instructions and found that we're not to like this record.  But being that I haven't gotten into Beefheart or Television yet, I may not be qualified... but if Spoon is considered so dang inventive, then maybe my ears are broke.   <br />Anyhow, sure there's a few so-so tracks here, but mostly this is the best rock album I've heard in a long time from a band that gets any promotion.   <br />I like it better on the whole than their first record.
0792839749|5.0|Dick Van Dyke and Benny Hill in the same film.  5 stars automatically.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Yes, the costumes are a bit cheesy, and so is the plot, but \\"Logan's Run\\" really kicked off the run of science fiction films in the 70s and helped get teens ready for \\"Star Wars\\" a few years later.<br /><br />Logan 5 isn't worried about the future; after all, one can be renewed at age 30, right? He spends his days tracking down \\"runners\\" - those who don't believe the renewal promise of Carousel and flee - and having sex with beautiful women, until his faith is shaken....<br /><br />A cast of beautiful people, including a young Jessica Agutter with Michael York, added to the appeal of this film in the 70s. Still a cult classic with sci-fi fans, and worth a look for this generation despite its dated effects. Five stars for a classic in the genre
0307276902|1.0|I had to read it. It's a social phenomenon. People at work talking about it. People on airplanes. People in waiting rooms.<br /><br />I surrendered. I was powerless against it. I took inventory. I made amends. I spent a whole Sunday reading it cover to cover.<br /><br />No, you can't put it down. Not because it's so good and so powerful and so inspiring, but because you can't wait to see what tall tale James Frey spins next.<br /><br />How could he have duped millions of people with this hyperbolic drivel? Are we all so starved for stories of people with lives worse than our own? Or is it because of the brainwashing of Oprah's Book Club machine?<br /><br />The story takes place at a rehab center (presumably Hazelden) that has the best recovery record of any rehab center in the world. Seventeen percent of people who go through the program will stay sober. Only seventeen percent. This is staggering to me as one of the few truths in the book.<br /><br />Dentistry like root canals done without novacaine but rather by clutching tennis balls? According to a couple of doctors I've talked to, a shot of a local anesthetic would be perfectly fine. What would happen if he needed major surgery? And what dentist would perform such an operation?<br /><br />On a plane, with a hole in his cheek, no front teeth, full of blood and vomit, unconscious and unattended?<br /><br />Mobsters and judges pulling strings for him?<br /><br />The crack house rescue?<br /><br />Ridiculous anecdotes and details aside, I found Frey's writing style to be lazy and repetitive:<br /><br />\\"Bayonets of Pain. The Fury. Blood. Vomit. Blood. Vomit.\\"  We GET it.<br /><br />Further, the lack of structure, randomly capitalized letters, and punctuation became tedious.<br /><br />This book insulting to recovering addicts and their families. It's insulting to 12-steppers. It's insulting to anyone with cognitive skills. I'd even say it's insulting to mobsters and crack-whores.<br /><br />Frey's biggest addiction seems to be for drama and narcissism. He's always the hero. Everyone wants to be his friend except the crazy guy. Every girl is beautiful. Everyone, including an old priest, wants to have sex with him. He is above the rules of the rehab center. In every situation, he beats us over the head with his subtextual, overcompensating comments about how tough he is.<br /><br />I'm not going to include the link to the Smoking Gun's six page expose on all the ways his book his fiction but it's an interesting, yet not surprising read.<br /><br />To those reviewers who contend that the book, marketed as fiction, would get lost and never sell, I heartily agree. I've read that he first tried to publish it as fiction several times and then \\"retooled\\" it so that it became a memoir.<br /><br />Well he got the \\"tool\\" part right.r />Frey's biggest addiction seems to be for drama and narcissism.

B000E1YW0E|5.0|I'm not much of a reviewer, and even less of a theatre regular, so I'll keep this short. I just got back from a showing of \\"Rent\\" at the local $2.99 theater; it was so good that I figured I'd toss in my two cents here.  <br /> <br />The songs of \\"Rent\\" were all great; each was hugely entertaining, poignant or gripping for its part (my favorites were \\"One Song Glory\\" and \\"What You Own\\"). I'd admit to a little bit of back-row sniffling if I weren't such a manly man. But to be honest, I hadn't realized how large a part homosexuality and AIDS played here (\\"East Village\\" should have been warning enough) -- so if you're an avowed bigot then you might want to steer clear and preserve those delicate sensibilities. For everybody else...I'd say definitely give \\"Rent\\" a shot. As a picture of humanity (which most of us can relate to on some level) alone, it's time well spent.
0345404475|3.0|I know that a lot of people really enjoy this book on its own terms and that it is pretty unfair/inaccurate to review it in light of the movie. However, most people who would consider reading this book now have probably seen Bladerunner and enjoyed it so much that they want to read the book. For this audience (which includes me) the book is not very good. <br /> <br />Comparing the book and the movie, the book is an exercise in framing a philosophical debate in a work of fiction, while the movie is about creating a dramatic work of entertainment that is also thought-provoking. Unfortunately, the book is unwieldy, vague and unimpressive as a philosophical work. Also, the story and characters of the book are far less compelling and engrossing than the movie. <br /> <br />I read this book because I wanted to know more about the fascinating world, characters, story and ideas of Bladerunner. No dice. If I was just looking for a philosophical scifi book, something like the Moon is a Harsh Mistress is a much better and more intriguing read.
0670033375|4.0|Diamond weaves a fascinating, if somewhat disjointed, tapestry of archaeological and historical tales of societies which notably succumbed or succeeded in dealing with fundamental challenges of survival. There is a loose structure to the project which Diamond lays out at the beginning, but in fact the stories are more compelling than the analysis, especially the analysis that would tie the tales together to form a coherent theory of societal success or \\"collapse.\\" <br /> <br />Not being highly versed in archaeology, one might have to take a great deal on faith that Diamond asserts about preliterate societies, or those that left a very sparse historical record. The evidence Diamond marshals is often not entirely convincing and one has the sense that he is pressing the data of others to fit his theses.  <br /> <br />So, while fascinating, his lengthy discussions of archaeological examples, are not as interesting or persuasive in terms of his overall thesis as are more well documented cases for which there is ample historical record. Yet this is precisely where his analysis seems rather thin in dealing with very complex historical factors. The \\"proximate\\" cause, to use his term, of societal \\"collapse\\" (more accurately I would say \\"crisis\\" or \\"degradation\\") may often appear to be environmental or resource issues, but in fact in any complex, and especially modern society it is far more about culture in the broadest context. Diamond discusses this latter phenomenon as one item of his multi-factor analysis under the rubric of \\"decision-making processes.\\" He acknowledges, and ultimately focuses squarely on, societal structure and responsibility as crucial to, and the efficient cause of, societal survival.  <br /> <br />Socio-economic, political and cultural studies are not Diamond's primary area of expertise, so it is not surprising that his book does not emphasize the dynamics of those factors. I agree with other reviewers that the title of the book is thus inaccurate (itwould be rather harsh to say \\"deceptive\\") in its subtitle \\"HOW SOCIETIES CHOOSE to Fail or Succeed.\\" A better subtitle would be \\"How Environmental and Resource Constraints Influence the Way in which Societies Succeed or Fail.\\" But then I am not a book publisher or author, and such a subtitle  would be less impressive than the one Diamond has chosen. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, what Diamond has produced here is a compelling compendium of archaeological, historical, and scientific information that does persuade the reader that only a foolish bird fouls its own nest. Moreover,  the nest IS being fouled, the materials and sites for other nests are becoming increasingly scarce; nor will restless and disgruntled members of our flock leave our nest in peace.
B000002JSP|5.0|One of the biggest reasons for my initially buying this particular Zeppelin album owed much to curiosity; as in curiosity as to why so many Zep fans--nevermind the critics--seemed to trash it so much. Having been previously inundated with Zeppelin I, II and the almighty fourth album, this was indeed \\"different\\". But the thing I came to appreciate about Zeppelin over time was how 'different' a lot of their latter days output was and how their musical style progressed over the course of eight studio albums.  <br /> <br />\\"The Brown Bomber\\" (Zeppelin II) and \\"Zoso\\" are great records, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be as big a LZ fan as I am now if every single album sounded like them, or if Plant & company felt they needed to endlessly recycle the riff from \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" to keep their \\"true fans\\" happy and never try to expand beyond nicking old blues numbers.  <br /> <br />For one thing, the much carped about use of synthesizers featured on \\"In Through the Out Door\\" never once bothered me; it wasn't like Zeppelin never used them on a song before (\\"No Quarter\\" anyone?); having Jones back on the keyboards/piano for this one makes for a refreshing variety amongst all the tracks, an ingredient that was sorely lacking from \\"Presence\\".  <br /> <br />I'll just finish this by simply stating that ITTOD is by no means an album to be ashamed of. For me personally, it's at the very top of the list along with \\"Houses of the Holy\\" and \\"Zoso\\". Times change and so do many truly great musicians over the course of their careers; Led Zeppelin was no different. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0792846443|3.0|most fans of this movie seem to have never seen \\"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\\" before.Mr King was obviously influenced by that movie while writing Misery. A demented woman keeping an invalid locked up. <br />But James Caan and Kathy Bates manage to give great performances: They are the ones who make the movie. Not to mention it is always a delight having lauren Bacall on screen. <br />This movie is entertaining like most of King's early works.
076113719X|5.0|I bought this calendar on a whim for 2005 and can't believe I ever kept track of my family without it.  The simple and easy to use format ensures you will keep using it for the entire year.  The large boxes allow for much information to be noted.  The format even allowed my 6 year old so see if he had an activity (even though he could not read, he could look down his column and see there was writing in his box for the day).  And who can deny that Sandra Boynton's drawings are just so whimsical, cute and funny.  I color coded each persons column and used black for family events.  By keeping it in the kitchen, I could review this calendar each evening after dinner to see who needed a lunch in the morning, who needed gym clothes the next day, sports practice times & places, etc. A quick review over breakfast with my family kept us on track for the day.  Like the front of the calendar says it is great for keeping track of \\"Who does what and goes where when. (But not why).\\"  I highly recommend this calendar for any Mom (and Dads too)with children of any age.
B00002R0MC|3.0|I received this set years ago and I love it.  But, I almost never listen to it.  The sound quality is HORRIBLE.  I can't listen to it at all in the car, and I can only handle 6 or 10 songs at home before I've had enough.  The older tracks (first cd) are the worst.  I know these are old recordings, but it would have been nice if they'd been remastered.  When cd's were new, (way back in the olden days of the early 80's) a lot of things were just rushed out.  They were later re-released with better sound.  Why not these?
B00003CY0V|2.0|Halle Berry appears topless in a scene for the first time, as you know. That is the only memorable thing from this movie, sorry to say. It gets caught up in its own hype and it never goes anywhere. The alternate endings are mildly interesting, but in the end, it's just another bad Travolta film.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|I bought this movie with mixed feelings, I read all the reviews about how the movie was all about alba and walker showing a lot of skin, and nothing else going on.  In the other hand I also read some reviews that said the cinematogrophy was excelent. so I bought it, and I'm happy I did. the movie is not a five star movie, and maybe not a four, but it is fun to watch, it was mastered in HD, and I love the way it looks on my hdtv!  I'm not going to lie, I do love the fact that Jessica Alba has a great body, but this movie does have a lot of great parts.  and watching on HD makes it even better, the underwater scenes are some of the best I seen, exept for a cheesy shark attack late in the film nothing looks out of place and the actors swim next to big sharks without being nervous and I bet that took a while to get them used to the fact that the sharks were not going to attack them.  I say if you are looking for something bright and lively to watch this is it, a good way to spend a couple of hours in front of your tv.
B000C1YL1G|4.0|You already know about the hits on here so I'll only mention the new tracks. \\"FACK\\" is pretty funny, \\"Shake That\\" could've been left behind and \\"When I'm Gone\\" is an interesting narrative about a dream he had about his daughter. The bonus disc, \\"Stan's Mixtape\\", featuring Em's favorite songs, is a plus because you get to hear his guest spots like Biggie's \\"Dead Wrong\\" and Jay-Z's \\"Renegade\\". In fact, he could have added more on this mixtape. I can think of a few songs that they missed for this collection but this is called \\"The Hits\\", not \\"Al's Favorite Eminem Songs\\". Even though I own every Eminem album (including Infinite, which is not represented on here), it's good to have all of the well-known and favorites on one disc (two counting the Mixtape).
B00005JMJG|3.0|Unfortunately, this movie is receiving way too much credit and praise than it deserves. <br /> <br />Yes, it is a good movie. But at times, the plot seems to sway from centrality and thus lose its viewer's interest. This movie could definitely have been better plot wise. Without benefit, it seems to rely too much on vagueness and predicable scenes to explain parts of the movie. <br /> <br />I believe that Winslet did a very good job in her role, and so much that when I first started watching the movie, I had no idea that it was her until 30 minutes into the movie! However, Carey pulled through with a run-of-the-mill performance. <br /> <br />A good movie it is, but not deserving of all the praise and accolades. \\"Butterfly Effect\\" was far more brilliant than this film.

Together they travel the far reaches of space in search of food, money, and anything to live off of.\\" <br /> <br />Sorry. It's just that after all this show has gone through simply to survive (it's amazing how many levels the metaphor of the series works on...), I couldn't sit idly by and let it suffer the injustice of a half-heartedly half-assed plot synopsis on Amazon.com.
B0001FR3IG|5.0|Wow! This movie really exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie does not get the credit it so much deserves. Berry put one of her best performances into this film. The plot is superb, the scenes are very convincing, and the plot-twist at the end is brilliant! <br /> <br />This movie is much better than your average thriller and one of my favorites that I have seen in the past few years. This movie is void of predictability or any formulaic format, which makes it such a refreshing thriller. <br /> <br />Don't listen to the negative reviews on this film, they don't know what they're talking about! Remember: If you see this movie with a friend, make sure you can hold on tight to him/her because you'll need someone!
B0000070QN|5.0|i picked this up after reading reviews posted here. ya know, it's really hard in the good ole usa to get exposed to music that has what i need to get off. that being:1.really good lead and back-up vocals 2.great musicianship 3.well written songs. this one has all of the above. the guitar work is brutal, harmony vocals as good as you've ever heard, and the production is grade A. i'll never understand why a band of this caliber doesn't get promotion and airplay in the states. you really need this one.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|It is hard to find words to describe what I felt after seeing this movie. <br /> <br />Most already know the plot of this movie so I'll save you the turmoil. What really sets this movie apart from the rest is its realness. You really feel like you are right there with Kucther's character feeling the desperation, pain, uncertainty, and guilt. <br /> <br />He was all alone with no one to help him. But in the end, he tries to make the best possible situation of the never ending \\"butterfly effect.\\" He realizes, like many of us, that we should never hope or wish for things to be different in life. For one, we can't change it. And if we could, we never know what could be different for us as we go on in the journey of life. <br /> <br />Yes, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And we should be thankful that, as humans, we don't have the opportunity to change our past, for I imagine that if we did, this movie would sum up the disastrous effects of such a thing.
B000BWI9U0|2.0|This album is disappointing. In fact the more I listen to it the more I HATE it. The songs suck and I was yawning through most of it. You can't say that at all about their first two albums, which were genius. Instead, this sounds utterly conventional. The only good song is \\"Ask Me Anything\\" because it sounds unique, but you're not missing anything by skipping the rest. JC has abandoned the vocals-through-the-phone here and the albums suffers for it. Nothing wrong with the change, but it hurts when the songs themselves are mostly dull, throwaway junk. Also, the \\"limited-edition\\" package is a sham. While I like the interchangeable album art, it's ridiculous to pay extra for something that would have been de rigueur a couple of years ago.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|I can't believe there are people who actually like this movie. The one's that actually gave this movie a good review, must \\"really\\" like this kind of humor. <br /> <br />This movie is so lame, that I watched nearly the first 10 minutes and I couldn't take it. I waited a few days and tried again. But it is still, the bad movie that it is. <br /> <br />This move \\"tries\\" to be satirical and funny, but instead, it fails at everything possible. <br /> <br />No laughs. Not even a sympathy laugh. Even (a great movie) \\"Two Can Play At That Game\\" was much better than this \\"rubbish.\\" Skip this movie! However, if lame \\"supposed\\" British humor is your thing, you just might like it.
B000022TSH|5.0|No doubt this is an amazing movie. I have watched it many times.  Unfortunately the available DVD has been edited and does not show the correct beginning to the movie.    If anyone else here has caught this. I haven't seen it.    Ever wonder why investigating marital affairs is Jake's \\"metier\\"? Don't crucify me on the spelling, OK? Ever wonder what sets the level of society's opinion of a private investigator in a small town like L.A.? Why does Curly get upset and why does his wife get a black eye?     When the movie CORRECTLY opens Jake is skulking through the underbrush after having trailed Curley's wife and her lover. He locates them and takes the revealing pictures, with some amusement, that are shown to Curly,in the office later.    I can't believe this is not how the DVD opens. Maybe someday there will be a special edition that corrects this. This is how TV would show the movie, so I don't doubt that upon further inspection, additional cuts were found. This has always bothered me. A couple of generations of film watchers have been cheated.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|There's something about this movie that you really want to like. It looks good at the beginning. Cruise is rather convincing in his role. Foxx does a fine job... <br /> <br />But in the end, the movie leaves you empty and wanting more! This should have been a longer movie, and with more genuine plot twists. Instead, we are left with a predictable movie that seemed to waste more time than anything else. <br /> <br />At times, the film was too simplistic to take seriously and not even Tom Cruise could save this formulaic film.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|Here's a movie to test your intellectual mettle, that over twenty years after it's initial run on television remains as timely and unsettling as ever.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Horror films and the reason I like them so much is that they almost always focus on the fantastic, the make believe.  This movie is not anywhere near the realm of fantasy.<br /><br />The Day After could happen every second of every day that nuclear weapons exist.  Everything you know and love could be erased in a second of blinding light and searing heat.  Those close enough to the epicenter of any nuclear strike would be the lucky ones.  Those who survive would truly suffer.<br /><br />The sheer intensity of emotion and terror depicted in this film is almost nauseating.  Give me monsters, gore, chainsaw wielding maniacs and I'll be fine; show me the potential extinction of the human race as a consequence of politics and I'm sleeping with the lights on.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this was a made for tv movie and that it was presented in its entirety.  It's doubtful that something this scathing could be shown on television in the current atmosphere of government sanctioned censorship.  Too many people might start to think.<br /><br />The Day After is a movie that should be re-made with extreme, stark realism because the danger presented here is still looking over our shoulders.  If you're seeking a reason to be paranoid watch this movie with friends and family.  You'll never look at mushrooms the same way again.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Before I start my review I just want to say a few words to this kikanju guy(two spots below). First off you listen to a little too much Gangsta rap.Secondly If you didn't like this album write a review, brake it down and tell us why. But if your just coming on here to just talk s**t about 2Pac, then you need to take that s**t somewhere else. This site is for writing music album reviews not for haters talking trash about somebody. They have a place for lame Jackass haters like you, their called Message Boreds. Go to A 2Pac message bored and write your worst. In the meantime all you one star reviewers with little and no explanation or brake down as to why you gave one star need to quit taking up space because your opinions are not appreciated and even more so are not respected.Oh and one last question Gangsta man, because i'm curious,do all \\"real gangstas\\" write music reviews for Amazon.com? Think about that homey.         As for this album, this is cleary Pac's best and most succesful album. Yes iv'e listened to  Me Against The World and I own Makaveli The 7 day Theory and yes those albums are w/out question more Significant then A.E.O.M,but as for as the best,Their is plain and simply NO COMPARISON to this album.The first disk is almost flawless but their are Two lackluster tracks on here and they are \\"Tradin War Stories\\" and \\"Whats Your # Number\\"(although it's not as bad as everyone says it is. The beat is just horrible). My favarite Track on here and pretty much my Favarite track on the entire album is \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\". Pac be speaken from the heart & soul on that one.       Now as far disk 2, A lot of people say that it wasn't that good but I disagree with that totally. No it wasn't as good as disk 1 but D.2 had a lot of good tracks.The first 4 tracks are good(on track 3 I think he dissen Biggie on the first verse,listen closely).\\"When We Ride\\",\\"Thug Passion\\" ,\\"Rather Be Ya Nigga\\" and \\"Check Out Time\\", and \\"Run Tha Streets\\" are pretty weak tracks but \\"Picture Me Rollen\\" \\"All Eyes On Me\\" and the last Two tracks are really good songs.       To me this album was like a Hip Hop version of Michael Jacksons Thriller. I don't know a single person that hasn't at least listensd to this album before.This is hands down the  greatest West coast album of all time. Better then both Chronics by Dre and better then Snoops \\"Doggy Style\\". As far as the Greatest rap album period, I wouldn't go that far, but it is definitly in the conversation.      Finally kikanju, I hate to admit it,but you were right on one thing, 2Pac wasn't a gangster.He was a soldier. A soldier who probably had more Heart, Balls, and courage that sometbody like you could ever dream of having. That's someting else to think about Gangsta.
0393324818|4.0|I read Moneyball at the suggestion of a respected colleague.  My typical choice of books tend to be more technical, and often feels like work.  Lewis' Moneyball though was like taking the afternoon off.  But don't be mislead into thinking you won't get much out of it. Lewis expertly takes you inside the game, offering keen insight at the same time. I now look at business and government indicators in a new light, and I don't take any of them for granted as I often did prior to this book.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Along with new releases from the New Pornographers and My Morning Jacket, Coldplay's X&Y was one of my favorite albums of 2005. \\"Square One\\" through \\"Speed of Sound\\" is an amazing accomplishment and a joy to listen to. The rest can't match the opening 7 tracks, but I really enjoy \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\", \\"Twisted Logic\\", and \\"Til Kingdom Come\\". <br /> <br />P.S. I don't think the American release of X&Y has that extreme copy control--mine didn't.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|Have Been A Big Fan Of Horror Films For Well Over 30yrs And After Seeing The Trailer For Hostel I Had Very High Expectations For This Movie.Instead The Film Simply Does Not Live Up To Its Reputation.This Film Could Have Used The Tom Savini Whose In Your Face Gore Effects To Greater Advantage.

0143034901|2.0|I am a man and no feminist by any stretch.  I also count myself a recovering Cathoholic.  Cavemen originated Adam and Eve, heaping on their female counterparts the burden of the fall of Eden b/c they were stronger physically if not emotionally.  That's how they got away with spreading that story.  Make no mistake.  Any woman will tell you, Gents, strength permits us a world of conveniences they don't have, like the ability to single-handedly author creation stories and much of history.<br /><br />Thankfully, we needn't go on promulgating the lie that we kill women and tear down beauty because, due to some innate bugaboo, we must love things to death.  Today modern man must own up, assume his share of blame, and be a man.  Technology in developed countries (apologies, we must question Spain in this regard, as this book began as a bestseller there) has mostly devalued the strength difference.  Still recklessly chauvinistic stories and male insecurities linger.  Normally I only read and do not write reviews but with The Shadow of the Wind my beliefs would not leave me alone.  I would be guilty by complicity without standing up, stepping in and urging a strong cautionary warning, as I believe the modern male especially must, and we all must as fair dues for the gift of existence.  Representing one's self is a small price to pay.<br /><br />This is a great book.  And that's the problem.  Like so many imports, it begs acceptance and then coolly steals the welcome mat.  Its detractors are supposed to chalk it up as, at best, simply one more giddy cultural faux paus that leaves U.S. cash registers ringing and American sensibilities with a bad bout of the flu.  Bestseller?  I was offended.  Take this passage:<br /><br />\\"If a doctor had been present perhaps he would have been able to stop the hemorrhage that took [the pregnant teenager]'s life, while she shrieked and scratched at the locked door, on the other side of which her father wept in silence and her mother cowered staring at her husband ... the sheets and afterbirth were thrown into the boilers ...\\"<br /><br />I can't imagine the worst inner city slum urchin in the States doing that to his daughter, regardless of circumstance, but we are supposed to believe he had cause for various reasons I won't deign to go into here.<br /><br />There is a general disdain for female characters throughout, and no I'm not talking about Fermin's antics which I found very funny as a matter of fact.  Women's heads being casually blown off, brutal stabbings, \\"b*tch\\" slappings galore (pardon my Espanol).  I was badly yearning to recommend the book on whole to my wife.  It seems there is so little unoffensive (or at least artfully balanced) writing these days.  I dutifully wrote off the violence.  Then I came to the trite and grizzly murder of JC's love interest and I said this is not okay.  Not fun.  We have come a long way since this was good entertainment.  This is foreign caveman stuff and if we are lulled into believing otherwise it is because we think too little of ourselves and have forgotten that shouting 'no' out loud is not just a right but a responsibility.<br /><br />I'm a fan of tragedies, Braveheart, etc. but they have to go down easy and the incomprehensible motives of \\"the Don\\" at the turning point of this tragedy I can only relate to insofar as they are 'foreign' and backwards, not really arising out of anything attributable to the familiar (could someone, perhaps Spanish, please explain him better maybe?).  This saddened me to no end, as I took three years of Spanish b/c I admire the people and culture!  I was gravely disappointed by this book.<br /><br />A sinister subtext of TSOTW seemed to be a virtual compendium of domestic violence made deceptively gentler and more culturally acceptable to American audiences by Ms. Graves' masterful translation.  I don't dispute the business sense of the translation.  Hey, it's a best-seller after all.  *BUT* I do have trouble believing that the book's apparently wide U.S. readership is properly prepared to have their values besieged when they read this story.  I wasn't.  It can only be taken for what it is:  a Spanish import, or we're in bigger trouble than we think we are if this material goes down without a hiccup.  That's how globalization subtely erodes progress, by dragging us unwittingly back into the cave.  Maybe the translation/cultural-edit was too deft with the exception of the above quoted scene (and you know which one I'm talking about) and possibly the ridiculously cruel and largely inexplicable gratuitous NM slaying.  These events are in no way redeemed by the book's end.  If you take pleasure in this stuff, watch the nightly news instead.  It's cheaper by far and I daresay less offensive.<br /><br />Better yet, Pearl Buck's The Good Earth comes to mind as an even-handed treatment, albeit regarding a different culture, of the capricious cruelties inflicted on women by men in less modern times and societies.  It is no less reprehensible there, but at least that story sheds light on believable motives of one all too ungrateful man.  The drama is furthermore earned not merely by advancing the plot as melodramatically as the author could imagine, but by giving a realistic and therefore constructive counter model of the emptiness of one man's reckless power-mongering.<br /><br />As for TSOTW, I can HIGHLY recommend the story as an import with only minor technical reservations as have been mentioned by other reviews such as the problematic epistolary tack for the concluding third part.  To recommend TSOTW as a good story you can get into, love and rally-behind, sadly, I cannot.  Otherwise, like me, due to the hardboiled criminal treatment of females (and I'm a crime story and murder mystery fan!) especially as the plot advancement gets firing on all cylinders, you'll be asking yourself 2/3 through what has become of our values in this country if this is what constitutes a bestseller!

B00007GZR5|5.0|This is another one of Robin Williams' great performances.  The special effects are absolutely mind-boggling!  I would have given it 10 stars if I could have!
1896597890|5.0|This is a great graphic novel. I would have liked it if it were fiction; it's chilling that it's about reality. It's one of those books that you read in one sitting. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a window into the lives of North Koreans, this is probably not the book for you - it's more about the bizarre aspects of the mundane as experienced by an outsider.
0800177975|1.0|In my opinion, this movie has got to be Arnold's worst movie.  It was so stupid and boring, I turned it off 15 minutes into the movie.  I would give it NO STARS if I could!  Thank goodness Schwarzenegger's other movies make up for this turkey!  Definitely not worth renting let alone buying.  I would pass on this one.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|If you and/or your kids are fans of \\"The Incredibles\\" and the \\"Harry Potter\\" movies, you/they will get a kick out of \\"Sky High,\\" too. <br /> <br />This is one of the best family-friendly action/comedies I've seen in a long time, and certainly the best live-action film Disney's put out in years. \\"Sky High\\" has a clever script, an excellent cast of grown-ups (including Kurt Russell, Linda Carter, Bruce Campbell, and \\"Kids in the Hall\\" alums Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald), and a likeable (if not super-charismatic) ensemble of young actors and actresses.  <br /> <br />The only real drawbacks to this film are its lackluster special effects, many of which involve obvious models and amaturish-looking \\"flying\\" on wires. On the whole, they give \\"Sky High\\" a  low-budget, made-for-TV look, somewhat akin (in appearance only) to an episode of \\"Power Rangers.\\" However, \\"Sky High's\\" sharp writing, solid performances, wit, charm, and uplifting message (i.e. it's not your super power that makes you a hero; it's what you do with it that counts) more than make up for Disney's apparent lack of financial backing.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended and appropriate for all ages.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I have been a DM fan for many many years. Liked violator in 1990 but found it really minimalist compaired to 1997's Music for the Masses and it's interweaving synth lines and atmosphere building (see Behind the Wheel or Never Let Me Down Again). When 1993's Songs of Faith and Devotion was released the blatant religious imagery turned me off the album completely...but thanks to friends constantly playing the album...i grudginly loved it, and to this day think it is probably the 'Mode's best long player to date. Alan left and out came Ultra.....it had confirmed what I had thought, that since 1983 Alan Wilder WAS the talent behind the DM sound. The next release 'Exciter' was, to me a stagnant and un-inviting thing. Time runs out for most bands and I had thought that the Mode had seen their day. 2005, 25 years after Photographic and i am eating my words, gobsmacked by this latest Depeche Mode release...Playing The Angel, not only do DM slice right into the top 10 with the dabut single release, Precious, but release a kick ass album that blows it's two predesesors out of the water. From the pounding 'A Pain That I am used To' to Dave's 'Suffer well' It is a winner! Well done boys! and well done Dave for securing yourself some mode space on the CD!
0307276902|1.0|I read both books twice and now I want my money back. You people are missing the most important fact; if he lied about the arrests he probably lied about a great deal of other things as well.<br /><br />I think Frey is a con-artist and his parents should be ashamed of themselves too.
0553801503|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but in this instance, I felt a need. I think that this novel completely satisfies as the most recent book in series, and that by cutting the book in half, leaves me dying to read the forthcoming \\"A Dance with Dragons\\". With so many weak, unoriginal fantasy books on the market, each novel in this series is like a literary breath of fresh air.
0307276902|1.0|I was given this book as a Christmas present by a friend who highly recommended it. I'm a big fan of Hunter S. Thompson and, at first glance, hoped that this would be a worthy successor. Frankly, I just couldn't get past the sheer unbelievability of it all.<br /><br />I started to lose my faith with the root canal narrative. My cousin is my dentist and I'd undergone a root canal only a couple of months before. Getting the level of \\"numbing\\" just right took a couple of attempts and nothing has hurt as much in my life. So I just couldn't believe that he could simply be held down and endure such torment. I discussed the tale with my dentist/cousin and he totally discounted it. The most severe addicts are treated with Novocain (or other appropriate medications) and any dentist who attempted such a procedure \\"cold\\" would probably lose their license.<br /><br />The other thing that I just couldn't believe was the constantly running thread to the effect that this guy was the baddest a$$ since Mike Tyson stepped out of the ring and into retirement. I've seen the guy and he looks like a young Richard Dreyfuss. There's no scars on his face; heck, he doesn't even look like he's lost a nights sleep in this life. That, of course, proves nothing by itself - Hitler was a short, goofy-looking jerk with a Charlie Chaplin moustache who killed several million people.  It just contributed to the doubts I was already entertaining.  Having been in a few scrapes, I would've expected someone who'd been beaten as many times as he claimed would have a little blood in the eyes.<br /><br />It's easy to see why some embellishment would be needed to sell this story. The stripped down facts could be summed up as \\"The privileged son of a wealthy family checks into the world's foremost treatment center for addiction and changes his ways.\\" Who would want to read that?<br /><br />All that said, I fully expect most memoirs to take some poetic license and it is an entertaining read, in the same way that comic books and some of Hunter's more drug addled rants could be. Just don't look too deeply into it seeking a factual account of one man's battle with personal demons. Such a book was written years ago by Eddie Little (Another Day in Paradise), who properly marketed it as fiction.way that comic books and some of Hunter's more drug addled rants could be.

B00005JOQ9|4.0|I'm not closed minded as some I knew what to expect going in to this movie, gore and sex.  The two main characters are traveling and on the search for women to fill their heads with after their trip is over.  I think one of them mentions something to that effect about when they go back to their normal lives they'll have memories of the girls they scored with(cheesy yes, but not unbelievable).  As their trip turns into a nightmare the story is full of an exciting, yet very violent/graphic story.  Thing is I was entertained even looking through my fingers as I covered my eyes I sat there hoping things worked out and wondered if I'd ever travel to that part of the world myself after this movie.<br /><br />This movie was popcorn scare fun.  Not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but worth my money.
B00005UKE0|5.0|It's pretty hard to imagine anything by an ex-Beatles member would be bad, and this isn't! \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is simply a great album that most music lovers will enjoy. George definitely has a unique and charismatic voice that most listeners will like listening to. The musicianship here is also extremely well done, though the style is pretty dated. The lyrics, as always, are definitely worth your time to listen to as they're fun, interesting and oftentimes even quotable. The album also has a couple classic songs on it (\\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Wah-Wah\\" for example). The production is pretty good, though I have the non-remastered version so I couldn't say what the new versions sound like. Overall I think that most music fans will really like this album if they can get used to its dated style (it took me a while to get used to it, too). Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000002H70|5.0|This is the best Cure album. It heads the triumvirate of bests, followed by Pornography and Bloodflowers. I have listened to it more times than I can count. Its great for any mood (surprisingly). You must get it. I don't care if you've never heard The Cure before. You will not be disappointed. The album is the most consistent ever. Every song deserves to be there.  <br /> <br />      1. Plainsong <br />Separate from this album, this song would only be OK. But I don't think any song is better to lead off Disintegration. It just seems like the ultimate first track.  <br /> <br />2. Pictures of You <br />Great lyrics and great song. Sadly, the only song I have got too used to over the years. But still great. <br /> <br />3. Closedown <br />Another mediocre song apart from this album. Reminds me a lot of Plainsong in that it is a precursor to the sweetness that lies ahead. <br /> <br />4. Love Song <br />Of course a fave to all. This one never gets old though. Somewhat positive for a change.  <br /> <br />5. Last Dance <br />I think this song is underrated and sometimes forgotten. It's really good though. I love the lyrics esp. \\"but christmas falls late now flatter and colder\\". <br /> <br />6. Lullaby <br />A popular song that I must admit is probably the one I like least on here. Sung in a sort of whisper and probably not a good lullaby despite the name. <br /> <br />7. Fascination Street <br />Great great great. Put on repeat. <br /> <br />8. Prayers for Rain <br />More great lyrics. First song of the last part of the album. I divide the album into 3 separate yet wholly interrelated parts (I: 1-3, II: 4-7, III: 8-12). My favorite part is III. <br /> <br />9. The Same Deep Water as You <br />Classic suicide song. Nice and long. <br /> <br />10. Disintegration <br />Most likely my favorite song. Never got sick of it despite putting on repeat a lot. Best lyrics of any Cure song probably. Great special effects.  <br /> <br />11. Homesick <br />Good second to last song. Kind of like letting you go nicely before the end. The goodness can't last forever. <br /> <br />12. Untitled <br />Great last song. You listen to it and you know theres nothing after. Still in the spirit of the rest. Tracks 11 and 12 took me longer to appreciate for some reason, but now I listen to them more than any other. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />Sounds: ***** <br />Lyrics:   ***** <br />Consistency: ***** <br />
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|There's no doubt that \\"Graceland\\" was indeed a very influential and great soft rock album. Every song here is good, but what makes it great is not only how accessible it is, but also because of \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" - this song in particular is absolutely classic. Paul Simon has an easily recognizable and pleasant voice - I doubt anyone won't like it. The lyrics are always fun and interesting to listen to as well as catchy - they're pretty much perfect. The musicianship is extremely well-done and pretty unique - I can't think of any other album or band that sounds like this except for probably Peter Gabriel. The production is just very well done. It might take a while to sink in, but in the end you'll be thankful. Though it's a soft rock album, I think most people will really really love this. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
0805076476|5.0|Fight Club, first published in 1996, has become one of the greatest books of the 1990's, cultivated a sizable cult following, and is a book by which others should be judged. Chuck Palahniuk, the author of  Fight Club, has written a brilliant and promising first novel. The language and construction of the sentences draws the reader in and the attention to detail and description make the story incredibly vivid. From the first sentence, \\"Tyler gets me a job as a waiter, after that Tyler's pushing a gun in my mouth and saying, the first step to eternal life is you have to die\\", is among one of the more memorble first lines of any book I've ever read.  <br /> <br />        The beginning of the book takes the reader on a journey, teaching you about the daily life of the narrator (never explicitly named), and how he came to meet Tyler Durden, an enigmatic, twenty-something individual who's philosophies range from the absurd to strangely simplistic. With a pessimistic view of the present, and a dangerously optimistic view of the future, Tyler is willing to stop at nothing to accompish his goals. He is both creative and persuasive, which is a dangerous combination with someone with so much apathy towards others. He is a complex character, with a passion for making soap. He starts fight clubs, underground boxing rings in large cities, and starts Project Mayhem, a group that is bent on destroying corruption, one building at a time. Aside from his personality and intentions, he is absolutely brilliant, forcing people at gunpoint to succeed and accomplish their own personal goals. <br /> <br /> For a simple book (starting fight clubs, making soap, and destruction), Fight Club has amassed a passionate group of followers, including those willing to start their own fight clubs, change their names to Tyler Durden, and burn themselves with caustic lye. It spawned an excellent film of same name, which, is as close to as good as the orginal story as I have ever seen. One motivated reader went so far as to put Tyler's home addrss on Paper Street on the sample pictured for a popular line of Avery adhesive labels. I would recommend that if you haven't read this book that you borrow or buy it, along with a few extra copies for your close friends. Without question, Fight Club is one of the greatest stories I've ever read, and is destined to become it a classic novel. <br />
B00005AQE8|5.0|I came into liking Tupac VERY late into the game (2005, in fact), but now that I've listened to \\"All Eyez On Me\\" I can see why he's so well-liked. Not only does this album have some classic rap songs on it (like the first track \\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\\"), but the production, lyrics, and Tupac's delivery are second-to-none. Tupac himself has an easily recognizable and likable vocal style that most people will be hardpressed not to like. The production here is fantastic - Johnny J and Dat Nigga Daz do an excellent job here with their g-funk beats. Though some of the songs are arguably not that good, overall the 27 tracks here MORE than make up for any minor complaints. This is truly an epic rap album (he wanted it to be the first and best epic rap album). The lyrics tend to be about the streets and gangster life (as compared to previous albums, but this makes sense considering he made this RIGHT after he got out of prison), and despite its overdone and questionable subject matter, all of it's interesting and fun to listen to. You won't care that it's all been said and done before. All things aside, rap fans and possibly non-rap fans will absolutely love this album! HIGHLY recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000A3VTT8|5.0|Ah Rossini...! The real inventor of the assembly line. That Ford fellow was just a copycat. One-size-fits-all overtures. Arias you swear you've heard before (you did). Plots that are reused more often than a sandlot league baseball. Why do we love him so much? Because his music is so infectious that it gets under your skin faster than a splinter from a bamboo shade.<br /><br />This production of Rossini's take on Cinderella, another filmed Opera from Director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, is beautiful. A joy from beginning to end. Frederica von Stade is luminous in the role of Cenerentola. Literally luminous. Ponnelle illuminates her for much of this film as if he were a graduate of the Spielberg school of backlighting. In fact he backlights just about everything and everyone, sooner or later. Filmed in 1981, (Spielberg had made that technique ubiquitous back then), La Cenerentola had me searching for ET in the long shots. Yet, oddly enough it works. It is a fairy tale, after all.<br /><br />The Overture has the camera weaving through the empty lobby of La Scala, fixing on the marble statues of famous Italian composers. From there it meanders into the theater and finally the stage. The film records a virtual \\"La Scala\\" (it isn't, though) staged performance without an audience. Yet it seems larger, and occasionally it does open up to a larger location. The sets are stunning. Every visual element has been carefully chosen to emphasize beauty. This is a lovely film, thoroughly enjoyable just for it's aesthetic excellence!<br /><br />But there's a beautifully performed Opera here, as well. The youthful Von Stade is a lovely heroine. Her singing is wonderful, her voice lighter than Cecilia Bartoli's smokey mezzo found on her DVD of Cenerentola; now that I have both singers, it is fascinating to compare the two.<br /><br />Francisco Araiza is Don Ramiro and Claudio Desderi is Dandini. Paulo Montarsolo sings Don Magnifico. Margherita Guglielmi sings Clorinda. Paul Plishka is Alidoro. The entire cast is superb. The Chorus and Orchestra of La Scala, under the direction of the Conductor Claudio Abbado, live and breath this music. They have that authentic Rossini sound unique to native Italians. Nevertheless, they often perform with manic energy; as if this were the first time they were inhabiting Rossini's sound world.<br /><br />The DTS 5.1 sound is crystalline and full. The picture is well-nigh perfect, as befits a film that's been digitally remastered.<br /><br />As usual, Ponnelle recorded the music first in January 1981, then had the singers lip sync for the filmed performance in Vienna during August & September that same year. Thus, the singers can focus on their acting; not where the next note is coming from. This works for me, for what it's worth,  but purists may not like it. I think the film's beauty and lofty production values can overcome any obstacle. My strongest possible recommendation for this superbly performed and beautifully filmed La Cenerentola from Director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and a great cast and Orchestra under Claudio Abbado!<br /><br />Mike Birmanro.

B000002OX7|5.0|\\"Who's Next\\" is one of the better and more accessible Who albums, though not necesarily the most artistic. They definitely perfected their songwriting and hook-crafting skills on this record as one can see with the hits \\"Baba O'Riley\\" (better known as \\"Teenage Wasteland\\") and \\"Bargain\\". Every song here is great, even if they weren't all hits like the first two. The musicianship is still excellent (some of the best I've ever heard), and the band still sounds like The Who, which is always good. Singer Roger Daltrey does an excellent job here, even though he's not the best singer in the world - I think most people will like him (although in the first two songs he slightly walks into cheesiness land). The lyrics, as always, are incredibly interesting, fun to listen to and sometimes even quotable - they are definitely more than a means to make the songs catchier. Another great thing about the CD is that the production holds up surprisingly well - it doesn't sound the least bit dated. Overall I think most people will love this album as every song is great and the sound holds up surprisingly well for how old it is. All in all this is highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
0226264017|4.0|Milton Friedman is one of the great economic thinkers of the 20th century.  Based out of the University of Chicago, this Nobel Prize winner in Economics has consistently and cogently argued for the benefits of capitalism over any other form of economic organization.  This, along with \\"Free to Choose\\" are his two major works establishing and explaining his beliefs.  Within it, he argues against many established policies in the US federal government such as the minimum wage, subsidies, rent controls, and licensing requirements for practice in fields such as medicine and law.  Likewise, he argues for many market-orientated alternatives to today's arrangements, such as increasing the use of school vouchers.   <br /> <br />The author argues that the concepts of capitalism are very similar to the concepts of democracy, and that the spread of one helps the spread of the other, and hence both should go hand-in-hand in terms of public policy.  This book, along with his other writings, are the bedrock of modern-day economic conservatism and its creations such as health-care savings accounts, school vouchers, tradeable pollution emission allowances, etc...  By reading this book, one gains a very thorough understanding of modern-day American conservatism.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book minimizes the power of corporations and financial markets - speculators.  The book also does not pay enough attention to the mining and energy industries, two sectors of the economy which often produce scandal and disasters when given over to the rule of free-market forces; i.e. Enron...  Last, the author misses one key difference between democracy and capitalism.  In democracy, one person gets one vote.  In capitalism, this is rarely the case; some individuals will end up having more dollars (more votes) than other individuals.  <br /> <br />Overall, a good book, though not a great one.  The book's arguments are well made and warrant understanding, though they  are by no means universally correct.
B000002WU9|5.0|As you probably know already if you're reading this, the Wu-Tang Clan is one of the weirdest, funniest and best rap groups alive. What also makes them great is the fact that basically all of their solo albums are equally as classic as their combined material (like their debut \\"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\\"). Raekwon isn't necessarily the best of the group (personality-wise, anyway), but he's still great. Everything on here is fantastic, and you'd be hardpressed to find something here that you won't love. The beats are just awesome - these are great for anywhere, and most definitely parties. Every song here is good or great. The lyrics are always catchy, funny and interesting to listen to - he hasn't lost any of his talent since \\"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\\". Though it lacks hilarious kung-fu movie clips, they're instead replaced by funny clips between Raekwon and his friends. Overall, if you're a Wu-Tang Clan or rap fan, chances are you'll love this. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00005JOQ9|5.0|i saw this movie today and i loved the hell out of it!  yeah i tend to get turned off by movies with large amounts of sexual content, but in horror/gore movies i dont mind it. *spoilers ahead... lets see starts out with three guys...the cocky american, his shy hometown friend, and a loud obnoxious icelander they met in europe. basically they just want to do drugs, get drunk and get action from whores. well they go to this place in bulgaria i think where they get everything they want until one fateful day the loud icelander disappears with his \\"prostitute friend\\" ..qucikly after that, the happy party feel of the movie turns into a hellish nightmare..the lighting of the whole movie adds to the creepy depression. i agree, the three guys have enough things about them to where you dont hate them. well maybe that icelandic guy didn't.... anyways, surprisingly, the cocky american survives out of the three(i seriously thought the shy passive guy would have) i liked the character who ends up being the hero in the end. great character change. i was impressed and shocked by the gore...the shock being more like \\"i cant believe im actually watching this awesome stuff in a theater!\\"   also the ending was kick arse!..i wont spoil it, but those of you who know..the bathroom scene was amazing!      sadly, i dont think this movie will last long in the theaters..it will be lucky if it makes it to the middle of february. its a shame how failures of films such as wedding crashers last like 3 months and on and good movies like this and land of the dead last maybe 2 if lucky in theaters...and NO i see no similarities to american pie and eurotrip(both horrible movies) besides the fact they go to europe. good job quentin tarantino and eli roth! you have made one of the most brutal serious movies i have seen. i recommend \\"ichi the killer\\" and \\"riki oh\\" to fans of this film.  oh wait, most of you who gave this more than 3 stars probally already own those.  all in all, if you are expecting a cliche hollywood turd, than you best leave this chilling film to cult movie, true horror and gore fans.
B0000004V2|5.0|The Stones Roses were innovative because they fused guitar-pop with dance and rave music. Every song here is good-if-not great, and there's even a couple classics scattered about (the hit \\"She Bangs The Drum\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" are some). Singer Ian Brown perfectly fits the lyrics as I can't see how anybody won't like him. The lyrics are always catchy and are very much worthy of close inspection. The instrumentation is also fantastic - it's all very creative, fun and distinctively Stone Roses - they definitely have their own sound. It sounds just a tad dated, but I don't think most people will care in the end. All things aside, I'm pretty confident that pop rock and 80's rock fans will definitely love this album (along with most other people)! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br />the entire album!
0440237688|3.0|I think there's been enough written as far as plot description of this tale...but if not, then here goes:  Jonas lives in what appears to be a perfect, Utopian society and upon the completion of his 12th year of life (just like all other 12 year-olds in his community) he's given his job for life. His title is to be 'Receiver', to become a recepticle for all memories and knowlege within his community.He goes into training with the former Receiver, who then becomes 'The Giver', and learns the truth of his environment...and how it is far from perfect, and how impossible the concept of perfection truly is.   There's more to it, but that's the bare bones of plot.  It's a wonderfully enticing tale, and the author chose a powerful subject as well as doing a wonderful job at constructing a society with very intricate rules and social graces. I was thoroughly drawn to this book...and I felt it was simply yet powerfully written. The simplicity was actually quite effective since the subject and story was rather complex.  I felt the author kind of wimped out though, somewhere toward about 3/4 of the way...perhaps it wasn't the author...perhaps it was the publisher, which is really possible too. Lowry was starting to dip into darker waters which were extremely powerful, but it seems like the moment she did, there was suddenly this miraculous solution to the story...it felt like the narrative was about to spill the goods and then was silenced somehow. And I found this a pity because I was really getting into what i was reading, was really getting into the character of Jonas and his development and growth and maturity. He was stunted as soon as he began to grow up and gain some understanding, and this is the main reason I gave this book 3 (actually 3.5) stars.   Perhaps the reason it was all cut so short was because it was a book that was also meant for children...but that doesn't seem like a good enough reason. I just felt like, Don't take me somewhere unless you're going to takeme all the way. Don't abandon your reader...I felt I was abandoned as the story was tied up at the end with a very messy and strangly metorphorical ending. The book was not metophorical to begin with. It's too bad, because I really was starting to sink my teeth into it!  [..] I read the book myself about 3 times...and I just flat-out disagree. The author painted  extremely innocent characters who didn't know what was considered taboo by OUR standards...and in truth, there also wasn't any kind of overt leaning toward any kind of sexual orientation. There was no weird nudity. Children volunteering at a nursing home and tending to bathing the elderly is not what I would consider sensual. A male child taking his shirt off to be more in touch with his surroundings is not a sensual thing, but rather unself-consious...why would it be otherwise???   Whoever criticizes that is kind of missing the point anyway: There was NOTHING sensual in this book...if anything, the author made a point of creating a society that was sensually stunted and out of touch in that way, and actually took pills to remedy those cravings in order to never look at them again. So...what's all the fuss, people?
B00004W50T|5.0|At first I didn't like The Band's \\"Music From Big Pink\\" as it was noticably dated sounding since nobody follows this musical style anymore. I gave it several listens, though, and there are several reasons why it's a classic. Despite the fact that it was one of the first of its kind (how it sounds, I mean), it's extremely well produced, the lyrics are fantastic, the musicianship is great and Richard Manuel's voice is perfect! Unless you hate this style of music, there's no way you couldn't love this! Every song here is great, and some are even classic (\\"Chest Fever\\" and \\"The Weight\\" are some examples). The lyrics are a tad hard to make out, but when they're clear they're always deep and interesting to listen to. As I said before, the musicianship is perfect and you can hear every instrument that's being played (much like on a Jackson Browne record). Richard's voice is arguably the weakest part about the album, but he's certainly very very good. Overall, if you like The Band or classic rock, chances are that you're going to love this! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
0689865384|5.0|UGLIES, a book by Scott Westerfeld is one of the greatest I've ever read.  It might be because the characters are around my age and experience the same things that I feel deep down inside, but the author adds a lot of mystery and excitement into his work also.  The story begins in a city called Ugly Town with a character named Tally.  There are two different towns.  Ugly, which you live in until you turn sixteen, and Pretty, which you move to after you have a total body makeover.  It interests me on how this fact is very similar to our world; people usually go through stages during their lives where they are ugly and pretty or in between at numerous times.  In UGLIES, once you turn sixteen and are accepted to become gorgeous, you are taken to the hospital in pretty town.  Once you are there they take your measurements, grind your bones down to be the perfect shape, replace cartilage with programmable plastic, trim your muscles, and sand down your skin to be just the right texture.  They also laser-cut your eyes so that you have a lifetime of perfect vision and insert reflective implants under the irises to add sparkling gold flecks.  All of these operations are performed, and then the main character describes the symptoms as only a painful sunburn.  If only real life was that simple, everything would be as easy as pie!   <br /> One of the biggest differences between this book and other fantasy/science fiction books is that everything is so original.  There are interesting names, the strangest scenarios, and complex but down to earth characters.  One of my favorite things in the book was an object called a hover board.  It was described much like a skateboard or surfboard that flies a bit above the ground, but it doesn't work unless there is metal underneath the ground or water onto which you are driving it over.  Tally, the main character, and her friend, Shay fly around on these boards numerous times during the story.  It was exciting to read about some of Shay andTally's adventures on the boards, and sometimes I felt like I was on one along with them.  Later in the book Tally is dependent on her hover board to get her to a place called Smoke.  This book definitely shows how much future technology, and also the technology we have created to this day makes a big impact on how people live their daily lives.  Computers, transportation, and other electronics are definitely things that we strongly depend on today and also into the future. <br /> Out of all of the books I've read, UGLIES is definitely one I would recommend, especially to people in the early teens to mid-twenties.  There is also a sequel to this book, which I haven't read yet, but strongly believe it will be just as good as this one. <br />
B000002KHF|5.0|Van Morrison's not my favorite musician, but he's still a great singer/songwriter. His voice tends to verge on being unlikable, but he somehow manages to keep it pleasant and enjoyable in every song. Every song here is great, and there are even a couple classics to be found (for example \\"Moondance\\" and \\"And It Stoned Me\\"). The lyrics are essentially half of what makes this classic - they're always fun, catchy and memorable (and occasionally quotable). Most people will love listening to what he's saying, though it's not a requirement to enjoy the album as the music itself is also great. It's a pretty mellow album that would make great background music, and the instrumentation is distinctly classic rock and very well done - this is just a fantastic group of musicians. Even though Morrison's vocals might turn a couple people off, the pros far outweigh any cons here. Most people will love this album, although you might have to get used to the dated style (considering none of the bands around today sound ANYTHING like this). Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
0307276902|1.0|This book and it's contents is complete and total lies!  Read \\"The Smoking Gun\\" commentary.  Everything they investigated and revealed holds true.  Get the facts!  It's shocking this con artist has been as successful for this long, even fooling Oprah for crying out loud!  I hope all of his millions dwindle quickly from lawsuits and forgery, because someone like this does not deserve the right to write BS like this when great writers wait in the wings hoping someone will read them.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G. definitely ranks in the top 5 of my most favorite rappers ever list as his style is unique and very fun to listen to (for the curious, my favorite rapper is Big L considering just how funny he is). His delivery is fantastic and is copied to no end (there's even a rapper named Guerilla Black who takes pride in copying his delivery EXACTLY!). Though it might not strike you at first, every song on here is a great, though offensive and sexist, rap song. For those who might care about such trivial things this is worth noting, but I don't personally care about content (when it comes to art I'm very lenient). The lyrics here are great and definitely fun to listen to - a lot of it's also pretty funny and quotable. You can tell why so many people were mad when he was assassinated. The production is great here - Easy Mo Bee (who probably no one has heard of) does a great job. The album even has several rap classics on it including \\"Things Done Changed\\", \\"Gimme The Loot\\", \\"One More Chance\\", \\"Big Poppa\\", and, of course, \\"Juicy\\". You can tell why practically every rap fan loves this album and Biggie. Basically, if you call yourself a rap fan then there's no possible way that you could at least not like this (unless you only like pop-and-non-offensive rap). Overall this is HIGHLY recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00005IAOF|5.0|Quick history lesson.  I hope you can keep up:<br /><br />1977:  L.A.M.F. comes out with a horrible, muddy mix.  It was so bad that Jerry Nolan, the drummer, quit the band.<br /><br />1984:  L.A.M.F. is remixed by Johnny Thunders and sounds surprisingly fresh and clean.  Retitled, L.A.M.F. Revisited, it sounds very good.  Some say it's a little too \\"glossy\\" to represent how The Heartbreakers actually laid it down.<br /><br />1997:  Hundreds of different mixes were sorted through and the hardest, punchiest versions were remixed and put out under the title:  \\"L.A.M.F: The Lost '77 Mixes.\\"<br /><br />This is the version you want!  The druums hit HARD like a punch to the gut and each track manages to rock harder and with more power than on \\"Revisited.\\"  JT may have been pushing for a more \\"mainstream-friendly\\" mix when he worked on \\"Revisited,\\" but I feel that some of The Heartbreakers' power was drained from that version.  You WANT The Lost '77 Mixes.  This is how the original release could have/should have sounded.  Incredible.
B000003TAW|5.0|Personally I'm not the biggest Weezer fan, but if there's one album by them that I'd consistenly enjoy hearing it's definitely this one. It's easily their most accessible and catchy-yet-creative album that they have recorded thus far. Perhaps it's not as creative as \\"Pinkerton\\", but it's still great in its own right. Though most casual music fans wouldn't know much of this band, emo bands were heavily influenced by Weezer. Ask any emo person you know and they will most likely love Weezer (at least, that's what my ex-girlfriend told me...). Anyways - Rivers Cuomo does another great-yet-slightly-annoying vocal delivery here which I think some people might not like (mostly just non-emo fans and those without an open-mind). The most well-known track off this album is definitely \\"Buddy Holly\\" which almost every person growing up in the 90's heard at one point or another. The lyrics are surprisingly good and are very catchy and memorable for a mainstream band - you'll probably enjoy listening to them carefully. Once again the band sounds distinctively Weezer with their fuzzy guitar-sounding indie rock. No other band that I know of sounds like Weezer (so they were at least the first to start this style). Emo, punk-pop and Weezer fans will love this album, though I'm not sure whether others will. Overall, though, this is highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I don't really like Fall Out Boy, and these boy bands that call themselves \\"punk\\" nowadays are just repulsive. Hence why it took me so long to really listen to this CD. And whoa, I'm glad I finally put my ass where my face is, because this album rocks. <br />It's alternative music... kinda dance, kinda pop, and kinda rock... The kind of stuff that teenage girls like. But every song on this album is so original with catchy choruses and keyboard/synthesizer bits. The best songs are definately: <br />-Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage <br />-I Write Sins Not Tragedies <br />-Build God, Then We'll Talk <br />-Time To Dance <br />But when listened to in full, this album will get you hooked by the second time. You might even dance, although for anyone that actually reads this, the only dancing you may be doing is dancing alone in the dark in your mom's basement. I'm making a joke about myself there more than a joke about you. <br />Watch out, MTV will get hold of this band soon.... although as a band, they are definitely MTV material... screw those MTV guys...
B00001OH7P|5.0|I'll be honest - I was never a big David Bowie fan. I just didn't understand why everyone liked him so much, that is, until I heard \\"The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust\\". Not only is it a weird and creative album, but it's extremely accessible and consistently fun - THIS is the Bowie album that you want to show to friends who don't think much of him. Bowie's voice is pretty good here, however it's not perfect - most people will like him, though. The lyrics are always interesting to listen to, though it's kind've hard to make out at times. The production and musicianship is great here - everything can be heard and the music is pretty experimental-yet-familiar at the same time. Though it arguably lacks any \\"classic\\" songs, all of it is surely great stuff. It's a surprisingly mellow and groovy album, too - it'll make great background music. It doesn't sound dated at all (well...the production, anyway). All in all I think that Bowie and non-Bowie fans will most likely love this! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000000OUJ|4.0|It's 11:00PM, im browsing Amazon, and I come across Enter The 36 Chamber's, WU TANG's first album. Me personally I gave it a 3.5, and I thought it was ok. I COULDNT BELELIVE HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE GUSHING OVER THIS! I think people just fell into the marketing concept, after Wu Tang Clan was not as much a rap group as you think, but more a Marketing Sceme devised to use a collective group of rapper's, and a in house Producer, to produce a rapid firs amount of albums quilckly in the early-mid 90's, to dominate the East Coast rap game, and it pretty much worked. <br /> <br />Now on to this album... <br />If anyone tell's you this is anything like 36 Chamber's slap them in the face, yes it's GZA,RZA, and the rest of the crew, but it is a toatally different sound. Even though it is more underground feel to it ( There is no C.R.E.A.M. here ) It seem's more accesable.  <br />There is really no good song here, but the best ones are the ones that have a clip, or skit before them, and that feature a few other artist's then GZA, to give it more variety. Actually my favorite track is B.I.B.L.E. which is tecnically not even his song. There is really no skippable track though, and it's vibe is really nice to listen to in the dark of the school bus in the morning, or when your rolling thru your hood. <br />The only weaker part of this album, but that is still good is the production, don't get me wrong RZA is da man, but this is not the best production ive seen. ALso the CD is only about 60 min's, leaving about 15-20 left to fill. Also one more weak point that enhances the flaw of the distance of the record, is that most of the song's only have maybe 2 minutes of actuall rhyming, the rest is skit's, and beat's. But what is cool about that is the Clip's are fVCKING AWESOME!!! And it is nice to hear the beat's by themselves, so it balances out. Also the first track will surprise you, as will the rest. <br />Enjoy this is a great ALBUM! <br />Overall 4.5/5 <br />NEAR CLASSIC <br />And Ibump it constantly... <br />Lyric's- 10/10 <br />Delivery- 9.5/10 <br />Production - 8.5/10 <br />Charisma - 9/10 <br />Skit's - 11/10 !!! <br /> <br />Hope this helped! If so, tell amazon it did!
B000002TQB|5.0|Like most people in the world, the name Blur probably brings up images of their 90's hit \\"Song 2\\". While this was a pretty good song, it's NOTHING compared to how awesome \\"Parklife\\" is! It's all very original and interesting to listen to. It's essentially indie rock britpop with an electronic twist that has VERY good and catchy lyrics as well as great production. The only questionable part of this album is lead singer Damon Albarn who some might not like (mostly because of his punkish English accent) - he's certainly likable if you have an open mind, though. Another great thing here is that every song is good-if-not-great, and the lyrics are pretty memorable and interesting - you'll most certainly enjoy listening to them closely. I have no idea who to compare their sound to as its distinctly \\"Blur\\" - this is a good thing. Basically, if you like britpop, are open-minded or if you don't mind Damon's heavy English accent then chances are you'll LOVE this album! Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00066N8JS|5.0|Trent reznor suped up his re-releasing of one of the most acclaimed albums of the 90s \\"The Downward Spiral\\" with some cool packaging and an extra CD full of demos, B sides, and non-album songs. Not only do you get a great album, but another great album with it. It contains a demo version of \\"Reptile\\" entitled liar. Different versions of \\"Closer\\" and \\"Hurt\\". I have only listend to disc two a handfull of times. The first Cd \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is an amazing piece of work. If you dont have The Downward spiral I suggest you get this special addition but If you already have it dont bother getting it for the 2nd disc unless you wanna spend close to 30 dollars. Lets get back to the album people. The individual ratings: <br /> <br />1. Mr. Self Destruct-(10/10)- Really good way to start us down the spiral. It starts with some noises that make it sound like someone is getting hit with something very hard. The chorus is heavy hitting and pervusive.  <br /> <br />2. Piggy-(10/10)- A legendary song. Almost like a prelude to the 4th track. The lyrics and the sound of this song are slow and creepy. A real stand out song of the album. <br /> <br />3. Heresy-(10/10)- Probalbly one of my favorite NIN songs. Very controversial lyrics, \\"God is dead, and no one cares, If there is a hell, I'll see you there\\". A very bold statement. If you dont like it, go to church. I also like the way this one starts out. A retro 80's beat. <br /> <br />4. March of the pigs-(10/10)-Another Notorious NIN song. Starts out being a heavy NIN song, then has a slow down piano part which knocks you out, then your right back in it.  <br /> <br />5.Closer-(10/10)- This is the song that put NIN on the map. One of the most grotuitist songs on the radio and MTV. Its full of dark, sexual lyrics. Dont let your mothers listen to this one. <br /> <br />6. The Ruiner-(10/10)- This starts off with a hip hop vibe kind of. Then it transforms it self to a dark NIN song and Trent makes weird noises like a Car burns gas. Its like gravity. <br /> <br />7. The Becoming-(7/10)- This is where the album takes a dip with a predictable song. In comparison with the rest of the album this is honestly to just average. <br /> <br />8. I do not want this-(10/10)- Great song. Starts off slow and slowly builds up to an explosive chorus. Guitar work really comes out on this one. The music towards the end really picks up perfusively and mushes into your head like a bag of broken nails. <br /> <br />9. Big man with a gun-(9/10)- Again, Im feeling the hoppy beats. This one keeps the flowing goin and gun opposing lyrics gives it a good kick. <br /> <br />10 A Warm Place-(10/10)- Great timing for an instrumental track. It gives a timeout, and it doesnt need any words in this one. It says a thousand words on its own. You should never skip this just cause its an instrumental track. Its slow, soulful, and it takes you even further down the spiral then ever before. <br /> <br />11. Eraser-(8/10)- I really just degraded this because its so long. Otherwise its a great song.Alot of different types of stlyes.  <br /> <br />12. Reptile-(10/10)-This is something outta a science fiction tale. Machine like sounds roaring in this one. Ya gotta love this one. The last heavy song of the album.  <br /> <br />13. The Downward Spiral-(10/10)- The 2nd instrumental track of the album. You may notice the riff from the end of closer on this one. I really like this one. The acoustic guitar isnt something I didnt expect on this album. There is technically some singing but its just a sample of trent screaming and him mumbling something in the back. <br /> <br />14. Hurt-(10/10)- Fantasic way to end the album. A soft poetic song like hurt. Keeps you interested from the first note. No wonder Johnny cash, one of the most talanted and legendary musicians chose to redo this song. <br /> <br /> <br />DISC 2 <br /> <br />1. Burn-(10/10_ <br />2. Closer(precursor)-(10/10) <br />3. Piggy(nothing can stop me now)-(10/10) <br />4.A Violetfluid-(10/10) <br />5. Dead souls-(8/10) <br />6. Hurt(quiet)-(10/10) (almost the same as original) <br />7. Closer to god- (10/10) <br />8. All the pigs, all lined up-(Demo of March of the pigs)(10/10) <br />9. Memorabilia-(8/10) <br />10. The Downward spiral(the bottom)-(10/10) <br />11. Ruiner(demo)-(7/10) <br />12. Liar(demo)-(8/10) <br />13. Heresy-(7/10) <br /> <br /> <br />I suggest not listening to Disc 2 right after Disc 1. It would be like listening to the same album twice. But It is worth the cash so If you do buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you, and continue your journey down the spiral... <br />
1401301010|5.0|Scar Tissue was the most interesting book I've ever read.  Anthony Kiedis tells of his life full of drugs, women, and rock n roll.  You would think that his life would be great, being a rock n roll superstar and all, but he faces many problems along the way.  His life is full of ups and downs and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  He goes through so many struggles in life.  Early on he drops out of college, doesn't have a home, and is kicked out of his band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  And on top of all that, he has a massive drug addiction.  You will be inspired as you read about his addiction and how he goes through a rollercoaster, overcoming his addiction, then starting up again, then quitting again.  I gave this book 5 stars and it is one of the best books I've ever read.
0679601686|5.0|\\"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\\"<br /><br /> When first hearing the title Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen one might think that it would be another dull romantic book written ages ago.  When in reality, Pride and Prejudice is a book that I could say I have actually enjoyed so much that I have read it myself several times.  Pride and Prejudice is the type of book that draws the reader in deeper with each chapter, giving you new characters and personalities to make the book so compelling.<br /><br />The book starts off with a family known as the Bennets who have five daughters all with intentions of marrying to a young man with good fortune, except for one.  That one is Elizabeth Bennet who wants to marry for love or to retire an old maid. It causes a great stir when a young man of great fortune, Mr. Bingly, has just bought a large estate in Loungbourn.  This brings high hopes for Mrs. Bennet who has intentions of one of her daughters to catch his eye and to marry him.  With surprise and great excitement Mrs. Bennet later finds out through gossip that Mr. Bingly has a friend whom makes twice as much as Bingly, Mr. Darcy.  Mr. Bingly very quickly notices the eldest daughter of the Bennets, Jane.  Mr. Darcy on the contrary refuses to dance with Elizabeth at their first meeting.  In return this shocks Elizabeth of how someone could be that proud and that sets her opinion of him very low. Elizabeth reassures herself that this opinion of him could never change, but what if she is mistaken?<br /><br /> Throughout the book Jane Austen never lightens up or falls short of her humor.  Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have many amusing conversations about how she believes he is proud and how he believes she is prejudice.  This classic book will always remain one of my favorite books with the distinctive way Jane Austen writes.
B000002J1O|5.0|Real connoisseurs of Genesis consider this 1973 album to be their magnum opus, not the follow up smash double LP The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. Why? Everything from the cover art by Betty Swanwick to Peter Gabriel's sublime lyrics to the outstanding virtuositic performances by the band (most notably Steve Hackett and Phil Collins) lends itself to a truly magnificent and surprisingly cohesive set of songs that leave the listener with the sensation of having listened to a 40 minute tone poem.  <br /> <br />Peter Gabriel's haunting a cappella opening to \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\" gets things going in a dynamic way. Hackett's lead guitar interplays beautifully with Collins' fast but steady time keeping. The tempo slows a bit on \\"I Know What I Like...\\", but the momentum continues to gain. Based on the Swanwick cover painting, this song is an instant Genesis classic, the first Genesis single to reach the Top 40 in the UK. It's lawnmower sounds, grandiose synth & organ tones, and soaring vocals give it an anthemic feel. Lyrically, it is one of Gabriel's best story songs with one of my favorite Genesis lyrics,  <br /> <br />\\"Gambling only pays when you're winning. I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure...\\"  <br /> <br />The virtuosity from the band is kicked up a notch with \\"Firth of Fifth\\". Tony Banks' beautiful piano opening and Peter Gabriel's meloncholy flute solo segues beautifully to Phil Collins' nimble wristed snare drum fills, but the real performance gem is Steve Hackett's majestic guitar solo. For its sheer expression and atmospheric tone, it ranks up there with best guitar solos of all-time. Phil Collins slows things down and foreshadows the future of Genesis along the way by taking over the vocals on \\"More Fool Me\\", and he does so with remarkable aplomb. Thus the momentum gains on.        <br /> <br />Yet another fabulous Peter Gabriel story song comes next with \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\", complete with Gabriel's immense talent for theatric multi-role vocals and a bit of humor to boot. Steve Hackett's \\"After the Ordeal\\" follows perfectly as if to communicate instrumentally what happened after the ordeal of the Battle of Epping Forest.  <br /> <br />At this point the momentum has gained to a near climax leading to the album's best track, the epic \\"Cinema Show\\". More lyrical excellence from Gabriel is featured along with stellar guitar work from Hackett. Once upon a time, before he became an international pop star, Phil Collins was the best drummer in rock music as shown by his powerful yet effortless handling of the 7/8 time signature during the second part of \\"Cinema Show\\". Tony Banks' beautiful synth playing rounds out the band's ultimate virtuositic performance leading to the album's climax. Afterward, the surreal \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" with Peter Gabriel's spooky chant of grocery store sale ads seems a fitting albeit strange end to this prog rock masterpiece. <br /> <br />Whatever momentum that carried the 1974 follow up The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway to its success was clearly gained with Selling England By the Pound. Not only does this recording represent the best of the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, it represents Genesis at the peak of their musical powers. Listen for yourself and hear what Genesis fans in the know have known for years.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|The Definitive Western.<br /><br />Let's first start off by saying Lonesome Dove is the Western of Westerns.  Regardless if it had been a cinematic release (which would not have been done due to length, or the mini-series, the story is compelling and the filming and acting top-notch.  Any superlative that can be said has been said so no more need be said.<br /><br />There have been reviews discussing editing vs. no editing so to satisfy myself a side by side by side comparison (original VHS to original full length DVD to newly released DVD) needed to be done.  What was found was there was editing.  No major clipping was done but there was some compression accomplished on some longer scenes where no dialogue was occurring.  But the series is intact.  This being said, you need to remember the original was not filmed for wide-screen since it was intended for television and wide-screen television did not exist except in concept twenty years ago, mono was standard so the stereo and dolby soundtracks are simulated for the majority of the film and any digital video or audio originated from analog film and tapes so you cannot and will not ever get pristine digital quality being reproduced. Again does this have impact on the film, nope unless you just want something to complain about.  All in all, the top of the line western.  Perhaps they just should have left everything alone and no one would have had to write anything.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was fortunate enough to buy the original VHS version of Pulse from a local retail store when it was released over 10 years ago.  I've played it many times and the performance is second to none.  I've preordered a copy of the DVD and can hardly wait until it arrives!  For those of you wondering whether or not to get it...hey, it's a no brainer....preorder your copy NOW!!!!!!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|To say this box set is loaded would be an understatement.  You get two versions of the movie, followed by a second disc with TONS of extra stuff.  IMHO the Scott and Cameron directed originals are still the best, but the Quadrilogy would not be complete without the other two.  Weaver looks absolutely stunning in the first one and solid performances are given by all the actors in each movie.  A must own for an Sci-Fi or Action Fan as well as any lover of great movies.  Well worth the money (especially on Amazon as I've shopped around and haven't found it cheaper anywhere else).  Incredible.
B000002KZ6|2.0|Yes, yes, this is the band getting deeper into the funk, but Speaking in Tongues just doesn't work for me. For one, the vocals (on most of the cuts) are muddled and mixed too low for my taste. Couple this with the fact that the melodic hooks aren't there as they were on their first three masterpieces, and Speaking in Tongues falls apart.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently received my Firefly DVD and I absolutely love it. It takes place 500 years in the future in a different solar system. Firefly is about about a group of vagabounds on a ship getting work where they can, legal or not. The actors are extremely talented and I have never seen such good chemistry before with a cast of 9 people. The characters really make Firefly come to life and make it seem believable. The set designs are stunning and absolute genius.  <br /> <br />I, like many of the other fans to the show, only became a fan last year where I saw reruns of in on the SciFi channel. I wish Fox would have promoted the show better so more would have known about it and watched it.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|It sounds a bit different, but still very, very good. <br />This is the second album I love listening to from the beginning to the end, since \\"Issues\\". <br />My advice - buy it. <br />
B000AWYOGE|1.0|This movie is terrible.  I like Jennifer Connelly and think she is good actress.  The whole thing, I kept waiting for it to become scary, but instead it just got more ridiculous.  I was just waiting for it to end.  I thought I would want to own this DVD (after renting it) but I wouldn't bother.
0385335482|5.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic was a great book in my opinion. Sophie Kinsella tells the story of Rebecca Bloomwood, a hip, trendy, and penniless columnist for Successful Savings magazine. She has no control on her spending and tries desperately, every once and awhile, to get a grip on herself and her urge to spend. <br />This book is great qualifier for the Chick-Lit genre. It is easy to read and is funny. I think most women could relate to Becky very easily. Sophie Kinsella keeps you interested and entertained right down to the last page. Another thing that keeps you reading is a developing romance with a millionaire and representative for a business company that Becky works with. It's a love hate relationship that keeps you guessing.  <br />I didn't want to put it down the whole time I was reading, because the author has a way of making you cringe at some of the things Becky does to get rid of her bills and to keep them secret. I think Sophie Kinsella wrote this to be a light read and to entertain but I am sure after women read this book they will seriously rethink their purchases and future.   <br />The book is written from Becky's point of view, which really adds to the humor contained inside the story. This point of view lets you see how she is really thinking as she lays out all of her plans to \\"get rich fast!\\" or to bury her finances so they will just disappear. Another reason that I enjoyed this book was that it was set in London. I liked reading all of the slang, currency, and hearing about different places that Becky went to. <br />I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who wanted to read a book that makes you laugh and wants to read a book for leisure. <br />
B000BKVQTS|1.0|It is truly disappointing when a movie with such unlimited possibility is trashed by inept acting, poor effects, and a director who cannot seem to decide where the movie is going.  With such a cool premise, the movie just turns into a bunch of garbage that is unbearable to watch let alone get involved in.  I was glad this was a free rental at the local video store.  I would have been ticked off had I spent a dime on this crap.  Consider yourself warned.
B00026WU3M|4.0|After reviewing the negative article I wrote about \\"Nashville Skyline,\\" I realized I made a huge blunder by not including \\"Oh Mercy\\" as one of Dylan's few, later, greater, post-60s albums.  Substitute the out-take \\"Series of Dreams\\" (Bootleg: Volume 3) for the lame \\"Disease of Conceit,\\" and you have something close to perfection. ****1/2
B000683VI4|5.0|I can't even think of this movie without almost crying!  I'm not one to get into the tearjerker movies and didn't want to watch it, but it was on a movie channel so I thought \\"What the heck?\\"  The acting was magnificent throughout the movie.  I was on edge when I didn't think love was going to work out the way it should.  I thought \\"Where's MY guy at who hounds me and reveres me??\\"  Oh..and how it ends.  Don't get me started.<br /><br />I'd write much more about this movie but I don't want to give the plot away.  While it wasn't hard to figure out who was who and what was going on, it still moved me to tears.  It wasn't the art of surprise, but the overwhelming dedication that two people can have for each other.  A must see!
0805066691|5.0|I have a well-worn first edition of this book, and have just finished re-reading it. Although by no means perfect or completely unbiased, it does do a pretty fair job of illustrating the methods that the \\"white man\\" used to banish the Indians to the few scattered reservations that are now left to them- and also documented some of the atrocities that were unfortunately quite commonplace in that period in North America.  <br /> <br />Also, I feel somewhat compelled to take some of the \\"facts\\" that were presented in the prior review to task, since the author seemed to feel that they were debatable: <br /> <br />1) \\"The only words on record from any of the Indians featured in this book were obtained through interpreters. No Indian featured in this book could speak English, or even broken English while free or just after settling on reservations, well enough to make complex statements about anything. Those who interpreted their words on all occasions were rough-and-ready frontier scouts, semi-educated Indians of tribes allied to the European invaders, or US Government Agents on reservations - none of whom had the command of the English language to provide renditions of such flowery, high-sounding statements.\\" <br /> <br />    I'm not sure to which specific statements you were referring, but all quotations in the book are footnoted- with the majority of the most damning statements coming from records of the Secretary Of The Interior, Secretary Of War, Commisioner Of Indian Affairs, and the Congressional Record, among others, so I'm not totally willing to write off the statements in the book to some sort of mass miscommunication, or spurious eloquence on the part of the translator. <br /> <br />    I will give you the fact that the level of literacy at that time was spotty at best....one of the reasons many surnames have so many variations is the illiteracy of those who recorded them. <br /> <br />And we all know that Congress has lied like a rug on more than one occasion, but I don't think that really applies in this particular instance. <br /> <br />2) \\"The Indians of the western frontier were nomadic and constantly at war with one another over the best hunting grounds. Before the arrival of Europeans, these Indians existed at the Stone Age level with no technology beyond stone, bone, or wooden-tipped arrows, lances, and simple bows. They did NOT comprise \\"Nations\\" because they had no DEFINED TERRITORIES in which they lived, nor any set system of politics. They existed as wandering TRIBES and operated within these tribes as BANDS.\\" <br /> <br />   No argument there. But if you think that they lived totally without skills my friend, I suggest leaving you and your family with nothing but bathing suits and a couple of blankets in Powder River, Montana around October 1st, and then we'll come back around June after it thaws out and we'll see how y'all are doin? And let's not forget who it was that showed some of the early colonists how to survive long enough to see the next ship make it across the ocean from Europe.... <br /> <br />3) \\"Here are some examples of what I mean. During the early years of the fur trade, the Sioux existed in the forests of eastern Canada until being driven out onto the plains of what is now Minnesota, the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Nebraska by other tribes who obtained fire arms from trade with the French and British. Once on the plains, the Sioux attacked the Kiowa and Cheyenne, who lived at that time around the Black Hills area, and drove these tribes southward. The Sioux also attempted to totally exterminate the Pawnee and Absaroke (Crow) tribes....\\" <br /> <br />    Being a decendant of Nicolas Marsolet, I know a little bit about the fur trade, and the migration of the Indians from Canada into the plains....in fact, many of my ancestors were killed by the Sioux and the Iroquois.  <br /> <br />    Interesting fact about Marsolet....he was on the first ship to Quebec from France, and was \\"traded\\" to the Indiantribes for one of their braves for several years. Later, he became the official interpretor for the Iroquois, arranging several treaties  between the Indians and France. However, it is believed that he felt sympathy for the Indians, and was charged with treason on those same grounds.  <br /> <br />4) \\"Unknown to most people, the horse existed in the Americas in prehistoric times. Europeans were NOT responsible for the first appearance of the horse on this side of the world. However, by the time Europeans arrived with domesticated horses, the Indians had long since hunted the prehistoric horses to extinction as a source of food.\\" <br /> <br />   Sorry to throw a little Zoology and Darwinism your way, but the horse is a perfect example of an animal that is on it's way to an abrupt dead end in it's evolutionary path to extinction- Indians, or no Indians. <br /> <br />5) \\"There was no mercy or \\"fair play\\" between the tribes and none provided to invading Europeans by most Indians either. It was quite common for Indians of each western tribe to slaughter the women and children of other tribes they were at war with. Or, barring outright slaughter, to use them as slaves or sell them as slaves, or rape and torture them to death while in captivity.\\" <br /> <br />Ahem. Name me one race of people on this planet who *hasn't* done exactly what you just stated above. Or heck, better yet, maybe just open a newspaper.  <br /> <br />6) \\"If they could obtain better weapons or trade goods, or if they could hope to destroy old tribal enemies, many Indians happily joined the White invaders in wars against other Indians.\\" <br /> <br />   I believe that in the book, that situation is described as being a b-r-i-b-e. <br /> <br />7) \\"Also, the decorative costumes and elaborately feathered war bonnets of the plains tribes didn't exist until trade with the European invaders began. There was no colored beads, no thread, no needles, no colored yarn, no colored linen, no glue, and no colored dyesamong the tribes BEFORE the terrible invading Europeans arrived and used all these items as trade goods.\\" <br /> <br />   It's funny, I've handled some authentic artifacts, and I sure don't remember seeing any signs of needles, thread, linen, or glue? As for there not being any colorful yarn, I think you had better recheck that theory....because I know for a fact many colorful dyes are of Indian origin, made from substances such as oak galls, marigolds, bark, and lichens. <br /> <br />   Hard to believe that we're in the 21st century, yet here in our country we *still* have areas set aside as \\"reservations\\" for a certain race of people.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I expected more from this movie.  Hey...it broke up Jennifer and Brad, didn't it?  There was some action, romance and some drama.  That about sums it up.  It reminds me of a more modern \\"War of the Roses\\" with some plot twisting to it.<br /><br />If you're thinking of buying it, I'd rent it first.  Better yet, wait until it comes out on one of the movie channels and it is $5.00 or being sold used.  I don't see this being much of a collector's DVD.
0790731452|4.0|It's amazing that there could be anything subtle in a movie about martians bent on destroying the world with death ray guns, but behind the wackiness and campy violence lies humor that reveals itself with repeated viewings.
0553801503|4.0|The long-awaited new installment of Mr. Martin's series is an excellent book.  As always, the characters are amazing and the intrigue tops the charts in excitement.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, however, others sound as though they disagree. <br />Now, the obvious complaint is that we have half a book - well, that is true, but I have to agree with how Mr. Martin did it.  In the past books, a big annoyance for me was having to wait two hundred pages to here back from our characters, and I only had to wait 100 pages in this volume!  I usually skipped around anyway, though I do regret not being able to fulfill my curiosity on others characters.  <br />Many have also complained about all the minor characters.  At times, it is hard to keep track, but what is the difference between all the other books?  With the ironmen and the Dornishmen, he tells the tales from different perspectives, but it is not any more confusing that way because even though it is told from different perspectives, they are all about the same characters.  I would have just gotten rid of the Dornish tales and told that tale from afar, but I liked the addition of the ironmen in this book. <br />This book, more so than others, Martin seems a little self-indulgent in certain aspects.  For example, the sexual aspects of the book are heavier than previous installments which doesn't bother me, but they seemed unnecessary, as if Mr. Martin needed to take the reigns on his hormones a little more.  There are other times where Martin flaunts his Medieval knowledge unnecessarily, but not much. <br />I highly recommend this book if you've read the previous books - it is an excellent read.  The book is fast-paced and you'll reader fast than you'll ever know.  Yes, it annoys me that I'll have to wait to hear about more storylines, but with a series as massive as this one, that is to be expected.  If it bothers you, wait till he writes them all and read the entire series.  However, I think that Martin andhis publishers did the right thing on this one.  Just think, if he wouldn't have published half a book, we would have to wait another year to read any of the series!  So, I'm not complaining.  Not perfect, but quite enjoyable.
0765315246|4.0|I really liked this book, though I wouldn't put it into the first rank of SciFi literature. Scalzi has some great ideas and does a really clever job of sort of \\"futurizing\\" a lot of current tech developments to some of their logical conclusions. I think the universe he creates is well realized and seems believable and I can't wait to read the sequels.
0307276902|3.0|Anyone who has been through the hell of drug addiction will recognize from Frey's narrative description of his thinking that he actually was addicted to drugs.   Beyond that, little of the story he tells appears credibile.   The excruciating detail of his \\"memoir\\" is belied by the fact that he didn't mention keeping a \\"journal\\" (one of many standard suggestions in Rehab), and he didn't write his book until years later.  Yet somewhere in his blackout prone, severely chemically unbalanced brain, he expects us to believe that he has a preserved \\"photographic memory\\" of every detail of every conversation and every experience he had in his 6 week rehab experience.  Yeah....right. <br /> <br />The extremely grandious \\"concept\\" that he gained \\"respect\\" as a \\"tough guy\\" from Leanord the Mafia Don, the black pro boxer, the black judge and his biker counselor, (despite his \\"trust fund kid\\" status and diminuitive physical presence), ALL in 6 short weeks (wait, I forgot about his heroic rescue of Lilly and his \\"John Wayne\\" dental experience), is apparently the product of drug induced psychosis, brain damage or some long term delusion.    No one who has been through this in real life would believe this crap!   Trust fund kids with attitudes like Frey's get slapped down in Rehab (mentally, emotionally and sometimes physically), and usually it only takes 6 hours, not 6 weeks, lol.  Sure, some are tougher than others, but Rehab Rambos like Frey typically do not exist outside the ego driven imagination of the weakest of the weak. <br /> <br />The story is entertaining (as mostly fiction/part fact), but I think it does a great disservice to those who kick through 12step programs, as well as those who kick on their own.   Personally, I participate in a 12step program, and I've never bought into the \\"disease concept\\", \\"perpetual powerlessness\\" or alot of the same rehab psycho babble that Frey describes with disdain.  I also had a very substantial drug addiction, but I actually enjoyedmy rehab experience and found that kicking drugs really wasn't that difficult, if I just \\"tried out\\" the suggestions, kept what worked and left the rest.   I also have found it quite easy to remain alcohol and drug free.   However, I will not disrespect the tremendous effort required by many people to remain drug free by telling an imaginary tale of how I did it all on my own.   Frey actually describes working several important parts of the 12step program (with a 12step counselor in a 12 step rehab), but gives them little if any credit towards his recovery. <br /> <br />Entertaining?  Yes.   Dishonest?  Yes.   Responsible?  No. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|I will preface this by saying I was never a big Johnny Cash fan, but after seeing the excellent way Hollywood handled Ray Charles (\\"Ray\\") and Bobby Darin (\\"Beyond the Sea\\") I was anxious to see what it would do for The Man in Black.  The results are phenomenal.  Now, I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to John and June when they were still living.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are phenomenal as Johnny and June Carter Cash.  This unlikely casting yields such outstanding results that I would hand them both the Oscar right now if I could.  I read that Reese almost bailed on the project when she found out she had to do her own singing, but you would never know it from the great vocals and spunky performances she delivers.<br /><br />The film focuses on their love affair, first as friends and then torrid even while he was married to his first wife and the mother of his children.  His drug abuse is highlighted but it is Johnny Cash, the complex man and his love for June Carter, darling daughter of the close-knit and totally supportive Carter clan,  that comes shining through and makes this a totally enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Two big thumbs up for a movie that thrills from its opening at the infamous Folsom Prison to its spectatcular closing.
B000BJS4BM|3.0|Dont get me wrong, i love COADF, its my second favorite Madonna album (next to Ray of light). But this special edition...well lets just say i expected more. I mean, the 40 page booklet of the complete confessions photoshoot is awesome and the new track \\"Fighting Spirit\\" is very good to but thats basically it. it also comes with a blank book for drawing (i guess). I just expected more like different versions of some songs or something to that extent. I reccomend you buy this Special edition it wouldnt hurt. Just dont expect anything very spectacular.  <br /> <br />Fighting Spirit- is a great song. however, Madonna could have done something better with the chorus part. but still its a great song. and is the main reason why i got this. it has a great message and will have you dancing.
0307276902|1.0|I was reading it last year and got up to the scene where the dentist refuses to give him anaesthetic for his root canal out of concern that he would relapse into drug addiction. I knew this couldn't possibly be true. It was like a ripoff of Marathon Man. At that point, I realized I'd been had and threw the book away in disgust. <br /> <br />I acquired the book accidentally in a mistaken book club shipment and decided to give it a try.  The narrator is an annoying spoiled rich kid, extremely unsympathetic.  Like most junkies, he's boring. He has no interests except himself. The writing is tedious.  When I caught my neighbour reading it on the subway I actually asked him in disbelief, \\"You LIKE that book?\\"  (He said yes. God knows why.) <br /> <br />Come on, no anaesthetic for a root canal? You'll need an anaesthetic..preferably some hard drugs..in order to enjoy this ridiculous, overheated, overhyped book.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|Every once in a while a thoughtful horror film comes along, one that creeps the audience out and makes it ponder at the same time. \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is one of those films, written by Paul Harris Boardman and director Scott Derrickson, who were inspired by a true story. When a young woman named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) dies of starvation and self-inflicted injuries at her family's Midwestern farm house, the State prosecutes her priest, Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson) for negligent homicide, claiming that his encouragement to abandon medical treatment for epilepsy led to Emily's death. Emily had been suffering from frightening hallucinations, seizures, and violent behavior which she came to blame on demonic possession and believe could only be cured by exorcism. Ambitious agnostic attorney Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) defends Father Moore and the possibility that Emily's affliction may have been spiritual, while the practical, church-going prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) lays the blame for Emily's death squarely on religious superstition that fed her psychosis.<br /><br />\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is part courtroom drama, part horror movie. This turns out to be a good combination, as the courtroom scenes allow Emily's story to be told in flashbacks, which paces the horror evenly throughout the film. And the horror punctuates the courtroom drama so that it never becomes plodding. The first thing that struck me about this film was the quality of the cast. Laura Linney and Campbell Scott in a horror flick? This obviously isn't schlock. Great character actors bring much-needed credibility to this spooky tale of the maybe-supernatural. Campbell Scott's role as the prosecutor, a religious man himself, brings stronger conflict to the courtroom than if it were simply a secular prosecution. Jennifer Carpenter's physicality as Emily Rose is remarkable. She's a sweet, earnest woman who does some very freaky stuff, terrifying herself and everyone else. Carpenter's incredible physical performance allowed the use of visual effects only as subtle enhancement, grounding supernatural events in realism.<br /><br />The second thing that struck me about \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is how good the film looks. Director Scott Derrickson has an impressively cinematic vision. He took great care with framing, colors, and production design. The courtroom scenes are especially captivating, thanks to production designer David Brisbin, who found a middle ground between realistically dreary institutional courtrooms and Frank Lloyd Wright. \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" claims to be \\"based on a true story\\", but \\"inspired by\\" is probably more accurate. The real case took place in the 1970s in Germany. A devoutly religious woman named Anneliese Michel, who had been epileptic and psychotic for 6 years, died in 1976 of self-imposed starvation after a series of exorcisms. Two clergymen and her parents were brought to trial on charges of negligent homicide. In the real case, it was clearer than in the movie that Miss Michel's problems were medical. But it was also clear that she had exhausted the offerings of the medical community, which was unable to successfully treat her after years of trying.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): Bonus features include 1 deleted scene with optional director's commentary, 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In \\"Genesis of the Story\\" (19 min), writer/producer Paul Harris Boardman and writer/director Scott Derrickson talk about the film's themes and researching cases of demonic possession. The film's cast also discuss their characters. We hear how Derrickson found his actors in \\"Casting the Movie\\" (12 min), and Jennifer Carpenter talks about her role.  \\"Visual Design\\" (18 min) includes discussion of Scott Derrickson's visual philosophy for the film, inspired Francis Bacon paintings. He and production designer David Brisbin talk a lot about he color palette. Costume designer Tish Monaghan talksabout trying not to give the impression of a particular era. And visual effects supervisor Michael Shelton, of \\"Captive Audience\\", talks about his team's contributions. There is a good audio commentary by writer/director Scott Derrickson. He discusses the origins of the project and his intentions with the film, providing a scene-by-scene commentary on the actors, characters, visual design, pacing, sets, filming, and some technical details.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|This CD is filled with great songs. They are not the same kind of songs so you have variety when you listen to this CD. Some of my favorites are Hurt, The Man Comes Around, and Desperado. I just recently watched the video, Hurt. It was so amazing that it will bring tears to your eyes. <br /> <br />2 Thumbs UP!
B000BMSU68|2.0|I just got the Bueller..Bueller edition.  The great Hughes commentary is missing.  I guess I'll have to rent the old dvd to hear it.  But I just wanted to say that Paramount should put this one up the a for leaving out the only special feature that's interesting to film enthusiasts like me.  I mean, come on!!  Just give us a product that will satisfy us.  They put commentary on the new Airplane and Tommy Boy dvds.  Why couldn't they fit it onto this?  They suck.. All you should buy the old dvd for 9.99.  Thanks to all the reviewers who wrote what the commentary said.  Could someone at Paramount slap someone in charge please?  I'll pay you.
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|Perhaps the strokes should walk outside and take another look at earth, because their first impression of it seems to come out all wrong.<br /><br />I have no problem with the strokes on any level as people, or as a product of a hype machine, or as media darlings- and generally speaking, their music has been good to me. While their first two discs weren't brilliant expressions of art, they did contain some of the best rock songs i've ever heard. They had a knack for great hooks (imediately, the prechorus breakdown of 'reptilia' comes to mind as being one of the catchest things i've ever heard)- and they had an uncanny ability to transform the everyday and make it interesting, while sounding completely disinterested themselves. it's a trick that they perfected with their debut, started to lose with their sophomore album, seem completely incapable of recapturing here.<br /><br />I won't be completely negative here. There are a few songs that do truly shine- Vision of Division, Easily the strongest track here, has an unforgetable and catchy chorus. A Few other tracks have moments of brilliance, as well. Further, The Technical abilities of the band have grown by leaps and bounds- I've never found them to be a particularily skilled band in regards to their instruments- but the band is clearly taking more chances, and while few of them pay off, it is promising that they are trying- the rhythm section has clearly had the most improvement, showing a diversity of range that makes you wonder if this is even the same band that came out on those previous recordings. It will be interesting to see where they go next.<br /><br />All of that said, there is an undeniable downside to this album- namely, that most everything here is, in some capacity- challenging to listen to. Not the kind of challenging that becomes rewarding after repeated listenings, but rather the kind of challenging that makes songs harder and harder to listen to the more you hear them.<br /><br />The Lead single, \\"Juicebox\\" pretty much sums up all you need to know about this album- The bassline doesn't work. the surf-guitars don't work. the chorus and the verses don't sound right together. and most of all, Julian has finally decided that what he has to say might deserve more than the bored delivery he usually gives- and he's wrong. His lyrics were never great, and his conviction here throws that into sharp relief. The boredemn in his expression is what made this band so endearing, and therein lies the main fault of this album:<br /><br />The strokes are trying way too hard, denying everything natural to their sound and instead come off like a second-rate band trying really hard to be the strokes.<br /><br />Their first two albums were nearly identical, so this album can be excused as a sophomore slump of sorts- a band trying to expand their sound, but not really knowing what to do with it. I have a suspscion that their next album may very well end up being their finest- but for now, we're regretably left with this unfortunate mess.
1400031354|3.0|I want to like these books more than I do. I enjoy them -- they're clever and sweet. But they're not too exciting, and at parts a little slow. I'd like to see heavier plotting in terms of the mysteries -- they're almost a sidebar to the story, rather than the main focus. One thing I really appreciate is the author's insight into human nature -- Mma Rotsawe is sort of an African Miss Marple. I must say I'm hooked on the series.
B000006TRV|5.0|Don't mind the (...)who give one star to this great album.  Instead, read the long 5 star revies.  Those really tell what this album is all about.

The wall  Mother   and more    If you like this album, try the dark side of the moon, wish you were here, Pulse and the other PF masterpieces ^_^.

0684833395|5.0|There was only one catch, and that was Catch-22.... <br /> <br />Catch-22 is a book detailing the life and times of John Yossarian, and how war changes his life and his way of appreciating life. <br /> <br />Yossarian, a bombardier in WWII, is constantly faced with the threat of death , when all he wants is to be immortal, or die trying. He is a quirky, witty man, and Catch-22 is full of humor, but one of the great things about this book is the range of emotion expressed by the soldiers. Although they are proud men serving our country, they are also trapped in a powerful bureaucracy focused on nothing but celebrity. Although they should have been commended for their bravery, they were thrust into the most dangerous missions for the most pointless of reasons: aesthetically pleasing bomb patterns. <br /> <br />One of the main reasons you should read this book, however, is for the flashbacks of Snowden. It's a powerful scene that stays with the reader, with vivid description and detail. You feel like your're there with Yossarian and clueless as to what to do about a dying gunner on your plane.But more than anything, this part, along with the entire book, leaves the reader with a new perspective on death and war. War can be a corrupt system, with people supposedly hating people from foreign countries they have never met, and supposedly being friendly with those on their side, when it can be entirely the opposite. War can send young and old to die, and war can drive men crazy. But most of all, war changes a man, as Catch-22 shows. <br /> <br />So if you're considering reading Catch-22, don't think twice...but do it. It's a book you'll never forget, and won't regret reading.
B000002LOE|1.0|Without any doubt, the worst album this great band ever made. Sappy and dated songs in search of a hit single. I own every REM album but this one. I originally bought this when it came out but gave it away because I hated it so. A few years later I bought it again so I could have the complete library, but once again dumped it because I truly hate this album. Not sure how fans of Reckoning, Document and Lifes Rich Pageant can say they like this piece of crap, there is nothing in this album that relates to REM's great works. Seriously, how can one listen to this album today without feeling nauseous?
B000E0OBK6|5.0|Not having spent in the military, not alone the Marines, I came to appreciate this film.  I have read the book, so the book differs from the movie in many details, but at least I come to understand what Anthony Swofford experienced during Desert Storm.<br /><br />I have many friends that have served and are currently serving in the United States Marine Corps.  Two of them were in Desert Storm and they would tell you that this is what happened when they were there- especially if you were a Marine sniper.  The protrayal of Anthony Swofford is very well-done, done by a very fine actor.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen this film (or will see when it comes out on DVD) may come to appreciate what it's like to be a Marine.  It takes a lot of hard work, determination, blood, sweat and tears.  War is never good, even when nothing happens.  I take that back, I believe that it's worse when nothing happens.<br /><br />I praise Sam Mendes efforts in making this film along with his fellow filmakers.  I hope that anyone who sees this film feels the same way.  Semper Fi Marines.
B000002BFL|5.0|I remember when I bought this album, I kind of popped it in the car CD player and played a little, stopped, got back in the car, played a little more, stopped, etc. Well, I did not have a very glowing view of the album, thought it boring and lacking. Sometimes I would pop it in the CD player and move around the house, picking up pieces here and there. Once again, thought, not that good. HOWEVER, I finally one night, crashed in my chair and put the CD on, listened to it the whole way through. WOW! WHAT HAPPENED!? It was as if my eyes were finally opened to a piece of art. I just played it over and over, still do. It's a concept album, not as commercial friendly as \\"Born in the USA\\" or something. But when you take the time to mellow out and listen to it, it is GREAT!
B0009JAENU|5.0|With the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birthday in 2006, a new crop of Mozart recordings have been released, including many of his sonatas for violin and pianoforte. Among these are fresh recordings from Mark Steinberg/Mitsuko Uchida, Hilary Hahn/Natalie Zhu, Anne-Sofie Mutter/Lambert Orkis(Aug.'06), Andrew Manze/Richard Elgar and Rachel Podger/Gary Cooper - the latter two on period violin and period fortepiano.  Depending on how one feels this music should be played will determine what most appeals to you.  All of these new additions seemed to get mixed reviews from the music press.  Often in these reviews, mention is made of the historic \\"Reference Recordings\\" - those superlative readings that set the standard.  And in the case of Mozart's violin sonatas, we have the legendary works of Arther Grumiaux/Haskill and Szeryng/Haebler - both recorded in the 1970's - as well as Perlman/Ashkenazy.  Grumiaux in particular of often cited as the standard for Mozart (for most critics) with his ever-smooth, elegant, galante manner and beautiful tonal coloration and equisite vibrato.  Like the lead reviewer properly stated in the review on Rachel Podger's release, any artist undertaking such works as these best study the greats that have gone before them.<br /><br />Out of these newer releases mentioned, the performance that seems to have heeded such advice is that of Hilary Hahn and Natalie Zu - whose readings exude \\"Mozart\\" the most clearly and approach the elegance and grace of the past legends.  As much as I greatly admire Podger and Manze in the Baroque repertoire, I have to say their take on Mozart did not captivate me.  However fans of theirs will likely find much to celebrate - and the fortepiano in those recordings certainly evokes the era of Amadeus.<br /><br />While the lead reviewer can point out a few weaknesses that mainly professionals will mostly care about, the average listener will probably be thoroughly delighted in the sprightly interaction and appealing performances of this duo.  Hahn is one of those performers who playing seems to eminate from her persona - that of a perfected, pure and angelic tone and line.  Her violin sounds quite delectable as does the overall sound.  Miss Hahn is always a treat to hear and her fans should adore these readings.  Overall, I think she finds the right approach here and gives a winning perfomance.  Mozart's music was a lot about perfection and poise (ie: classicism) and less about rubato and exentuation, and Hahn plays to that standard.  Perhaps she could \\"loosen the reigns\\" somewhat at times and alter her shaping of the music, but with such gorgeous playing as hers, such criticism can quickly become irrelevant.<br /><br />As Mozart often viewed these works more as \\"piano sonatas with violin accompanyment,\\" it really should be the pianist more fronted in the billing.  Equally a star in this CD is Natalie Zhu who brings great dexterity and a perky legato to the music and should be more noted.  While I like the sound of the fortepiano can invoke images of Mozart himself, I have to admit I much prefer the modern grand Zhu plays here for its greater depth, richer timbre and wider range of expression.  And there is a effortless, seamless partnership between these two musician-friends that is marvelous.  So, altogether, this CD is a fine, fresh sampling of Mozart's many violin sonatas and worthy of addition to even a large Mozart collection.  I never get tired of these pieces or performance.  Uchida's CD is also gorgeous with slightly slower tempos and a very different, more \\"romantic\\" violin expression from Mark Steinberg with beautiful sound quality.  Get both if you can.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|I saw the trailer for this movie around haloween and while watching I was trying to figure out who in the holy of holies would want to make this movie? When one of the most brilliant film makers name came up at the very end I scratched every previous thought and wanted to see it immeditly.<br /><br />'Hostel' is a fantastic film weather you want to beleive it or not. Even though there are moments that you really wish you didn't have to see the audience is given characters that are developed so perfectly in such a short amount of time that you actually have feelings for the good guys and want the bad guys to be punished. Beleive me you get nothing but a great movie with Hostel.<br /><br />I can understand why Quinten Tarentino chose to work on this movie. There is a very big Tarentino vibe throughout this movie. There is gore blended with quirky action and plenty of humor throughout. Don't even think about the grusome scenes from what I saw no one else in my theater did.

B0007M22TI|5.0|For some reason I kept missing the entire performance on PBS; seeing bits here and there.  So I did the next best thing: I was fortunate to see Celtic Woman live on stage in Richmond, Va.  All of the performers from the DVD recording were present sans M?av N? Mhaolchatha who was off for maternity leave.  In her place was Deirdre Shannon (Gilsenan) , who played \\"The Godess Erin\\" in Michael Flatley's 'Lord of the Dance'.<br /><br />I can testify to all that this live DVD recording is equal to the mesmerizing live performance I saw in October 2005.  As Enya herself had difficulty singing \\"May It Be\\" live, Lisa Kelly proved she was aptley able as were all the young ladies.<br /><br />The bonus interviews of the principals including David Downes displays the individual qualities of each performer.

B00005JOFO|1.0|Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain is a new film in theatres (1 month old?) about a gay romance and is getting some pretty high reviews.<br /><br />this film is outrageously bad. even though the gay lisping and limp-wristed stereotype is actually found no where in this film, there are plenty of other overplayed incorrect gay stereotypes available and then some more! the most devastating feature of this film is that it basically says, \\"all gay relationships are tragic and impossible.\\" the second part i found really gross is the reinforcement of \\"how unsafe it is to be gay in this world\\" in other words, that people kill fags and if you are a fag, you can be killed to, just for this reason. this is outrageous to put in a film that gay people are supporting. while this deals with a very small percentage of what gay people are going through, this is totally coloring within the lines of all gay literature (tragic death impossible circumstances, terrible endings) to actually undermine the gay community. this film is neither ground-breaking nor inspiring and the marketed plot to advertise this as a gay film is a poison pill experience. this film basically reinforces self-loathing programs for being gay.<br /><br />other issues of the film are it's length in general. i felt the show could have been capsized and completed tastefully in 15 minutes, but ang lee decided somewhere around 2 hrs 30 mins is better. the misperceptions emanated towards the straight audience of gay people and gay people of themselves is absolutely wrong. All gay relationships don't happen because women are not available and all gay relationships do not include or begin from alcohol and other drugs.<br /><br />there are really countless other incidences of debate here but this film just pisses me off.<br /><br />-chad chavers
B00008J4P5|5.0|Simply an unbelievably good, timeless rock CD. A crashing, rollicking, powerful, complex, stylish, noisy, innovative, minimalistic, catchy, brilliant, loud, theatrical, multi-levelled and supremely artistic record that is simply one of the very, very best albums of our new century. <br /> <br />A garage-art tour de force.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|The foos brand of alt-pop starts to sound a little bit recycled on the \\"heavy\\" album, with songs like \\"The deepest blues are back\\" sounds exactly like their early \\"Floaty\\" (a better alternitive) and \\"The last song\\" might as well be \\"Wind Up\\" mixed with \\"Hey! Johnny Park\\" (both also better alternitives.) The best songs on the heavy disc are \\"DOA\\" and the title track.<br /><br />However The acoustic disk is a completely different story, almost every track on here is fantastic, in the vain of \\"Marigold\\" ( a nirvana b-side on which Dave Grohl first sang ) Each song is a beatiful ballad and probably not great for fans of songs like \\"Stacked Actors\\" or their debut album. The only low points on the acoustic album is the boring razor and friend of a friend (a song about Kurt Cobain.) both dissapointing efforts compared to the brilliance of songs like \\"Another Round\\". The songs are a vehicle for various guest artists such as John Paul Jones, Norah jones and Drummer Taylor Hawkins steps up to the mike for \\"cold day in the sun\\" which isn't a bad effort, but he's no dave grohl.

B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback have been regarded as \\"posers\\", who only make music for the money. They've been criticized of not making \\"good\\" music and of not being innovative. However, I have to disagree with these views. Let's be real for a minute, and realize that most artists, nowadays, make music for the benefits. Now, I am not saying that the creativity and uniqueness has been lost, nonetheless, I am implying that music, for the most part, is done for the \\"mainstream\\" popularity.  <br />Silver Side Up possesses some very memorable tracks. In my opinion, people need to look beyond \\"How You Remind Me.\\" Is it a great song, of course; has it been overplayed, without a doubt, but we need to become aware that other gems lie inside this production. Songs like Woke Up This Morning, Too Bad, Just For and Where Do I Hide are outstanding in their own unique way. My favorite is Good Times Gone, which has this gloomy-ish sound to it. I advise anyone, who's into the likes of Creed, Staind and Lifehouse, to buy SSU.

B0000028M7|4.0|The first thing that drew me into this album was the virtuoso of guitarist Jerry Cantrell whose style is reminiscent of the greats in heavy (not hairband) metal, like Page and Hammett.  The other factor driving me to become an AIC fan was Staley's voice.  On this album in particular his high register makes the pounding metal rythmn more melodic (check out the chorus in \\"junkhead\\" homes).  This album is a good choice for all those metal fans who like a powerful frontman with a high register, like Plant or Rose.  \\"Dirt\\" also gets props for an innovative sound.  For example, \\"hate to feel\\" is a hyper-blues piece that shows Cantrell's superb imagination by putting much life back into cliched blues riffs.         The only problem with \\"dirt\\" is that the lyrics are extremely depressing, particularly the title track, making it hard to listen to all the way through, but whenever you need a kick in the pants listen to the first two tracks.  If that don't raise your pulse, you must be dead.

B00005JNTX|5.0|I rarely watch movies anymore because they all seem so repeatative but Sin City is different. The storylines that weave in and out of each other are fantastic although the dialogue is wooden at times (although I think that this is intentional.) Its strange how disturbing most of the plot lines are and yet, I was not disturbed by the movie in general.  The violence and sex are not for the faint of heart (keep the kids out!)  Overall, one of the most unique movies to come out in decades.
0307276902|3.0|I thought that this book was alright.  Even though most people feel it is a work of fiction, it is still a good book.  It tells a good story of overcoming ones demons and proving your self worth and overcoming addictions.  I also thought that his writing style was very poor.  At times, Frey didn't use correct punctuation and I never once saw a quotation mark.  This made reading a little confusing, especially at times where there were long conversations.  I also thought that the repetition of words was unneeded.  I only need to read the word once and then I get it.  I don't need it repeated for me.  Overall, I give the book three stars.
B00005JOQ9|4.0|I'll mention right off the bat that serious horror aficionados aren't likely to be terribly impressed by the gore and sadism of 'Hostel'. They shouldn't need to be told this-- Major release films are rarely ever particularly remarkable in these areas.  Certainly, it's well above average, but don't listen to the hype, and then go see it and complain that it doesn't live up to it.  (Honestly, 'Hostel' is decidedly less intense than 'Wolf Creek', though it certainly has more out and out gore)  Frankly, this still feels like a modern, mainstream horror film, just one that a bit more extreme than most of the competition.  Still, gutlessness is the major problem of mainstream horror, so the added intensity goes a long ways.<br /><br />'Hostel' opens by following the hedonistic adventures of three young guys in eastern Europe, two Americans and one from Iceland.  Like many others, I don't find these characters particularly appealing, though they are likable enough that I found myself rooting for them rather than the killers, so I guess they aren't all bad.  They're primarily interested in sex, and get a lead on a rather inexplicably fancy hostel in Slovakia which is even more inexplicably filled with countless, uhh, loose, attractive women.  Yes, this movie does have a ton of nudity in it, though it isn't all quite as gratuitous as some would have you believe.  (Mild Spoiler:  This is because the hostel itself is a trap, and the women are the bait. Admittedly, this is a fairly convenient excuse to have a lot of naked women, but it *is* a reason, which is more than you can say for the nudity in most films.)  Some have accused 'Hostel' of being misogynist, what with the women pretty much only existing to be ogled.  This displays peculiar logic, as it supposes that if one finds a women sexually attractive, that means you hate her.  The term that ought to be used is sexist, and while I don't know if I entirely agree, there is a case to be made.  However, I must note that the men in this film exist only to kill & torture or to be tortured & killed. (There is relatively little violence against women, emphasis on `relatively'.)  In short, we are only interested in their bodies, regardless of whether or not they're male or female, and in this regard I think the film is really quite fair.  Perhaps this makes it misanthropic, or maybe it's just a damn horror movie and all you social critics will need to accept the fact that they aren't gonna cause the downfall of western civilization.<br /><br />The film looks very good for costing under 5 mil, and is fairly stylishly shot. The European setting is a nice change from your more stereotypical horror movie settings. The music, however, is occasionally rather overwrought, but this doesn't ever hurt it too much.  The acting is competent, though this doesn't matter too much as all the characters are very shallow and simplistic.  They do sell the pain of the torture scenes pretty well, however, which is important.  That kinda thing doesn't disturb you if you don't buy the victim's performance.<br /><br />The movie does take a while to get going, but most horror films do, ya know.  It turns out that there are some who've found that garden variety hedonism is no longer thrilling enough, and that violence is the answer, leading to an underground industry in torture and murder in Slovakia.  Naturally, Paxton, Oli and Josh fall victim to this murder for money business.  `Hostel' is hurt by the fact that the most gruesome, intense scenes are towards the middle of the film, rather than the end.  In fact, the first real full horror scene is the nastiest one, as the victim is assailed with a power drill, has his achilles tendons sliced and is generally tormented by the killer.  The scene actually leaves a fair bit to the imagination, but is still one of the most brutal scenes you'll see in a major release horror film.  Roth is fairly committed to grossing us out, going beyond traditional gore to include that most unpleasant of substances, vomit. (At one point a character vomits while he has a ball-gag in his mouth.  That would be exceedingly unpleasant.)  It remains fairly intense for a while, and Roth actually comes up with a relatively clever way for our final protagonist to escape the torture chamber, but after this things drop off a bit.  Roth includes a bit too much humor and some of the gore is wacky enough that it lacks the real visceral intensity of earlier scenes, (see the eye scene) plus there's just some weird, inexplicable stuff that totally doesn't work.  (Particularly the murderous gang of 9 year olds.  What the hell?)  It just generally becomes a bit too conventional, with Paxton just sneaking around the torture compound, and it utilizes that most tired of conventions, the old scenario where a character pretends to be dead and must hide in a pile of corpses and limbs.  It's always pretty good, however, and it does close with one of the more intense scenes of the film.  It still can't match the earlier stuff, but it hits pretty hard after the less visceral section.<br /><br />Recently we've seen a few more gruesome, intense horror films pop up in theaters.  I don't think this is as good as `High Tension' or `Wolf Creek', but it's a solid effort and deserves to be mentioned alongside such films.ost unpleasant of substances, vomit.

B00005QDW5|5.0|What more can I say, it's Floyd, their best songs all collaborated into two albums. I still find it interesting how they bled Barrett contributions into this set, they did it beautifully. If you like Floyd, get this one.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The Strokes lead rock and roll in a new direction. Following on from their first two albums, \\"First impressions of earth\\" again brings completely fresh sounds to the table. For their third release, the band has adopted what sounds like a new age space themed approach, going beyond limitations to combine sci-fi sound track music with alternative rock.<br /><br />The musical composition remains The Strokes biggest strength, however the vocals of Julian Casablancas let the band down big time. His voice has never been the most exuberating, but you could put up with it. Unfortunately by the end of this album you'd hear better listening to a drunken parrot. The band even play over top of him on several songs.  Thankfully Albert Hammond Jr and Nick Valensi's guitar work more than makes up for it.<br /><br />It's a solid performance, and where several bands have failed recently The Strokes continue to excel. To say this is better or worse than their other work is unfair. Wait and listen to what music becomes popular over the next few months, then judge the The Strokes by the influence they have on the progression of alternative rock music.
B000002U82|5.0|This album still stands out to be one of my favorites. This album is when Pink Floyd really gelled, and got their true sound indeed, and perhaps should have been their last since their heads decided to colide with one another, who's better than who, who cares!!! Money, On the Run, Great Gig, you put it together yourself, fantastic, if you haven't heard these, you've been living under a rock for many years and don't know the light of day. If you like Floyd, get this one,it's a keeper, but beware you'll probally have to get it again, due to playing it to death. And if you like this album I would recomend getting Obscured By Clouds, and Meddle.
B00006RCNW|4.0|Since I've never been a cop, I can't really vouch for how realistic its portrayal of urban police work is, but there's no denying that the first season of The Shield makes for some mighty compelling drama.  The Shield was a target for controversy from the very beginning, drawing all kinds of free publicity from TV journalists fascinated by the fact that the show contained such words as \\"s--t\\" and \\"balls,\\" but those willing to look deeper were greeted with a fierce, intelligent drama that upped the ante on decades of TV cop fare.  Granted, The Shield was hardly the first police drama on TV, nor was it the first to reflect a more modern sensibility on the part of its creators--both Homicide: Life on the Street (which I watched) and NYPD Blue (which I didn't) were known for their gritty, realistic depictions of police work and occasional use of naughty words.  That said, if you thought five years ago that there was nothing left for a cop drama to say, you would've been wrong: whatever the first season of The Shield lacked in originality it more than made up for in complexity and sheer intensity.  This first season barrels through thirteen episodes at lightning speed, throwing so much at you that it's virtually impossible to get bored.  Below all the action and cliffhanger finales, though, The Shield manages to overcome cop-show cliches and make itself a worthy watch because its writers blend intricate plotting with multi-dimensional characterizations and a healthy dose of moral ambiguity.  Much as FX's other great dramas, Rescue Me and Over There, de-romanticize the lives of firefighters and soldiers, respectively, The Shield presents a portrait of cops as deeply compromised people trying to do a tough job under incredibly trying circumstances.<br /><br />Naturally, no characters on the show are more clearly compromised than the always-compelling Vic Mackey and his Strike Team, who are almost impossible not to watch as they steal, beat, make deals with drug pushers, and generally abuse their power.  At first I thought the creators of the show were daring viewers not to like Mackey, but then I came to a more counterintuitive conclusion: Shawn Ryan and co. are daring us to *like* Mackey, to approve of his methods and the results they produce in spite of his blatant corruption and disrespect for procedure.  All this intentional ambiguity surrounding Mackey and his men actually goes to what I think is the other main thrust of the show, namely that moral rectitude and effectiveness as a police officer may not go hand in hand.  The show may take place in the fictional Farmington district of LA, but its setting could be a stand-in for pretty much any inner city where racial division and fears of crime run rampant (or, to put it another way, pretty much any inner city).  When they're presented against this context, it's easy to view cops like Mackey as a necessary evil at worst.<br /><br />Anyway, while Mackey and his behavior seemed to get The Shield a disproportionate amount of its considerable press, it's still hard not to notice what how many great characters there are overall here.  For all of Michael Chiklis's sound and fury as Mackey, my favorite this first season was actually Det. Holland \\"Dutch\\" Waggenbach, played in career-making fashion by Jay Karnes.  Dutch is the quintessential misfit (especially in a police station), the socially awkward guy who can't take a joke and internalizes everything, and winds up getting perceived as a glory hog because he just wants to be respected for his own abilities.  I have no idea why, but some small part of me can relate to a shy, overanalytical type who wants to be liked but who doesn't fit in well with his peers.  Benito Martinez is probably the most memorable after that as Captain Acevada, who in his own way is just as morally gray as Mackey, at times almost to the point of being amoral.  Much as Dutch typifies the well-intentioned misfit, Acevada typifies the ambitious social climber, the guy you can't really trust because he almost always has a self-interested ulterior motive, namely pacifying the Hispanic lobby and advancing his own political career.<br /><br />Like with so many other of the best shows on TV these days, The Shield is able to pull off its nuanced characterizations so well because its writers prove to be experts at developing them over time, as well as balancing single-episode plots with longer, more complex arcs that extend over several episodes.  Without giving away too much, there are numerous key strands that hold the season together even as smaller plots come and go: Vic's struggles to keep a lid on his collaboration with a local drug dealer; Dutch's search for a serial killer; Assistant Chief Gilroy's various perfidies; Aceveda's political maneuverings; and of course Julien Lowe's struggles with being a gay black religious rookie cop, which are handled a lot more delicately than you might expect from such a show.  The last few episodes are especially addictive, moving at even-faster-than-usual speed and expertly ratcheting up dramatic tension as they bring a bunch of plots to a head until I JUST COULDN'T STOP WATCHING!!!!!!!!!!  DAMN YOU CREATORS OF THE SHIELD WHY DO YOU MAKE YOUR SHOW SO DIFFICULT TO STOP WATCHING!!!!<br /><br />Oh, sorry, don't know what got into me there.  Guess that's just what watching The Shield does to me.  Well, now that I've calmed down, I guess I'll just state dryly that I consider The Shield to be about as addictive as heroin, and easily one of the best new TV shows I've picked up in the past five years.  Yeah, that sounds about right.er, the guy you can't really trust because he almost always has a self-interested ulterior motive, namely pacifying the Hispanic lobby and advancing his own political career. <br /> <br />Like with so many other of the best shows on TV these days, The Shield is able to pull off its nuanced characterizations so well because its writers prove to be experts at developing them over time, as well as balancing single-episode plots with longer, more complex arcs that extend over several episodes.

B000002U8G|5.0|Typical Floyd fans know this. This album is where it began, their true sound indeed. You can here bits and pieces of all their later albums on this one. Starting with One Of These Days, to Fearless, all the way to Echoes the longest and my favorite on this album, just sound good all the way through, very moving to me. A MUST album for Floyd fans who like their later stuff.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave review    I'm not going to lie; I had this one my list of worst of 2005 around October or so. But something happened. I feel hypocritical about saying what I am about to say since I have seen the band live twice, but bear with me.     At first, I was expecting it to be identical to the self-titled debut, which was a mistake. If you go into this album thinking that you will indeed be let down.     My first listen I was bored. I kind of liked the single (which I compare to Like A Stone, which I can no longer stand) and then there was Your Time Has Come, which is very energetic. Then it happened, I had that ah ha moment that the drunks have.     I was watching VH1, which I normally don't do, since I am past that whole MTV thing. But I saw the video for \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" and I was blown away. That is a piece of moving after that makes a major political statement without even trying. Instantly I loved that song, so this required me to listen to the album as a whole again. And surprise, I liked this whole album.     You got to give it to Audioslave, this bad should not have worked. Two separate labels and management, being a super group and the two previous bands having very distinct fans and sounds, and yet they still made it. I also have a tremendous amount of respect for the band traveling to Cuba, not only did that take guts, but that is so f@ckin' rock n' roll to travel to a country that the USA has hated for years. Rock on dudes. Can't wait for album #3 this year.     And on a final note, go to iTunes and download the video for \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" and you will not be disappointed. If you are, then feel free to bash me and send me hate mail.
B000002KGT|4.0|This is a fantastic album, and it shows in quality. Problem with that, tooooooooooo much radio play made this gem a COMMERCIAL sucess, I would rather hear Dreams every now and then instead of every day, if you know what I mean. Highlights for me on this album, You Make Loving Fun, love the keyboard, guitar, bass, hell the whole band on this number, best song on this album. Always thought Nicks was overrated, always liked McVie better, but what do I know. Anyways well worth getting, just too bad it gets played too much.
B0000AMJED|1.0|I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT.  (...)
B0000029AL|4.0|I must say, I don't partically like Aerosmith that much, but I must say their debut album is what made them, and also must say, I like this album. I think I was about 3 years old when I was bobbing to Dream On in 1976, of course 3 years after the album came out, at my grandmother's house. That song still goes on without a doubt as their best song ever made. Next would be Mama Kin, awsome. Aerosmith definitely at best before commercialism and rap got to any of their later stuff. the only album worth buying of theirs.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. IT'S BRILLIANCE AND SIMPLICITY COMBINED WITH INCREDIBLE ACTING AND DRAMA MAKE IT THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME. WHO CARES ABOUT EXTRAS? THE MOVIE STANDS ON IT'S OWN.
B000006TRV|3.0|First off, I love Floyd, but I feel as though Dark Side should have been their last, after that it was mostly egos running wild. This album does have the highlights, but I feel this is the most commercial Pink Floyd album out there. Another Brick In The Wall gets too much airplay, to make even more complaints, it gets played just about every day. Young Lust is alright. Is Anybody Out There has got to be my highlight on this album, love the acoustic guitar on this gig. But like I said, too much airplay, Pink Floyd should have stayed a little more in the underground.
0060934913|4.0|Yes, if  you're the chef, you'll want to know which hospital has the fastest emergency room next time one of your line cooks sticks a knife through his hand.  \\"Get it stitched up and get back here in two hours!\\"<br /><br />Anthony Bourdain chronicles his history in the restaurant world from a dishwasher to the executive chef to one New York's popular bistros.  Along the way we are treated to the tales of the steaming hot, pressure cooker that is the restaurant kitchen in action.<br /><br />Having dated a restaurant owner, I'm inclined to believe the major part of Mr. Bourdain's stories.  They are vastly entertaining and he doesn't spare himself when disclosing culinary indiscretions.  The drinking, the drugs the bad language, it's all in here.<br /><br />Strangely enough, it is a love story.  Bourdain clearly loves food and cooking and this comes across in this bawdy tale of boisterous bad behavior on the culinary front.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Yeah, you hear how Trower's guitar playing is identical to Hendrix, well all I have to say to those people is get over it!!!! Trower is awsome and it shows it here on this album, and on the rest of his catalog. In This Place is still as trippy as the day it was recorded, Bridge of Sighs, brilliant. Lady Love, gorgeous. Go out and get this album, it's timeless, just like Jimi is too. Trower ROCK ON!!!!!
B000002HMH|2.0|Um, this album WAS a sell-out.  That's like trying to argue Saddam Hussein is not guilty.  It's sell-out, face it.  Is it thrash?  No.  It's sell-out.  It's alternative with a bit of a metal edge made by a bunch of Gucci-wearing, (...).  Let's call it for what it is.    Why the 2 stars?  I figured they deserved something for being better than the other mainstream bands, such as Taproot, Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Creed, Nickelback, Linkin Park, etc. etc. etc.  These guys may be sell-outs but they still play better stuff than all those other bands and they can still play live shows well.     (...)But please, people, this is sell-out since it isn't thrash and Metallica made it to get more radio play.  Shame on them.  This band died with Cliff.
B000089RV6|4.0|The only Brian Johnson AC/DC I truly like, cause there are two different kind of AC/DC fans Bon Scott, or Brian Johnson, I'm A Bon man. Anyways good album to fill in the empty space of sudden death of Bon Scott. Very powerful, Hells Bells, creative title track obliously. Overall good album, my highlight Have a Drink On Me, classic at very best.
B00005JOIF|5.0|At the 1972 Olympics in Munich, the terrorist group Black September kidnapped and murdered some Israeli atheletes.  This is the story of Isreal's response to this horrific event.  Avner (Bana) is chosen to lead a five-man team of ex-Mossad agents that are to track down and assassinate the 11 Palestinians responsible for the attack.  They are working unofficially for the government, through their handler, Ephraim (Rush), who provides them money and information.  For Avner, this is patriotism, and a chance to serve his country. <br /> <br />The team travels the world locating and eliminating their targets.  He becomes focused and begins to lose himself with each passing murder.  Also, the hunters become the hunted, and soon they are guarding their own lives as well as trying to finish the job.  Plus, Black September begins retaliating, forcing Avner to question their actions and if those actions are actually making things better or worse. <br /> <br />\\"Munich\\" is an excellent movie, showing a story that is very relevant today.  It is thought provoking and engaging.  Eric Bana is amazing as the conscience-tortured Avner who just wants to do the right thing.  His team (especially the new James Bond, Daniel Craig) are all excellent in their roles.  The story is fast paced, and full of action.  Director Stephen Speilberg has crafted another masterpiece.  \\"Munich\\" is an important film that I highly recommend be seen by all.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|Good debut from these guys from across the pond. The guitar really does the singing here as it does on all their albums. And very expressive with classics like Down To The Waterline, Water Of Love, love the guitar work on that one, incredible. And of course Sultan of Swing, timeless classic about a band I think Mark Knopfler saw and thought they sucked, either way still fantastic, and good quality on CD. Go out and get you a copy, it will be worth it.
0316168815|5.0|Susie Salmon was only 14 years old when she was brutally raped and murdered by her neighbor.  With only her elbow left behind, her family never truly knows what happened to her, or who was responsible.  Through Susie's eyes in heaven, you are able to see how this tragic event dissolves, and at the same time evolves, her family.  Her father's life is consumed with the task of finding Susie's murderer.  In an effort to suppress her overwhelming grief, Susie's mother embarks in a short-lived affair with a detective, ending with her leaving her family and opting for life in California.  Lindsey, just a year younger than Susie, toughens her exterior to deal with the rumors at school, but opens up her heart to the boy she loves.  Susie's four year old brother, Buckley, is forced to deal with his disengaged family members, while trying to grasp the concept that his sister is never coming back. <br /> <br />What really makes the Lovely Bones an exquisite book is the emotions it evokes inside its readers.  Even while dealing with a tragic event, in both the murder and the grieving family, Alice Sebold is able to leave readers emotionally invigorated, instead of emotionally drained.  It is immensely satisfying to watch Susie's brother and sister evolve into great people.  They allow Susie's death and the grief they feel to be a part of their lives, but do not allow it to consume their lives, as their parents do.  They are able to continue on in life, and end up being the ones to comfort their parents, even years later.   <br /> <br />Built out of grief, the end result is a story of hope and memories.  Recommended for high schoolers and up.
B00000255F|2.0|Never was a big Springsteen fan, never will be. He can't sing, his music is boring. I shouldn't say all though I do like Thunderoad, that's it though, still a snoozer to me. Sorry Bruce, no sympathy here, and don't see the big rave on the 30th aniversary edition.
B000BVD460|5.0|Even though it is unknown whether this is Eminem's final album, or he's just taking a long and needed vacation, this was definitely his best album. He has come a long way, and has matured as an artist during his rapping career. Marshall has definitely made his mark in the rap industry--he broke the sterotype that all rappers were black. He gained the respect of millions of people, and he really does deserve the success and fortune he's been blessed with. But, like the saying goes \\"Money can't make you completely happy,\\" so I do understand why he's stepping down to spend more time with his family. I wish him the best, and hope things work out for him.
B000002KKS|4.0|The fist time I was listening to this album, I was a little misfit in 8th grade and it still sound good today. My only complaint is... this album does not get any airplay, at all.... period. My other is the first four song are the best and after that it's o.k. and that's why it only gets four stars. The music is very powerful, and would have made a good e.p. Neon Knights, kicks, Children if the Sea, excellent, probally my favorite on this album, love the guitar work on it. Lady Evil, good, and last but not least the title track, timeless. But still the first four songs are my favorite, the rest you can do whatever with the rest of them. I do feel Ronnie did fill in the gap on this album and did a good job at that before going solo. Ozzy, you still were missed at this point in the group.
0767847431|4.0|This movie is the second of three Sinbad movies featuring the special effects of Ray Harryhausen.  The first movie was 1958's \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.\\"  The third movie is \\"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger,\\" from 1977.  Of the three movies, this one is probably the best.  Even with the current state of digital special effects the stop-motion miniatures of Dynarama are incredible.  It is amazing to see the kind of magic that special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen was able to wrest from his miniatures.  As with all Harryhausen miniatures, I was unable to see the wires he used anywhere.  According to one of the extra features, each wire was painstakingly painted to match the background, which means that wires had to be painted for each shot.  Wow.<br /><br />In this movie Sinbad (John Phillip Law) encounters a homunculus carrying a golden tablet.  Soon Sinbad is seeing all sorts of interesting visions, including a beautiful slave girl and a strange looking man who turns out to be an evil wizard.  Incidentally, the homunculus and the golden tablet are the property of the evil wizard, and he wants them back, so he creates a storm that drives Sinbad and his men ashore.  Once ashore, Sinbad encounters Koura (Tom Baker, who would be the fourth Dr. Who the same year this film was released), an evil magician.  Sinbad escapes to a nearby city where he meets with a disfigured Vizier.  Soon Sinbad figures out that the golden tablet is part of a map leading to all sorts of riches, which causes Sinbad, the Vizier, and Sinbad's men to go seeking the goodies, ostensibly to keep evil Koura from getting them.<br /><br />Before Sinbad and company head out, Sinbad encounters a beautiful slave girl that, surprise, looks just like his vision.  Through a fortuitous circumstance the slave girl is able to join Sinbad and his men on their quest.<br /><br />The whole gang, with Koura traveling separately, travel to the mythical island of Lemuria where they encounter a group of natives protecting a shrine.  Sinbad is ready to do battle with Koura, but Koura brings to life a statue of six-armed Kali, which also turns out to be the best Harryhausen effect in this movie.<br /><br />After the encounter with Kali, the natives see that Margiana (Caroline Munro, who has been in a number of movies, including both Dr. Phibes movies and Bond film \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\"), the former slave girl, has a symbol on her hand that is also the symbol of another of their gods, a one-eyed centaur.  The natives stake Margiana out for the centaur, which carries her into its lair.<br /><br />Sinbad and his companions escape the natives and follow the centaur.  By coincidence, Koura and the centaur are in proximity, as is the fables Fountain of Destiny.  Koura has the three golden tablets (obtained earlier in the movie by various nefarious means), which will provide youth, a cloak of darkness and a crown of untold wealth.  By the time Sinbad catches up, Koura is already young.  Soon Koura acquires the cloak of darkness and becomes mostly invisible.<br /><br />In the exciting conclusion, involving more Harryhausen special effects, a gryphon fights the centaur as part of the eternal battle of good vs. evil that includes evil wizard Koura and Sinbad.<br /><br />This movie is superior to \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.\\"  The acting is better, the story is better and the special effects are more numerous and better.  I think both movies are valuable for those looking for quality fantasy, movies with Ray Harryhausen special effects, or Sinbad movies.  Or you could just get these movies because they are fun to watch.<br /><br />As a side note, Robert Shaw is uncredited in the role of the floating Oracle of All Knowledge.  Shaw was a star of renown, and would soon be Captain Quint in the movie \\"Jaws,\\" released the year following the release of this film.rotecting a shrine.

B000059T00|4.0|Good collaboration of Winwood, Clapton, and Baker. Now I wouldn't call them a supergroup, close. A super album, maybe. Can't Find My Way Home, probally stand out the most on this album, good acoustic on this track. Sea of Joy, good song. Had to Cry Today, pretty good but a little too long of a song of 8 min. should have been three or four. Anyways, if you like Traffic, and if you like Clapton, get this album, it's good for you.
0307276902|1.0|A MILLION LITTLE LIES<br /><br />Oprah Winfrey's been had.<br /><br />Three months ago, in what the talk show host termed a \\"radical departure,\\" Winfrey announced that \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" author James Frey's nonfiction memoir of his vomit-caked years as an alcoholic, drug addict, and criminal, was her latest selection for the world's most powerful book club.<br /><br />In an October 26 show entitled \\"The Man Who Kept Oprah Awake At Night,\\" Winfrey hailed Frey's graphic and coarse book as \\"like nothing you've ever read before. Everybody at Harpo is reading it. When we were staying up late at night reading it, we'd come in the next morning saying, 'What page are you on?'\\" In emotional filmed testimonials, employees of Winfrey's Harpo Productions lauded the book as revelatory, with some choking back tears. When the camera then returned to a damp-eyed Winfrey, she said, \\"I'm crying 'cause these are all my Harpo family so, and we all loved the book so much.\\"<br /><br />But a six-week investigation by The Smoking Gun reveals that there may be a lot less to love about Frey's runaway hit, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies and, thanks to Winfrey, has sat atop The New York Times nonfiction paperback best seller list for the past 15 weeks. Next to the latest Harry Potter title, Nielsen BookScan reported Friday, Frey's book sold more copies in the U.S. in 2005--1.77 million--than any other title, with the majority of that total coming after Winfrey's selection.<br /><br />Police reports, court records, interviews with law enforcement personnel, and other sources have put the lie to many key sections of Frey's book. The 36-year-old author, these documents and interviews show, wholly fabricated or wildly embellished details of his purported criminal career, jail terms, and status as an outlaw \\"wanted in three states.\\"<br /><br />The investigation continues at:<br /><br />[...]
0812550706|4.0|This was a gripping book.  The character development of Ender is very good, although he lost some of my sympathy toward the end of the book.  The author probably intended this, but I did not like it.  I thought the Peter/Valentine subplot was rather farfetched, even when compared to already fantastical main plot.  Overall, a very entertaining book that flows well (although the very end seems rushed and not quite as fulfilling as it is perhaps meant to be).

014028009X|3.0|Bridget Jones's Diary is lots of fun: I listened to it on tape (read by Barbara Rosenblat) and it regularly led me to laugh out loud. Bridget gives us a moment-to-moment account of her life, as she works and plays and dates. <br /> <br />Fielding (the author) takes experiences that are eminently relevant to different eras in my own life (and that of many others, I know) and magnifies them: the disastrously late (and generally disastrous) dinner-party preparations, the contrast between Bridget's excitement about planning vacations and her boyfriend's utter lack of interest, and - most centrally - the worries of finding romance for a single adult. When Fielding focuses on these kinds of relevant experiences, the book is at its best. <br /> <br />Occasionally, I tired of the constant diary-style accounting: June 3, 8am. Cigarettes: 5. Alcohol units: 3. June 5, 9am. Cigarettes... And sometimes the book just felt long. But so much of the book felt relevant and very funny that I forgave the shortcomings.  <br /> <br />For those who care about this sort of thing, the book has lots of strong language, and it also has lots of sex. The sex is not explicit, and it's mostly played for humor, but it's ever present.
0385508417|4.0|Skipping Christmas by John Grisham is a hilarious book that is fun to read anytime of the year.  Grisham captures the chaos and spirit of Christmas through an over worked hen pecked accountant, Luther Krank.  Luther and Nora Krank decide that since their daughter, Blair, is in South America working with the Peace Corp they would skip the Christmas hassle and go on a cruise.  This decision causes quite an uproar on Hemlock Street. The Krank's nosey neighbors are flabbergasted that anyone would decide such a thing, especially since Hemlock Street wins the best decorated street every year and all the houses on Hemlock are decorated perfectly and consist of rooftop Frosty's.  The Krank's will not be hosting their annual Christmas Eve party; they won't even get a tree!  This news spreads like wild fire throughout Hemlock and avoiding Christmas will not be half as easy as Nora and Luther anticipated.<br /><br /> In preparation for their cruise Luther and Nora go on diets, hit the tanning beds, buy swimsuits and make other yuppie preparations before embarking the Princess Island Cruise.  After making the arrangements, and costing Hemlock the award for best decorated street, the Krank's are set to leave for their cruise on Christmas day.  However, on Christmas Eve they receive a phone call from Blair saying that she is coming for Christmas and bringing her fianc&eacute;e!  The cruise is immediately cancelled by Nora. Luther and Nora are in a tizzy trying to prepare for their annual Christmas Eve party.  They have to put the massive forty pound Frosty on the roof, find a tree, put together all the food, clean the house, and get people to come to their party before having to pick up Blair and her fianc&eacute;e at the airport!<br /><br /> When Luther and Nora invite guests no one is able to attend and the last thing Luther wants to do is beg for mercy from his nosey neighbors.  In the end, however, the neighbors find out that Blair is coming home and the entire street of Hemlock pitches in to help the Krank's before Blair and her fianc&eacute;e arrive.  The Krank's Christmas Eve bash turns out to be a success thanks to the help of Hemlock, and Blair does not suspect a thing.  Nora and Luther love Blair's new fianc&eacute;e and in the end the spirit of Christmas conquers all.  Luther ends up giving the cruise tickets to his neighbors, Mr. Scheel and his wife who is dying of cancer.  Aside from the hilarity of this book the end is very touching.  It is an easy read and I highly recommend it (434).elp the Krank's before Blair and her fiance arrive.

B00005JOII|3.0|Because of Woody Allen's success with \\"Match Point\\" at the Cannes Film Festival, I had high hopes of Allen returning to his former glory. As it is though, \\"Match Point\\" creates a new category of Allen misstep: the quasi-thriller...deadly serious and deadly dull.<br /><br />Allen's serious films like \\"Interiors,\\" \\"Another Woman\\" and \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" to name a few are some of his best work. But \\"Match Point,\\" set in England and starring a gorgeous Scarlett Johansson as Nola and a strange, distant, demonic Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Chris is so over the top serious in a penny mellerdrammer way that I felt that, at several points in the movie, the cast would burst into laughter, turn to the audience and yell: the joke is on YOU!<br /><br />In a story very similar to Theodore Dreiser's \\"An American Tragedy,\\" made in the mid 50's as \\"A Place in the Sun,\\" Allen attempts to update the story of a poor but ambitious guy, Chris who lucks into an affair and marriage to a rich, devoted woman (Emily Mortimer as Chloe') but can't stay away from a poor, struggling actress Nola (Johansson). In the process, Allen somehow transforms the usually warm and glowing Johansson into a shrew. Adding insult to injury, at this point in her career, Johansson cannot rise to the challenges of this poorly written role and most of her scenes are painful to watch.<br /><br />\\"Match Point\\" is beautifully shot and the friction between the dyed in the wool New Yorker Allen's attitude and the Stiff Upper Lip very British Cast creates an interesting, even electric milieu. But in the end, \\"Match Point\\" suffers from a lack of commitment on Allen's part: he obviously cares about making movies but is there enough up on the screen in this film to make us care as well?

But you didn't have to stab him! Do you know what you've done? Do you know what you are----------\\" For a crime he didn't commit, Matt Freeman had to choose between jail, or to go live with a lady named Mrs. Deverill in a rural town called Lesser Malling. <br /> Anthony Horowitz, The New York Times best-selling author of Stormbreaker and Scorpia brings a great novel about Matt Freeman's time in Lesser Malling. People who are trying to help him are dying mysteriously, and he finds himself on a road that never gets him anywhere. It all comes down to Raven's Gate, an ancient system that is somehow able to destroy the world. Matt must fulfill his destiny as a gatekeeper. Or the world will be destroyed, and engulfed by evil. <br /> Raven's Gate adds to the list of great books that Anthony Horowitz has written. It is a great book of fantasy and adventure. This book is great for almost any age, boy or girl. Five out of five stars. Raven's Gate is the first book in the Gatekeepers series. Five children saved the world once, can five save it again? <br />

This book makes sense!  It does not over-analyze human behavior, it does not judge human behavior, it does not dictate what is right and wrong.  It does not criticize the beliefs of other religions, philisophies, cults and organizations.  It offers a simple, yet wonderful, positive way to live your life and to open your heart to those around you.  This book encouraged me to live a more productive, loving life and to better understand and relate to those around me.  Even people I do not know!!  I love this book! <br />Kudos! :o)
B00003CXDV|5.0|Our whole family enjoys this movie tremendously. The language can occasionally border on the coarse, and the Bad Guys can be intense. So, keep out of reach of the under-8 set. <br /> <br />Captures the essence of an alternate-universe Star Trek (original series); deals sensitively with the realpolitik of fan conventions, insufferable egos, and disillusioned acting careers. <br /> <br />The Thermians are quite funny. A well-done movie!
0385507755|1.0|This book is contrived and his ordeal is pure fiction as any low-level substance abuser will tell you. Proves my theory, Oprah is full of crap and was easily duped by this bs artist.

He can't talk the talk and anyone who has been through it or had a family member go through it can see right through this jackass.

0307276902|5.0|I saw James Frey on Oprah and became very curious about his story.  I recieved the book for Christmas and finish within a week, I just couldn't put it down.  Whether it's all completely true or not, I don't care.  Frey story was compelling and inspiring, and I don't think Oprah would have put him on the show if she thought his story was B.S..  It's amazing to find out what goes on in the mind of someone who would call themself \\"an alcoholic, an addict and a criminal.\\"  Most typical addicts would blame others for their problems but Frey doesn't and even makes up his own plan to become sober.  I do warn readers if you're looking for a \\"clean\\" and \\"happy\\" story, this isn't for you.  There is extreme language and the whole atmosphere is very sad.  There are some rather graphic scenes which really pulls you into the story.  Even if you don't believe his story, there are so many things throughout the book that are great and inspiring like when Frey quotes from the Tao te ching and his friend Leonard's story about \\"holding on\\".  It's become one of my top ten and I would recommend this book to anyone. <br />

B0009MAO46|1.0|I suppose I am going to be branded narrow-minded and out-of-touch, but I cannot help wondering which people are showing this movie and its sequel to their children without any reservations at all. I, for one, do NOT allow my children to use language like 'moron', 'loser', 'dirtbag' or 'idiot', which language is found in this movie by the truckload. I would certainly never allow my children to pretend that they were threatening to hang someone from a gallows, as the toys threaten to do to \\"Woody\\". I guess that when TV/DVDs have become, once again in this generation, the babysitter/parent, we can get fooled into thinking that such a 'nice' movie about some 'nice' toys can't be all bad. I guess the people who get sucked into buying the movie for their kids won't mind if their kids interact with one another using language and scenarios like these I mentioned. The minute I began to even suspect that the world of \\"Toy Story\\" and it's values were going to be reflected in my childrens' lives, I couldn't throw the blasted thing out fast enough, and if you want your kids to grow up a little different than the TV-bred cretins around them, you'll do the same.
0307276902|1.0|After 17 failed attempts to get this book published as fiction, James Frey switched gears and found a publisher to print it as a \\"true-story.\\" Unfortunately, the book is still mostly fiction ((...). Worse still, Frey uses his book to preach that AA's 12-Step process is not necessary for recovery -- if this hurts even one alcoholic or addict Frey should be arrested for criminal negligence.    This book is a sham, a hoax, and a lie.     On the bright side, he did make a fool of Oprah.
B00003CXCS|5.0|The Sound of Music, as far as I am concerned, is a most perfectly-written, acted, scored and crafted film of all time. It is a gem, a jewel, a diadem in the crown of musical cinema.<br /><br />This wonderful movie, beloved and familiar to so many, comes with a series of extra features that deepen one's appreciation for this excellent film. The making of TSOM is told through interviews with the film's stars, its director Robert Wise, and others intimate with the film's development. It was fun watching these Hollywood pros dance around the evident awfulness of the stage version of the movie; fascinating to see how Christopher Plummer brought humanity to the otherwise uni-dimensional role of Captain von Trapp; horrifying to imagine the misplacement of songs in the stage play (\\"Raindrops on Roses\\" sung by Mother Superior?) and heavenly to realize their perfect placement in the film. The very 1960s filmlet, starring Charmian Carr (Liesl) as a young ing&eacute;nue in Strausburg, was eye-rollingly innocent and a neat behind-the-scenes view of the filming.<br /><br />TSOM is cloyingly sweet and schmaltzy to some, and a deliriously joyful extravaganza to others. To those who love it for its spirit, for its exuberant and uplifting music or for its cinematic excellence, this DVD will provide many happy viewings.
0553381350|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books. I've read it four or five times (twice out loud to my wife.) The stories behind the public lives of the astronauts is fascinating and, as Wolfe tells it, hysterical. Fast-paced and funny.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I know, I know. This was the album of 2004 and here I am discovering it in 2006. Typical me. I prefer to be a little behind the curve, time weeds out the hot bands and leaves only the truly great albums in the popular memory. Like Arcade Fire's absolutely gorgeous Funeral.<br /><br />I've actually had the album for about a year now, but it never really got much play on my pod. It struck me as a little too generically indie sounding and I had only picked it up because they were a much hyped Montreal band (got to cheer on the home teams).<br /><br />It wasn't until I moved to London and heard the song \\"Wake Up\\" at the Roxy that I decided to give the Arcade Fire another chance. This album did not disappoint. Funeral manages to capture an amazing spectrum of sounds and instruments with masterful orchestration. Each song holds up on its own and as part of the whole, brilliant structure. And the always-changing vocals are often stunning.<br /><br />I suppose then that I am just confirming (for those few people more skeptical then myself) that this album is an enduring and even brilliant release which may come to be a modern classic. I just wished I'd jumped on this bandwagon back in 2004, when I was still living in Montreal...
B000002NHN|5.0|There are those rare occasions when an artist captures your heart, and gently coaxes feelings of uphoria, and Loreena McKinnet is one of those artists. I have had this album since 1999, and everytime I listen to it, I am brought back into the trance her voice, and haunting instrumental genius induces. I have had friends stop in their tracks, when they hear her....and ask, \\"who in the world is that??!!\\"....they too cannot believe that tranquil feeling that hits them. I am a hard core rock and roll freak, from Led Zepplin to Alice in Chains...but without a doubt \\"Book of Secrets\\" is my favorite album. It's the kind of album that when it's over, you feel like you are awakening from a wonderful, peaceful dream, and in it's absence are faced with dealing with reality and all it's jagged edges again.
B00079FUI6|1.0|The title of this review says it all.  Desperate Housewives cannot be compared in any way to Sex and the City.  Desperate Housewives has nothing valuable to discuss.

The pink elephant scene in Dumbo, the entire Fantasia and Alice, what were Walt and his buddies smoking? I know the acid heads loved to drop some and watch Fantasia.<br /><br />I can watch Snow White and Pinocchio over and over again, but this movie drives me insane. Maybe I'm too cerebral?<br /><br />The quality of the filmmaking is, of course, stellar and second to none.
B000066C6Z|3.0|Directed by Jim Abrahams and David Zucker, the directors of comedy classic \\"Airplane\\", \\"Top Secret!\\" follows in the same footsteps, with a similar brand of insane slap-stick comedy.  If you've seen \\"Airplane,\\" \\"Hot Shots\\" or \\"The Naked Gun\\", then you know what to expect.  \\"Top Secret!\\" is the kind of film that is not afraid to poke fun at itself, or the movie industry in general, and much like the other films mentioned, \\"Top Secret!\\" is filled to the brim with hilarious jabs at pop-culture.  From Pac Man to the Wizard of Oz, to a genius game of Tic-Tac-Toe (you'll see) \\"Top Secret!\\" is full of some truly classsic scenes.  It doesn't come to close to standing up to \\"Airplane\\", and it certainly is not as memorable, but it is one heck of a funny film.

There is an ongoing battle between the two sides throughout the book.  <br />       I loved the book and would give it four and a half stars out of five stars.  This is the second book in the Chronicles of Narnia series.  Which book you read first, doesn't matter.  I would recommend it to any fantasy readers, boys or girls.

1594200106|5.0|I desperately needed something different to read and I was intriqued by the idea of a Library of Forgotten Books. What a great idea! Tired of action adventure books, political and other nonfiction  books, as well as mindless quick reads I really wanted a true novel. Didn't you ever want to simply curl up with a real novel, with real characters and a plot that moves you and keeps you going? Slightly gothic, tragic, romantic, coming of age and always poetic this is a real novel. We rarely get an opportunity to get our hands on a real book of depth and meaning. I would often stop and read passages to my wife, lines that floated throught the story.<br /><br />I will not detail the plot, others have done that very well but I can only say that this book will become a present to my special friends that I know will enjoy a good read, no make that a great read. I don't recommend many books but this one is a rare book that should be read by anyone that loves a real story populated by characters you come to know, hate, love and fear for. As for me I loved the ending and the way the author tied it all up.<br /><br />Its a hard book to describe but if you're looking for a really good novel, this is the book for you.
B000002I6X|3.0|This was a much-maligned album, but nonetheless spent a great deal of time on my turntable. In those days, I couldn't get enough of Mr. Stills and his illustrious pals. <br /> <br />While the album contains several gems, it also included quite a few duds. I wasn't one to complain back then, but I can also see why the critics were in such an uproar. Cheesy horns, falsetto singing, and throwaway lyrics had no place on an album made by the guy who brought us For What It's Worth, Bluebird, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, and Love The One You're With.  <br /> <br />Change Partners gets things off to a big start. It's swinging 3/4 time, soaring chorus, and gorgeous pedal-steel from Jerry Garcia make this a monster track, and the lyrics were especially wry. It seems that Graham Nash took \\"Love The One You're With\\" a little too seriously, and made off with the one Stills loved. Stephen gets his revenge by making the woman out to be a country-club debutante who saves herself for no one. Touche. <br /> <br />Know You Got To Run, Stills' ode to his pal Neil Young, proves to be one of his strongest vocal takes, and is also another great set of lyrics. The banjo and guitar interplay shows Stills at his folky best, and the overall tone of the song is sufficiently dark, effectively conveying the gloom that often beset his friend. <br /> <br />Sugar Babe should have been a hit, but was overlooked by DJs. It had a soulful feel to it, enhanced by the Hammond B3. The big, beautiful suspended chord at the end is a touch only Stills could have thought of. <br /> <br />Singin' Call is a subtle gem that never seemed to show up in his live set. Too bad, as this was a real showcase for Stephen's considerable vocal chops. <br /> <br />Word Game is a blistering Dylanesque rant against racism that, while not his best lyric, is one of his very best acoustic guitar workouts. Who but Stills ever applied banjo-frailing to the guitar, and made it sound like this? <br /> <br />From here, things start to go downhill in a hurry, and it's evident that Stills should've waited until he had more top-notch cuts before calling it a wrap. His desire to step into R & B is understandable, as Chicago and Blood, Sweat and Tears were all the rage at that time, showing that white boys could pull it off. Unfortunately, the material just isn't strong enough to make it work, and Stills' horn charts left much to be desired. Critics looking for someone to dis found this an easy mark, and Stills' reputation for big ego and ostentatious displays of wealth didn't help any, and the knives came out. <br /> <br />In spite of the inconsistencies of this album, I would recommend it. The high points are as thrilling as anything else  <br />Stiils recorded, and should be considered a high point in the music pantheon of that time.
0446677450|4.0|I really feel this book has great insight to acquiring money and keeping it.  I found the book to be inspiring. It was nice to see someone say that schools should be teaching kids this stuff.  I think if they did, we would have a very different world.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|I believe one needs to see \\"Cabaret\\" in the history of musicals, especially film musicals.  \\"Cabaret\\" was the ne plus ultra of the modern musical: it explored territory that wasn't normally the subject of musicals, and did so with a sophistication that transcended the genre.  It's a musical with no happy endings, because we know--as the characters do not--what is coming next.  There is no escape in Cabaret, which, given the almost-inherently escapist nature of musicals, is a genre-bending turn that hasn't been equaled.  Later musicals are either post-modern (the great Moulin Rouge) or ironic and vaguely silly (Chicago).  After Cabaret there was nothing left to do.
B000060P79|2.0|if a person puts this CD on and listens to it while playing pool or something along those lines, he will hardly notice a change from song to song.  the songs sound too much the same from one to the next.  blame that on lack of musical talent - the band cant play anything else.  i guess thats about all that should be expected from a first release, but dont buy it. download 2 or 3 songs and it might as well be the whole CD.
B000BNTM96|5.0|Picking up this album/dvd in passing, I did'nt know what to expect. What luck, this a very well-done set that really showcases their fine body of work. As far as the dvd is concerned, I was blown away. Some of the things done in editing are perfect, the use of studio footage layered over top of the concert footage is executed without flaw. As for the sound, this is one of the best mixes I've heard with a modern rock act yet. As far as buying this, you should buy this album for \\"The Fun Machine Took A **** and died\\" alone. I highly recommend this to anyone who has bought an album from QOTSA in the past, to someone not used to the bands eclectic rock this might further alienate them. But, at around $14 for a dvd and a album you can't really go wrong.
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer lays it on the line, something we sorely need in these times of obfuscation and euphemism about a pernicious religion which is still at war with the whole world. <br /> It's too bad so many people seem to think that criticizing Islam is somehow an anti-social activity. Actually, it is the opposite, because it is Islam which has victimized so many innocent people. <br /> Here's the recipe for Islam: Take crude elements of Jewish monotheism, add in Christian-like prospects of rich and vulgar rewards in heaven, mix in the ethics of a ruthless bedouin raider, sanction bloody, mafia style retribution against opponents, and then establish a theocratic empire ruled by the faithful and paid for by taxed infidels, a sort of robber baron religion. No wonder it's growing so fast! <br /> I agree with Robert Spencer: We need a new Crusade.

The details of \\"this little wooden world\\" that is the English ship, as it chases a French man-of-war around the coast of South America in 1805, through the stormy Cape Horn, and finally landing in the Galapagos Islands, are astounding.  One gets the feeling of what it must have been like for the seamen in such close quarters for months on end. This is one of director Peter Weir's very finest works, in a career that has been replete with great stories told brilliantly on film.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is superb as Captain Jack Aubrey. His charismatic and virile presence fills the screen, and he is the perfect model of a heroic 19th century sea warrior. I always admire how Crowe subtly uses his voice to fit the part, a talent that is rare in actors these days. Equally excellent is Paul Bettany as the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Bettany will be remembered from his part in \\"The Beautiful Mind,\\" the film that garnered Crowe an Oscar), and the interaction between these 2 extraordinary actors make for some memorable scenes. Another notable performance comes from Max Pirkis (recently seen as Octavian in the HBO series \\"Rome\\"), as the young Midshipman Blakeney.<br /><br />The cinematography by Russell Boyd is a marvel, especially the scenes in the Galapagos Islands, with its unique landscapes and strange creatures, and the soundtrack is a delight, using many lovely classical pieces, among them Bach's Cello Suite # 1, and Corelli's Concerto Grosso # 6. I recently viewed the Full Screen Edition of this film, which focuses on the expressiveness of the acting with its larger close-ups, and found it gave an added dimension to the film; I would recommend buying the Widescreen Edition, and perhaps renting the Full Screen Edition for additional viewing. \\"Master and Commander\\" is one of the most mature, satisfying, and engrossing films in recent years, not to be missed by anyone who enjoys adventure, along with a well-written script, intelligent characters, and the finest acting. Total running time is 138 minutes.ne of the most mature, satisfying, and engrossing films in recent years, not to be missed by anyone who enjoys adventure, along with a well-written script, intelligent characters, and the finest acting.

0385507755|1.0|Oprah Winfrey and James Frey belong together.  They are both self-serving egomaniacs who enjoy manipulating the gullible masses.  I wonder how Oprah's cult is feeling now.  I notice Oprah's camp has no comment after The Smoking Gun's expose.  It will be interesting to see how they spin it to put Oprah in a positive light. <br /> <br />I checked this book out of the library months ago as I was curious to see what all the hype was about.  I'm still not sure what all the hype was about.  I forced my way through the first third of the book before returning it.  Aside from sounding like it was written by a fifth grader, it was boring and required quite a bit of suspension of one's disbelief.  What airline would allow an incoherent man who is bleeding and covered with urine, snot, and vomit to board a plane?! <br /> <br />Several friends thought I was crazy for disliking this book.  I guess I'm not so crazy after all.  One co-worker in particular claimed this book \\"transformed\\" her life.  She is livid now.  I guess it has transformed her life in the sense that maybe she will be a little more skeptical in the future.
B00005JO04|4.0|This is a terrific political film in the tradition of Costa Gavres and hits the bulls eye on so many evil doers in the Mid_east imbroglio that Gaghan had best hope Cheney takes a fatal no 7 before he gets the idea to settle the score. Extremely taught and brilliantly acted, this is a document as convulted as Traffic that makes it abundantly clear just how complicated and simple the story really is. It comes down to greed, and greed is there in spades from the US government to the US oil companies to the wealthy arab monarchies to the insurgents with a larger agenda. Through it all, lives are wasted. On both grand and intimate scale, the bad guys are custom building a whole new circle of hell. Your heart will race, especially as the inevitable conclusion bears down. <br />Clooney is brilliant in this. So is Jeffrey Wright and the Arab actor who plays the \\"good\\" prince. The bad guys from Christopher Plummer on are just seething with evil. The only episode that is superfluous is Matt Damon's subplot. It's tear-jerker stuff, whose conclusion is the only improbability in the whole film. Costa Gavres would have left him on the editing floor. But, no matter. For Gaghan, this film is a triumph. Hope Hollywood has the huevos to honour it.
B000BYRCRY|5.0|I was confused how this was different than the other DVD's and now that I have it in my hands I wanted to post what it is.<br /><br />The two disc unrated extended cut version. Inside were two booklets. One is a 49 page comic book but the standard DVD enclosure size and paper. The other is a 16 page sketch book same standard DVD insert size.<br /><br />Attached to the outside of the package in a cardboard sleeve is a bonus disc. I haven't watched it yet but the sleeve says it contains a sneak peak featurette of the movie Underworld Evolution and a sneak peek at the Underworld Comic Book.
0307276902|2.0|I read this book, and although I thought it was ok I am amazed by the number of people who seemed to have swallowed the \\"facts\\" of this book whole without question. Even as I was reading the book I found myself chuckling at the ridiculousness of some details. Honestly, people, think about it...what kind of airline is going to allow someone to board with spit, vomit, blood and a hole in their cheek and no knowledge of where they are going? I have flown enough in my lifetime to know that an airline won't even let you board a plane if they suspect for a second that you are under the influence or not conscious of your surroundings. And the trip to the dentist...what kind of dentist in their right mind and with a license to practice would do such extensive surgery that Frey says he received without at least novocaine? I can't imagine the malpractice they would be risking, and any dentist worth his salt would tell you that novocaine isn't addictive. Then there's the stories of catered parties, gambling in the facility...LOL. In my opinion it just seems so...fictional. Believe this story if you want, but some of the details of it just doesn't smell right. <br /> <br />As for the book itself the style is a bit repetitious, and I coulda done without the 400+ pages (the story could have ended 200 pages before the ending). All in all, an ok work. For fiction, that is.
B000002UB3|5.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" may be the penultimate effort by a Liverpool band already adept at paving untraveled ground ie. \\"autobahn albums\\", no speed limits, no rules, and driven straight into permanent pop consciousness..The Beatles bore the monumental task of continually topping themselves, hardly a never-sweat proposition..\\"Abbey Road\\" is even more commendable since the Beatles had long ago given up touring, and settled in more routinely as a studio band only..Their public awaited with baited breath each and every new pressing by the boys, looking for that inevitable slip of creativity, genuis, and verve..It never happened!..The Beatles, then on the verge of divorce and disintegration, went into the Apple studio and pulled \\"Abbey Road\\" out of their collective consciences like the dedicated, hyper-gifted, yeoman they were..The tensions between Lennon and McCartney only heightened the brotherly cut-throat competitions, and translated into another enterprise album akin to \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club\\", \\"The White Album\\", and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"-- that good..The Beatles at the time, had been written off in certain quarters as band that had hit the wall, and speculation abounded that the boys had become a dry gulch, a desert, and their best stuff was clearly behind them, left uptrail in the dust, having lost Brian Epstein their manager to suicide, and further distracted by the financial morass that was Apple Records..But Lennon and McCartney dispelled that cynical notion with the creative surge that became \\"Abbey Road\\"..Play \\"Abbey Road\\", and you will not find better lyrics, better music, better energy, on any other Beatles compilation..The medley that begins with \\"You never give me your money, you only give me your funny paper\\", is the beginning of a crescendo never again replicated by the Beatles, or anyone else, for that matter!..All in all, \\"Abbey Road\\" is in my opinion, the most thoroughly prodigious work by the Beatles, and the public was re-reminded once again, Pauland the band were not dead afterall, but risen.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This music is just as moving as the movie itself. With each and every song you feel as though these are the words that Jack and Ennis would have said to each other, had they been comfortable with the love they felt for each other. The music celebrates the love between these two men. As the old saying goes, it is better to have loved and lost than never loved at all.
B000055XMF|5.0|That question sure made a difference to a lot of kids then and who are now adults now in their later years with their sensibilities and image they still show to the world..<br />Indeed there was a world of difference between The paisley of The Who,The Kinks,The Small Faces and the harder edge Gene Vincent lovers with their bikers dressed in leather as the movie portrays.<br />They all made great music so what difference does it make? Music sure made a big difference in style and temperament and is still a big deal in life where fashion and outlook still and will always color ones reality and lifestyle.<br />This movie brings it all back home as the backdrop to the energy and youthful libido of the early UK rock scene with a dose of reality that set the Who apart from your typical rock band.The anxiety and conflict is real.<br />The Who's music was great and this film captures the tension and life of teenage wildlife in the UK at the time..the plot is good,the film a clear portrayal of the album, acting good,soundtrack fine, Rhino's special features on Vespa Scooters, interview with Sting, are all appreciated.<br />Mental illness, suicide remain pertinent,contemplated or acted on...<br />This movie is a great timepiece and not to be missed by any kid, I saw it when it came out and still watch it.
0307276902|3.0|I read James Frey's \\"A MILLION LITTLE PIECES\\" as part of a selection for my book club. I had never heard of Frey but his story seemed interesting enough. When I read the synopsis of the book, I automatically thought it was fiction because it sounded unbelievable and far-fetched. But a friend of mine informed me that it was based on a true story, and the author was even featured on Oprah. Well that was all I needed to hear... This tale seemed even more fascinating than before.<br /><br />Whether or not the accounts are true, Frey did an amazing job breaking down the life of addict in a way that reveals the evil side of drugs and why you should say no! I've never been an addict, nor do I know anyone who is/was, but this book gave me chills, because it was so brazen and daunting.<br /><br />Although I can see where many reviewers gave the book one star (not because it \\"may be fictional\\") I felt the book was fascinating for someone like me who knows nothing of this lifestyle. One of the downsides? It tended to drag and get repetitive in many sections.<br /><br /> In my personal opinion, I feel this book is better for those parents/guardians/teachers trying to \\"scare their kids strait\\", then to hand it over to a recovering or in the process of recovering addict.  It is also definitely not for the squeamish.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I, along with countless others I'm sure, tend to buy a CD based on the strength of one or maybe two songs. I did this with Morning View for \\"Wish You Were Here\\". I quickly found that I play that track far less than all of the others here.  <br /> <br />These guys rock! I'm blown away with their maturity and talent. I'm not really into any of Incubus' so-called \\"peer bands\\" so it's hard to make a comparison. I can say that on its own, Morning View is a stellar CD I count among my favorites in my collection. My two favorites are \\"Warning\\" and \\"Just A Phase\\", but plenty more than these two and the radio hits.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This is the first season of Smallville in my opionion this season is one of the best three. It has some really great episodes on it.

Get this season if you are interested in buying it.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|The only information I've gathered on this DVD is that it is a two disc edition release.<br /><br />It has a Dolby Digital 5.1 english audio track, and it will include:<br />- an audio commentary by Chris Columbus and \\"selected\\" cast members,<br />- Deleted Scenes,<br />- a new feature legth \\"Making Of\\" documentary, and<br />- \\"musical performances\\" which to me sounds like B'way footage.<br /><br />To see box art go to:<br />images.barnesandnoble.com/images/10610000/10610950.jpg
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The first review declares this as their best yet. That is certainly  a stretch. But I would say this album is great. Its grown on me and heck... ive been listening to this once a day... so that's got to count for something. In fact I'd go as far as saying that this new album is more addicitve than room on fire... and I feel like Im experiencing it much like I did with 'is this it'.... suspicious at first, then somewhat curious, now really starting to enjoy it. Room on fire was derivative... even though catchy, and I was done with that album very quickly. <br /> <br />The second spotlight reivew is just down right stupid. Some guy writes a review on the day of its release, declares the cheesiest song (juicebox) as the best song... and calls it a night...  <br /> <br />If amazon wants to reveal a general concensus about the new album, surely those two spotlight reviews are totally inadequate. <br /> <br />I think many people are cringing because of the risky 'ask me anything'. Critics just cant get passed it...  <br /> <br />If they had omitted 'killing lies' and 'fear of sleep' aswell... this album would have been tighter, ideal in duration and no one could touch it.
B000002JSN|5.0|There are countless opinions on which Zep album is their best and all make valid points. Kind of like trying to say which year model Corvette was the greatest. '68 or '73 etc. Point is, all of their releases were beyond their time, breaking new ground and recruiting millions of fans. Show me an artist with any relevance today who wasn't influenced by this band.  <br /> <br />I believe Physical Graffiti is the highlight of a much too brief career for this great band. This CD has it all. Jimmy, Robert, JP and Bonzo are all over the place musically on both discs, and doing it extraordinarily. Yeah, there are the radio staples here, you know of which I refer. But there are other hidden gems that will become the reason you listen to this masterpiece over and over. Sick Again and Ten Years Gone to name a few. <br /> <br />Cut your teeth on their fourth release and then go get Physical Graffiti. The rest will follow.....
B000E1MXSW|5.0|The controversial best seller became a superb film thanks to the <br />magnificent performance given by Audrey Hepburn.  She was surrounded by greats like Dames Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft and <br />in one of his earliest (and finest) roles Peter Finch deserved an <br />Academy Award.  The film never bogs down and depicts the life of <br />a nun in the late 1920's and of her constant struggle.  One wonders in 2006 why the religious rules were so strict but it was a different time.  There are some fine cameo roles by Colleen Dewhurst, Ruth White, Barbara O'Neil and Mildred Dunnock.  I am <br />delighted this is finally on dvd.  I was keeping my laserdisc <br />player just for this.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|In actuality, away from Andrew Lloyd Weber's beautiful score, the story is pretty ludicrous. <br /> <br />Christine is 16 years old in the movie, way too young to be dallying with two much older men, way too young to be playing them against each other sexually. The Phantom has serious anger management issues and ALL women should steer clear of this dude at all costs! In a month  if Christine had married the Phantom, she'd be fleeing to the nearest Abused Women's Shelter. <br /> <br />But this was a beautiful movie to watch. I agree, it was very miscast. I saw the original play in L.A. in '92 and it pretty much put me to sleep. I thought I was sick of the music score and not impressed with the story, but I was very wrong. <br /> <br />This movie refreshed the music score by making the story clearer to me. I don't normally care for Minnie Driver, but she nearly stole the whole movie as the Prima Donna/Diva (bad) Opera singer. Ciaran Hinds, who played Caeser in HBO's Rome, shows his versatility at comedy as one of the put-upon new Opera House owners. The costumes and sets were magnificent. Yes, Gerard Butler was mis-cast. He's a gorgeous man who is not getting the roles he should be getting.He was in the bomb \\"Time Line\\", what a waste.  Wish he'd gotten the title role in Alexander! Or Troy! Or somewhere else where they need a real, grown up man, not a teeny-bopper, surfer type. <br /> <br />Even if you are tired of the score and the play, this movie completely refreshes the whole thing. Rent it! You'll watch it more than once. 4 stars for mis-casting only.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's all very well to be an indie hero who draws adoration from hip kids in dirty jeans, but every now and then the world needs a hearty dose of widescreen rock bluster. With Bono looking just about ready for a pension (a purely hypothetical notion given the old millionaire's mountain of riches), Chris Martin has put his `Make Trade Fair' hand in the air to take up the mantle, with Coldplay's third album X&Y delivering a colossus of odes from beginning to end. Martin's yet to learn how to write songs that tell stories (each of the 13 tracks collected together for this album are told in the tiresome first person perspective), yet with X&Y Coldplay show how full-bodied their songwriting has become since 2002's stellar A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Opening with the scene-setting Square One, the epic ambitions of X&Y are initially presented via a musical nod to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here. While What If turns up the slop factor with an ode to Mrs Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow (while Chris sings of bringing up Apple, fans may simply want to bring up their lunch), White Shadows finds Coldplay stealing the best bits of U2's War album and creating a massive tune. Even the coda to this song suggests the band don't want the thrill to end, with the clean mix of Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar, Will Champion's thumping drums, Guy Berryman's persistent basslines and Martin's vocals coming together in spectacular form. Having previously pledged allegiance to 1980s U2 rivals Echo & The Bunnymen, album highlight Talk is further proof that this time around Coldplay are wanting to rule the world rather than rue the world, giving X&Y an instant hit that simultaneously channels the best of U2 while lifting a sample from German electro pioneers Kraftwerk. The comparison to their Irish forefathers is furthered via current concert closer Fix You, the ballad-with-a-conscience that finds Martin's Make Trade Fair sloganeering transformed into a Save The World hymn that rests too heavily on pastglories as a musical backdrop. Stealing from Kate Bush on preliminary single Speed Of Sound and offering up lines like `I could write a song a hundred miles long' appear far from endearing on paper, but X&Y finds the most absurd ideas working gloriously well thanks to Coldplay's heavy mettle. The final act of U2 appropriation comes via the `secret' track, Til Kingdom Come, a song written especially for JC, the mythical hero of the poor and downtrodden. Dedicated to Johnny Cash (who were you thinking? Jesus Christ?), the stoic and bare finale finds Coldplay making their closing bid for U2's slot as the best stadium act in the world. Unshaven indie jokers may scoff, but with X&Y Coldplay have delivered a grand new chapter in UK rock.
0812968255|5.0|While this translation is concise and lacks the flowery writing of the George Long version which I've also bought, it remains true to the simplicity of the Stoic lifestyle and the casual writing of someone doing this only for themselves. If you want to satisfy your ego and read something with more flowers, get the George Long version or something else. If you want to understand what Aurelius means and don't care about the difficulty of a book as long as you get something out of it, I'd recommend this because it's probably more accurate in terms of tone and formality, and like another reviewer said before me, it's reads as though Aurelius were right over your shoulder giving you advice.  <br /> <br />While some of his theories lack sound proof, he never wrote this for anyone else to read, so he has no reason to go out of his way to prove something to himself. It's up to the reader to find the proof, or refute what he says. It's a very interesting, easily understandable read that comes of as some sort of ancient self-help book. It's advice for living a decent life in a complicated and confusing society, with a limit on your existence in this world. Personally, I'd recommend buying both of the versions I mentioned (you can actually find some george long versions free online) because Hays tends to simplify a lot, but you can pretty much get the same understanding from this easier read version.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I have seen the stage production twice and I have also seen the movie.  The stage production is better (as it is with every stage to movie production) however I did enjoy the move.  It helped explain some of the stage production aspects that I didn't catch the first 2 times on stage...not too mention couldn't see from OK seats.  Best part of the production and movie is the soundtrack!
B000B5XZLU|3.0|This album is ok, if you've never listened to any other jamiroquai album before. but if you are a hardcore 6 album jamiroquai fanatic, u know this is the worst of their work. this album seemed to be venturing back into the trrritory of jamiroquai from Traveling Without Moving and Return of the Space Cowboy, but it really isn't. if you look at the reviews you'll see that the main strongholds of the band aren't there. Toby is MIA and that great guitarist from Traveling is long gone, but is very much needed on this album. JK thought he could do this album on his lonesome with bringing in some unknowns, but he can't. he's the play by play of the songs on this album:<br /><br />1. Ok. sounds like a hidden track on the Funk Odyssey album.<br /><br />2. not so good<br /><br />3. Great. the best song on this album. This is a true venture into that jamiroquai is really made of. i got goosebumps listeneing to this song for the first time<br /><br />4. ok. but no so good<br /><br />5. Good. the sencond best song on this album.<br /><br />6. no<br /><br />7. no<br /><br />8. no<br /><br />9. no<br /><br /> and so on...<br /><br />in all, this album just isn't what we fanatics on jamiroquai know they can do. maye because it really isn't jamiroquai, its JK and some of this buddies and Sola and Derrick. mayebe when the true band gets back on track, we can really get some more of their amazing music. i'm STILL a hardcore fanatic though, jamiroquai rules!
0385507755|1.0|Even as a work of fiction, Frey's writing is torture to read.  What slays me is that the average reader can take in his stories and actually believe them.  It's SO obvious that he's making this up.  Go back to early reviews and you will see some people called him on it back then.  To find the evidence that Frey fabricated the stories was no surprise.  That people say the book \\"touched them and changed their lives\\" boggles the mind.  The real misguided addicts here are the sheep addicted to Oprah's \\"Book\\" Club.
0804106304|4.0|I initially read The Joy Luck Club for a literature class. I was picking randomly, and through some stroke of luck, came across this well written group of vignettes. The book used wonderful imagery to portray the sights, sounds, smells, and mood of each individual scene. <br />The stories switch setting and characters by chapter, and generations by section. I won't say this made for an easier read. I found it helpful to keep a sheet with a few major plot points from each chapter, to make the book easier to follow. This also helped bring some of the tiny nuances to the surface. <br />The stories, which know no order, are brilliantly written, and weave in and out of each other, sometimes crossing paths, and adding small details and subtext to each story. Most striking was the lack of influence and communication between mothers and daughters. While the daughters are quick to dismiss their mothers as semi-literate burdens, the mothers had important lessons that would help their daughters. I strongly recommend this book to anyone, no matter their heritage, age, or familial situation.  <br />

B000A88EVE|2.0|I noticed that when I watched the extras and I did some research on the movie that a whole lot of folks didn't read the book. I think that the saving grace of this collection is that they include Walter Tevis' novel. I picked this up as a David Bowie fan, and I don't like to admit to that because it's pretty much stupid to pick up a film because your favorite musician is moonlighting as the star of the film. It was also made at a point where Bowie was at his most compelling artistically and 2 of his best albums lift images from the film for use as album covers. <br /> <br />That means nothing because Criterion packed the novel with the DVD. I picked up the Criterion copy without having read the novel or seen the movie. I decided to read the novel first and it was one of the most arresting pieces of literature I have ever read. The story was simple, yet sublime. And the experience of reading the novel seemed to break the wall between the reader and the reading and it became a very experiental read. Some of the commentary on the story points out an existential underpinning to the novel and I believe it. You feel anxiety at times, as well as alienation and discovery. Again, very experiental. It functions as very meaningful art. <br /> <br />On the other hand the movie, while on one hand rewrites the characters, the events, the plot, and even the purpose and aims of the novel, is also a stupid, stupid, stupid movie. I can imagine walking away from the movie thinking something deeper is going on, but it really isn't. You can see this by what they added to the movie. There are moments that they adapt dialogue from the book, but there are meaningless asides all over the film. It's hard to explain, but absorb the novel and then watch the film and you can see how badly all the creative liberties were implemented. It's crummy. <br /> <br />Candy Clark and Rip Torn are both interviewed for the Criterion edition of the film, as is Buck Henry and the let you know that while theyhaven't read the novel before or since, the script was something special. Not all enigmatic art is good art, and not all abstract or experimental filmmaking is successful. Just read the book first and this won't seem like a negative review. <br /> <br />Also, becomes an exercise in sexual exploration when that theme was not even explored in the novel. There is maybe 2 lines in the book that're vaguely sexual. One of the most touching elements of Newton's and Betty-Jo's (renamed Mary-Lou in the movie) is the nature of their relationship. Betty-Jo comes on to Newton but her role is more maternal, her purpose something more innocent, yet devestating. The fact that they don't cross the line says something deeper about the relationship. Bryce's character does not include an array of disposable co-eds. He's shaken by the death of his wife and feels shame and guilt for even ogling a woman while watching a movie. The screenwriter explains his adaption of the novel but he used the book in a very vague way, much how the Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter was made a silly commentary on uninhabited sexuality in a puritanical setting (with a 90's twist!) in the film version starring Demi Moore and Gary Oldman. <br /> <br />So yeah. Blah blah blah. Read the book. This was by no means an exhaustive list of liberties taken and that kind of thing doesn't bother me. It was just silly and I want as many people to know as possible that the film is completely shallow and has nothing of real value to say, at least nothing that the book didn't already say with greater lucidity.
B0002S94OS|4.0|The only reason I give this album a 4 is because the lyrics are..well....ugh..you know what I mean. <br /> <br />1. laid to Rest-First Single off the album, good opener, and a great video, it got old though, which turns me off. 7/10 <br />2. Hourglasses' intro is somewhat similiar to Slayers \\"Raining Blood\\", good song never the less. Vocals are up to par nice guitar work. 8/10/10 <br />3. Now you've got Something to die For-Kick ass vocals, good title, but the guitars could've been better. 7/10 <br />4. The Faded Line is the best song on this album next to Blood of the Scribe. It has a good hook, good vocals, lyrics. Not too fond of the drumming though. 8/10 <br />5. Omerta could've been waaay better. Its basically too slow, and the guitars are uh...meh. <br />6. Blood of the Scribe is the best song off the album, lyrics are good, guitars are great, drumming is great, and the overall song struvture/lyrics is good. 9/10 <br />7. One Gun is another song off the album I enjoy, mainly because of randys vocals, he definintley delivered with the lyrics too. Guitars are good, the rest is good. 8/10 <br />8. Break You is an ok song, coud've been way better too. Not much to say about it. 7/10 <br />9. What I've Become is one of the gems off the album, randy showcases a bit of screeching, the vocals are right there in your face. 8/10 <br />10.Ashes of the Wake is an instrumental, its good, reminds me a bit of one gun but just slower. <br />11. Remorse For The Dead coul've been easily the best songs off the album, the guitars are a bit low, the breakdown is odd (if that is a breakdown) Its a tad slow. 6.5/10
0440237688|5.0|In the world where fear is not a factor, crime is not an option, and happiness is required, Jonas, a twelve year old, changes this world drastically.  The community Jonas lives in is one hundred percent controlled but the government and as people reach a certain age, they are given a privilege to receive something from the government. When Jonas is assigned a job as a receiver on his twelfth birthday, people in his community only see him as a caring, smart, never to do anything wrong young adult.  As Jonas is opened up to a world only a few get to see in his society, he is astonished and appalled by the troubling activities that take place to make his world, a  \\"safe\\" place.  The Giver, person who gives Jonas the memories, changes Jonas and changes his way of life by opening Jonas up to pain, fear, and doubt.  As Jonas tries to live his life, he realizes that his family as well as his community is controlled as if they were robots.  The government has made strict rules and if some \\"forbidden\\" rules are broken, \\"the government\\" makes the person who broke the rule just disappear.  This is what drives people to do as they are told. Jonas gets to a breaking point and he decides that people need to know about what is going on in his community.  His first step was giving his received memories to a baby that was temporarily living at his house. The baby did not meet the \\"requirements\\" due to crying all the time, and was scheduled to be put to death. Fearing that the government would find out and knowing what happened to the previous receiver, he takes an unpredictable step. This book is truly an amazing piece of writing and it should be a requirement for schools throughout the country.
B000BB14YY|5.0|This is the 4th version of Ran that I have purchased.  Having expensive redundant DVDs isn't fun (the first was VHS).  The Fox Lorber first DVD release made my eyes hurt.  The Masterworks edition was a better transfer but still reminded me of changing a 32-bit image to 8-bit, or compressing a jpeg to the max so that contrast is increased but in-between shades of color disappear.   <br /> <br />This release is up to Criterion's quality standards.  They probably saw that they had to do it after looking at the other releases.  Just as a check, you can look at the horses' flanks and withers in the opening scenes on Mt. Aso;  they now have contours and shape from the better shading.  The colors of the greens of vegetation and the yellows on the tent are now vibrant. <br /> <br />If you own all the others like I do, because you wanted a better version of this masterpiece of film-making, it's now worth coughing up the $ to get the best version out there.  You won't have to buy another version unless something replaces the DVD format.  If you're wondering at which version to get because of price, stop looking, you get what you pay for and with the cheaper ones you don't get that much, but with this one you get the high quality transfer, commentary, and the 2nd DVD of extras. <br /> <br />When the DVD arrived, I had only planned to compare the 3 DVDs and started swapping them out.  By the end of the comparison, I was drawn into this new edition all the way to Tsurumaru dropping the scroll of Buddha.  This one is easy on the eyes and worth repeated viewing.

0671015206|5.0|This book is as much of a sociological study (written by two PhD-types who admit they aren't personally wealthy) as it is a how-to manual on getting wealthy.  The principles for obtaining wealth may be common sense (as other reviewers have noted), but are worthy of elaboration; many of the anecdotes are revealing in that they identify what separates accumlators of wealth from those who squander wealth (and the latter greatly outnumber the former).  <br /> <br />Some chapters are a bit long winded; for example, the chapter  on buying a car is probably 2-3 times longer than it needs to be (you can save $$$ on a used car; got it).  Another thing to remember is that this book was written 10 or 11 years ago, so references to salaries, home values, and the threshold for what determines who is \\"wealthy\\" may not be as applicable today. For example, they say that the average millionaire lives in a $320K home; a home that was worth $320K 11 years ago is probably worth more than $500K in most markets, particularly on the coasts.  Also, they define someone with $1M of net worth as \\"wealthy\\"; if you are married w/ children, you can't exactly drop out of the work force and live on $1M for more than a decade.  <br /> <br />

0307276902|5.0|This is not the usual type of book I would pick up off the shelf for myself.  The language alone would have given me enough reason to quietly close the book and return it to it's place on the shelf.  HOWEVER, someone else, knowing that I was dealing with a problem drinker in my life, suggested this book.  Keeping in mind that this story was being told from the PERSPECTIVE of the person writing the book and how he PERCEIVED his own life experiences is the very thing that gives this book it's power.  It offerred me the opportunity to look into the thinking and PERCEPTION of someone whose life experiences are so far removed from my own.  It also gave me the understanding of what I needed to do to improve my own situation.  Great book!  Fantastic style!
B000002LIR|4.0|He's done it all in his career: Classic rock, pop and now he relives the past in his The Great American Songbook series. This box set is of course is all about Rod at his very best. Not really a bad song in the four disc set which shows his transition from classic rock (\\"Street Fighting Man\\", Maggie May\\", etc) into the pop world (\\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\", \\"Downtown Train, etc). He has been one of only a few artists that could transition to different genres and still be successful. Very successful. I give the set a 4.5 based on sound quality (not remastered) otherwise, it's a 5.
0553296981|5.0|This book is a great book.  It helped me understand what people in that time period was going through. They had to hid from the Nazis, what kind of life would that be for a young girl, being locked up in a little room and be afraid if she made a nose that someone would here her, what kind of life would that be, that would really be hard.  This book is about a young girl and her memories about the Holocaust.  I agree with everyone when they say that it is sad that she could live longer and give her a chance to \\"blossom\\" into a great writer. I think Anne Frank is a great role model for teenage girls, except for the fact that she was mean to her mother.  I think that this book gives everyone a better understanding about the Holocaust and what life was like during that time period. I agree that if Anne Frank would have lived she would have been a great writer.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This was Yes's breakthrough album, and contianed their 2 biggest hits: Roundabout and Long Distance Runararound. Every song is great and deserves a listen. What people don't realize about Yes is that they were more than just Roundabout. They were South Side of The Sky, they wre The Gates of Delirium, they were Close To the Edge, etc, etc, etc. The beginning track, Roundabout, was their biggest hit, and it certainly lived up to the hype. Cans And Brahms is a pretty instrumental. Lots of pianos and organs. We Have Heaven is probably the worst song here, but Yes's worst is still better than most bands' best. South Side of The Sky is one of Yes's most underrated songs. It has a harder edge in it than most Yes songs that is further explored on Heart of The Sunrise, but not as good here(in my opinion). South Side also has some of my favorite Yes lines like: \\"The moments seemed lost in all the noise,\\" and, \\"it seemed from all of eternity.\\" Five Percent For Nothing is one of the most bizzare songs Yes ever did. It sounds like something a 5-year-old would make while 1st trying out an instrument. Long Distance Runaround is the 2nd most popular song off Fragile. It's their most \\"progressive\\" sounding track off the record. The Phish is the most popular instrumental off the album, and is a very catchy tune from Chris. Mood For A Day is a beautiful solo from Steve. Very relaxing. Heart of The Sunrise... if you ever wanted to hear how hard-rocking Yes can be, THIS is a perfect example. Heart is a great way to end Fragile; Jon's voice is very bleak in this song. America is a pretty cool bonus track. It's literaly about a man immigrating to America.<br /><br /> All in all, Fragile is a great record from Yes. It may not be their best album(bow down to Relayer!!!!), but it still ranks among their best. Hugley reccomended. Buy it if you're a prog rock fan.
B00005JNQA|4.0|Director Sydney Pollack abetted by accomplished actors, Oscar winners, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman collaborated on an underrated taut political thriller based on events surrounding the United Nations.<br /><br />The U.N. General Assembly is about to be visited by President Zuwanee, despotic leader of the fictious African country of Matoba, who will plead against possible sanctions.  Zuwanee ascended to lead his country and was praised as a savior but soon his administration degenerated into a policy of racial genocide.<br /><br />U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome, played by Kidman, a native of Matoba inadvertantly overhears an assassination plot against Zuwanne through her headphones at a time the building was being evacuated for security reasons.  She reports the conversation to authorities and within short order Secret Service agent Tobin Keller played by a haggard looking Sean Penn commences an investigation.  Penn and partner Dot Woods played by Catherine Keener work in a division responsible for security for foreign dignitaries.<br /><br />Penn must investigate Kidman to ascertain the veracity of her claim.  As he digs deeper events surrounding the arrival of Zuwanee point more and more to the possibility of terrorism.  Penn also soon learns that Kidman's radical political past give her ample motivation to be involved in the plot.<br /><br />Pollack did a fine job in creating a multi layered film that was both topical and relevant.  The cinematography shot in both Africa and the concrete jungles surrounding the United Nations was outstanding showing both squalor and high tech.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time.  Well, you will have a good time listening to 'Mesmerize'.  'Toxicity' pushed SOAD's unique combo of thrash combined with classical movement and injected with Serj's Bowie-like, off key, sexy vocals, and 'Mesmerize' brings back the full impact of SOAD's talent.  'Steal This Album' was a tiny bit disappointing, with the exception of 'Streamline', but 'Mesmerize' brings back the fun, the talent, the uniqueness, and the power of SOAD, along with their poignant and truthful political messages.<br /><br />'Violent Por***raphy' points out how far our society has slipped when 'choking chicks and sodomy' have become par for the course in amorous behavior, even on television.  'BYOB' is one of the finest musical romps I have had in a very long time, with amazing \\"railroad\\" guitar riffs and lyrics that poke at GWB's asinine war policy.<br /><br />'Revenga' is one of the catchier tunes, one that I find myself humming through the hallways at work after having project proposals turned down.  'Sad Statue' is a poignant message that our symbol of liberty in New York has become a sad remembrance of something America lost along the way.<br /><br />'Radio/video' is a thrash/mellow combo with some definite fun attached to it.  Smiles and happy fingers accompany this tune.  So many changes to the beat and the music that the entire song is a surprise every time you hear it.<br /><br />'Cigaro' has a bit of phallic humor in it, 'This Cocaine...' thrashingly claims that there's nothing wrong with me, but there is something wrong with you.  'Question' starts out rather mellow, but develops some amazing riffs and thunder to complete it.  Electronica is brought into play with 'Old School Hollywood', and lyrically makes fun of the washed-out stars who still believe they deserve the \\"above thou\\" treatment, without sacrificing the amazing, changing thrash and riffs that make SOAD so special.  'Lost In Hollywood' again makes fun of, what I like to call, the City Of The Damned.<br /><br />'Mesmerize' is equal to, and in places even better, than 'Toxicity'.  Clearly SOAD have developed their talents without sacrificing what makes them unique.  If you are leery of buying 'Mesmerize' because of the poorer quality of 'Steal This Album', stop worrying and run out and buy it.  If you loved 'Toxicity', you are going to love 'Mesmerize'.  Absolutely amazing rock!  Favorite songs are 'Revenga', 'BYOB', 'Violent Por***raphy', and 'Radio/Video'.  Enjoy!what I like to call, the City Of The Damned. <br /> <br />'Mesmerize' is equal to, and in places even better, than 'Toxicity'.

B00004XQ8E|3.0|This is probably a minority report, but I could never understand why the Walter/Ferrier recordings of the \\"Das Lied\\" are considered to be the best Songs of the Earth. Probably because everyone else says so. <br /> <br />Yes, it's not bad, but certainly not at the top of the list. <br /> <br />The question is why is it so overrated? Our culture loves drama and hates death. Ferrier sang her Farewell in 1951 when she was dying of cancer and she knew it. In the 1947 performance of the same work, she burst into tears in the middle of the Abshied. OK, I understand what's the fuss and drama about, but what does it have to do with the music itself?  <br /> <br />The Das Lied is not an opera, a fact that Walter and Ferrier (and also Bernstein amongst others) failed to understand, making this work sound overly dramatic and over-sentimental. It is *poetry*, pure p-o-e-t-r-y,  and demands an entirely different approach to the one that many musicians have been taking over the years (yes, forget the misery of Mahler's life, as well. A musician's life is one thing, his output another.) <br /> <br />Bruno Walter himself said that \\"Kathleen Ferrier's performance in Das Lied remains among the deepest and happiest experiences of my musical life. The lovely timbre of her voice moved me as hardly any other sound has. And she had a soul as well as a voice. That soul knew and resounded the very soul of Mahler's work. I have often thought how much it would have meant to him to hear the profound understanding in her performances.\\"  <br /> <br />Contrary to that statement, both Walter and Ferrier did not understand Mahler. (BTW, neither did Bernstein, whose recording of the Das Lied with Fischer-Dieskau is certainly one of the worst Das Lied recordings ever.) <br /> <br />Ferrier probably was someone with a soul indeed, and a great singer, but this work did not suit her. Walter a great conductor, but this Das Lied is a clear case of mystification of the public, something analogous to the DaVinci code (in this case the Da Mahler Code) and the smile of La Giogonda. There's no mystery. Only preconceived ideas.  <br /> <br />I would go for the Boulez/Urmana, Klemperer/Ludwig or Tennstedt/Baltsa recordings, instead. Top of the list (also the Janet Baker and Jochum/Merriman, too.) <br /> <br />
B0002DKCMG|5.0|I went backpacking through Europe in 1993 and 1995 by myself. I had numerous adventures and this movies allows me to relive quite a few of them. The trains and the creepy guy in the suit \\"Scusilo!\\" make me laugh every time I watch it and I can't stop watching this movie when I channel surf past it on cable. The money belt, the nude beach, Amsterdam, the Vatican, the whole thing makes me want to dig out my backpack and fly to Paris. <br /> <br />Of course my wife and kids might not let me back in the house so this movie is the next best thing. <br /> <br />David C.
0345350499|5.0|I read this book for the first time over 5 years ago, and ever since then, i've read it at least once every year. This is a very different look at the King Arthur legend, and is told through the eyes of mainly Guinevere and Morgaine, with occasional looks through Viviane and Igraine's(Arthurs mother) eyes. But mostly, it's through the eyes of Morgaine, arthur's half sister, and, in this book, the mother of Mordred.<br /><br />it's so tough to describe this book. It's quite a long read, so be prepared. plus, some characters have slightly different roles(but not anything too drastic).
B000AP04L0|5.0|This is an absolute must own dvd. Some of the reviewers here have made it very clear why you should have this dvd in your collection. A top 10 comedy of all time!
B000059XUO|5.0|I orginally didn't think i'dlike this movie. I didn't think it was my sort of movie. Thank goodness I decided to give it a try. i wasn't dissapointed.<br /><br />This movie has everything. A good storyline, interesting characters, really messed up bad guys, and not to mention great action scenes and music!<br /><br />Short summary:Eric Draven and his fiancee Shelley are murdered by a gang of two bit hoods on the eve of their wedding. Eric comes back a year later to exact revenge on each and every one of the people responsible. He's helped by crow, and his young friend Sarah and the cop who caught his and Shelley's murder. In a sense tragic and hopeful all in one. Even sadder as it was Brandon Lee's last film.

0792846443|5.0|This was the second Stephen King book to become a critically acclaimed film, the first being Carrie nearly twenty years prior. <br /> <br />Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a successful romance novelist.  His famous heroine is Misery Chastain.  He always goes away to write his books and he has just finished his final Misery book.  On his return home, his car spins out and into a snowbank.   <br /> <br />Lucky for Paul, Annie Wilkes (Cathy Bates) saw the accident and pulled him out of the car and to her cabin.  Also lucky for Paul, Annie has been able to set his broken bones and dress his wounds.  Unlucky for Paul, the snow has cut them off from everyone else. <br /> <br />Annie is his \\"number one fan.\\"  She has read all of his Misery books.  With Paul, Annie rescued his manuscript.  Annie reads the manuscript and finds out that Misery dies.  This will not do for Annie. <br /> <br />Annie keeps the bed ridden Paul hostage until he rewrites the novel with a happy ending.  This creates a high risk chess game between Paul and Annie.  And any pawn who gets in Annie's way is quickly removed (killed). <br /> <br />This is a great suspense thriller.  You are constantly guessing what Paul is going to be done next and how Annie is going spoil it. <br /> <br />Cathy Bates won the Oscar for this and she deserved it.  James Caan started his comeback with this film - but it would take nearly fifteen years before he succeeded. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is three great performers - Richard Farnsworth, Frances Sternhagen and the always luminous Lauren Bacall.   <br /> <br />Most famous scene: The hobbling scene where Annie crushes Paul's ankles to prevent him from escaping. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />

B00000K3CK|5.0|Miracle on 34th Street is one of the best holiday films and made a star of little Natalie Wood. <br /> <br />Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) is a widow with a young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood).  Doris believes that the best way to raise her daughter is to always tell her the truth and not foster any of the childhood fantasies. <br /> <br />Doris works at Macy's and it's Thanksgiving Day.  She is in charge of the talent.  And she has a big problem, Santa is drunk.  Luckily the perfect replacement has been found.  A man named Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), and even better he has his own suit! <br /> <br />He is hired to be the store Santa.  There's one problem, he thinks that he is Santa Claus.  Also, he lives out of town.  So Doris' neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne) decides to let him stay with him. <br /> <br />At the store, Kris is a hit.  And a little too good at his job.  A refugee from Europe wants to talk to Santa but she does not speak English, but he speaks her language fluently.  He also sends customers to other stores if the item requested is less expensive.   <br /> <br />Of course, you need a bad guy.  Kris befriends Alfred, a young boy at Macy's.  When Alfred is told that he is delusional for wanting to be a store Santa, Kris comes to his defense but he looses his temper and raps the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist has him committed. <br /> <br />Susan is upset by this and asks Fred for help.  Fred decides to take go to court.  This leads to a great court battle that is decided by the US Postal Service on Christmas Eve. <br /> <br />The ending is truly inspirational. <br /> <br />This film is Black and White and should be seen that way.  I know you want see Maureen O'Hara's beautiful red hair but then get The Quiet Man or The Parent Trap. <br /> <br />The performances are perfect all around.  Maureen O'Hara is probably the most underrated actress of her time.  This is another wonderful picture perfect performance.  This is Natalie Wood's first major role and she showed why she was a major star until her untimely death.  Edmund Gwenn was a great character actor and this was his crowning role and Oscar winning role. <br /> <br />This is a perfect film for the holidays.  It will get the whole family in the holiday spirit. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
0060989157|5.0|The Dirt is the loudest, most sensitive, in your face rock n' roll biography I have ever read. The book takes you through the life of the band, like in all other rock biographies. So what is so special about it? This is a very in to depth book showing you not just all the fun and good stuff about the band. It shows you all the twisted parts, the sad parts, and the happy parts. All the way to the end, the book has you wondering how these guys made it through without digging there own graves! <br /> You get to hear the story from every member, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee and Vince Neil. Each chapter is written from one of the four members. This really gives you a way to see the story from all sides, which mad the book a lot more interesting than most rock biographies. The book is sad, fun, nasty, and altogether extreme and would be enjoyed by any fan of rock n' roll!  <br />
B00005JOIF|5.0|This was a really good , movie, not one of my favorite Speilbergs by any means though. It was very intense at times, nothing too emotional to me. Just pretty suspensful. Great suspense that is. Very well filmed movie, I was actually expecting more about the Olympics and all, but it was about assassins going after those responsible for the killings in Munich. The acting was very good and deserves some nods, but I dont see it winning best picture or anything, and Speilberg probably wont snag his next oscar for director. Worth a look and to be remembered. The action was very intense, some of the best scenes I've seen in a while. Scary what goes on in other countries back then, and now of course.
0451529308|5.0|I read this book when I was 12 years old. I had to read it for school-it was a desperate last choice for the required reading. Boy, didn't I see this coming! It took a while, I will offer that (I eventually had only read half by the test.) But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady.  Thank you, library, for having little selection. This book changed my life. Everyone has to read it. After that book, I read more classics, and let me tell you they are lovely. I mean this with all my heart, when I say that Little Women is the purest, realest, lovliest novel I have ever known. Thank you, Louisa. I now long for a better time.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The improvements on this album are definately the vocals. Instead of alienating new fans with barely there whisper-style singing, she goes old-school and sings the songs for what they are.  <br />OK, so a lot of people don't like her, but hey she's doing the same music she's always done. And in fact, she's getting better with age!!  <br />No, ofcourse Madonna and Mariah can't be compared. But the thing is Mariah hasn't needed to reinvent herself but just perfect what she does. Madonna, unfortunately, has reinvented herself into the ground. Case in point, American Life!! What a piece of self-indulgent trash.  <br />However, I am loving \\"Hung Up\\", it goes off in the clubs, but the rest of \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" is quite forgettable. <br />If you're a fan, you'll already have the album. If you're not, get it! I think you'll be happily surprised!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I'll start out with full disclosure- I am a fan of Neil Gaiman and Dave Mackean's work.  When I found out about this film, I went to see it opening night with my girlfriend.  I think it should be said that anyone who is a fan of Dave Mackean and Neil Gaiman's work in comics and books will be thrilled by this excursion into film. <br />The movie is consistantly original and imaginative in the extreme.  Strange and dangerous creatures lurk around every corner in Mirrormask.  Many of them look like Mackean's xerographic works. <br />At the same time, Gaiman's writing is consistantly human.  The characters are clever and their emotions are convincing as they cross their personal arcs. <br />If you are not a Gaiman/Mackean fan already, you will love this film if you like imaginative fantasy films like Time Bandits, Spirited Away, The Adventures of Baron Munchousen or Labyrinth.  That said, when you see Mirrormask, it will be like nothing you have seen before.
B000088DSQ|5.0|Aimard, Harnoncourt, and the COE present a compelling interpretation of these oft-heard piano concertos. I agree completely with the favorable comments made by the spotlight reviewers and would like to add that this set is the best-recorded of the several sets that I own. While the interpretations are very unique, they are also musically quite convincing. I learned this music with the Ashkenazy/Cleveland Orchestra collaboration and have been listening a lot to the Fleisher/Szell set, which is perhaps my all-time favorite, but I would certainly highly recommend this new set to anyone with a fondness for these piano concertos.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I have been listening to them for quite a few years now, and they have easily become my favorite band. I find it hard to believe that there is another band out there that is more musically talented than this group of guys. Although i think their political views are out of whack, musically there is nobody better. OK Computer, I believe, is their best work. I really can't explain it, you just have to give it a listen, and you'll see.  This album has been called the best album in the past 20 years by a few magazines. It's the perfect blend of all the sounds from their cd's put together, it's got a little bit of electronic effects, with a few awesome guitar solos, slow songs, fast songs, its all here. This album is flawless.

0553801503|2.0|If I knew it was half a book when I started reading it I would have waited. This is the first novel that has taken me more than a month to finish in the last 10 years. It seems we may have another Robert Jordan on our hands (not in writing style, story, etc.) with too many characters and very little forward movement of the story. I am getting frustrated with fantasy series that take 5 - 10 years to complete. My advice, wait for paperback. If you're really wise, wait for the rest of the book in hopes that the story moves forward significantly.
0307276902|1.0|I don't really know where to start to tell you how bad this book is. First of all, I find it deeply suspicious and cunning that Oprah is pitching this book to her readers. If it was a classic she was reccomending, I would understand it, but I cannot help but think: What is the benefit for Oprah and her company behind all this?  <br /> <br />The Oprah issue aside: This book is not a memoir, it is a very bad form of fiction. I cannot believe that it was even published. The writing is very tiring, confusing, and not to mention, fabricated and egaggurated.  <br /> <br />His experiences are way over the top, and I am not even sure if he was that much of an \\"addict\\" to begin with. Everything that he writes in his book is fiction, not reality! <br /> <br />Do not waste your money on this.
0380807343|1.0|This psuedo-children's horror fiction's something that I wouldn't recommend to anyone who may be interested in children's literature or the \\"YA(Young Adult) genre\\" for that matter, not that I'd state something like that it's because it's 'too scary' or any of that cheesy stuff - but it's just that it is quite surprisingly amaturish in its delivery of an Alice-in-wonderland type of a novel that came out since C.S.Lewis' great Narnia books-- and what is peculiarly weird is that a lot of great acclaim to this book is being given that it's been receiving through book reviews as something on the category in par excellence - when it's totally boring - that I can't help but think it's because all due to that one of those trendy image stuff going on again associated with books kind of complexion since Jonathan ...'er rather, Richard Bach's psuedo-messiah fiction crap called 'ILLUSIONS'  if you know what I'm saying.    Not to discredit Neil Gaiman's exceptional work in the comic book genre- it's just even quite surprising he'd come up to put out something like this that is so bland and totally boring, the characters are as stiff as hell like from a lively cardboard milk carton box cut-out, and really there's really nothing new here, or exciting in that regard.    What boost this as on league with the trendy-hey-i-read-books-and-its-oh-so-fashionable-with-this-here-Neil Gaiman-book-that-i-hold-in-my-hand categry is because the author came along on camp with the likes of them fashionable fantasy fiction writers (on this side a little bit on the minor level of Harlan Elison) such as Terry Pratchett, Dean Koontz, and Emma Bull- who're even close friends and associates with along with Bull's hubby Will Shetterly (who've also done/collaborated on a book of theirs titled Doubleplay), and also they have a music record released with Steven Burst, and Bull with The Fabulous Lorraine as the Flash Girls (who's \\"The Herring Song\\" for one thing that I know of is a take on the 70's christian vocal group called the 2nd Second Chaptr of Acts' \\"Easter Song\\" which is written by its chief vocal composer Anne Herring- as a treatise and mockish parody) -kinda like on par with such indie-releases like those of occult 'goth-artist' Diamanda Gallas.    As I've stated, this book being in a trendy-complexion schtick of such along certain fictionary literary works that are coming out these days ever since J.K. Rowling have come up with his now-classic HARRY POTTER series -- obviously this one's quite trying to cash-in along with the market and vying for a possition somewhere at the top.    After all that's been said, anyhow if you still find that you're still a little bit curious about the book and you'd like to read it, just borrow it then and spend your money on something else; take it from someone who've already wasted his $5.99 for this piece of senselessly pointless bore-fest.
1932100385|5.0|This is an amazing book. Offering some of the best diet advice based on the largest study yet, the author also explains why we cannot separate out sound diet advice from extremely bad diet advice. I wish every person in America could read this book simply to understand the constant stream of misinformation that is being given to us, often from the sources we trust the most - doctors, medical schools, and government research studies. I am able to look at my Science News articles on conjugated linoleic acid and cancer-fighting beer and see how information is being distorted and fed to us at our own peril and the powerful food industry influences behind it. It is so hard to sort it all out, but this book does just that. The message is simple and clear. It has changed the way I look at \\"health information\\" forever.
B000000EPM|3.0|blame cd for 'how crap it sounds today' compared to in your 80's heyday. Rosanna in particular is a joke compared to original vinyl pressing. It captures about 50% of the goodness. <br />As for this album, I am not going to be completely tempered at the people putting it down.  It is not great at all. <br /> <br />Here are the ok/good or very good songs in no particular order; <br /> <br />Rosanna <br />Good for you <br />I won't hold you back <br />Afraid of love <br />Waiting for your love <br />Africa <br /> <br />that's near half the album missing <br />Now, I do agree Waiting for your love is good musically. Toto were good musicians as this record will show you. As for singing and lyric its plain trademark toto annoying, hence me refferring to the above tracks as ok - v g. <br />I can hardly listen (even as a musician) and I'm usually good at turning myself off to Lyrics and appreciating music but never could with this one the same I can with others. <br />I really don't think Steely Dan are all that. They have abominable lyrics half the time, and their first album in particular  was carried by people who would'nt know a good lyric or bad lyric if they heard one. <br />Remember they had some pretensious story on that petit piece about all the cheap instruments they used, which was hilarious reading, if not very nice as it was typical rubbish for people not in the know. That was pretty amatuer stuff and the guitars while sometimes interesting were often like experimental four tracking by 12 year old playing a week. <br />Well, we are not talking Dan, we are talkin toto. IV Album -three stars, certainly not four, two from good strict reviewers or, let's say if toto had some seriously good full records.  <br /> Get an original vinyl of this and while youre at it take note vinyl is better (at least with old music and there is no arguement). People just don't think it is cause they recieved from people who didn't take proper care of it/ or 'enjoyed' it ( depending on your view). Also, if you can't take utter care or like to 'enjoy' old mint analog artifacts in 2006 I think you should be shot. <br />
B000002AP1|5.0|The argument can be made that, along with the Ramones release in 1976, this album signaled the birth of Punk Rock.  Everything about this CD is abusive, including a violent mix that allows Iggy's voice to screech and pop; threatening to leap out of the speaker right into to your living room. <br /> <br />The Ashteon brothers, Ron and Scott who play bass and drums, are in full force here.  On each song they play in tight lock step with one another.  The guitars are brutal and distorted, just like the rest of the mix. <br /> <br />Anyone who appreciates metal, punk, or hardcore should give this a whirl and hear the roots of the music you love.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|This movie has a worse plot than Monty Python's Holy Grail! Like most of the other reviewers I think that the sets are wonderful, the design, and time era are perfect but... Really, what's the point? There was simply too much to work with, and the writer(s) tried to use all of it, apparently. This movie did have a lot of potential, too! And then they went off and tried to use every fairy tale ever written. This would've made a great Monty Python-style sketch comedy, it really would have. Making them be serious about it was just too... eh. Heath Ledger's character saves the movie to some degree, but the best acting in the world couldn't have made it work.
B0000028RR|5.0|To me, one of the true tests of music is how it stands up over time.  This CD still sounds as fresh and relevant as it did in 1992.  No matter how many have tried, no one sounds like Rage Against the Machine.  Each and every track on this CD is excellent, there are no filler tracks or substandard material. <br /> <br />It can also be said that no effort by this band, or any of its subsequent derivations (see Audioslave) have come close to the fiery brilliance that is this album. <br /> <br />Please note: LISTEN TO THE LYRICS.  Whether you agree with him or not, Zack De La Rocha has an excellent grasp of history.  I have seen few hard rock / metal albums which have inspired as much debate as this band.
B000002HMH|3.0|Just wanted to make a comment in response to \\"metalman\\".......how can you give Bleeding Me a 1 out of 10? This honestly leads me to beleive that you didn't listen to the record. It is definitely Metallica's best song of the 90's (along with No Leaf Clover and Sad But True). Even if you don't agree with that comment; any person who knows music and respects Metallica wouldn't give this tune any lower than a 7 or 8. You really think that \\"Ain't My B!tch\\" is 10 times better than Bleeding Me?!?!? <br /> <br />For the record, if Load had been combined with Re-Load to make ONE 12-song album; it would have been just as commercially successful as the black album. Again Metallica tries anything to milk the collective teet of their fans. They recorded Load and Re-Load together and sucked the bone dry for the next 5 years!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|As of the date of this review (Jan 2006), I feel that \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is Coldplay's best album.  It is a complete effort from start to finish, with a high level of songwriting and composition.  In particular, this CD picks up (in terms of tone & emotion) where \\"everything's not lost\\" left off.  It then ascends to an entirely higher plane. <br /> <br />While the other two efforts by Coldplay are good... this album is a true accomplishment.
0688158129|5.0|This book was AWESOME! The story is about two teens (Chris Harte and Emily Gold) who have been both \\"family & friends\\" since birth, and now lovers. In the book, you will notice the couple does everything together---even plan a suicide (The Pact). Suprisingly the plan doesnt go as planned, leaving one teen dead, the other questioned, and family friendships torn apart. Read as the book will have you WIDE AWAKE and thinking at all times. Also their is a movie for the book as well, called \\"The Pact\\" by Lifetime Movie Network. Check it Out.
B000062YAZ|4.0|A close friend of mine once referred to Slayer as \\"birth control music\\"; meaning that the moment you begin playing a CD like this women run for the door.  Simply put, Slayer is an uncompromising, angry, nihilistic band.  This album is perhaps the best example of that.  Each track is designed to grab the listener and pummel them into submission.    To be honest, the doom and gloom of the lyrics on this CD has made it harder to listen to over time.  But the composition is amazing and perhaps the best example of this type of music.
B0000TB050|5.0|I have other concert DVDs from U2 and NONE compare to this concert. U2 is in an obviously great place emotionally and one can only conjecture at why. Their Elevation tour is growing stronger and stronger, the crowd is a home town one, Bono lost his father a few days earlier. Eerily in just a few days the entire world will be changed forever with the World Trade Center Attacks. Whatever caused the band to be particularly happy and relaxed that night, it really comes out in an extraordinary performance that I am so glad was captured. They go from song to song with little chatter like on Live from Chicago, Bono plays with the audience and yes, suprise of suprises the whole band smiles throughout the concert. There was something special happening that night and we have the opportunity to witness it. If you buy only one U2 concert, buy this one. And even if you're not a huge U2 fan, buy it- it is bound to be a classic.
0307276902|1.0|I really started to have my doubts after getting to the end when James talks to Leonard. \\"James, I would like you to be my son. I will watch out for you as I would if you were my real son, and I will offer you advice and help guide you through your life. If there are ever issues with your real father, I must insist that you defer to him and respect him before me and over me.\\" Oh, please! I think this guy watched a few too many mobster movies with his frat buddies.  <br /> <br />Yeah, there were a whole bunch of things in the book that didn't seem true, but Frey has a tin ear for dialogue, and that was what really stood out as false.  <br /> <br />Now The Smoking Gun has exposed him as a fraud. My question is, did his family go along with his plan, or did he dupe them, too?
B000301YY8|1.0|Just because someone USED to be a soldier does not automatically mean that they are deep or have musical talent.  EVERY song on this album is indistinguishable from the last, and the only part of the album that changes is how whiny and pathetic his voice sounds.  The lyrics could be written by a monkey - \\"You're beautiful - it's true; I saw your face in a crowded place and I don't know what to do....\\" I want whoever's reading this review to actually look at those lyrics on a written page and tell me that they are original and/or inventive.  He's just another in a long line of pathetic, skinny, white guys whining about tears and women who they are too pathetic to pursue. If I could give him zero or negative stars, I would, but amazon does not allow it.  His voice and lyrics are physically painful to listen to and his \\"light, heartfelt guitar solos and backgrounds\\" are just recycled and completely overproduced in every song and are an attempt to save the artist from himself.  I'm sorry to say I have no respect for people who think that this guy is original, inventive, deep, or even attractive.  Next time you're seeking a solo male guitarist with poetic lyrics, try Bob Dylan (I'm sure you'll be much more satisfied).
B00005JOQ9|2.0|I went into this movie with high expectations, perhaps too high, especially since I saw that Quentin Tarantino had produced it. But Tarantino fans should be warned that this is in no way a Tarantinoesque film. I had hoped that the film would deal with the fascination with torture and suffering that exists in the human psyche and the strange desire to witness it even though it is horrible. Instead I found the movie clunky and uneven and afraid to be anything accept a horror film just like a thousand others. As you will hear in other reviews, the first and second half of the movie are very different: the first being a college sex romp across Europe and the second being an escape from a chamber of horrors. Unfortunatly, the two parts do not match up well. The two characters who are most sympathetic and well developed in the first half get killed off almost right away in the second half. The one who remains alive, an obnoxious and careless \\"ugly American\\" (played by Jay Hernandez) inexplicably turns into an action figure who ends up coolly killing off about as many people as the torturers themselves in order to escape. It becomes a familiar cat and mouse game of the loan survivor sneaking through dark tunnels trying to save his life and much of the true gore of the torture chamber is gentled down to simple screams in the dark and shadowy images that invoke a walk through a carnival spook house, and all of especially gory scenes with spraying blood and severed limbs will be old hat to anyone familiar with this genre. The movie also cowers out of delving into underlying political and social issues that momentarily rear their heads. Why, for example, do the European torturer pay such a high price for American victims? The issue is there, but then the movie chooses to do nothing with it. Also, why does this place where the rich pay 50k to torture and kill innocent tourists exist in the first place? How can hundreds of people dissappear in this town each year without arrousing suspicion? I suppose that if you don't mind the tired out slasher, Texas Chainsaw Massacre formula once again (but now set in a European hostel) you may enjoy this movie, but do not expect anything better than that.
B0000DI7UR|3.0|Obviously to some extent stung by overwhelming criticism of Elements Pt 1 the band respond with this effort. And it's pretty good. Anyone trying to convert a non-rock listener to the point of view that this music takes talent and isn't just a bunch of derelicts banging away on their instuments should buy them this. A lot more genuine feeling than the first Element and more body to the songs. Timo Kotipelto has the pleasing opportunity to do less bellowing and lets the songs breath while this still sounds like a working rock band. Where this Elements stuff would of taken the band eventually is anyones guess given what subsequently happened to the band.
B000063CPL|5.0|If you get this live album, you will soon thirst to see, own and feast on the DVD. <br /> <br />Enjoy!!
B00007LL7O|1.0|The gradual softening down of Stratovarius, with ludicrous attempts at driving a rock band via keyboards, has finally produced this. Some love it, but most old time Strato fans failed to see the point. Some lovely music, very few real songs and a total change of direction for the most part, this is an album of stories that nobody seemed interested in. The track Eagleheart is promising enough and builds to a cool crescendo - so why doesn't the rest of the album follow this lead cut? A disappointing effort from a band who always seemed to be on the verge of producing a masterpiece of melodic power metal.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is an art film. Amelie is a true sweetheart who's story could only be told through the imaginative and captivating colours and impressions captured visually in this film. She's a French girl alone living in a flat away from her father who'm she visits often. Her mother died when she was very young and she believes she has a heart condition her father diagnoses her with when young. Things are ho hum until she dicovers hidden in her flat a tin container that opens an adventure which will change her life forever. Audrey Tautou could not be equalled by any other pretty face for this role. She is Very cute, unique and enchanting to watch. The French and pretty much all of europe/ scandinavia have been the true originals when it comes to film. This is so cleverly and beautifully written and filmed that I would scarcely begin to make comparisons. What more can I say....., well maybe if your an average american who is completely devoid of a creative imagination don't bother, but if you like true originality then this is something that will inspire and captivate. Oh yeah, if there's subtitles and your very lazy, then don't write an ignorant and insipid review please!
B00005JO1Y|3.0|Is this film good?  Sure.  Both entertaining and filled with lots of great special effects, however, it's not great, and that's a shame because the potential was there.<br /><br />I read that the original Kong had a bug scene that was cut because it was too gruesome (at least for that age) and that the bug scene in this film was a bit of a homage to that lost footage.  It should have been cut too, along with another hour or so of this often over hyper story line.  It wasn't that the bug scene in the modern Kong is too gruesome, it was actually very well done, as far as bug eats man scenes go, it was just out of place, too long and detracted from the movie.  Plus it added another \\"saved in the nick of time event\\" and there were about six too many of those.<br /><br />If a movie is going to have us, the viewer, suspend belief about something, like say that there is a huge gorilla, or a spider man or whatever, that's fine, it's what fantasy and science fiction are all about, however, don't try and make us believe the impossible over and over again in a movie, it's just not fun after a certain point.<br /><br />Case in point, there is a scene in the movie in which dinosaurs go on a stampede.  It was totally out of place (it looked like it belonged in Jurassic Park-right down to the raptors) and it was too long AND it had nothing to do with King Kong, remember, the reason we went to see the movie in the first place, and finally if that scene had actually happened, everyone would have died and the movie would have been over.<br /><br />Okay, so besides that some of the casting stunk, but let me get to what was right.<br /><br />The cgi done for Kong was absolutely amazing, I mean I thought Aslan was done wonderfully in the LWW, but since he had to be made to speak and be more than an animal, while Kong just had to be a animal (albeit an intelligent one), I think the characterization of Kong was several levels of order higher in amazement.  It really looked like a twenty five foot tall gorilla showed up for filming.<br /><br />Also amazing was the background and set design for 1930's New York.  Just the scenes showing New York in that period were worth going to see the film for.<br /><br />As for the problem with having a creature be the main focus of a film, Kong did much better than movies like Godzilla, however in that flop of a movie they actually got a little better on screen chemistry going between the human elements than they did here, like I said, I think there was some problems in both the casting and the chemistry, but it wasn't totally horrible or anything.<br /><br />Okay, so should you see this?  I think so, many people are raving about it, I thought it was good, and worth going to the big screen to see it too.  Just make sure you're well rested and if you have back problems that you take something before you go.a twenty five foot tall gorilla showed up for filming. <br /> <br />Also amazing was the background and set design for 1930's New York.

B000022TSH|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  Roman Polanski pays tribute to the era of Dashiell Hammett by making an homage to film noir which is the finest, most excellently editted and filmed noir ever produced.  No good guys, no happy ending, just ambiguity and unfinished business.  Jack Nicholson has never been better.  If you want to see other excellent film noirs which inspired this masterpiece, check out: The Maltese Falcoln, Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Kiss Me Deadly and many others.  If you're even partially interested, buy it.  You won't be disapointed.
0743454537|2.0|I picked this up on the recommendation of a friend.  The premise was interesting and timely.  However, I was irritated throughout the novel by the authors use of analogies and similes.  Everything was described in this manner:  When this happens, it's like this.  I understand that many times it is necessary to describe an event or emotion in terms of something else so that other people can relate - but, the analogy must make sense for this to be effective.<br /><br />As I said, the premise was interesting, but it didn't seem to go anywhere.  At the end, when characters are faced with difficult choices, and you begin to feel that there will be some resolution, the author throws in a \\"surprise ending\\".  Even though the ending is tragic, it felt like the easy way out to me, at least for the author.  She never has to make a statement or take a stand on the issue.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed, and I don't think I would read another by this author.
