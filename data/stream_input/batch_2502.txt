B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie! This movie kept my kids entertained and also included adult humor, would watch it over and over again..
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It's not like all the other obvious stories ... It was intense at some points in a good way ... Good enough to pay for at the theaters
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Love this movie I can watch it over and over again.  One of my all time favorite Disney movies. Girl power!
0800141660|5.0|My wife has been looking for this movie for a long time, and when I came upon it, I had to get them.  This is one of my wife's favorite movies...  Thank you... great seller!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have to say this is a good quality game. Excellent music, u don't mind keeping I open all day. Beautiful and colors. Adorable fish, and cute little quests, u don't feel overwhelmed.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My wife has been looking for this movie for a long time, and when I came upon it, I had to get them.  This is one of my wife's favorite movies...  Thank you... great seller!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. It was so amazing! It was very emotional. I think everyone should read this book! Katniss faces so many tragedy.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I had followed Scott as he ran his first Badwater.  The personal stories and his thought processes, along with the quotes he used, made me understand his desire to continue his quest.  Truly a gifted athlete, and I'm so glad he shared his story!!!  It's a great read for all runners, and especially those who have ever tackled an ultra.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|HILL CLIMB IS FUN AND COOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is the coolest game ever. It makes me laugh when the guys head gets smudged
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Its in a great condition! The shipping process was quick! And most of all Great Music! I have no regrets whatsoever!
B00AEFXEN6|4.0|this movie is good and interesting.. I baught this for my bf for his collection he loves this movie..  it arrived on time and in good condition..
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed  the back and forth, he-said, she-said. It kept me wondering who's version was the the truth. I was not happy with the ending, just because I don't feel that justice was served. But<br />sometimes life isn't fair either! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and drama.
B000ARFNNM|5.0|this movie is a girls wish except the hooker thing ..great movie it will make u laugh and make u cry.... good movie for cuddling up and relaxing and wAtching
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I can't say enough good about both the movie and book.  There is total genius in &#34;You is kind, you is smart, and you is important.&#34;
B0090P98Z4|5.0|When will the 3.0 upgrade be available? I have friends that play but they all have ios and they already have 3.0 version:/
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Good mix of humor and action.  Better then I expected. If you are a car nut, you will like the supercharged Corvette and the stunt driver.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's more like hopeful, finding how in all the chaos that they Indore is amazing. Blown away with all that this book has to offer. After reading this book I am hopeful that I can get over my past! Must read!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|They did it again! Loved all the area's you are able to move to. A little on the short side but worth the money!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I almost didn't buy this book after reading the negative reviews. Then, I almost stopped reading it after page 50 or so because the narrative style is a bit unusual. I did finish it and I am very glad that I did.<br /><br />I like books that surprise me...that leave me with something to ponder. \\"Gone Girl\\" did not disappoint. It's more than a thriller; its a psychological study of two very damaged people. A warning: do not expect the usual crime novel with bad guys and good guys and a \\"justice was served\\" ending. If that's what you are looking for, watch \\"Law and Order\\" instead.<br /><br />This is a disturbing story with a end that is troubling and, at the same time, contextually logical. The characters are complex and difficult to like and yet, you will keep reading to find out who wins and who loses. It's a story that draws you in slowly - maybe too slowly - until you realize that this is different from most other mystery/thrillers. The surprising, dark ending is Hitchcock-like. Twisted yet perfectly in keeping with everything that has come before. All in all, it is a very satisfying read!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Not fluffy summer reading. As eviscerating emotionally as Hosseini's other works, and far more complex character development. This book leaves a wound that is slow to heal as we look at the cycles of Afghan history, and in particular how one wounded generation creates a new wounded generation.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I am a female in my 60s and this was my first time downloading and playing an app game. There was not enough help information. I figured out what some of the tiled did simply by trial and error. I really got into the Arcade game but got frustrated and will probably delete the game because in order to get to the second World, I have to play 120+ levels in the first World. In the first World the game would not display any levels past 99.I tried searching for online help but found no tips or mention of this issue. If it weren't for this glitch I would have rated it 5 stars.
B000IZ8DZQ|3.0|Michael Caine is fantastic, but I still like the remake of this movie better. It's entertaining, but the 2003 Edward Norton, Charlize Theron version is much more fun and up to date.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It came as advertised. I believe it's a one time use product. The photo is definitely larger than what you'll get in the mail. It did come quickly and was well packaged. It served the purpose I bought it for. Buy it, use it, and make your pc last much, much longer.
B009CG3M1C|4.0|Although the aliens look like some folks I see around town (except for the hands, that is) this was pure escapism and full of enjoyable clichés, like a double amputee who got around fine on his metal legs and saved the day, a computer geek/astronomer who maned up, and, of course, Taylor Kitsch who became a man in the course of saving the planet.  Not quite Barsum, but entertaining.
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|This game has some of the worst mechanics of any puzzle game I have ever played. During many attempts there was no way to match any symbols by dragging an entire row. Makes no real sense to design the game play in that way contrary to all that has been established in other past games. A fundamental of good game design is to employ mechanics that are easily learned and previously established or new ones that improve the mechanic.  Also am I the only person that knows this retro game look is not appealing, I have game design students that fall into the same aesthetically disappearing look maybe because they really never played those games.  Honestly if I wanted to play a retro game I would play the best games of that era not a game just because it is old, it actually has to be a good play.  In the end save your money and purchase a fun puzzle game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Such bad writing.  Should not have wasted my time.  Sure the sex scenes are interesting but not worth everything else.
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|Loved this new generation Star Trek -I just saw it for the first time! Great fun and well done! Hope to see all of them!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|enjoyed the movie was a little different than I thought it would be<br />glad I didn't need to wonder what happened  all the time the end was a little strange for me<br /><br />but made for an enjoyable evening
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app and use it daily.  It is so easy to use and is a fast way to put items up for sale.
B003Y74KCK|1.0|I dropped my phone on concrete and the case came OFF and my phone came out and it chipped around the outside, don't buy this case do your phone a favor.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Hill climb is a MUST HAVE when your bored! It Challenges your mind &amp; distracts you,which is good for those boring ass lectures In class or when your on the toilet lol...don't act like you don't do that!!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Many twists and turns in the plot. It captures your interest from beginning to end. Some graphic passages concerning torture!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I love crime thriller and The Time Killer was an amazing find. It started out strong and it kept exceeding my expectations since then. The book starts with the killer and his latest and perhaps first victims, the Bjornsons. It is here that we get the first glimpse of the killer and his motivations. That first account is insightful and the fear you feel for the victims is palatable. The killer is angry at the father for wasting his time and he make sure the family pays for it.I read this book in 2 days and would have finished faster if I didn't have to go to work. This book was electrifying and I could not wait to see what would unfold. I will be adding this author to my list of people to follow when I want to read a good book. I recommend this book to fans of thrillers and crime novels.
0060853972|3.0|I will not give a synopsis of the book since many other reviewers have already done that. What I will say is that Good Omens is a light and breezy read that has been aptly summarized by one reviewer as \\"Monty Python meets The Book of Revelations.\\" That much is true and it works for most of the book. There were, however, two notable flaws for me. The first is that too often, auxiliary characters were introduced that were later never heard from again. That, or their roles were often so unimportant that they wind up being distractions although they were probably meant to be irreverent. Personally, I do not enjoy tangents that have no tangible connection to the larger story, but that's me. Second, it is clear - given the climactic chapter - that Pratchett and Gaiman had no idea how the story was going to end and they even admit this in the interview given in the back pages. Writing stories without an end in mind seems to be an epidemic in fiction over the past decade which is why I tend to shy away from fiction these days. Good Omens is fun and campy enough to keep you interested but it ultimately fails to deliver the knockout blow when it's needed most.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|pretty much what u expect from disney, i woulda bought this first and maybe i will after renting it. loved it
B00382S9N2|5.0|If you love everything Dirty Dancing, this is the collection for you.  The back story and information I always wondered about and wanted to know, was pretty much there.  I'm sure not every question was answered, but the quality and quantity, made me full for a while!  Definitely had the &#34;Time of my Life&#34; with this purchase.
159315724X|5.0|This book really highlights the HUGE impact of seemingly small choices that we make every single day.  It is a great read and is easy to follow.  Take Mr. Hardy's words to heart and you will create new positive experiences in your life!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I ordered this as the season started here in the United States and it did not disappoint.  It was so nice to be able to sit down with my best friend and do a weekend viewing.  We had a good time, lots of tea and sandwiches and biscuits and a good cry now and then.  This season did not disappoint.
B0000041CZ|5.0|\\"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\\" (Romans 3:23, ESV)<br /><br />I wouldn't characterize this recording as unremittingly dry or passionless, to the contrary. It sounds to me as another reviewer describes... the hammering, fluttering, laboring, reduced sodium (no-pedal, no-romance). It's very human and seems almost like a period piece despite the instrument. I like it!<br /><br />\\"So to condemn Gulda for playing in an ahistorical style is wrong\\"<br /><br />Couldn't agree more, obtain CD at a great price.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|What a Great Collection for the Holidays.  Great old songs and new make for a great collection of Good Christmas Music.  Would Give as gift.
B008220BP2|4.0|this review is made on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />just finished watching this enjoyable zombie movie, with a twist.<br />blu ray was great, good video and audio throughout and should be added to your collection, not a horror movie but really a romance.<br />loved it from start to finish.
B0090SI460|5.0|If you have seen Monsters Inc., the 3D Blu-ray is the natural progression to make to your collection.  My grand-children gave it a 10 out of 10 hands up, even better than the original.  Worked for Grandma too.  Definitely worth the buy!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|All in all a good game.installed on my kindle fire. Have it on my phone but more fun on a bigger screen.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|There should be a rating between 3 and 4.  I like it as in I do not regret spending the money to rent it.  Over time and thought I might give it a higher rating.  There are movies that should be watched multiple times.  If I was interested in metaphysics I might consider this one of those movies.
B00A2V2SS4|5.0|If you're a &#34;Trekker&#34; obviously you love the original Star Trek. It was a series twenty years ahead of its time. Bringing to the screen Gene Roddenberry's vision was a delight to the eyes. Other than the spectacular pseudo science of space travel and interaction of the main characters, you really marvel when you know the behind the scenes struggles of Roddenberry to bring the project to reality. You also marvel at the short sightedness of the executives that cancelled the series considering the letter campaign and the spin-offs and movies that the series generated. How did these guys become executives anyway?
B00BWJARHO|4.0|What is there to say?  Great movie on a night when I am too tired to read romance novels in my top hat and coat because I only needed three  more words.  This review process is ridiculous.
0143122916|4.0|This remarkable story of birth, survival and escape from a North Korean prison camp will horrify you as a free American.  It is upsetting to say the least that humankind still subjects people to lives of starvation, torture and deprevation.  One can only hope that evil such as prevails in N. Korea will soon be abolished.  This is a disturbing book, but the truth must come out if the situation is to be changed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reminds me of my work environment. Lol!  Super great book!!!<br />The pages just seemed to turn themselves. Can't wait to read the next book!
B001EC2IV2|5.0|I remember seeing this movie on tv and for years I couldn't remember the name of it, just remember the weapons used, Really good suspense, great cast of characters, too.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|this sounds track ispulled straight from the movie,I think. I listen to it from beginning to end and itslike I'm watching the movie. I absolutely love it. definitely download.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|i was very pleased to have added this one to my collection because i have the one with mark walberg but i dont have any of thee oiginals with roddie mcdowl the original planet of thee apes
B0097K21YW|4.0|Simple enough, but it's just a fun game. May get a but repetitive, but that's what cell games are supposed to be - quick, pick up and play games.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|i liked this movie and i realy thought that both jet li and jackie chan was over kill but they worked their parts very well together in this movie i thought the both did a very good job and the young man was very good also in actting like he had no kong fu at all to a pretty good fighter in thee end.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have found the merriam webster dictionary to be an exceptional and convenient tool whether I'm reading, writing, or studying!
B004LWZW8I|4.0|immortals was better than the preveiw that i saw of it i was surprised that it came together so well a bit of a love story with a hereo and some blood and gut and who doesent love the gos that was very good to add the gods of couse it made for great affects.
B000SW2F8K|3.0|Not a bad movie. The only reason I watched it is because I have a thing for Penelope Cruz. I would not recommend it. Hardly a plot.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|now this was a bat man movie like i never ever thought i would see but this was great action great writting all together a very good bat man.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|For whatever reason after launching this game once, it refuses to work at all. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling the app it still doesn't work. Seriously? Free app or not: it just isn't worth it. Maybe it's just my phone or what have you, but this has convinced me to just uninstall the amazon app store in general.<br /><br />Get your stuff together Amazon!
B00003CXCT|4.0|this was a very good buy i love stars wars i love george lucas and even his daughter katie lucus is showimg off her writtings skills on star wars the clone wars but this is the first three thee originals the begining of the star wars sage and i am very proud and excied to add this to my collection. and even though i brouth this package used it arrived in great condition almost new.
B00004TBVU|5.0|I know this album well and was more than pleased to find it for a reasonable price! It was exactly what I paid for and came sooner than I thought.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|he realy did pull off a very good conan wich was a very hard thing to do after aranold who else would do but he pulled this off with a lot of skill and beleivabilty and i am quite pleased to see him in a game of thrones on hbo it my pleasure have been able to buy it this moth the first season anyway liza bonet is a very very lucky women.
B003U4UPHG|2.0|Season 2 is when it starts getting bad. Believe me, when you get to season 3, you'll wonder WHY in the world you wasted hours of your life watching this.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|i said this was a great honor to have the original star wars by george lucas and i already said how i love anything from him and i also said that his daughter katie lucas has proven to be a very skilled writer also based on her work with the star wars dlones wars io have seen and heard her work she has a long future in carrying the lucas name in the star war world or even somthing else of her own creation.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|Stunning release from the man from the midwest. Every song is a story that makes you think \\"Where does he get this s***? Damn!\\" He's the Elmore Leonard of song. My favorite is when he's starts naming items on the grocery list in the dead woman's pocket \\"Peanut Butter, FUNYUNS......\\" John is the BEST.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|i realy realy thought that we were going to at least see the battle between man and beast climax but i was cheated out ofthe ending but all and all it was a very good movie i love liam neeson ever since the first batman movie and i thought his understanding of the animal he hunted for the oil men was great it was a very good addaptation of man in the wilderness and mans fight for survival.
B0055IU4GM|4.0|But not great. His NEXT release is stunning. There are some gems on here, &#34;Damn This Town&#34; is memorable. Go John!
B002ZG9788|4.0|this movie was taken from me stolen out of my collection by i dont know who but i had to replace it was the retelling of the first one with harry hamilin so i had to buy it again and i already had the wrath of the titans so i couldnt just let it go so when i brought i brought in bluray and dvd formats so that i can watch them on both my new sixty five inch flat screen or the  older model tv i have in the bedroom along with the older dvd player. so now i can feel better about my collction not being broken up by a theif.
0670026603|5.0|When I first saw this book, it was listed under \\"chick-lit\\" and \\"romance\\" on many Goodreads users' shelves, which is pretty much all I need to run the other direction. But then a friend of mine read and reviewed it, a friend that feels much the same way I do about those genres.  So I gave it a whirl. And by a \\"whirl,\\" I mean I read the whole damn thing in 9 hours and actually considered skipping important things I needed to do that day just so I could keep reading.<br /><br />This is a book that tackles difficult issues honestly and emotionally, but without emotional manipulation. It's just SO GOOD. I strongly recommend that people who normally are put off by seeing the words \\"chick-lit\\" or \\"romance\\" give this book a try. Trust me, it's NOT what you're expecting.
B009VYF5E2|4.0|i am so surprised that this is the next to the last season that this wonderful show only goes to season five i was truly shocked because i was and still am very much into aurther and morgana and merlin and even even gwen and gius is realy very good.
B009MYARIK|1.0|I love all of Sophie Kinsella`s other novels, so I was so excited to read this one....sadly, it was very disappointing. I couldn't even root for a single character because each one was a contrived mess. So much of the book is spent on a plot line that you can tell is going to end badly. It's much better to read a book where you get to experience a couple falling in love, rather than one like this where the entire time is spent watching the couple find out why they're not meant to be. Such a waste of money.
B004LROMSY|4.0|like i said before its very hard to do better than the first movie when its sequels that your dealing with but this werewolf movie is realy good better best this one is better than the rest and thee other two was very good also.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|I wish that they had left the dementia out.  It was not what she had when Thatcher led her country out of liberal mismanagement into something great for 11 years.  Streep could have done it too.  She could have showed us the forceful personality that made it happen.
B00B19DW0E|1.0|This is one of the worse movies I have ever watched. I gave it a try but gave it up after 15 minutes.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This could have been a sloppy John Goodman's character approach to a severe drug and alcohol problem.  Washington made it an epiphany and we are all the better for it.  The opening scene with the flight attendant should not be seen by anyone under 17, but it was necessary to the understanding of the court scene where he has that epiphany
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Keeps you guessing & on edge! Has a great story plot and surprises! I can't wait to read the others! I would recommend this book to readers who like action, suspense, and imagination!!
B002RSDW80|3.0|Honestly I was hoping to see Julia do her magic on tv.  Instead we got a nobody blogger writing out of her league about a contest she invented.  Cute.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|But I LOVE this album !! I thinks its because I am a sucker for anything acoustic... wow... just love this.
B005LAIISA|5.0|They could make several more of these and I wouldn't get tired of the format.  It was just fun.<br />As usual the saber toothed rodent stole the show.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I really do love it. I dont know what else to say. I really do love it and think you should give it a listen :)
B00004WGC4|5.0|This is the funniest piece of TV ever made.  Interviews in between the shows are worth watching.  Everyone is a character that has well written parts
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I don't know what it is about it but I think this game is a great time waster. I am addicted to it every time I play.
B001HN6922|5.0|Cars 2 movies is very different from the first movie, mystery, spys, and a car race, great actor used for the voices. a family friendly movie
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Lady Antebellium cd are all ways great what can you say love it. Would buy it again if any thing happens to this cd
B00005JNS0|5.0|The cars movie is a very fun video for kids and adults to watch. Family friendly film, enjoted the voices used to place the cars.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I rate this book a five star due to John's teaching ability made it a great read and good advice that gets you past start. I would love to have him on my Podcast Show to help my listeners that could use this advice.<br />Tim Town<br />TheBIZRoom Podcast
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Good game but the healing pots suck You can only buy with real money. The combat is a little boring after a while. Overall good game
B00124LYHQ|5.0|This is a great movie no doubt! The blu-ray remastered version of this movie is spectacular. The book is filled with AMAZING pictures and trivia about the movie and the actors. This is a GREAT buy. The only thing I didn't like is that my book came slightly damaged. The top corners of the book are pressed down like bent but there is no way to fix it. But other than that that I find this was a great buy.
0451209338|4.0|I had a bit of a hard time following all the charactors and places they popped up in, but after the confusing first few chapters, I am hooked
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I really like the role Julianna plays as Alicia I like that though Alicia has so much on the ball, she has conflicts and issues just like rest of us. Julianna, what a strikingly beautiful woman.
B009MYAQK4|1.0|It is neither a philosophy textbook nor a Coelho story. The reader will get bored unless he or she is one of the tailors selling the Emperor his new robe. An appropriate discussion piece for snobs.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|The title enticed me to read this book which I thoroughly enjoyed.  This is a very simple tale told in simple language peppered with calmness, innocence and hilarity. Although the journey taken is fictional it draws the reader into a relationship with the main character , making the reader experience disbelief, frustration and happiness.  I would recommend this book to people over 40 who are retired or who are thinking of retiring.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have several different Mahjong games (on my laptop, my first Kindle and how this one, plus two separate discs that were gifts).  This one is the best I think.  The tiles are interesting.  The layouts are fun and I even enjoy the music that plays.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I found this book to be an easy read  but not really a superb piece of writing.  It contains many examples of problems for women in the workforce throughout the years that they have been allowed to work and lots of statistics about their situations that are well-documented.  I was disappointed with the number of references  in the book because they almost took up more space than the actual text.  However I do recognize that the reader can delve into their interests easily if all of the references are there.  I would recommend this book to young women and men entering the workforce.
0375826726|5.0|Shipping was very fast. This is the third book in Christopher Paolinis Inheritance Cycle. Was a great read. One of the best he has written so far.
014050639X|5.0|I just bought this book for a friend.  My children (no grown) had this as pre-schoolers, and can still recite it.  The blending of the nursery rhyme and fairy-tale characters and the rhymes are great fun.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I love the scenery and costumes in this movie. It's over the top and deliciously so - very highly recommend!
B000FC130E|3.0|I understand that Neil Gaiman has a hoard of ardent followers, but I guess I just don't fit the bill. This story is rather interesting, but told in a kind of pedestrian way. I never felt hooked or wondering what was happening when I put the book down - it was just kind of &#34;eh, it's average&#34;. If you were born and raised in London, however, and know each and every one of the landmarks Gaiman attaches magic significance to, then you'll probably really enjoy the work.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|One of my favorite love stories. The story of Isabeau a beautiful woman who fell in love with the captain of the guards Navarre, a jealous corrupt bishop, and an old priest who seeks to atone for his betrayal. Matthew Broderick's character provides the comic relief as Phillip the Mouse. Some people say the music doesn't fit - I say it does - it adds to the fantasy. Watch for the duel transformation scene between Isabeau and Navarre - brings me to tears everytime- you'll cry too.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. The power ups make it so much fun. The more you play the more free credits you get. I loose so much time. Cause of this game ;)
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I thank Dr. Mosley for bringing this diet into the mainstream.  I have experienced profound changes in my psychological and physical health... all for the good.  I consider it a total lifestyle change that I will follow for the rest of my life.  Only regret I didn't start it years ago!!!  Thank you again,  Dr. Mosley!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well made. Great graphics and gameplay. Simple and addictive. Def one of the best apps for a kindle<br />...and it is free!!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian has done it again!  Blink an eye, and you're done with this high-energy workout...you don't get bored at all, because you're only doing 1-2 min of each move at a time, and the entire workout is done in 25-30min. Does that mean this workout is easy? No way! It is JM afterall =) You'll be dripping in sweat and feel so accomplished at the end of each session!
B00BSW6F26|2.0|Short game.  Some logic to the puzzles but some obvious puzzles can't be solved until you have completed everything the game wants you to do first.  Nice visuals but some things difficult to see on a mobile phone.  Try using it on a tablet with a larger screen.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I wish it was longer!  I can't wait for the next one so I can challenge my mind with more puzzles
B009MYARIK|5.0|Another great novel from Sophie, perhaps even better than &#34;I've Got Your Number.&#34; Perfect for the beach or pool!<br />Can't wait for the next book!

B0063IH60K|5.0|love using this to pass the time on long car rides or sitting in doctors office.  great product.  i use it all the time
B000FCKGPC|5.0|So, I read books 1-3 in rapid succession, and upon completing  3 of the 800-1000  page tomes, I couldn't bring myself to pick up the fourth book for a LONG while. However, out of necessity to stay ahead of the HBO series (which seems to reach way ahead in the books to grab onto certain threads of storyline), I finally picked up this one. Contrary to the opinions of many other reviewers, I thought it was great. In fact, one of the best things GRRM could have done was to split books 4 and 5 by sets of characters so that readers weren't overwhelmed by keeping up with all of them at once. It made for a much more cohesive and pleasant read.
193700788X|5.0|This is the second time I read the book.  The first time, I had finished reading all of the negative reviews - and I was already incensed.<br /><br />This time, I pretended that I hadn't read the reviews first.<br /><br />The story line was reasonably cohesive.  I enjoyed it.  I saw the reason for Sookie's choices, and I didn't feel (at all) like she had settled - more like she had gone, explored the world, and then decided that this was where she belonged.  She no longer had to wonder, she felt as though she had found herself.<br /><br />That's JMO, though.  I would have ended it differently, but it's not bad.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Don't know if I was just feeling this, but I think this is the best band in the world. Their music rocks!
B00AEFXZ1C|4.0|It's been a while since I saw this movie.<br /><br />Since I am from the Pittsburgh area I really enjoyed seeing the changes in the city since it was filmed.<br /><br />I remembered seeing more dancing than there actually is.<br /><br />Still a really good movie
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A very good game worth the data space. Fun for young ones to pass time. It should be bought as it is still free.
B004PHSTY8|5.0|It's Supernatural. It's a fantastic series (at least until the 5 season). Season two is where the plot really starts to heat up and I'm glad to finally have it on blu-ray. The detail's a little better, and formatting way more agreeable when you just upgraded to an HD flatscreen TV. (Yeah, Mr. Ackles looks a lot worse when his face is putty-stretched across the screen.)
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Bought this for 99¢ on my Kindle. Really fun Sim with a kind of morbid theme. I'm having a good time working out the strengths and weaknesses of the three basic types: bacteria, virus and fungus. The large number of options availble for mutation keeps the replay value high.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|It was definitely different and very unusual. I found it to be rather dry and uninteresting. The animated characters were great but the story lacked enthusiasm.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|I can see why its so popular. Only reason I say its cheesy is because its older. But it is still good nonetheless and gets better as you get into it
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Robert De Niro is his usual super actor, but he's not alone in this film. It had a moment where he cried [as did I], but I felt good about the crying. The acting is believable and captivating throughout. The anguish of the characters proved cathartic for the viewer. I'll be watching it again!
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I am very glad that I purchased the protection case but find that it doesn't hold in it's postion well.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is okay but I think that you guys at Mojang need to update it every once in a while.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The devolpers did a great job cutting through the obvious and then giving the viewer hints and tips as to how the conflicst/situations were resolved or ended.  Loved the cliffhangers!
B00338QENI|4.0|Story of science, mystery and of a sad family that is still affected by the repercussions of a death that happen more than 50 years ago.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters and family dynamics are so authentic.  All the money in the world and all the help from the labor of others does not protect a family from the conflicts, envy, and impact of world events.  Living large can be a real burden.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this series and hope it's on tv for many more seasons! The writing is sharp, the characters are relatable.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|There is some new functionality that keeps up the interest and overall its playability is neither too difficult or too easy but then I got the game for free.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Fresh view point going beyond the all the procedure-- still a lot of procedure in there though. I like this Landay's style.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|it made me delete every thing on my kindle and I still couldn't play it!!<br />so its the biggest gameloft ripoff in America
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft is a curse that everyone is falling under. Horrible and crazily addictive. I have never tried it and never will!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I usually love these types of stories within stories that all connect, but I think it was too many stories in one movie for me to appreciate them all.  Plus, I thought the connections from one story to the next was a little week and not very meaningful.  I think I expected too much.  Acting and visuals are well worth the watch.  It was very interesting to watch the characters change from one story to the next.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|What can I say? It's a cord, it plugs in, it works. How many more words do I need? Huh?
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Opening with a thrilling, whimsical, adventurous segment before turning down the volume into a haunting piano piece, Michael Giacchino's masterful score never fails to let up, nor does it cease to highlight both the talents of this composer and the dangers of the film. While not as adventurous and awe-inspiring as the score for the first Star Trek by JJ Abrams, the score to Into Darkness provides deeply resonant emotional themes, playing on both the main theme for Star Trek and Spock's Theme, as well as introducing an intriguingly ambiguous theme for the villain (who I will not name). Giacchino plays in shades of gray with that aspect, providing sinister intent and yet heroic ambition. Meanwhile, the action pieces are pulse pounding, and as good as -- if not slightly better than -- Nero's themes from Star Trek. A highlight is The Kronos Wartet, which provides score for the Klingons, and good lord does it succeed. A grand replacement for Jerry Goldsmith's classic score for the Klingons from classic Trek films, and it's about time. Overall, I could go on at length as to how good this score is, but quite simply it's reminiscent of John William's Temple of Doom score: adventure, danger, emotional payoff. Well worth the purchase.
B00AW57L96|5.0|The characters in this book are richly described, and all believable.  I loved the way that the characters were bought together and we were given the history and connections that were concerned with the information in letter revealing the secret.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down, it kept me reading at pace.<br /><br />The epilogue (don't feel tempted to read first) was brilliant, and in a lot of ways achieved what the book 'Life after Life' tried to do, only better.<br /><br />This is my first Liane Moriarty book and I will be looking to buy her other novels.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Such a gorgeous game! Very interested in future releases. Highly recommend. Use of tablet dynamics (turning the actual tablet to produce results) was integrated seamlessly.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|good storyline lots of action and believable fairly clean language<br />if you liked mark in  invincible you Will love shooter,
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Others have already done the long reviews - just buy the book, you won't be disappointed. You'll find a great story with numerous engaging characters
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|I could not even finish viewing this movie.  One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Do not waste your money on this movie.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Great movie, Romance, thrills, tears, it has it all.  Well acted and the daughter is a charmer.<br />must see for movie buffs
B00A757EFW|3.0|With the lite version you are only allowed to play up to the second level. So if you are a good player you with either be bored very quickly or you will be playing the same two levels over and over again. If you really like this game, you should probably pay more and get the regular and not the lite version.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|always enjoyable cant put it down till last page My husband has become an addict too.He writes for so everyone can really can get into the story
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Overall, it's the ease of use and controls. Like the nightstand mode and the white noise feature, as well as selections of clock displays.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My whole family enjoys playing this game I highly recommend it it's fun and you will get hooked for hours
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved the getting even and revenge factor.  Also I enjoyed the way John Grisham developed the<br />story line to keep you guessing until the very end.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|One of the most fun games I've played in years. I really can't think of a better game than this one.

B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This  app  is  the  worst  I've  ever  downloaded  it  stinks. It  is  so  boring  all  you  can  do is  tap  things.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Another gripping tale I couldn't put down. It is fun to read a story based on actual historical events and people who really existed.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game bit why do you have to pay gems for the air Dragon. By the way I tried to get a salamander or coral Dragon I got the air Dragon so people try a fire and a water Dragon you might get lucky and get an air Dragon.
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|In the beginning, he only went after people who actually deserved it.  Now even good people are being killed so he doesn't get caught.
B008602KQI|4.0|The film didn't have the visual pageantry of the book (e.g., the book's flame costumes were better than the film's). On the other hand the science fiction elements were better expressed (e.g., the invisible flyers felt like an uncomfortable, unconsidered plot element).
B00CBRADU2|4.0|This tongue-in-cheek Arnie reboot is more entertaining than expected and relies more on some old fashioned Wild West Sheriff action than CGI overload. There's the improbable but spectacular jail break, some unlikely but gripping car racing against helicopters, and a reasonable young ensemble cast supporting the aging Governator in defending his tiny town against a ruthless but stereotyped Mexican drug lord.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, Arnie is looking old, and there are plenty of references to this throughout the film. Still, the action is well paced if not a little predictable and it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours with some optimistically inventive assaults by the bad guys, and the FBI operating in a less-than-competent mode while they wait for our small town Sheriff to do the jobs of an entire SWAT team.<br /><br />There are a few stunts that will have the ever-loving disbelief suspended away from you but the camerawork and direction is fluid enough to feel the excitement rather than unlikelihood of the whole thing. Personally, I was expecting so little out of this film given its dismal box office performance that I guiltily admit to quietly enjoying it. It's almost like the good old days of Arnold - if you bring some beer and pizza, you're guaranteed a mindlessly good time.
B00418NVMQ|3.0|It's a recording of a live performance!  If you are more interested in hearing the band and Ms. Hale's voice rather than the noise of the crowd, buy one of the group's other albums!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Watch it with captions.  entire ensemble is excellent including Crowe who is getting a bum rap about his singing.  His songs are made to fit his character and the music is intentionally somewat &#34;off&#34; ( minor notes in somehat odd spots).  Jackman should have won an Oscar and movie should have won also (Argo?...are you kidding?)
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|We have used the viewing app, the wifi connectivity and the battery features of this product. I can say that it works as advertised for our iPhone 5. App installation was quick with a free download. Syncing the device with the phone was as simple as a wifi search (give it a few seconds; it's not instant) and a click on the correct source. Viewing begins as soon as you find the folder on the SD card. Viewing (and pre-viewing) a large amount of files can take some time as it is (I think) building thumbnails and storing some data on the phone. It's wifi, and the images can be large, so a little time seems reasonable.<br /><br />The odd thing is that the data seem to be only partially transferred as it stayed \\"on the phone\\" well after the connection was dropped, but the photos later disappeared from the app. I can only guess that it needs to re-sync to maintain the files. I would have understood if it dropped the images immediately upon connection loss...it's the lingering until the next day that's perplexing.<br /><br />The bonus feature for me is that the USB slot (positioned for charging the unit or the phone) can also be used for USB flash drives for viewing. So, as a wifi reader I think it could be the most useful for a small group of family/friends to stream multiple files and act as extra storage.<br /><br />As for the battery feature, I consider it more of an emergency backup battery. I have gotten a ½ charge at best. Don't get me wrong: any charge is better than none and a ½ charge is more than enough in an emergency! The unit is small - about the size of the phone - so it could be a great thing for trips where battery life is at risk. I will certainly use if for long travels and to areas where signal strength is limited, as that is a real battery killer.
1400069807|5.0|I follow information about the food industry as a long time subscriber to Science in the Public Interest and still found new information about the processed food industry in this book.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie keeps you engaged. It is an action movie, but the main character is not Rambo and shows her soul and character. Thoughtful portrait of the show business.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|its an awesome game except for a few glitches but other than that its a epic game and i recommend it i have for my kindle and my iphone
B007K3JFUQ|2.0|I enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes. It felt fresh and Robert Downey Jr. was masterful as the clever, over-the-top detective. But Game of Shadows feels hollow and dull. Where is the mystery? Suspense? The banter between Holmes and Watson? It just feels void of anything new and refreshing.<br /><br />It has its moments, and of course they are when both Jude Law and Downey Jr. are on screen together. They make a great pair but I thought their relationship would be more fleshed out here. We got a nice glimpse of it in the first movie and I was left wanting more. Here, not much happens in terms of evolving their characters. It feels emotionless, even during a moment that should be full of it. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Moriarty has to be one of the most boring villains ever. He's trying to make the most of his role, but the script and plot is so lacking, there's almost no point. Sherlock doesn't even have much of a chance to show off his powers of deduction, or any of his skills actually. No violin plucking, no wit, just a couple of fight scenes.<br /><br />I don't know what happened to this movie but if they ever intend to make a third I hope they stick to the source material or at least try to actually invent a plot. Sherlock Holmes fans; skip this one and head straight for the Sherlock miniseries for a truly remarkable experience.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I never take the time to write a review after reading a book, although I know I should, but I've also not enjoyed a book this much. I haven't watched the movie, and I'm very thankful for that because this book drew me in and had my mind completely wrapped around it. Five stars, kudos, two thumbs up, and every other cliche you can imagine go to Nicholas Sparks. This tale of love, survival, and coping to change doesn't disappoint! This book continuously surprised me! Not only is it a romantic love story, but also a thriller. The twists in the story had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. You start out reading thinking it's the typical, sappy love story and that it's going to be like all the others, but as you read further on, you become engrossed in the lives of Katie and Alex and their juicy pasts. I enjoyed reading this book and I would, without a doubt, recommend it to everyone. It is worth every cent. Buy this book, everyone! You won't be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|In it's inception, It was brilliant.  But, like everything else, One has to keep up with technology, and change which was effective and simple evolved into what is competitive, and overwhelming.  To keep current, you have to (a). be psychic, or (b).tied to FB just to keep up with the changes!  It's like using penny-stock websites.  These people are cloned to their equipment.<br /><br />O.k. Zuckerberg, you're a ingenious trip. Not all of us are.  Keep it simple, and don't use any sophistry to underwrite your security and account security protocols.  Don't use this competitiveness to ruin what you began. I've kept my account for three years, and what the hell. after what I posted...who really cares? LOL Annette

1451695195|1.0|My brother told me about this book, he said it was &#34;good reading&#34;.  However, I read a few chapters and it scared me.  Hoping it would get better as I read along, I read more chapters. To my dismay, the chapters got worse and worse!  Some chapters centered on the doctor's condition (which I wasn't interested) or they centered on going to Heaven.  I state truthfully that since my reading/scanning some 10 or 11 chapters, I am scared to the core of my soul!  I scanned his &#34;condition chapters&#34; because I wanted to 'see' what he saw in Heaven; after all, it's called Proof Of Heaven!  Now, almost every single night I have nightmares about the words he wrote about the 'CORE' of Heaven!  I purely would place this book under the heading of Horror Books! After reading some of this book, my nerves are bad during the day and my nights are filled with horrific dreams of exactly the same words he wrote what he thought he saw of Heaven!  According to him, we all are going through some, horrible, horrible things before we can get to 'part of Heaven&#34; He said we had to work our way, upon dying, to reach a high level where our loved ones are dwelling!  After reading what I did, I deeply FEAR dying!

B00CL0J99K|4.0|I am openly conflicted about \\"Iron Man 3.\\" On one hand, I am desperately trying to achieve objectivism in my review. I enjoyed it. It had a solid plot, it tied wonderfully to Joss Whedon's \\"The Avengers,\\" and a majority of its special effects are a technical marvel. I thought that the casting was superb, and personally the inclusion of Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce always make a filmbetter. All-in-all, the quality of the film sits snugly between the first and the second Iron Man films.<br /><br />However, on the other hand, I was incredibly dismayed to learn that, \\"Iron Man 3\\" would be Robert Downey, Jr's last standalone Iron Man film. In this context, \\"Iron Man 3\\" disappoints. It doesn't invoke the same sense of finality that I experienced when watching Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Rises.\\" \\"Iron Man 3\\" felt like a strong mid-entry to the series, but not the epic conclusion that should be expected from the franchise. However, it has been pointed out to me that Robert Downey Jr. will reprising his role for \\"The Avengers 2,\\" so maybe a more adequate `conclusion' to Iron Man will present itself within the confines of an Avengers film.<br /><br />Personal reservations aside, \\"Iron Man 3\\" is a topnotch Marvel film. It dives into the character by making Iron Man fallible, resulting in a two-hour character exploration--One of both his weaknesses and strengths. The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley) and the founder of A.I.M. (Aldrich Killian played by Guy Pearce) are excellent villains and far superior than \\"Iron Man 2's\\" subpar Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). I also enjoyed Marvel Studios' deviation from the more-famous Iron Man comic book plots. It held true to the character (for the most part), but was removed enough to surprise comic book and films fans alike.<br /><br />I thought that the special effects were top notch, save for the fire effects used for the A.I.M. henchmen. The were starkly different from the other special effect heavy scenes, which made them appear dated and cheap. The end sequence was gorgeously rendered and nearly all of the scenes involving the Iron Man armor were meticulously dazzling; they were fluid and excellently scripted.<br /><br />My only complaint, besides the shoddy A.I.M. fire effects, is that Stark seems to break character towards the end of the movie. The script alters the very core of the character's personality, and it as-if the exploratory elements of the film override the source of Iron Man. I am curious to see if Joss Whedon carries this new `Tony Stark' into \\"The Avengers 2,\\" or decides to follow a more comic book-like rendition of the character that was presented to audiences in the first two Iron Man films. Whedon will be struggling between cohesion and character integrity, but with his directing and writing chops I am sure a happy median exists.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Iron Man 3\\" is a good film. It is better than the last and is on par with the other Marvel Universe films. Besides my own comic book snobbiness and reluctance to see Robert Downey, Jr. leave the mantle, \\"Iron Man 3\\" is more than worth the price of a couple of movie stubs.<br /><br />I give \\"Iron Man 3\\" four-stars-out-of-five.heap.

B00CRR5YA0|4.0|I notice that all the people who complained along the lines of one or two stars are disappointed that this soundtrack is not like the originals, such as the ones by Horner.  Frankly, that's not a bad thing.  The movies themselves are a new step, an alternate version of the original Star Trek.  Giacchino is giving a new sound to an awesome movie.  Change is not always such a bad thing.  Perhaps the only fault I can find is that Giacchino uses some repetitive notes in his action themes. Still,if anyone ever listens to Jaws 1's soundtrack, the whole movie is repetitive notes, and John Williams did that, and made it great.<br />Additionally, I note that the introduction of a special Klingon theme may have significant implications, i.e. that there may be another movie and that the Klingons will be the bad guys.

I wish the show would never end but I know it will someday. Thank you for everyone's hard work.

Good story line and it actually incorporates some of the other justice league charactors. We have had it less than a day and are watching it for the second time. Good for kids and adults. It's a good break from some of the unwatchable kids stuff that is out there.

Not only would I recommend it, I have already installed it for someone else's Android. 2017 UPDATE: There is a new automatic update to this classic favorite of mine, but I can live with it. The addition of the offer of 3 more games is now resident on the playing screen. Just pretend you don't see it.  Like me, you probably already have the other games being offered also by Mobility Ware.

B009NY43NY|4.0|Despite holes in the story, I thought Dead Ever After wrapped up quite a bit of the Sookie story. I found the third-person perspectives distracting and unnecessary - I would've preferred direct action in the story to provide the information given in those scenes. Disappointing was - spoiler alert - the very few moments we get to see of the vampires (Bill, Eric and Pam) and because of that, plus who she ends up with, the title of the book makes no sense at all. I love the Sookie series but this book seems to take for granted that After Dead will be released in October and will fill in any gaps. I think Dead Ever After could've been more tightly and completely written, giving us a more satisfying ending.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a highly interesting portrayal of family dynamics with a good solid plot. The characters are very well drawn.
B00CRW2066|5.0|It's been a long time since I've found an album that I can just sit and listen to over and over again and hear something different each time.  This is one of those albums.  It's beautifully complex.  Also I'm not sure it warrants an \\"explicit\\" warning.  As far as I can tell the \\"F\\" word is said once in one song and you can barely even hear it.  I have a 3 yr old and 1 yr old and we listen to this album together all the time.
0312567448|5.0|Purchased this for a friend who loves Sex and the City! Never been hugged harder! Even had the love letter from the movie bookmarked...
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good action, good interelationship between Cruise and Pike.  Well directed and good screenplay.  On par with Taken.  Probalbly see a sequel or two.
B001JU4S44|1.0|MI-2 is the worst movie of the Mission Impossible franchise.  There is no \\"MI Team\\", and special effects are not a substitute for a plot.<br /><br />As one person said, I really didn't believe you could make a boring motorcycle chase.....er, well I know now that it can be done.<br /><br />MI-1 is excellent, MI-2  please just skip it.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I've liked Bonnie Raitt for a long time.  I heard one of the cuts on the radio, and got interested.  When I found that this was a new album, I bought it on faith.  I love most all of the cuts.  Her renditon fo Jerry Rafferty's &#34;Right Down the Line&#34; is just terrific.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I have this game on the I pad wanted to see difference in game play<br />Game is interesting to play
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A really good choice for anyone who loves history.  It is not for young children, however. because there are graphic scenes of different events that would be disturbing to young viewers.  I'm a retired teacher and would not show this to anyone younger than high school.  I would also probably get permission before showing it to high school classes.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have this game on the I pad wanted to see difference in game play<br />Game is interesting to play
B007JQLNXG|5.0|wonderful album.  the covers are fantastic; the classics a refreshing treat.  mercy street is especially haunting, beautiful tapestry of sound.  the orchestra fits with PG's style just right, as i had often described his work to others as orchestral, creating movements rather than simple melodies and songs. check it out.
1568987846|5.0|Just watching at the pictures in this book is very relaxing and inspiring. Excellent book. I love this photography style.
B0000CJXN1|4.0|Bond goes back to Jamaica. The novel holds up well. Honeychile Rider is alluring on paper as she was on screen. Fleming's Bond is a fully realized character who lives life like there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />Reviewed by, David Feeney, author; [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Excellent movie with a fast pace.<br />Excellent casting.<br />Liked especially Jim Kirk.<br />Old Spok from the movie series is a nice touch.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game, plenty to do, good graphics and sound. Nice surprises. G5 always comes through with a good product. Splurged for full game.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a life changing book....a must read for everyone!  I have read it and re-read it.  It's inspiring and life changing.  I watched an interview with the author, Don Miguel Ruiz.  He was incredible and I bought the book as I was watching the interview.  He had such insight.  You won't be disappointed...well maybe with yourself, as you practice trying to keep the 4 agreements! LOL  Practice makes perfect!  Buy the book!
0783231032|5.0|1941 is one of those movies that makes you blow your drink out of your nose! The all-star cast kept me in stitches from start to finish. This definitely shows a different side of Steven Spielberg than most of us are used to.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|great series would watch it again and again. the show is awesome would recommend it anyone. Too bad it ended.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I found this one to be very good. Nicholas Sparks kept me reading - even when I should have been reading other things (like for my own children's writing.) He weaves a good story, and this, I felt, is one of his best.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Since their first album Deep Purple has had the ability to consistently produce great material. This album is no different. It has its slow moments and Ian's voice has lost some of it's range but all in all this album stacks up with anything else they've put out before.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Great performances by all, Jennifer Lawerence made me wish I was 40yrs younger! She was terrific...........the film had so much going on it kept you very busy with how each characters life battles affected anothers
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This is a fun app but phone freezes a lot of and uses a lot of battery. colors are bright and fun to watch fish and new things grow. A great brain dead app for when you just need to fill dead space.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game rules it is so much like temple run but it is so much funner I hope this review makes you get this app
B000VIPJKM|5.0|If you need to cheer up, this movie is funny and can lighten up your day. I feel like I am &#34;Elle&#34; at times and I wish more chick flicks were like this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am waiting for season 3 to begin..  I have followed it from the beginning and would buy the 3 season if I could.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think the game is amazing but it would be better if u could sell your old cars and the higher it's upgraded the more it's worth
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Definitely worth a read.  Very intriguing story and as a fan of Manson, it explains a lot.  Lol<br /><br />Awesome book!
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Fast moving, keeps you interested all through the movie and great character interaction. A statement of how things are really  going in the U.S. at this time.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Once again Speilburg has outdone himself with another great and heartwarming movie that is sure to be a classic. A must watch.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awsome this a great  because my brother and i work toge ther and we help each other
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I own this game on Steam, and I always thought it'd be a perfect game for the Android crowd and touchscreen products. Looks like I was right!<br /><br />A great little time-waster when you need to fill ten minutes or so - but you can also sit down and play it for longer stretches of time. Engaging, simple to learn but harder to strategize, and runs like butter on my older phone and tablet. Hope to see more from this company.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|As I read this book I realized it was a &#34;diary&#34; presentation and found much redundancy.  This could have been that her daily life was redundant.  I found it a 'slow' read, and felt she should have told her story to a writer.  In the end I appreciate that she was 'saved', but it was anti-climactic in the book.
0425252868|4.0|I got this book for my dad and he loved every page of this book. It was historical and an easy read.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO TWEET, AND EVERYDAY IT GETS A LITTLE BETTER....HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE GOOD OKAY OKAY
B006ZZANG0|4.0|Another great album from Rufus Wainwright.<br />I listen to the songs \\"Rashida\\", \\"Montauk\\" and \\"Out of the Game\\" several times a day.<br />The album also comes with a bonus DVD, about the making of the album.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is so refreshing! It's totally unexpected! I love it that it's in a man's POV. I instantly fell in love with Drew. He is completely blind about his feelings.the story is hilarious! You laugh, cry, and even become a hopeless romantic if you aren't one. I do wish it had an epilogue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a terrific game!!! Me and my kids love it!! They love the thrill of jumping trains and getting chased by a cop and his cute dog!!! Thank you subway surfer creaters!!!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love the way the &#34;bad&#34; people on the show are portrayed in a manner as to give insight into how they chose to be bad and not good.  And how the &#34;good&#34; people recognize the &#34;bad&#34; people could be good and give them opportunity.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Sometimes I play it just for the music.  Tho, I wish it was full screen not wide screen.  Lent my widescreen one out and have yet to retrieve it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game I loved it This is a very addictive game I thought it would be 1.99 cause it is so action packed
B00364K6YW|5.0|Love this movie!  Longer than the newer version but due to the age of the film not quite as sharp as I would like.  But I'm a sucker for a happy ending.
B0073B587E|2.0|It would have been more impressive if there was real teaching content like chords and scales.<br />I sent it back.
B000VAPZM2|4.0|This movie is a cute story, appropriate for tweens, but a little long for them (the extended version). Showed it to a group of tween girls who were really into it for first 40 mins, then got a little slow and lost their interest. Last 15 minutes piqued their interest again.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|If you like the old Black Isle titles and/or Diablo,  you'll like this game. It goes slow if you don't want to spend any money, but its still a lot of fun.
B00908DDZM|4.0|Could be better if it left out all the #22!%**#@ swear words you don't need that many ###@@!!!!%%%$&&&*Swear words.. Laughed through most of the tracks and all but 2 songs are excellent.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Very cool novelty. I couldn't see anyone actually learning to play the piano on this but the play along is a cool feature for those who don't know how to play. Overall cool app.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|I realize that Brandon had a monumental task of completing this series, but this was just a poorly written book.  The disjointed way the book bounced between characters and events was annoying.  The battles made absolutely no sense what so ever.  This was a major failure in the story line.<br />The characters themselves did not even seem close to what they were in previous books.  This was more like watching a cartoon of an epic story instead of reading the actual book.<br />I think the thing that annoyed me most was the way that some of the subplots were just ended abruptly.  Other subplots were needlessly drawn out until you just couldn't wait for the character to die already.<br />Some instances were just plain stupid.  The reverse weave of Balefire (something which burns anything out of the pattern) is to turn all darkfriends and cracks into crystal?<br />The ending itself seemed to me to be more like the ending of the Mistborn series.<br />Well, I guess it was an ending, just not a very good one.<br />BTW.  There was no explanation of the how or why the main character finished the way he did nor the reactions from the others.  Kind of mysterious for no good reason.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't game a lot on my phone. I have about 20 games on there and they are only for when I get stuck in a waiting room somewhere and need something to pass the idle time. This game however, had me playing levels instead of doing other things. I probably played through the first 3 level sets in one sitting over the course of an hour or so while watching tv. Great game, and it keeps your mind fit. They say puzzles help improve problem solving skills and increase brain health. Hopefully this is true, because I play this all the time now.
1620402963|5.0|Highly recommended -- Boyd at his recent best here.  Beginning with a young emigree living a perhaps Nina Berberova-esque existence in Paris entre guerres, Boyd weaves a compelling tale of the surprising and often unknown complexities that bind our presents to our pasts.  About as good as pop fiction gets today.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Its a good simple hangman game with basic graphics. If you like hangman you will get a kick out of the game.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Don't waste your money, read the book instead. This is just an average action movie and my expectations were low before I rented it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Another great book although it didn't end how I had hoped (hence the three stars). But a must read for Sookie fans! Glad Quinn made an appearance and hope he makes it onto the show!
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I found the first few chapters a bit slow to pull you in but get through these and you wont put this book down.  All three books were the same intense read.<br /><br />Would recommend this book!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I listened to Les Miserables with ear phones in the hospital.  It helped distract me.  I couldn't concentrate enough to read or watch TV, but the music took me a wonderful place.
B003UBTX72|1.0|THIS BOOK IS VERY UNINTERESTING TO ANYONE AND THAT IS WHY YOU SOLD IT SO CHEAP.  DID NOT READ IT
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This a truly a family movie.  It had action, drama, humor all without cursing, nudity or any obscenity.  For those that are not religious it was not a movie that promoted God overly as it does traditional values, morals and responsibility.  It was very realistic and heartwarming.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is awesome. super fun! my nine-year-old grandson just loves it! it can't get any better! again awesome! can't go wrong.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|It's a good movie to own. Kids love it.  Love how they made the movie.  Brings back memories of the 80's arcade games that I used to love and play.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|The movie brings detail and reality to the events. It reminds us we must remain strong and armed. The NAZI's won every election<br /><br />Tom
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Gangster Squad was a nice reprieve from the usual fare, but was very reminiscent of the Untouchables, if any of you remember that one. The cast was great; the costumes and settings really added to the total package.
B00BQ1D91E|5.0|Going to see them live this summer. Absolutely love the album front to back. A must buy for a very under rated band
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It does exactly what I downloaded it to do. I use it for exploring files that are not available as apps for Kindle.
B00004NRWJ|5.0|The old slipknot albums were the best. This is by far the most brutal debut albums out there. Must get if you are a true maggot
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|If you like the arcade version, you will probably like this one. You get a few coins and earn a coin every 30 seconds while you are playing.
B0036BDQ6U|5.0|Pantera are gods and Dimebag will be truly missed for years to come. RIP. Great album if you are just getting in to them.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The only thing missing from this game is the joystick. Pac-Man is one of those games that can be addictive.
B001CDL6ZM|5.0|Great band. I hope they continue to tour and make records. A must buy for any die hard fan. Great band.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I find this show very entertaining and love the scandals. I'm glad amazon prime has this available for free.  I can't wait until season 3 is available
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Never thought I would enjoy reading about the English upper crust and their government but it is all warped around the peoples life's so you can't stop reading
B004ELSDZK|5.0|High quality puzzle. Very entertaining. Recommended for puzzle lovers. Good job. Worth every penny. Great graphics on my nexus ten.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I enjoyed the majority of the movie as the stars mix action with irreverence.  The comic set-pieces work very well and the actors look like they are enjoying their work.  The only draw back for me was gratuitous language near the end of the movie.  I felt that it real wrecked what had been a fun ride up to that point and did not add anything material to the overall plot. I think that without the unnecessary language I might have given it a five star rating.  With the current ending it caused me to waver between three and four stars - it was that disconnected from the rest of the experience.
1402756399|5.0|Incredible quality (cover, images, paper, etc.). I'm just starting reading it, but the edition is the perfect one for a classic like this one.
B003F48E4W|5.0|Have always loved this movie -- supernatural action, mystery, humor, surprise ending -- what more do you need?  If you havent seen it, give it a try!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game<br />I play it all the time with my sister so that provides this game is awesome
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is high action, fast paced game. You can play either online or offline, it will update when you next go online, but must have a Facebook account to do so. It updates your lives by one after about 8 minutes to reach a maximum of 5 or 6. I agree with another review that said it could end up costing you money if you choose to buy more lives or coins. I have had it for about a week now and not spent anything. Just be patient while it refills. It is a lot of fun. Great ap for free!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun but I'm now stuck because I don't want to spend money. there should be a way to keep playing without coughing up cash :(
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's a great free game no glitches an there's plenty of coins so u can upgrade and it doesn't take forever<br />It's addicting an fun
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've been having lots of problems with battery on my Kindle Fire so I downloaded this app. It's been very useful in determining where the drain on my battery is, how much time I've got left for whatever I'm doing (reading, watching videos, playing games or getting online). Love that you can customize colors too, because I'm very girlie and everything has to be shades of pink. Trivial function, I know, but it's something that makes some people happy.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show is awesome. There are many famous guest stars, it is funny at times, and has good thought put into the plots that occur.  I a show by Ridley Scott and Tony Scott must be good so that is why I started watching it.  It definitely did not disappoint me.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I love this movie. I have sence the first time I saw it. I love Audrey Hepburn as Liza. Rex Harrison is great, too.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|funky, disco music of the future. The song with pharrell is awesome, makes my 10 month old daughter dance.  My summer soundtrack for sure.
B009MEEZXI|5.0|An amazing and moving story about a gifted autist who overcame sexism and disability to transform our understanding of both human and animal psychology. Beautifully written, directed and acted first to last--a must-see!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book!!:) I think Rick riordan did a great job with this book!!:) he does great with all his books!!!:)
B008MEM24S|3.0|Where is my water was a better game with more levels. This is fun but was disappointing after the other game.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Hadn't heard much about this movie but, after watching it, my husband and I were very pleasantly surprised by how it kept us guessing about the outcome.  Well acted!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|My daughter told me about Flashlight app.  It's great to NOT have to carry a flashlight in my car / purse / or anywhere.  Thanks!
0812982622|4.0|I understand that this book won the Pulitzer prize.  I expected something out of the ordinary and I wasn't disappointed. The writing is impressive.  I'm giving it 4 stars although reading it was relentlessly depressing.  Yes, there was some humor but mostly satire/sarcasm about the unbelievable brainwashing that takes place in North Korea.<br /><br />The main character, Pak Jun Do, is the humane element and his sufferings - and his acceptance of all the unfairness - is what was most depressing.  Torture scenes (too many) were quite brutal. Jun Do is enamored of the poster of a famous national movie actress, Sun Moon, and gives his life for her. Unfortunately, Sun Moon's personality is one of a cold, selfish woman so that Jun Do's infatuation with her, even when he meets her in person, is hard to understand.<br /><br />But not to worry, all is well that ends in disaster.  The only redeeming feature in this relationship is Sun Moon's children and their eventual fate.<br /><br />Despite of the negatives, it was an engrossing experience.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The movie was .. OKAY .. the book is 8x's better.  Actually the stories are a tad different, they should have named the movie something else. The one thing I liked about the movie is the dance competition, the book's version is, well ... you'll have to read it to find out. You'll find the book version fills in a lot of the gaps of what's going on and there are a couple of nice surprises as well that weren't put in the movie (for one reason or another).
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I am definitely hooked! The arcade part is very fun, and I'm really liking the mineral one right now too. I haven't gotten to the rest of them yet but I'm sure they're great.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|an excellent read like all his books.  I couldnt put it down.  I read his books so fast. I need to break between reading his books or I get them all mixed up
B007N31YH0|5.0|Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Kind of says it all. Robert Shaw , Eileen Brennan wow. This movie is a treat.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|what a true hero and patriot!  direct, honest, and brave.  To survive all that combat and then to die the way he did, just doesnt seem right.  what a damn shame.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I love Jack Reacher.  Have read some of these before; but decided to start from the &#34;start&#34;.  Great read.  Am not on book 4.  Plan to keep on keeping on...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is very enjoyable, with the right blend of complexity and difficulty.  The solutions are very logical but not too hard to overcome.  I enjoyed this app very much and can't wait for another edition.
B000244EMO|5.0|Clean, clear copy of the film. Still a great movie with cool characters and an awesome looking Stan Winston monster!!!! Still holds up today.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was so different from what I usually read. I didn't give it 5 stars because by the end it was really starting too be just &#34;too much&#34;. Most of my friends have read it and all felt the same way. A fun read.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I only have 1 complaint. Why can't I see memes? It says for me to update but even after I do it doesn't change anything.<br />Otherwise this app is great.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I like that this gives me the ability to actually hold things on the City Mini, but at this point I am really disappointed with the City Mini and the need to buy 8 million 3rd party accessories in order to make it useful. The stroller organizer itself is good, in that it gives you 2 cupholders and space for toys/keys/wallet, etc. The velcro that holds it on the stroller handle is hard to get level and stay in place, as it naturally has some movement.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a great app to have on my Kindle Fire. I like how I can have several different locations set, to see weather conditions where friends and family may live. I'm also impressed with how accurate the forecast is too. The ability to set alerts/warnings is also a great plus.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|If you want to laugh your head off then just watch this and any one of Jim Carrey's movies...hilariously funny!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|In a few short weeks I have found this to be the easiest and most successful diet plan I've ever tried and I have tried too many including Primal and Paleo, Atkins, The Zone and other combinations. Once a week is a cheat day; ANYTHING GOES and knowing that day is coming makes not cheating for 6 days easier. My problem with all diets is that I redoubled on fruit and now understand that this was worse in its way than processed sugar.<br /><br />Diet is only the beginning - this is a how to book on becoming more athletic and achieving more with less. Worth every penny and more.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like the game but after 5/24/13 update game Opens to show that it's loading then returns to kindle home menu
B0070Y46UY|5.0|In the book and also in the move, one of the characters said the protagonist's story will make you believe in God.  This is such a heart warming story for anybody of any denomination
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Because I liked the movie a lot. There isn't anything I did like about the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie
B0011XBLUS|4.0|What can be better than this Spaghetti Western with Clint?  Great cast, music and direction.  This director is Quinton Tarentino's inspiration
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Simple to the point and just makes sense. Once you do it or a while it is relatively easy and something you can maintain for the rest of your life.<br /><br />We all eat too much anyway!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The best to start off with.  If you like this season, wrap up the Matt Smith's and then watch the others. Worth the time!
B008602KQI|5.0|Sad story. Although it's depicted as a fictional story it is the reality of what our lives are like now, people going into war killing people strangers. THe film itself is done really well. The cinematography, edit, and the impact they make with the contrasting costumes
B0049IWQJW|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining...great story line which even had our 2 year old grandsons totally mesmerized as well as their grandparents!<br />An all-around great movie for the family to enjoy!
B00CW665VI|5.0|If you enjoy levity with your hot and steamy, this book is a MUST READ.  I can't remember when I loved a book more.  It was laugh-out-loud funny.  I don't normally enjoy first person POV, but THIS book (from the Hero, Drew's POV) was one of the most enjoyable books I have read all year and I have read a bunch. I can't wait for the next in this series.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My favorite characters are Gibbs and Tony but the whole cast is wonderful. I love the interviews, car chases, and the head slaps.
B00138KKFS|5.0|Recorded Live In Memphis is one of many of Elvis' Best Albums<br /><br />I bought this back in 1974 when it was on vinyl.<br />updated it to Playlist.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I have a blast playing this game! You can't take your eyes off the game for a second while playing it.  I only wish that there were more plays, because, they run out so fast.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The story is very sad but beautiful.  The music is unforgettably haunting and beautiful at the same time.<br />Bring your kleenex.  It is sad and uplifting at different times. Do not  say &#34;It's only another sad movie.  You will be making a big mistake. The acting and singing are superb.  No wonder it won &#34;Best Picture&#34;  Golden Globes, this year!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I adore daft punk! This album is by far the best album I will probably buy this year! The best birthday gift I got!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Thanks for a heartwarming, touching story.  Enzo shares his observations, feelings and experiences with intense empathy and sensitivity.  Smiles mix with tears.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Oh my gosh, this show is great!!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. I recommend it for anyone interested in the Sherlock Holmes franchise.
B006C45CFG|5.0|Enjoyed this product! Great movie with something in it for everyone. Great for movie night with family or friends. Enjoy all!
B001XULSG6|4.0|Feels like the next gen that I grew up with, but I'm sure that if you dont know the characters you'll be a little lost
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed this product! Great movie with something in it for everyone. Great for movie night with family or friends. Enjoy all!
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|I bought the app and it wouldn't let me download it onto my kindle. I really wanted to play the game.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Enjoyed this product! Great movie with something in it for everyone. Great for movie night with family or friends. Enjoy all!
B009G41CG2|5.0|I really like this game!  It's fun to use, good graphics, easy to use.  Would recommend to others, for sure!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln is depicted as a human being instead of an icon.  A very troubling issue - whether or not slavery was abolished by the Emancipation Proclamation - is explained in laymen's terms.  And Tommie Lee Jones is wonderful as Thad Stevens!
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I was dissapponted with this  short version, because it was obvious  to me that there were some scenes missing in it
B005ETA5K2|1.0|This product did not work at all. I was on the phone for two days with their support tech. He could not get it to work. After which he would not call me back.  He was never again on call.  When I finally did reach him after many e-mail messages, he came on line and could not get the system to work. Then left me hanging, told me he could not help me.  I have been using computers for some 30+ years. So I know what to do. Eventually after his last call, the WIFI equipment in my laptop cease to work at all. I believe the antenna caused internal damage. I had a signal before installing this junk antenna.  The Tech admitted they had a lot of problems. He was rude in his manners. I definitely do not recommend this signal booster to any one. I have since found out from an online technical forum that it has been a disaster for many people. I will say that Amazon took the defective booster back and gave me full credit.  Thank God I was dealing with a reputable company and will buy from them again. I had to buy a new laptop as it cost too much to repair the original after the WIFI card was burned out, yes it was an older HP but worked very well.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|Just had it a short while. So far So Good. Like better than Pandora.Having issues with some songs loud, some too low.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Sure, its a sexy story, but yes it is poorly written.  I guess that's what you get with a story written as fan fiction for Twilight.<br /><br />I'm curious of what happens in the next book but won't be wasting my money on it.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I don't know how she does it each time, but her characters come to life as you read on. Your hooked after the first page!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I read her last year’s great success Gone Girl first, and I’ve been tracing her backward. I’ve done Dark Places, now in the middle of Sharp Objects. Gone Girl is her best so far. This is the most sophisticated one and highly entertaining. But her compelling storytelling talent is obvious from the first, Sharp Objects. You can see her signature.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I got this book a few years ago in paperback and loved it. I think it's the strongest of the series I ended up loaning it out. When it came available in electronic format, I was very pleased to grab a download so now I can have it around whenever the mood strikes me. I've reread it a few times over the years.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I already had his plugged in live CDs from Royal Albert Hall and Beacon Theater. This acoustic masterpiece is icing on the Bonamassa cake! The sound quality is incredible. A must have if you own a good sound system
B00985E3UG|4.0|The reader should be prepared to have nightmares about yogurt that has more sugar than cake. If the food industry even tried to mend their ways now, they would risk sinking there businesses.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|A dramatic finish to the prematurely euthanized series Firefly. Has all of your favorite characters, some of which are dropped in some pretty heart-wrenching scenes. It's not as satisfying as another season would have been, but it's a good bundle of entertainment in its own right.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very addicting and fun game that is amazingly so simple but one of the best games i have ever played. It is a must get game for ur android device. I would recommend everyone to get this app.
B003HARV4S|5.0|This is a fun movie to show friends who have never seen it. The special effects feel very organic, and the drama is well-formed. It's a little more low-key and has a higher finish and less moral exploration than its temporal cousin, The Prestige. Good for re-watching.
B0098A1TEE|4.0|Caro Emerald's dulcet tones do not disappoint. She has an uncanny ability to stay modern all the while reminiscent of a jazz age that has been a heavy influence..
B001EN71CW|5.0|Must-have for any self-respecting nerd and the friends who love them. It's often described as a sci-fi western, and that's exactly what it is. It's a crying shame that the series was canceled. The discs themselves are durable, and the picture/audio quality is great.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game is only fun for a few mins if you are in the can for 5 mins or something. After that I deleted this from my kindle and android phone since it's not worth keeping.
0345308239|4.0|Got this for my boss once, and he loved it. Gives you a bit of cred with history aficionados after you've read it and can bring it into conversation.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I had so much  fun playing this game if you have free tome then buy and start playing 5 stars
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I thought about asking for a credit, because this movie was so bad! I have over 6 years of college and still could not understand what this crazy movie was about. Never made any sense to me or my wife! If I could rate it less than 5 stars I would!
B007REV4YI|4.0|The product is just what I ordered and I am happy with it.  I would give the seller and product my recommendation
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This is the first album I've bought in a while, and I was more than impressed. I love every song on it, and i've been playing it every day to and from work, to get myself pumped up.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Has many different shapes fun to do also let's you see how fast others have done the game you are playing in a way it's not a big draw back to enjoyment of the game
074322454X|5.0|I'm a Computer Science and History student at the University at South Carolina, and I was doing a pretty big paper on World War II. All I gotta say is that i found this book to be incredibly helpful, it was inspiring, hooking, and well written. Ambrose is a true Historian and Storyteller and I cant recommend this book enough for curious individuals to rocking Historians. If you are a WWII buff, you need to read this book. Give these young men their props.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|My wife and I heard halestorm on the 2013 golden gods awards and have been Rocken to them ever since.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is a great CD, and if you love Folk music I highly recommend listening to this. They have a great style, and good morals. Love this CD!
193700788X|4.0|A well done ending for the series. The story stays true to the characters, nothing seems forced to neatly wrap things up, which is appreciated.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Fantastic on Kindle! HD is wionderful on Kindle. Try it. Great in 9&#34;. You will love it too. Go Kindle
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book. Like a lot of people I got into the show before the books, there are some slight differences but all in all this book follows the first season pretty well. If you're a fan of the show or of just fantasy novels I would recommend that you give this book a read.<br /><br />I'm off to the second in the series
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I love this show and when I was randomly browsing amazon, I searched the DVD set and it came up for a great price so I immediately purchased it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|An amazing tale of survival almost so real you might think it actually happened. I couldn't stop reading. Max keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's next, who else survived and how.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Each episode is like a little movie. This show is really entertaining and very well done. I can't wait to watch season 2!
0545265355|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a straight genius. I hope she has more books coming up. I would like to read more. I can't wait until the movies come out.
1400082773|5.0|I read the book for class. It was great to read about his life and it was useful to understand race in America
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|as much as I like jimi, this is not his best. would like to have a better choice of his music
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|rocked the whole birthday party with fun.  talented lady miss katy,  my niece was very happy with it all. thanks.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Thanks to Amazon to give this game for free!!!! Its simply brilliant!!!!! Love it soo much!!.Amazing grapgics at this game :-)

B000YJ54DU|5.0|great!  as always the jack reacher books are great.  lee child is a good author and hopefully will continue writing jack reacher novels.
B001AITGWE|5.0|Falling down has always been a favorite of mine since I first saw it in 93! Michael Douglas doesn't usually play a NUT! HAHA
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is always awesum,as usual its my favorite site,the one place to keep in contact with all my friends and family
B007BVT5N4|5.0|i chose 5 stars because it helps you get to know Justin better than you knew him before. I would recommend this book to beliebers and people who want to know Justin Better.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I love all the movies and have watched them a dozen times, just didn't care for the game, sometimes things should remain what they start out to be....
B004RKXNDU|5.0|I saw the Gary Oldman movie and decided to reread and see how closely the movie followed the book. I became immersed in 'Smiley's World' and forgot the comparison. The characters are so well drawn and the plot has such interesting twists. Definitely worth a re (or first) read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This was/is a great workout for my brain. It had me thinking and concentrating, which is difficult for me. I enjoy the challenge.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered about life in North Korea. Suffice it to say, whatever you have imagined has not prepared you for the brutality, the perversion, the hideousness of the iron rule which the people are subjected to. The intricate plot will have you glued to your Kindle, and it all comes together well at the end. Though gruesome and disturbing, the story is told with a mood of magical realism, distancing the reader from the horror. It is hard to imagine that this world exists, yet after reading, hard to go back to believing that it does not.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Very good graphics and interesting layout. Has a good pace to it and good challenges. Enjoy the series of hidden object adventures.
0307474259|2.0|I'll have to admit that I could not get through the book. There were just too many false assumptions and statements made in the book without any real evidence to back up his claims. There are some basic information that is worthwhile, so it doesn't make the book a complete waste. However, he dis-spells the 'myth' of exercise reducing fat by a statement and suggesting that the experts are wrong. Then goes on to purport his own theory without any backing. So what makes his theories any more real than other evidence, especially admitted heuristic evidence we all see? well, nothing really - just his word. I don't think that's good enough.<br /> For that reason I couldn't get through the book as there was just too much 'selling' rather than any science behind his beliefs.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I loved the show and look forward to the next season?<br />I just about love all if the BBC series, once I discovered how great it was, that was it!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|So much fun to watch, I keep on going!  More excellence from J. J. Abrams.  Excited to see how it all ends.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|The damn thing was too short. How's that for a delicate truth? Bravo Mr. DJM Cornwell or whatever the truth of your name is.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Great way to combine your reading experience with great music.<br />Jazz Radio is much more than just Jazz, it's music at its best.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would read anything this man wrote. Beautiful. A sad story but very well told. Not violent like the last two but poignantly transcendent nonetheless.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I was very excited to get the app, and when I first got it all the restaurants were unlocked, but after I updated it, half of the restaurants became locked. If a company is going to charge an additional $5.94 to get the whole game after spending an initial $0.99 to buy a game, then I feel like they are not a trustworthy company. The game itself was fun, but they really need to be upfront about the true cost of the whole game, not just part of it.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This series has a talented cast, smart writing and excellent execution by the entire team. The photography and direction are superb.
B008D36INE|2.0|I like Rachel Weisz normally, but this movie was not her finest. I'd say its mostly due to the writing and directing, it's very very slow and the story line uninteresting. I didn't finish it.
193700788X|1.0|I was so excited when the final book in the Sookie Stackhouse series came out. I love the series and burn through the books in a day. But from the beginning of the book, it seemed almost like someone other then Charlaine Harris wrote this book. The style is totally different, and it didn't flow the way the other books did. The story was lame and didnt make sense, and the ending was VERY VERY anticlimactic. And as a huge fan of Eric, I was extremely disappointed with the ending. I couldn't help but think about in Deadlocked, when Sookie has the daydream about everyone's life ending up all nice and perfect and with a neat little bow. It was almost as if Ms. Harris decided she was done with the series, and just rushed to end it. Said that this will be the last book about Sookie, Eric, Pam and the rest.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it! It is hard to put down and the characters are all so very cute. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the movies.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Mr. Owen's account of the training, preparation and execution of the covert raid to take out Bin Laden was indeed facinating reading.  After seeing or reading numerous perspectives of this operation, I think his is the most authoritative and likely the most accurate for that reason.
0452289963|5.0|Tolle rocks. Learning how life becomes richer as we let go of ego and all its' trappings, how there is a place called the now that is accessible, are life lessons that can bring us to a better life.  Read it for a better life.  Easy to understand and the sort of book you will buy to share with others.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|Film is great never gets boring definitely lives up to the action from previous die hard movies. Would recommend this movie
B005HSG3U6|3.0|Overall I think its worth the purchase. I does all that's included the only issue I had was when I put the kindle in it case in my bag the corners of the case were stained a blackish brown from tune Colorado of the bag. Other than that it was pretty good.
B00AEBB8FQ|5.0|If the movie was any funnier in a slapstick kind of way I would not be able to watch it for fear of suffocation from lack of breath. It is hilarious.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic account, ,not for the squeamish, but a portrait of what our fighting men have gone through for us and this country. BOOYAH!!!
0783226888|2.0|This movie I watched when I was about 18 or so for the first time and It was entertaining. I did not look for the why or how factor. The acting is decent but the plot is way out there as far as the method of assassination. Without giving anything away. It makes too little sense. When I was young it was about the thrill. Now looking back on it you can think of a thousand things wrong with the scenerio.
0345501292|4.0|There is so much behind the scenes info and photos in this book, it's almost overwhelming at first.  The writing style is a tad on the dry side, but overall the presentation and information is excellent.  A must have for any serious Indy fan.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|The movie is very good the cast seems to click very well in their roles leaving a very funny action movie. I am very critical of action movies because of most impossible action sequences in them. This has a few but nothing I cannot overlook with the help of the plot and the humor. I really liked it.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Edge-of-your-seat read. Another Baldacci treat with turns and twists to keep the suspense crackling right up to the end.  Perfect beach read.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb is noted for shattering icons several eons before other thinkers catch up with him, as in Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, where he noted that the unforeseen is where the intellectual wild cards look first and the academic careerists never look. Well, the wild cards knew that anyway. But this new book, Antifragility, treads ground where only the wildest of the wild cards had even tiptoed: getting the crap beat out of you now and then makes you more successful, biologically and evolutionarily speaking.<br />The only thinker who got there ahead of Taleb was the pioneering endocrinologist Hans Selye, who noticed that, just as his lab experiments showed that injecting mice with various irritants produced the same symptoms, many human diseases had similar symptoms, leading to the theory of &#34;general adaptation syndrome,&#34; for which Salye coined the term &#34;stress,&#34; now used in many languages. His 1974 book Stress Without Distress proposed that living organisms need stress to maintain vigor, and that distress can be too little irritation rather than too much - the racehorse never allowed into full gallop will get sick and die.<br />Readers of Antifragility will see, from the shoulders of Taleb, how our efforts to cope with stress by minimizing it have serious social and political consequences, softening of the cultural brain and backbone into the mush of political correctness and sweetness and light. The implications for a future backlash of rigor have already been explored in Taleb's books on the unexpected.<br />Atnifragility even has religious insights, such as what did Jesus mean by the controversial and much interpreted &#34;I bring not peace but a sword&#34; remark reported in the Gospel of Matthew 10:34?<br />Antifragility unfortunately has no simple synonym short of inaccurate cliches such a &#34;toughness&#34; so you just have to read the book, which is a feast of great quotes and elegant writing, to see what this great thinker is actually telling us.<br />And after Antifragility, you will surely want to read Selye's Stress Without Distress, which, even though it's not up to date on the now-known role of glucocorticoids, is the antecedent science that fertilized the philosophy.elling us.<br />And after Antifragility, you will surely want to read Selye's Stress Without Distress, which, even though it's not up to date on the now-known role of glucocorticoids, is the antecedent science that fertilized the philosophy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazon had the best price for season 3. I checked everywhere my only complaint is that I could not get it to play through my apple tv and amazon wouldn't play on my smart tv so I had to watch it on my laptop.
B0094KTA4Y|5.0|This Movie is not only appropriate for my 8-year-old daughter, but the enjoyment I & her Grandparents got out if it was pleasantly unexpected!!- the \\" Characters\\" can actually mirror so many of the people in your own life, it's an extremely enjoyable movie..
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game it is fun to play make more of this type of game hope this is enough words for you.
B008602KQI|1.0|very disappointed in the film, I found it to be one dimensional as well as being terribly written-- the camera took far too many close-ups and was never pointed where I wanted it to be, very disappointed.<br />My advice: stick with the book!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Love this game it is fun to play make more of this type of game hope this is enough words for you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I LOVED HOW THE STORY UNFOLDED.  KEPT ME READING FOR HOURS.  THE  SCENARIO IS VERY REAL IN TODAY'S NEWS.  (UNFORTUNATELY).  IF YOU ENJOY SUSPENSE YOU'LL LOVE THE STORY.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|So this game is fun and a good challenge if you like that type of game. Unfortunately, I find the dialogue extremely annoying and without any options to stop the guy from talking before and after every single level I finally gave up. If you are able to power past that, or even enjoy(?) it, then more power to you. I deleted it after about 15 levels and the seemingly never ending insistent badgering from the narrator.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I felt that this movie explains a major difference in atheists and religious people. To live life on logic alone, and what's on the surface is what you get, or live by blind faith, and hope for something possibly more beautiful. It boils down to preference. Have you ever had a religious argument that dragged on and went no where? Well, I guess you'd get similar results trying to tell a vanilla ice cream fan that chocolate is better.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent . Fast paced action. A must for Grisham fans. This could be a big hit at the theatre if a movie is in the works.
B009NY43NY|5.0|A nice conclusion to a very enjoyable series.  I will miss Sookie's adventures.  Why on earth do they require a certain number of words?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. i did not expect it to be so good.loved the unique storyline. looking forward to the next one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A wonderful coming of age tale of 3 high school students as they struggle through one young mans freshman year.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|Yeah, I'm one of you. A room full of memorabilia & already have Destroyer on Vinyl & 2 Versions of CD....  So why did I order another?  I have issues I guess  Lol  I really like the 1st draft of Ken Kelly's artwork & I really like the Alt. solo on &#34;Sweet Pain<br />included. I also loved reading Bob Ezrin's notes on the whole project. I wish there were more outtakes, or alt. versions, but for the price it's reasonable.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|This is a movie review.  I downloaded it on my kindle fire as I was getting on an airplane.  See the headline for review
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show first came out when my son was a newborn. I thought the television previews looked compelling, however our lifestyle didn't leave much room to commit to a new show. When I saw that it was available for free on amazon prime, I was thrilled! Such great writing, characters and chemistry between the characters... It just keeps getting better and better! You can't go wrong with this cast... Give it a shot. You'll be hooked!
B007R12TNQ|3.0|I tried to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and fell asleep... 3 times.  It's not as funny or original as the first.  They used a formula, and it fell short.
B000FA675C|1.0|Brown writes like a 6th grader. If you haven't read this yet, don't. Watch the movie instead. It's one of those rare instances where the movie far, far, FAR exceeds the book. Again, the story is interesting but Brown is a terrible writer. It's just painful.
B007C9N4H8|5.0|It's a Muppet Movie!  Don't know what you're getting... then where have you been?  Jason Segel has done a lot to help bring back this franchise!
B007PBKG5G|4.0|This album has a few songs that stand out, but as a whole its a lot of fun to listen to.
B007Z9QS5K|2.0|This is a movie review.  I downloaded it on my kindle fire as I was getting on an airplane.  See the headline for review
0385333846|5.0|This begins with a bit of autobiography, then Billy Pilgrim is introduced.  This is a story about Billy Pilgrim.  It revolves around his experiences during World War II, but digresses to what happened to him afterward.  Poor Billy becomes crazy later in life. The story says he is not crazy, but to anyone not in his head, he is.  In a storytelling, linear fashion, he joins the Army, goes to France, gets lost and is captured.  As a POW, he is sent to a British camp, then on to do some work in Dresden.  He and others who were with him lived through the senseless bombing of Dresden by burying themselves in the bunker under Slaughter-House 5.  All they saw when they came out was others who were not so deep and so were burned to death.  After the war, he becomes an optometrist and marries the daughter of the school's founder, so he becomes settled and  wealthy, has a daughter, etc., etc.<br /> Mr. Vonnegut wants to write of the Dresden bombing, but does not know how to go about it.  He mentions that he has written some five or six thousand pages and thrown them all away.  He goes to visit an old army buddy.  The friend's wife is stand-offish.  It turns out she is some kind of peacenik and opposes all wars.  She sees this visit as glorifying the war experience these guys had.  When Mr. Vonnegut explains his intentions, and that he will name the book for the Children's Crusade, she thaws considerably.  Obviously, the name for this book comes from the place that saved their lives during the bombing and the failed Crusade those children tried to make.  The obvious futility, senselessness and hidden purposes of both begets his animosity towards wars and reason for writing the story.<br /> I read this story in high school, of course (early 1970's) and remembered how he was in the British POW camp with all the largess the British shared with them, but not with the Russians across the fence.  I remembered that the British gave some explanation of why they did not share across thefence, but now I did not see it.  If someone knows what I am talking about, please share it with me.  I thought the explanation could be used by the Catholic Church and ultra-wealthy as an explanation for their avariciousness.  I would like to ridicule it, but I did not find it here ;(.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This is a psychological mystery thriller, the type of book I usually avoid, but it was highly recommended as a fast, mindless read, something I also avoid, so I found it interesting and it does keep you reading, though vacuous.

B00CO52NLI|3.0|I tried this game some stuff are hard, and easy but some hard stuff is adopion of what a costomor wants. You can try it, but you mite give up.
B007IQX1G4|2.0|Young Adult got panned in the movie theater for a reason.  Just wasn't interesting or funny to me at all.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|The ultimate guide that directs you to focus like a laser beam on those things that are most important in all aspects of your life.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I can't believe this became a movie.  Not sure the director even read the actual book, although he does use quotes directly from the book.  Comepletely asinine... if I could give it a zero I would!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is a good game and you don't have to spend money to upgrade. You do have to get the xp to unlock but you get different suits to have fun. overall it is a good game to play.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|Pretty Funny.  Typical teenager wants to stand on his own two feet, goes through a trial, finds himself and becomes thankful for all he has... new format...I enjoyed it!
B00B5ARKDE|4.0|I love Legos (I own all of the Super Hero Batman sets), Lego video games, the DC collectibles, DC universe, DC Animated movies, Comics, and Batman himself. Great and fun movie. Animation, music, sound, and voices were really good. Vehicles and character themes were straight out of their Lego sets. Movie is good for all ages young and old. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that pretty much most the movie is based from the cut scenes from the Lego Batman 2 video game. I've already beat the game so I feel like I've seen most of the movie. They just remastered/remixed and extended the cut scenes. I wish it was straight from scratch. The early reviews here were mixed so I wasn't sure so I bought it anyways. You can watch video game cut scenes on youtube for free although it's not exactly the same as watching this movie. It comes with an exclusive Clark Kent Lego mini figure which you can't get in any Lego Set.
B005DD7H50|4.0|This was a great movie to rent in a hotel room.  Quick moving, lots of action, and just enough thought process to stay involved!
B00447L4KA|5.0|This was a very interesting movie. It was nice to see both actors at a younger age while they were still creating their own filmed personalities.  Although he will not be able to continue with more films like this,  it just showed the variety of things he could do.
1452110581|5.0|This book was a fast and interesting read... of poems.  From the perspective of cats... and how you are not worthy!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It could use an update. It doesn't even have editing exsisting things or making your own custom things like Unlimited.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This was a fantastic book, written in a unique style... 6 books converging through time to a point.  Each book only 1/2 written... then a forward jump through time.  Then the book reverses itself, finishing each book in reverse order and tying them loosely together!
0061564893|4.0|I read this book several years ago.  I loaned it to someone and never got it back.  I bought it so I could read it again and have it in my library
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was great for my dyslexic daughter to be able to listen to this for English class. It was very helpful.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Well done movie with a variation on young love. Well written.  Well directed.  And well cast,<br />What more is there to say!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|This a gripping movie.  Even though you know what happens it is fasticating to see how it all came about.  This is a must see.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Movie was boring and and premise was a little stupid. Cruise's acting was average. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, this not one of his better movies.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Love this movie.  It is definitly a movie that I could watch over and over.  A must see for everyone who loves a great movie.
B00742LLKU|5.0|I love Debussy and this compilation is one of the best with fantastic performances. I am not an expert but I have enjoyed  loading the cd's onto my cd carousel and having Debussy fill my home with hours of pleasurable music from the whimsical to the ponderous. Tres bien!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The polot twist was okay...a bit predictedable,  At points it dragged.  Bottom line I would not pay for the movie to watch but would watch it if it was a Prime movie option.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I don't think so...so well written and produced it's ridiculous. Haven't repeated an album this many times on my iPod in years...
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Funny and entertaing.  I am not sorry I spent the money to watch this.  I will be getting this for my DVD collection.  I would say it is a chick flick.
B00COGY6YO|5.0|My boys love Lego movies and this movie did not disappoint. This is a great movie if your kids love all the DC super heroes/villains and Legos,
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I expected more from this movie.  Maybe I wasn't in the right mood to watch it.  I wanted to love it but parts were just weird.  I'm not even sure it is worthy of three stars.  Maybe it needs another chance.
1616551151|5.0|LOVE this book. It is an awesome encyclopedia of everything on Thedas. Must have for any collector. It's a gorgeous book and a fat one too.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I have watched the seasons multiple times, and always enjoy it.  Did not ever watch it while it was in prime time, but have enjoyed it once I found it.
B006WZLCZ4|4.0|I bought this set because I'm a pediatric speech therapist and having pretend kitchen stuff is a great way to work on language, plus the kids love it!<br /><br />Oveall, I think it's a great buy, I just wish it included a couple of cups and maybe a pitcher.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I read this story and found myself asking why the world does nothing to complain about concentration camps inside North Korea.<br /><br />I feel like the dictators of the North need to be punished in Nuremberg trials that the Nazi's experienced.<br /><br />Shin the main character unfortunately is a lost soul who I can only imagine will find it difficult to assimilate himself into the world outside of Camp 14.<br /><br />We should all pray for these lost souls of a brutal regime in North Korea.<br /><br />Shame on China for doing nothing.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I always enjoy his books.  He needs an editor, but for me it doesn't matter. I still enjoy it, and I read very fast.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|We like how user-friendly the calculator is.  Not all calculators are the same.  This is the best we have found!
B000UZNRS2|4.0|I always enjoy his books.  He needs an editor, but for me it doesn't matter. I still enjoy it, and I read very fast.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love this game. I play with friends and random buddies.  It is a lot of fun.  It is fast paced too.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I always enjoy his books.  He needs an editor, but for me it doesn't matter. I still enjoy it, and I read very fast.
B00AEBB86A|4.0|We have enjoyed watching Shooter several times, always on TV and always with commercials. This is one of my husband's favorite movies...he is a Mark Wahlberg fan. We bought the DVD so we could watch when we want to, without commercials.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Brilliant! A must read. Loved how the stories finally merge. The theme of the demise of civilization because of greed etc. is fascinating.
B0018CMJSU|4.0|The Godfather is not really my cup of tea, but my husband likes it. That is the reason we bought it...he watched it, start to finish, when it arrived.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Very funny.  I didn't really expect it to have any depth to the story but was pleased to find it wasn't just a series of silly jokes.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My son accidentally downloaded this and started playing it one day...now he loves it and plays all the time! Angry birds are fun to him now.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I thought Top Gear had everything British I would ever want. I was wrong. This episode is the perfect gateway drug to more Sherlock greatness. Definitely worth the hour and a half of viewing time and you will be hooked to watch more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 3 year old son plays this and loves it!  It is easy for him to manuever and he is great at it!  My husband even downloaded this to his phone.  Fun App!!
B00992CF6W|1.0|it sucks because every time I get off of it, it deletes everything I did.never get this game you'll hats it.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|My 3 year old keeps trying this app but it isn't easy to use and it is very hard to exit from it.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I love the whole film, not just one certain thing.  I definately woud recomend this movie for people of all ages.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed the mystery behind the main character's mental issues.  It was written in such a way that it kept me reading faster and faster trying to figure out why the character was the way he was!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book presented a new concept to me, and I feel like it is a valid one.  I had already learned with an earlier relationship that he and I did not speak the same language, so I know from experience that can happen.  I enjoyed reading the book.
B004J64QSI|2.0|when I ordered this &#34;live musical&#34; I though there would at least be scenes acted out - music and singing was wonderful, but each cast member simply comes up to the mic and sings his/her part - no acting or interaction much with one another to show the scenes - just not what I expected
0307943232|1.0|This is my first book from this auther and very likely the last one. What a terrible taste and stupid plot. The first one third is interesting but it quickly turns into rediculous and soon is full of B *%$@. Totally waste of my time. Definitely not recommend.
B005L38QK2|1.0|The mouse itself feels fine and works okay but the program is completely awful. First, if you are running windows 8, or even windows 7 and you don't have .net framework 3.5 you're in for a battle. Second, forget about writing macros for for the game (d3) because it won't allow you to loop button presses, as far as I can tell after spending several hours with the program. The website offers a link to a users manual, but when followed, doesn't actually have a manual for the mouse. Pretty awful purchase I made, don't let it happen to you
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Every movie this guy &#34;Presents&#34; stinks. Movie was watchable till the ending. Im glad this came out the same week as mothers day. How clever....
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Very nice looking graphics and addictive game play. The difficulty progresses perfectly at first so you can get the hang of it while providing a good challenge in the higher levels. I highly recommend it, especially while it's free, although it's definitely worth the regular price.
B00C0233A0|4.0|I did recibe the movie just on time and in excelente pacage i just recomen this movie enjoy it, thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book made me feel as if I were in the Hunger Games myself. I'm about to watch the movie and I can't wait. I got this book off my Amazon Prime membership. If you don't have Amazon Prime, its still a definite buy.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Enjoyed the interaction between the doctor and Rose. Pure mindless, stressless entertainment. An enjoyable escape from reality. Always pure pleasure.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Wonderful and very fast moving.  The idea of working out a car is great would like to see more of this type of movie
B0034G4P80|5.0|'Don't buy too many movies, but his one's a keeper!  From beginning to end, movie moves at a good pace with just the right balance of battling the bad guys to getting the girl!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Was great.  Love all the actors with Gibbs and McGee are the best.  Also love Abby and Zeva  they are wonderful.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A must see. A lot of twist and turns. I always look forward to seeing the next episode. I wish My Amazon Prime covered season 3! That was a disappointment. The show was the only reason I signed up.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Video was a little dark in spots that made it hard to view. Plot was good as it leads to a good foundation for the series.
B000IDEORY|5.0|What's not to love about this movie? I could watch this move a million times and still not be tired of watching.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Awaken world to what goes on under our collective noses.  The subjugation of an entire country to the whims of a elitist class society.  Starvations of food, love, family, and personal existence is  going on in North Korea.  This book reveals the sad fact that in this world we ignore the most egregious acts of dictatorial suppressive governments.  As it goes on in North Korea and other countries we do nothing.....
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I'm addicted to this game.  Just the right amount of challenge, and it's a lot easier for me to play on my kindle vs. the computer.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|Let me also add that I was very excited to see this film. I loved how J.J. had the first one fast paced, heartfelt, funny and enveloping.  I wouldn't use any of those adjectives to describe this one.  I've seen every J.J. film and I think this is his worst yet.  I think J.J. blew his load on the first and now he's got this franchise by the wheel and wants to stretch it.  The whole film lacked substance, and that showed early on in the opening sequence with Bones and Kirk.  I didn't understand mostly why it seemed to keep all the favorite characters always separated. First Spock, then Scotty, Spock reunites, then Checkov, Uhura and on and on. What the first one had is these strong and different characters thrown together in a motley crew, and had great arguments and drama.<br />Secondly, the villain lacked some authenticity that would've made you believe he was smarter than the enterprise crew (like we're supposed to believe the accent is a gauge).  I can't say if that is the actor's fault, but seeing Benedict in this one reminds me of how understated Eric Bana's acting was as Nero.  For the record, Nero was crazy which isn't necessarily better or worse, but perhaps the plot in the 1st made crazy \\"scarier\\" than the plot in this one enabled smart.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Catniss Everdene welcome to the hunger games!!! This book is good but to many Charecters die.The rest of this note is random words put to gether fellow  Google Facebook video
B006RXQ62U|5.0|Best line ever?  &#34;So  I fired two warning shots -- into his head...&#34;<br />And Catherine Zeta Jones is simply breath-taking.  The critics were right!
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|My 9 year old daughter wrote: \\" It is an awesome book! I would definately recommend this book to a lot of my friends.  It's a great story!  l will read it again to someone else.\\"
B004742Y68|5.0|Very good movie well made will have glued to the TV set. other classic horror movie for the 80's you love it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wonderful, twisted tale of love, devotion, deceit, and parenting skills.  Worthy read that presents a different slant on proprieties in life.  Can genetics be the blame?  Read and find out!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Well written, acted and directed. The show is interesting and the characters are not too immature, despite their life complications.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|It works but is not as adjustable as it could be.  The font settings are crude.  The operations are rudimentary.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love this game and waste a lot of my time on it and in my opinion it is better than the first.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|It was surprisingly good! Narrated by the &#34;Zombie&#34;, it is gross, quirky, interesting and just plain fun!<br />A must see!
B000SEI230|5.0|i had actually like most saw the movie but finally decided to read the book and as always book is way better than the movie
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|lots of fun wish I could earn coins at a faster rate but all in all tons of fun. you won't be sorry.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|never watched the movie but i love the book and how she was talking with and her friend always giving good advice to find out it was his wife that had passed away
158270208X|2.0|of that book. I was disappointed that I spent that much on a journal. It has little sayings on the pages to guide you each day.<br />I still don't think it was worth the money
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|The game is good and it has excellent quality it is somewhat like gta and I do love this game but it does take up a lot of space
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Taut. Maintains suspense from beginning to end. Evocative. A dark, real sense of place and time. Great cast. Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. It's Chinatown, enough said.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So, I bought this game because I have two family members that enjoyed it a lot. I find that it is fun and easy to play. We have been passing around the kindle so everyone gets to play.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|this game is nice an all but not enough you no store game I mean I can not buy inything. but a car and stuff it stinks
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik me at D.C.tyese with the . Bored just want to talk people 13-18.and I love love love this app
B004FRX0MY|3.0|The entire setup is a pain with amazon.  When you try down music the platfom does not recognizethe app is installed.  You end up with multiple  copies, surprising for a platform as sophiscated as amazons.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This game doesn't work at all. How do I get a refund?? It downloaded and now won't open at all. I better not have  to pay for a game that I can't even play at all. Is this what amazon is giving us. Seems like a bunch of thieves to me.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love this version of Emma. It's was beautifully done and I can't get enough of it. I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and felt like this movie went well with the book
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|A combination of Three Stooges comedy, endless repetitive chases, dire dialogue and one dimensional acting. No surprise this was missing for any major nominations. This could have been have the length and still too long. Cate, Ian please..... You are too good for this.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is wonderful. The amount of info, and its easy to see what's happening and what's going to happen hour by hour.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think the Trilogy deserves 5 stars.  You can't just read Book 1.  It's important to read all three books to see where it takes the characters' journeys.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|The first time I heard the song &#34;We Are Young&#34; on bandit radio I knew this group would be big.  A great talent.  I finally purchased the CD and am impressed with the songwriting and harmonies.  The influence of Queen's &#34;Night at the Opera&#34; is obvious.  Nate can write a rock anthem (We Are Young, Some Nights, Carry On) and all of these songs have the essence of a good Irish march.  Some of the production is off and would benefit input from a seasoned producer but it's SO exciting to hear the raw and early efforts of a group with such potential.  Kinda like a front row seat at the Cavern.<br />The potential to blow &#34;A Night at the Opera&#34; out of the water is there but this is not that album.  It's great listening and exciting to anticipate what may come.  FUN has their work cut out for them.  Can't wait for their next release.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Got this as the FAO TD. I thought about being responsible and not downloading it. But when you compare the thrill of freeing lost trapped souls to the mundanity of doing laundry and attempting to get two teenagers too do their chores, this app wins hands down. plus, unlike the said teenagers, the little totem dude actually appreciates all I do for him and his tribe.  If there was a single step undo last move button, I would have given it a fifth star.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|There were parts that were funny but in the long run I found it to be boring in many more. Barbra is and always will be an excellent actor.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I enjoyed the book but felt the ending was too predictable.  By the time the hero is hurt for the ladies son, I had figured it out.
B00B23O96A|4.0|I like his tasty licks throughout and the talent he has brought along to play with him.  He generally picks songs that he likes and wants to remake in his own image and that is the case here.  While I would have preferred him to kick it with a couple of good rock songs and a few slow burning blues songs I can never say no to his interpretations of songs.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|So many startup books are merely the opinions of the author. Chris took the time to research and talk with hundreds of people who have followed their passion and started a profitable enterprise. He gleans nuggets of wisdom from these successful entrepreneurs and presents multiple points of view.
B00AGKH7K0|2.0|I had hoped for some tobacco road kind of rock but I got some 60's protest musical lyrics......He should focus on using the god given talents he has and his musical maturity and leave the weak protests to the kids.........
B00821OX98|5.0|No need to say anymore other than I can't wait for the next season to begin.  Hope it never jumps the shark.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This guy doesn't disapoint.  If you like Boz you will definitely like this effort....good listening and his unique voice comes through loud and clear.........
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so fun this is like the only game I play. I am so happy I got this game .i hilly recamend that you get this game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A novel of many twists and turns.  The ending was a surprise.  Couldn't stop reading.  A well written, interesting book.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|This  app is  pretty boss app it is the best app ever totally worth two dollars you should get this app<br />Thank you , nicholas parker
B000SEGUDE|3.0|A novel that requires interpretation and a need to make connections between the different sections.  I need to re-read again after our book club discussed this novel.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is a fun game that mixes a puzzle game with an arcade style, with a little rpg element thrown in too.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I really loved this book - and had put it on order after reading the 1st book, immediately ordering and reading the 2nd book, then waiting impatiently for this one to come out.  It was well written and I got caught up with the characters.  It has a bit of everything to grab and hold my attention.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome because you go under and over. And all the doging is fun and the jumping is fun too.<br />It is so fun l wish l can go on with friends but my mom won't let me.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Keeps you interested. If I play a game and it can't hold my attention for at least 5 minutes, then I delete it. This game I got to get to the next level.
B009LRE040|1.0|My mom and i rented this movie from redbox because we read the reviews and love the actors/actresses in it so we pay a dollar and it was not even worth the dollar. We watched the other batman and liked them but not this one. Save your money
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Very nice game.  Can be as simple or complex as you want, pretty long and feature rich for such a low price.  I was enjoying the free version and bought Elite just to support thr developers because I liked it so much.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Some decent acting. Some good characters. Not too many annoying characters. Not too many bad actors. CGI is fairly well balanced. Note to self: make sure to put a fingernail brush and a bar of soap in the post-apocalyptic survival kit. Why do so many people let their nail hygiene go so bad? How can you have clean teeth with healthy gums and at the same time such nasty hands? Standards people. If you let those things go you might as well have never survived the initial attack. Gross fingernails notwithstanding, hooked on this show.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is great! Great way to connect to people and make new friends. I love talking to people on here please look me up and talk to me lol I'm a high-school girl and in modelling. Again really enjoy this app.
B0095ZEDTU|1.0|Nothing new everything is the same stuff they keep repeating the same story line only person they should have kept was mike epps
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Not up to Reich's usual standard. Readable but the characters are flat cardboard cutouts.<br />I'll still look forward to future Temperance Brennan novels because I usually really enjoy them<br />Harry
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you have it figured out, it twists again. Its a good story. Its definitely worth buying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the fast pace and the great graphics. It provides many hours of enjoyment once you get the hang of it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie. When it was over, I understood why it won an academy award. My wife and I just watched it, it was honest, real, and enjoyable to watch. I could have done without the overload on the cursing- but aside from that- really well done.
B00C2GJWNG|5.0|The album is listenable from from track 1 through to the end.  A worthwhile album to add to your collection.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I got this game for my 6 year old to play but I enjoy it as much if not more than him.  This game is great!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved the character.  Sometimes I even laughed out loud.  It was a unique, interesting story.  I can see Jeremy Irons acting this part.  Well done!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read a book or novel everyday, this book was sweet, sexy and funny. I laughed and I don't laugh unless it's really funny. The sex was hot but not too much like a lot of  the erotic books. I loved the way this book was written, I was hooked on the first page this book is a must read. I definitely will read Emma Chase 's next book.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|Albert King in his Stax prime was the best purveyor of modern blues guitar in the world.  He inspired everyone from Eric Clapton (compare Albert's &#34;Born Under A Bad Sign&#34; to Cream's) and Stevie Ray Vaughn (check out their album together) to countless other blues players.  This collection of singles and odd studio tracks from his first Stax sessions are unmatched in their strength, straightforward style, and soulful feeling.  They are the beginning of the great Stax portion of Albert's long career.
B006QSLBC6|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie with a good point at the end. Great characters and decent acting. We enjoyed it without knowing a lot about birding, but it got us interested.
0307887960|2.0|I read this book cover to cover and thought it was a doable diet. Wrong!!!  I followed it to the letter for two weeks and only lost 2 pounds.  Maybe if you are 25 years old it will work for you, but not for this 50+ year old!  Go to Weight Watchers instead. At least you can eat a normal variety of foods.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Don't know why it is necessary to always put sex and foul language in a story.  Seems like the author can't write, or doesn't think his/her story is good enough to just write and puts sex and swearing in instead.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got this game today and it is so much fun I like how much cars and bikes there r. I would recommend this to it friends.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|What a wonderful read!!  I enjoyed every part of this book, from the first word to the last.  I am hoping for a sequel, actually two sequels.  Would love to hear the story from more of the characters, and the story from a year after the ending.  Great book!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Really different story line that gets you in so you want more and more. Loved the characters and the story is great and complex and not predictable at all. Makes you want to read anything this author writes. Loved it!!
0395925037|3.0|I was 7 years old when 2nd World War started.We lived in a town where there was an Army Base. When I got somewhat older I heard of the book  Mien Kamph quite often. Finally in my late Seventies I decided it was time to read it. i was somewhat suprised at how much of the first third of the book related many similar problems we see in our world today. I don't know yet how the rest of the book will go.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This was so very different and not at all what I expected. I loved that JKR decided to write about this side of life that never gets written about in this way. It was a story with lots of characters that I had to keep track of but when I worked them all out I found it really great. Different, unexpected, definitely worth a read and I applaud JKR fearlessness at publishing this.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The 3d version of jurassic park is a real fun viewing experience. Its amazing that a film this old can be turned in to 3d in such spectacular fashion. The conversion to 3d adds real depth. The only downside is a slight blurring of the image in some background scenes. Jungle scenes and the dinosaurs look great. A special mention for the audio also. On playing it through my 7.1 surround set up it seemed very dynamic and much more active in the surrounds. In the 3d behind the scenes feature its revealed that the 3d disc has had its audio remixed and it shows! An essential purchase.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|A real page turner - couldn't put it down. Twist at the end that I never saw coming. Gillian's other book is great too, makes a great change from chic lit. This story is complex and the characters are complete and believable. I really, really liked this and will look for anything else by this author.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|I have seen this movie a hundred times (really) finally found it on DVD. John Wayne, can't see enough of him.
B004WKI204|2.0|I like TF so thought I would like this book but I really didn't, just got bored and did not finish it. Couldn't really follow it and lost interest. It was a surprise as I find TF quite funny but this book just didn't flow for me.
B00870ZH3U|1.0|watched the instant video before buying ,glad I did Andrew should have left well enough alone Emma Rossom is hand downs the BEST Christine AND Gerard Butler  the Best PHANTOM
B004WR125O|5.0|I find the module to work completely as advertised.  It's pretty much plug and play.  One of the reasons that I chose the onkyo receiver brand was based on the low cost of this upgrade to make it wifi enabled.  It allows the use of my ipad or android phone to act as a secondary remote perfectly for when someone (including myself) has misplaced the units remote control.  I wish all other manufacturers that have lower end models without integrated wifi would find inexpensive yet completely functional solutions such as this.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I love my kindle and the kindle app I have on my computer.  I love the kindle so much that I bought one for my mother as a gift!  The android app isn't working.  I continually try to open it, but it after giving the kindle logo, it shuts down.  Sometimes it flashes a message about being unable to open; other times the app skips that completely.  I am very disappointed in this app as I love to read and feel reading on my phone would be handier in some cases than carrying my kindle!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! My husband on the other hand asked me twice &#34;how long is this film?&#34; to which I promptly shhhhed, because I was enthralled. I love how the film didn't get into the beginning of Lincoln's political career, or even the start of the civil war, but depicts a single momentous act, the passing 13th amendment. For his point, there is little physical actions, very few war scenes, but that's not what the film about. My husband said &#34;that was as bad as &#34;The King's Speech&#34;&#34; which is accurate, as I love that movie too. I gave it five stars because it's my review, but had my husband done it, it would have one or two stars. It all depends on what you like.
B000MDJH9A|5.0|Love watching this movie and understand how life could lead to these outcomes really enjoyed looking at the fine guys who played in the movies
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I just bought this for my 1.5 year old. Both he and his 1 year old cousin love it! It says it's for 3+ years, but in my opinion this is perfect for 1 year olds and up. I was skeptical about getting an inflatable pool due to the risk of holes and it being easily punctured, but it seems to be durable enough. We set it up last night, and I was pleasantly surprised that it held all its air the next day, never needed re-inflating. I am not sure how long it will last, but I am confident that we'll at least get one season out of it. Defintely worth the purchase for the hot summer months.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Inflated easily with a hair dryer. (Note that the hole doesn't actually fit a hair dryer, but we didn't have a pump, so we tried it and it worked fine). Inflated in less than 5-10 minutes.<br />-Has a drain hole in both larger splash pool and smaller inner pool.<br />-Has a secondary drain hole in the inter pool so it won't overflow.<br />-Able to control height of the sprinklers with a valve.  *I especially like this feature*<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The hook up to the hose leaks, wasting water (note: not sure if this is my hose's problem or the pool's hook up).<br />-Palm tress does not inflate enough to stand upright.<br /><br />I would recommend this purchase, and have nothing to complain about.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Great graphics, poor story line, and worse ending. One of those flicks where when it was over, I wanted my money back.
B003629IPW|5.0|See the dynamic nature of one of the musical geniuses of our times.  Truly an incredible talent.  This video shows all aspects of his musical vision and talent.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|OK, I'm a fan of most Cruise movies, I admit that. Don't like his personal politics, but then we can't have everything. This is one rocking movie that will loose you in a couple of twists in the plot. Make sure your popcorn is steady, you will jump at least once.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool! it is even lifelike.I wish I had a horse. My Horse is the coolest game ever
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The 007 series had appeared to be winding down, this movie revved it back up and propels the series back to what it is supposed to be. Have to admit, even my wife enjoyed it. Another aspect of the film is that it can be viewed by everyone in the house.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book Maybe a book 8 if so make it a good one. Also there better be a book 9
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|For the first 3/4 of the movie, you are on the same page, and then &#34;BAM&#34; everything you thought was pretty well set, gets upset. No, I will not share the ending, suffice it to say, you will be pleased.
B002VCR03A|1.0|I really struggled to read the first chapter of this and gave up after that. Perhaps it just wasn't the book for me or perhaps it's awful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So this game is a little like temple run (1 or 2) so the overall premise is the same. There isn't any turn your device this way and collect these coins. All you have to do is move your fingers. That's one reason why I like this game better than temple run. It gas mediocre graphics, and as I said before, its slot like temple run. Another good thing about this game is it doesn't have those stupid little look you just died lets have a \\"funny\\" joke about it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Second time I've read it and it was just as exciting the second time around. So glad I own it in my kindle and the box set as well I can read it over and over and over. I love it!!!!!!
B008NB0SQO|5.0|HAS BECOME A CHRISTMAS TRADITION AT OUR HOUSE. ATER WE FINISH DECORATING TREE; THE FAMILY ALL GATHERS 4 HOT CHOCOLATE , LITTLE DEBBIES CHRISTMAS TREE CAKES 2 WATCH  THIS CLASSIC.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Not the prettiest game in the world, but it keeps you coming back for more.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who likes Bejeweled type games.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I had this game on my ipod but the screen was too small so its way easier to do it on here
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This series will never dissapoint! If you love supernatural stories, scary things that &#34;go bump in the night&#34; plus hot guys this is your show!
B008NW67E0|5.0|\\"Mumford & Sons\\" are one of the best. They really opened the door for artists such as Phillip Phillips and \\"The Lumineers.\\" The songs on \\"Babel\\"--while similar to each other--always have something special and unique about them. \\"I Will Wait\\" and \\"Not With Haste\\" are--in my opinion--the best songs on the album. These songs could easily be in movies. I get chills every time I listen to them. This album is a must-have for anyone who likes music!
B0060D11OU|4.0|Love it! Wonderful songs and dancing. Good clean entertainment for this current generation. Just had to have it. Buy it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book helped me self publish my book on Kinle.  It explains and shows examples of how to accomplish your goal
B00005JLSE|3.0|It came quickly and I thought in the condition in which it was represented. But immediately it started to skip. Had I complained right away, perhaps they would have helped me out. I said nothing, so it's really more my fault than theirs. And I do not believe I damaged it in any way; I think it came like that. But since I said nothing, I didn't give them a chance to make the situation better either. So I can't and won't bash them for something that I think was, but may not have been, their fault. I think I'd feel comfortable buying from them again... it simply COULD have been MY fault and none of theirs.
0345803507|5.0|The book arrived in excellent condition and right now I'm about 3/4 of the way through it.  Really looking forward to starting the 3rd book in the trilogy.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|this first season makes a great gift for anyone who has an interest in national security, military and or politics.
0345803493|5.0|I'm sure this will be just as good as the 1st 2 in the trilogy-something to really wrap your brain around!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|And yet again, Daft Punk comes out with a great album. Some of the tracks are different in style than some of their other songs, but, when listening, it still fits their style. I was not disappointed.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book is ok. I didn't feel as connected to the book as I did to fifty shades. There was emotion that was missing throughout it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is one of the best tv series I have seen in recent times. Very gripping and highly entertaining.. It's a must watch!!
1934356476|5.0|A great book for anyone who wants to go further and realize the full potential that the Ruby language can give.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Loved the series!  But I had hoped that they would have showed more of the wedding and the honeymoon.
B00AA2W4L6|5.0|I enjoy the humor in this movie. Good action. I'm a huge fan of all of the Iron Man movies.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Couldn't put it down... a great sequel!  Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.  GRRM knows how to build a world we would all like to be a part of.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Well acted (mostly) & a good story. We watched it right before seeing &#34;Into Darkness&#34; which I didn't like as much.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is epic,just epic if you like this,get full edition.don't listen to the negative comments.they need anger management or a doctor.
0061474355|4.0|I read this quickly - being a YA novel it's a pretty easy read. Fantasy is not a genre I usually enjoy too much, but the story kept me engaged.  I am interested to read the other 2 in the series, but only if it continues with the same characters!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I didn't have high hopes for this one, which helped. It's not a blockbuster but much funnier than I expected.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|When I first saw this book, I thought it would be really good. But after the first 3 tapes, it just dragged on and on. I've been avoiding young-adult books for a while, even though I'm one myself. Most young-adult books consist of vampires and melodrama. I thought this one would be different since it dealt with something so horrible: suicide. I hoped that it would be different from most teen books I've been reading. I was wrong. Unlike much of the excellent teen fiction that is being written, Thirteen Reasons Why rang false to me.<br /><br />The characters seemed hollow, like caricatures of real teenagers. The teens in the story acted like an adult's idea of how teenagers act. Worst of all, there is no sympathy to be found for the subject of the book, Hannah Baker, who killed herself and left behind tapes detailing why for those people who made her miserable. Hannah is a whiny little teenager that didn't feel like talking to anyone about her problems, and decides to take it out on the people who have \\"wronged\\" her, even if it was as simple as spreading a rumor about her. She came off perhaps worst of all the characters in the book -- she seems petty and vindictive, having left tapes telling people that she killed herself because of them. We at least get to witness some of these characters experiencing remorse. Perhaps the flattening of Hannah Baker's character is an affect of the fact that she is already dead when the book begins. We only know of her what she recorded on these tapes, but what is there isn't flattering. Hannah is the ultimate passive-aggressive, not really doing anything to help her cause. Parts of the book just contradicted itself. This girl wanted to be kissed. A lot of boys asked for her number, but she waited until high school to give it to one boy. Then she complains about how she never been kissed and all of her friends were kissed before her. She had all those chances, why did she wait for one insignificant boy who ended up spreading a rumor about her?<br /><br />The reasons were just plain unrealistic. Why was everyone so interested in her? She wasn't the only new girl in town, and according to her not the prettiest, so why were there all these rumors about her? It just doesn't make sense. Clay's reason was annoying too. She went ballistic and told him to leave, and then gets upset because he listened to her? Basically, Hannah is very selfish and ridiculous. She had friends; family, and just because some minor things hampered her relationships with them, does not give her any reason to overdose.<br /><br />I just became increasingly aggravated when reading this book. This book didn't make me feel anything but annoyance, and I would recommend many other teen titles before this one. The writing was redundant and annoying, and I found myself rolling my eyes at some sentences. All in all, I shouldn't have bought the book.
B009GED3HS|3.0|I love this series. However this season was the worst in my opinion. So many fluff and filler episodes as they buy time to get us to the ***SPOILER ALERT*** 3 second &#34;Mother Reveal&#34; in the Season Finale. Still it has some great stuff, good performances, and memorable moments - but in the gran scheme of the show this has to be a low point.
6304696558|5.0|I've seen this, always wanted it, THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF THESE MOVIES<br />get them and enjoy, I know I have
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Tom Cruise is one of the best - as captivating of an action star as they come. But this movie slowly falls apart as it heads towards its resolution. Plenty of fun and intense moments. But pretty weak conclusion.
B00144VBBS|5.0|as A country music singer, I like his style, my MP3 player is all Toby Keith<br />35 songs? at shuffle, I'm hearing allot of it, and I definitely don't mind as I know most of them
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game has me HOOKED! I tend not to play many games on my phone. The ones I do tend to keep me interested for 3 or 4 plays and I usually am done with them, plus the battery drain while playing games reinforces that for me. With this game, I find myself playing any free chance I get.<br /><br />If you like RPGs & Match 3 games you really cant go wrong with this one!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is classic John Cleese! If you are a Cleese fan, you won't just like this you will LOVE it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|its okay..i think the you should be able to use money instead of invest points. just do away with those
B000FA675C|4.0|A good book that keeps you intrested.  I never wanted to put it down. I want to find more Dan Brown books.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was ok. I enjoyed the books much more. Sometimes when you read the book you picture things differently than in the movie.
B009R659L8|5.0|Enjoyed how she brought in many people, situations, and relationships and then tied them all together in the ending.  Great book!
B005SAJJHM|5.0|So funny! Love the whole cast and adding in Howard's girlfriend proves to be a good addition to the cast
B0094M2SCI|5.0|Had a good time watching. Drama, some bumor and a bit wierd. Too bad Amazon won't put the rest of the franchise's movies on Prime. Boo Amazon.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have always loved his music and this album does not disappoint. I was surprised that one of my favorite songs is the duet with Reece Witherspoon.
B00755MHXG|5.0|I bought this for my son who is 11, we both read it and agreed it was amazing. Well written, thoughtful and insightful, it tweaked both mine and my sons heart strings while being funny and uplifting. Junior fiction is rarely this good.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Best movie I have seen this year. Acting and visuals were amazing! Hoping for a sequel! Tarantino is an amazing director.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|A very sweet movie for both children and adults. As all of these animated films, they have delightful characters and story.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Just finished watching this with my daughter, I wish my teenage son had seen it  with us. We had watched Soul Surfer a few months ago, about a girl who surfs and loses her arm to a shark. This was less traumatizing, but equally as exciting. Gerard Butler is perfect in this role. We loved him in Nim's Island. In this movie, there is some suspense, some sentimentality, a glimpse of a shark (!), and nothing inappropriate. Fine for families, although someone dies before it's over - I won't tell you who....but no violence or gore. We want to watch it again.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie. I have such a heightened appreciation for both or military and our clandestine services. Thank God some of them can rise above the political winds that fly in one direction and then another, to keep us all as one nation safe.
0547572298|2.0|I guess I just don't get it.  The book strikes me as meaningless and incoherent. I  looked at my book collection and remembered \\"The Philip K Dick Reader.\\"  I liked many of the stories in there, and I thought \\"Androids Dream\\" was okay, so it's just some of Dick that I don't get. I had a similar baffled reaction to \\"The Man in the High Castle.\\"
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This may be the most well-crafted show on television right now.  When I first heard of it, I had no interest in entering what I thought of as a mere reboot of the franchise.  But after recommendations and fascinating recaps by one Cleolinda, I gave it a try.  Every details is carefully looked after and the story, while true to the books, deviates just enough to keep things unpredictable.  Too many shows take themselves seriously and should not.  This one is deadly serious, but somehow without pretension, even as it continues to work on many levels and the dialogue would sound affected if the writing and acting were not so high caliber.
B00932A66Y|4.0|English sub-titles are a huge asset.<br />Intrigue, drama, mystery and lots of action.<br />It was fun and exciting, I recommend it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is very good grade app. Easy to find.try to understand a word to find out the part or tools
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so sexy, real and FUNNY!!!!! It was well written with a great story line. It felt way more like a real life love story. It was perfect. More books should be written from the guys point of view. This book was F-ing amazing!!!!! Buy it, read it, love it!! I promise u will not be disappointed!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the game is awosme I can't wait unroll I play angry birds star wars that might be awosme game ever
B00005VWK3|5.0|I really loved this book to say the least. Teaches theories and states his theories on art in general, it is an awesome book.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Great Book!!  I was happy to finally get to read Anne Frank's diary as she wrote it.  (spoiler)  I didn't know she was a lesbian?!!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Amazingly well written.  Amazingly well acted.  I've watched it more than once and each time, I catch on to something different.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be entertained.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Yet another book by this prolific author with a chequered past.<br />Love him or hate him, Jeffrey Archer writes a well crafted story, even if the twists are somewhat predictable. He always, however, finishes with a flourish.<br />A good lazy weekend read if your spouse/lover/ significant other is out of town
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love how you can play with your fiend's. and a lot of people have fun playing minecraft it the best
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for and free! Fantastic!<br />A must for all Sherlock fans. Look no further. This is it.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The movie was pretty good, although it got a little weak, towards the end. Looking forward to another Jack Reacher
B002TXZSLM|4.0|I would have loved it had I recieved a copy, as I tried to reorder it, It kept coming up I had ordered onMay 1st so still unable to recieve it you have returned the  moneyI  paid. I still want to buy it please
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wasn't overly fond of the movie, which I saw before reading the book. The trilogy is amazing, and looking back, the movie did a decent job, considering it was pretty faithful to the book (when compared to other adaptations). Still, the book is an amazing read.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I LOVED this game until it reset on me for the third time and wanted me to start all over. I got really far and spent tons of time on this game only to have it reset on me. I finally decided to get rid of it because I don't want to spent anymore time on it if it's just going to make me do it all over again. So glad I didn't put real money into it.<br />It's an awesome game and I wish I didn't have so much trouble with it. They do need to make it so some of the goals don't require farm bucks because the bucks are really hard to earn if you don't want to use real money on this game.<br />My kindle fire is what I've been playing this game on.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I expected this movie to be terrible, as I'm no fan of Terrantino, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it really, really good. I still can't stand Terrantino's stylized moments, throughout, and OF COURSE his obsession with the n-word is as apparent as always. I mean, you know it's a little much when you're not particularly sensitive, amd you're watching a movie that takes place in the south in the late 1850's, and you're STILL like, &#34;That's an awful lot of n-bombs.&#34; The goofiness of it's abundance can make the characters seem like caricatures of 19th century racists rather than real people. Overall, though, I recommend this movie. It's pretty great
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing the game and this Mahjong Deluxe HD Free app fits the bill. No more needs be said.
B001A3GSJ8|5.0|This album holds a special place in my heart. As often as albums may cycle through my favourite ten of all time, I can honestly say I would never have forgotten to keep it in. Every song is immaculate. It can bring a tear to your eye. I may have heard this album more than many prominent over-listens. More than every Madonna song combined lifelong. That's alotta listens. What an amazing piece. I love it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's the chemistry and the humor that makes you want to watch more than once. Mark Ruffalo steals the show with his underplayed hulk.
1611761565|5.0|Highly recommend this book.  I frequently read modern military accounts written by former active duty service members.  This has been my favorite.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin explores the rise of Lincoln, and how his placement of political rivals on his cabinet helped bring the United States back into union after the Civil War. Goodwin does a fantastic job in recreating a human Lincoln with his strengths and flaws, presenting one of modern history's greatest leaders from an honest approach.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The third book in the &#34;The Clifton Chronicles&#34;, may be the best one - I also thought the first one was excellent - the second one fell off a little bit, but Archer was back in stride with &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34;.  Along with Ken Follett, the two best story tellers out there.  Be forewarned as with most Archer works, it's hard to put down.  Fast paced, romance, action, a slice of history.  It has it all.  When the first book in the chronicles was published, it was painted as the first in a trilogy.  The way this one ended, my hope is there will be a fourth.  Enjoy.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was a fun, not brainer read. Would make for a good summer read, light yet keeps interest very high.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Parts were funny. The wife is a bit crazy with complaints. Love knocked up! Cracked up some of the time.<br />It was worth the few bucks of entertainment.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|It is not only for anyone who lives with a teenager, but also for one who teaches, works with, or even knows one. Teens today have so many more challenges and tests than ever before. Picoult, as usual has chosen a topic that is relevant for today's culture and also as usual writes a story in her gifted way.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love my Castle and the DVD is no exception.<br />A great product for fans of the series.<br />All good here.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Having lived through several years with my mom during her stay at a very good senior citizen's home from beginning to end, I found the protagonist escape from his stay hilarious. I loved the Swedish setting...something I am not so familiar with. I will read Jonasson again. He is a gifted writer.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love, love, love this show.  The show never fails to make me laugh.  It is my go to whenever I need a pick me up.  My only hope is that they will find a new girlfriend for Raj in season 7.  Though I loved Kate Micucci's character in Raising Hope, I do not like her character Lucy as Raj's dysfunctional girlfriend.  Her quirks were annoying versus endearing. Instead, it would be great if they could develop a girlfriend based on Raj's Indian background.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A beautifully written story, thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I found it quite disturbing at times (when they referred to the past) it still captivated me and I didn't want to put it down.  Extremely well written and I would highly recommend this book.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This movie is not an action packed movie or a thriller seeker. \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a movie that makes a person think of human nature and actions.How those actions affect future generations. This movie is not meant to keep people on the edge of their seats; one can guess what will happen next. Simply put I liked the movie, but it may not be your style.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|This is a good movie, not what expected but good overall ! It's not as gripping as you would think !
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was such a good movie!  Being a guitarist it really made a lot of sense and opened my eyes to many things in the recording industry!  It was really the history of a soundboard but anyone who likes rock music should love this movie!  Congratulations and thanks to Dave Grohl on doing such a great job on this movie!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|this was a very funny and awesome movie, my family enjoyed it very much. I would recommend any of my friends to watch this movie.
B005LJITS0|2.0|This movie had all the makings to be great.  I had the right cast and plenty of money to make a great science fiction film of a beloved character.  It just failed to deliver in all most every area.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|One of the best Austen adaptations I have ever seen.  When it comes to Austen books being brought to the screen I can be a little bit of a snob.  This movie did not disappoint.  Romola Garai was perfect as Emma and Jonny Lee Miller brought Mr. Knightly to life in a completely new and more personal way than anything I have seen before.  I really did LOVE it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I like everything about this movie.  The plot, the storyline, the actors, and the cinematography all were amazing and put together to make a excellent movie.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Making Anna Karenina into a movie seems like such a daunting task to me that I am surprised anyone attempts it.  This movie took a different approach than most and was very effective.  It is more of an artistic production than a straight telling of the story.  It captured the moods and depth of the scenes that other productions did not.  I really liked the results.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|Edge of your seat type movie..is he getting caught?  Clever story line. Gives new meaning to stolen identity.  Great acting.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|It's no wonder this book is a classic.  The way Heller uses humor to show the senselessness and tragedy of war is genius.
B00908DDZM|3.0|definately the adult version !!! not for kids. haven't listened to very often. so far i like some of his music,but need to take time to really listen
B003L77G8I|1.0|This season 6 is perhaps my favorite one because we finally learn how Dr Brennan really feels about Booth.  In THE DOCTOR IN THE PHOTO She confesses to Booth she made a big mistake in not getting together with him when he asked her to.  This was one of the mystical weird episodes where<br />she is apparently affected by some drugs in a tree with the body of a female doctor and sees herself in the photo of the doctor.  Again, Booth rescues<br />her from getting killed.  I have great admiration for Emily D. as an actress as well as being one of the most beautiful women (with Zooey) that I have<br />ever seen.  Her Acting is superb, very realistic, and she touches my heart in a way no other female has done.  Her tears really move me.  I empathize<br />with Brennan and Booth because my childhood had some bumps in the road.  I often was alone and turned to reading, mainly history and science and I<br />never new my biological father.  So I understand her struggles on her own.  The splendid production values enhance the good stories in the 6th season as well as the other Seasons , all of which I got from Amazon.  And those who have seen all the episodes in this set, especially disc 6 know that they<br />finally \\"make it\\". Yea!!<br />  At the beginning Booth & Brennan return from overseas to return to crime fighting.  Brennan learns, however, Booth has a new girl friend named Hannah; reasonably good looking but with a big nose.  No, I did not like her.  Bones tried hard to be friends with her and tried not to spoil their<br />relationship, but clearly she was not happy about it.  Anyhow, it broke up because she did not want to get married.  Booth threw the ring away (DUMB!)in a pond and that was that.<br />  There are other good stories in this set, though someone seems to keep giving Sweets roles: I do not like this pompous, snobby, yuppie man-child and wish he would marry Dippy Daisy run off somewhere.  I do think eventually everyone is going to get married, even Sweety-pie.  Maybe time will make Sweets better, but I would never give him a weapon, not even a pea shooter!<br />  I love Hodgins & Angela, both very likeable and well played by their respective actors/actresses.  Camille is excellent (and beautiful) along with<br />Wendel and the other intern actors.  David B., of course, is excellent: really comes off believeably as a FBI cop.  Oh yeah, I don't care much for the character Daisy: Her constant yapping drives me up the wall.  NOTE: if  Brennan becomes President, pls tap her phone!<br />  In conclusion I think this is the best show on Television bar none.  though I am a bit uncomfortable with all the sex talk, still it has to rank<br />of one of the best all around TV shows in the history of entertainment.  One of the best casting jobs ever, realistic acting, relatively accurate<br />science and lots of humour.  Everyone seems capable of comedy when wanted and they all LOOK GOOD, especially the women (hubba!).  Keep it up FOX!!
B007REV4T8|4.0|I liked it but wish there was more action.Somewhat reminds me of the older 007's but overall i liked it
B00138J1R6|5.0|GFK forced the world to give them his ears with lp. A great Wu Tang album that showcased their consistency and enduring ability to produce quality music.
B0042L78MG|4.0|can't explain this one.Love the vibe of it butthere<br />s one song we play over and over again. haven't really listened to thewhole cd :( maybe soon
B000V6ADNW|3.0|50 Cent put his fingerprint on Hip-Hop with this lp and for a longtime set in motion a new New York focus in Hip-Hop. As great his some of his massive hits were, the album suffers from some song that sound repetitive and monotonous with 50's vocal delivery. Worth Buying.....at a low price.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|One of the funniest shows ever! Great cast, great storylines, this is a show I can watch over and over and it's still funny!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. I love crafting and it will be more awesome when red stone items. I can not wait.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|GOOD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SOME OF HER OTHER BOOKS. The endings a bit too vague to satisfy. But she is a fantastic writer and i am glad to have found her.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a great book.  Although I am normally an avid reader anyway, this was one I just could not put down and finished it in the course of a weekend, ignoring anything else I had to do in the meantime.  I didn't know anything about the Orphan Trains, and learned a lot.  I also really liked the 2 main characters.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is AMAZING! I would give this app 10/10 stars. All the Hill Climbing games are awesome. :D  EPICNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|So far it seems to be very simular to the regular Google.  I like being able to have the icon rather than having to go to the Web and then to the Google Homepage.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|What a perfect sound recorder! I love it. It records without causing hitches. I have also fallen in love with it quality sound output. I will recommend it to anyone.
B0067TGSOK|3.0|The $100 Startup is another of a whole generation of books on inspiring the would-be entrepreneur, theoretically stuffed with ideas but somewhat short on the ready cash, to jump right in.<br /><br />Guillebeau deals with a number of very specific small businesses, all started on a shoestring, many of them almost accidentally (until the owner recognized the potential of the business).  And of course, all of them are in the follow-your-bliss pattern common on entrepreneurship books lately.  The author rounds out some of this material with content available online, specifically some forms to use in the conceptualization of your own business, and in that sense this book has a very practical and useful side to it.<br /><br />Less practical is the drop-off in solid information about how to run a business once it has been founded; perhaps the author thought that such information was plentiful elsewhere.<br /><br />In any event, the book functions as part motivational speech and part mini handbook on establishing a micro business that, who knows, might turn into a real business in time.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is one of the best Baldacci books I have read.  The story keeps you on your toes from chapter to chapter.  A truly good thriller.
0446572993|5.0|Great book, loved every part of it couldnt wait to read the second one. Hoping that David Baldacci has many more adventures for Will Robie coming looking forward to them.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|It was a good movie, the use of the N word was hard on me.  Almost want to give it 4 stars because of that, but art is art. A few scenes caused me to break down as well. The realization that, that kind of life is so recent really made me sad.  As usually good job to Quentin for making another good film.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Fun as hell like oh man I feel like I'm actually there in [generic fantasy realm] fighting [enemy faction]! You get to pick one of [number more than 3 but less than 7] classes that all play differently and you get to walk around killing bad guys.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is such a simple game but still addictive. Great to pass the time away while waiting and not having to be too focused at the same time.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story is really interesting and different.  Well written.  I enjoyed it very much.  Didn't want it to come to an end.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This has several options for puzzle shape variety.  It helped to pass time on our most recent car trip. I like the variety.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Presents as several short stories of different areas during and after World War Z in chronological order. Told from an interview perspective of the people in those areas. Very well written. I really enjoyed it.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|They worked as advertized and did a fine job. But Mac did a great job keeping it from doing anything else with the USB port. :-(
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Very enjoyable read! Quicky and endearing book that was easy to read and a good insight into those who are a bit left of centre
B006AN78XS|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorite movies. I enjoy it as well.  We love introducing it to friends. Would watch it again...
B003F5NSTW|5.0|I couldn't put this down. I read without knowing anything about this book and I was gripped the whole time, looking forward to reading again
B008BZIUHG|5.0|Rival Sons won me over big time with their last album which was full of classic rock style rock n roll swagger.  On this their latest release, the band show a lot of maturity branching out into several different directions.  Influences, such as Led Zeppelin seem obvious, but these guys are just modern enough to make their sound something other than full on retro rock.  They are really stretching here from their last album with several more acoustic oriented numbers and the sprawling \\"Manifest Destiny Parts I and II\\" which comes pretty close to progressive rock.  A few of these songs would have fit right at home on radio about 1967.  \\"The Heist\\", \\"When The Sun Comes\\" and \\"All The Way\\" hearken back to a time when bands like The Animals, The Doors, and The Zombies ruled the airwaves.  It will be interesting to see how fans of the band's pervious stuff react to this one.  The last album was great, but pretty much stuck to a rather narrow formula.  This one is much wider in scope, and to my ears, seems like a natural evolution for the band.
B00571F26Y|3.0|The same things are stated over and over and over... a very boring book... too much scientific detail, not enough information.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|SOOOOO CLOSE TO MEGALADON!!! GREAT APP LOVE IT SO! You evolve you shark from a tiny reef shark to a prehistoric megalodon!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|i loved everything about it... i'm glad i got it... if i ever get the chance to see it on stage, i will... that's all i can say...
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|What I most liked about this movie was that it is a  remastered film, and that it is also an anniversary edition.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent read....very well written....couldn't put it down !! What a phenominal author.  Already started book 2 !!<br />I have enjoyed reading these books !!
0811729117|5.0|This is well worth reading and having.<br /><br />One of the best of the war in the Eastern Front.<br /><br />Glad I have this book, I have read of Otto many times, and I am a fan of the famous Tiger.<br /><br />Casper_zip
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got hooked on the show after my son was born, I love it!  Can't wait for the next season to start!
0385528752|5.0|I just received this book and I am enjoying it very much.  It helps to understand how we as humans fear change and also want change.  It is helping me to get to where I want to be in my work with animal welfare issues.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is difficult, and unless you plan on spending money, you will have to be patient and slowly blast through baddies. Also the missiles are really hard to dodge.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This can be a very important book for you to read. I recommend you take the time to do so.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Enjoy the tension.  It keeps me interested. The love triangle and the pressure of the job are what keep me coming back for more.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I had to read this book for book club and to be honest , I didn't know what to expect. But I found it a really interesting read. Being the mother of two girls myself I found myself questioning my own approach to parenting! Maybe a little more aggressive attitude would receive better grades! It also depends on the child as I definitely have a Sophia and a Lu Lu! But I definitely ended up liking Amy at the end. Her way definitely wasn't the easy way!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Love the tension.  Keeps me interested. The whole love triangle and the drama of the profession are what keeps me coming back for more.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|makes me crazy! i love this and can't stop playing this! it is awesome and I wish it had MORE MORE LEVELS!!!! AAAAHHHH!!!! where is SLICE ICE 2?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hated the end of season 3 but still love the series. I can't wait for season 4 to begin!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I am just a grandma that likes video games. I don't know or understand all the gaming lingo all the gaming pros use.<br /><br />But I do know what I enjoy and this is the most enjoyable game I have gotten from Amazon so far.  FUN with a challenge,anyway for someone who plays the build a city or farm or any of a myriad of build games,this his just super fun and refreshing.<br />  Many of the reviews have given precise details on how to play this game they are<br />right on the money.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Very fun game. I close my eyes and I see the puzzle board. But it is too short only took about 3 hours to unlock everything.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this book very well written, easy to read and highly intriguing.  I believe anyone with a penchant for off beat excitement and mystery will love this!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Best game I have on my Kindle Fire HD!! I just love the game! I love the horses and zebras!! The game maker should create more horses and zebras!!
B000OVLINI|1.0|Usually, when I find there are many low views for a book, I enjoy it. But this time I regret buying this book. I agree with most of the low views of this book. It droned on, like the ghost history professor from Harry Potter. (Not that I don't think the books were the best, I was just giving a simile that also comes from Harry's opinion.) I zoned out and skipped the parts without dialogue, for the dialouge was extraordinarily interesting in comparison to the rest of the book. I loved the overall plot but it droned on. This is a very, very, very low comment and rate coming from me. I hope I write better than that when I become an author! Listen to the others, one star reviews, that is. This was very boring. I will be careful in the future. The beginning was great, I leaped right in, in fact. But as I read on, it became very hard for me to read this book. Sorry to everyone who liked it. :(
B008BU75IQ|5.0|It is my opinion that Jeffrey Archer is the best story teller/author that I have read. The Clifton Chronicles does not alter my opinion of Archer and I have enjoyed immensely each of the three (out of five) volumes to date. Can't wait for the remaining two volumes!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One gets caught up in the Downton Abbey story line almost immediately.  I believe the production portrays what life was like in Britain in the 20's quite accurately.  The acting is superb, the quality of the filming excellent and the story line intriguing<br /><br />I can hardly wait for season 4..
B009GED3HS|5.0|After 8 seasons this show is still going strong. If you have not started watching How I Met Your Mother yet, you need to.
B005HED11Y|5.0|After so many years, it is still awesome. I'm not a treky, or a super nerd. It's just one of the best science fiction from the sixties.
B00947N6D8|4.0|Rise of the guardians was a very interesting movie. My grandkids loved it and watch it over and over and over. It incorporates a new outlook on the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Boogey Man, Santa Claus, and other childhood myths that we grow up with
B000FVE3AC|5.0|The watch looks so good in my hand, it's a beautiful piece of art. This watch keeps good time and it is heavy the way I like it.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Vikings is an excellent production. I feel immersed in the history of that time. Without the vikings the western world would not be as it is today, Vikings is one way to get the feel of history in an enjoyable manner. I cannot wait until the next season.
B00CATSONE|5.0|At first, as I read and read, I was very uncertain that I was reading about Nikola Tesla. But as I kept reading, it very much interested me that I have an unique ability to really do what I set my heart to. And so, I kept reading. It then brought me to the story of Nikola Tesla. After his story, I was certainly quite amazed that no matter what or who, he remained optimistic about his work and kept going. After reading his amazing story and realizing how much work and machines he made, that we still use today or have made better, I realized too that I could be a great mind. I just need to use my creativity and imagination. I do wish people would see the brilliant mind that Nikola Tesla had. All in all, I've learned that everyone is a genuis whether some has been told they aren't, Everyone is. You just have to find it within you. Find your creativity and imagination. Some has lost that from too much thinking they've done. But the trick is, don't use your mind in order to find it. Let it come to you.<br /><br />Oh yea... The author did an amazing job with this book. Well said and well organized with the words. I felt bad for Nikola, no one realized his great ability and we could of had known alot more or had more amazing inventions, if only they let him carry on with his work.
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you are looking for a challenging game that can be played in short bits of time try this. I have been playing this for a while once or twice a day. I am progressing at a good pace and haven't spent any money. If you are willing to wait for your energy to recharge on it's own it won't cost you anything and you will have a fun progressive game. Go ahead get the free version you will like it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this is my best game on my kindle and its really fun and worth getting and guess what its free there is never a better deal than that the only con though is that you have to have energy to build stuff and have to have energy you have to buy certain buildings witch cost alt of gold but its a awesome game and you should get it before it cost.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a while since I picked up a book and couldn't put it down, well, in this case my kindle. The first book was a short story, as well as a freebie on amazon. I thought I'd give it a try and as soon as I was finished, I was purchasing the whole series. It reminded me of all the jaw dropping twists the &#34;Lost&#34; show had. In fact, I think this would make an excellant tv series. It has enough cliffhangers to keep you coming back for more. Now you're probably thinking that I have rambled on without telling you anything about the book, and I'll tell you, you're right. Actually, the tag line is a little inside joke for others that have read it. Just get the first book and see what you think. It's very short, but I'm sure it's enough to get you reading more the way it snagged me.
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|Artists are able to create music that has 70s influence.  This was a \\"try hard\\", local critic gave it 3.5 stars, the article stressing more on who collaborated, little on it's substance.  Bland as cooking chicken without salt.  Listened to it again, not very inspiring.  Sort of ends the 70s that reveres, was inspires, etc.  Garbage, since I waited long for this release.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|A great story, with a lot of twists!  My high school aged daughter all the way to my grandmother love this series!!!
B008220DIC|5.0|Just finished watching The Master and found it an extremely intelligent film. It made me very edgy and yet I couldn't stop watching. The acting by all involved was incredible. It is not a film for everyone. I totally agree with that. I often wonder why most people review a film as being boring and terrible and slow etc. but yet spend two hours plus watching the entire film and then wishing they could somehow be given back the 2 hours they supposedly wasted. Doesn't make much sense. It's only a movie-----
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have bought other workout dvd's before and thought I was working out...well, I was wrong. I also knew I could be in better shape. But just level one of this dvd leaves me dripping in sweat. It is very satisfying knowing I am actually WORKING OUT now. And it's so funny when I am feeling like stopping, Jillian says some sassy remark about not stopping.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really wonderful! Very addicting!! The graphics, music, and all around board are very easy to use. Would recommend this game to everyone. It's creative, and its good to bring out the 'design' in each of us! I love it!!
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Scary all the way to the end, but the ending is very disappointing! Looks like the writers or producers ran out of ideas!<br />;-/
B008EKOIN8|4.0|I found this book about the four general methods of food preparation quite interesting. I come from a cooking and baking family and have cooked and baked myself for almost fifty years. My mother was a weekly baker of bread, and my son in law is a sometime brewer of beer, but I had only rudimentary knowledge of the science behind the activities of roasting, stewing, leavening, and fermenting until I read this informative and entertaining book.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time I could watch over over and over again each day
B008OOYALE|3.0|My six-year-old granddaughter said she didn't have enough room on my kindle to get homes<br />for all the dragons.  It was an OK game
B008D36INE|2.0|this movie was hard to follow and very depressing it projects a bad senario for women to go through in life
B005LAIIKI|1.0|When I think of Quentin Tarantino and his fans, a line from Dazed And Confused instantly comes to mind, altered slightly, and makes total and complete sense. I can imagine old Quentin saying, \\"That's What I Love About Tarantino Fans: I Get Older, They Stay The Same Age\\". I'm sorry, but I can't imagine anyone over the age of fifteen liking this film. Hell, I can't even imagine anyone who knows a thing or two about cinema liking this film. Django Unchained was obviously made for little children who can't achieve any sort of stimulation without hip dialogue, ultra violence, and some sort of hoity-toity 'cool factor'. Tarantino gets more and more pathetic with each and every new film he is involved with. The man is 50 years old, and he has never EVER made a film reflective of himself, his fears, loves, or his passions. He has never once made any sort of attempt at making a personal film, he is still desperately clutching onto a 'cool factor' he once had 20 years ago, and the whole charade seems ultimately sad and pretty embarrassing.<br /><br />When Pulp Fiction was released, he excited the entire planet, and revitalized American film. What happened to that guy? Because surely the director that made Pulp Fiction and the director that made Django Unchained must be two separate people. One guy obviously loved movies and defined himself through the art that he admired, while the other one seems to only be interested in perpetuating a self made myth about himself, further destroying modern film, and draining the life out of nearly everything in reach, all for the sake of 'cool'. Nice one, Quentin.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I really wanted to get into this story. It is a very good concept, however I felt like it just couldn't kick off. The writing made it very difficult for me to picture what was going on, and I never got a good understanding of the characters. The fourshadowing was very predictable, and some of the dictiptions were very confusing. In the end I was just not invested in the characters. I won't continue the series :(
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie was very tedious to watch. Bad acting and jumping back and forth through different time dimensions. I could not stay awake. It was tedious. If that is what they were striving for they pegged it. .
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|!!!THE BEST ACTING I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. WOW CAN THESES PEOPLE ACT. YOU WILL LOVE THESE DVDS.
B000003JBJ|5.0|If you haven't listen to Incognito you are missing something great.  Excellent work!  This is a real band at it's finest.
B000N90JGI|5.0|Love picks you up when you least expected it. Fun, beautiful good heart catcher.  Nice movie to sit back with girlfriends and dream of your Mr Right.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A bit long with some unnecessary parts, but I enjoyed it. Worth the read if our looking for a book to fill some time.
B002HSSAY6|5.0|I love Henry Fonda as the bad guy in this epic western.  I've seen this countless times over the years and was delighted to find it on Prime Video.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|I needed to get my head around UX, and now where to start. That book just blow my mind and completely exceeded my expectation. It did because I was expecting to read a book about Usability for website, when in fact that book covers Usability for anything you do. It's about how can I convey my ideas to others in the most efficient and effortless way possible so people DON'T THINK about how you've gathered information, but focus on the information itself. I'm a IT Solutions Architect, and I still code a lot. After having read that book I realized I was using most of the key concepts to make my code more understable so my team could pick it up quickly. Same thing applied in the way I now do my presentations or write high level documents. That book is short, easy to read, and contains website examples.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is amazing. I've been hooked on it since Daft Punk did the promo during Coachella. This is the first physical CD I have bought in 11 years, and probably will be the last.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This was my first purchase of Adele, but it won't be my last. What an amazing voice she has. I am now a fan for life; keep them coming, Adele!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Always love this game I like how it has the expanded version so you can play all parts of Dash.
B001AIY58O|4.0|The compilation of camp and humor is encapsoluatating! You find yourself accompanying the fun and terror racing to an uncertain but plausible end.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I don't understand what the fuss was all about when the movie first came out.  It's true to the Bible.
1442444053|5.0|I first read 'Watership Down' more than forty years ago to my children. For a few weeks we lived and talked in a bunny world that had deep parallels with our own. Forever after we recognized types and forms of people and situations that were Watership personified. In many ways it entered into our values and growth. Now I am reading it to my youngest grandchild and the magic grows. She recognizes, compares, acts along and feels for group looking for a safe home.  I cannot imagine a life without having known this solid friend.
B001NCTCYY|5.0|In my opinion this is the greatest Rock n Roll live album ever. It is the one that inspired me to pick up the Guitar and dream of being up on stage Rockin' the crowd. It brings you to the concert. All you have to do is close your eyes and listen. It's as if you are there. Front row. Kiss set the standard with Alive!
B0006J28BO|5.0|This film is a classic! A must own for anime and movie fans a like! buy it now or die!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This sent me to Awakening your inner genius. What has changed in politics today. It leaves you wondering that we may have been using mobile phones decades before we are had this chap's full potential been allowed.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|From all the Mission Impossible movies that I've seen this one was the best by far. I especially loved Thandie she is such a beautiful woman.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|It is refreshing to see a show portray an intelligent woman who is not overly emotional or defining every aspect of her life by the man she is currently sleeping with. This show has fantastic character development and depicts an interesting 'behind the scenes&#34; look at the world of high powered defense attorneys with both the bureaucracy and politics intact.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I been having fun with this app is wonderful, I suggest it to anyone, it looks good, sounds good, the features are on point. Get this app
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is awesome but the fith time I opened it it just kept exiting it is the worst ever I hate it
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Great special effects. Watched this in the run up to IM3 to set the scene. Downy Jr. And Mickey Rourke give masterful performances. Overall, a very entertaining movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best show ever made.  It is a great historical novel.  We love it but season three is not as captivating as the others. It is a bit of a let down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved this show and it's vibrant Characters.  I could not wait to watch to find out what happened next in their lives.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best show out there.  Great quality footage.  Cannot get enough.  We just keep buying and buying the episodes like an addict.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|We saw this movie twice in the theater.  We loved it then and still love it at home.  It looks great on our Samsung 3D tv and it's fun to get that 3D experience in the comfort of your own home.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|One of my kids really likes the game, but the other says it's a little boring. They seem to play it often though. Who wouldn't like Nemo?!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I'm not a big video game person but there was just something so cute and fun about this movie!  The characters are unique and fun to watch and the storyline was great.  The 3D option is nice too.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Believe it or not, I have never seen the movie version of the Godfather. I have seen bits and pieces here and there. The book and the movie have been on my list for as long as I can remember.<br /><br />A few months ago I read Writing the Blockbuster Novel by Albert Zuckerman (which is a great book for writers, by the way). Zuckerman's analysis of what makes The Godfather work contained several examples. I moved The Godfather to the top of my list, setting aside several other books I had open at the time.<br /><br />Even then, I was hard pressed to find the time, so I went to my favorite, most reliable book medium--audiobooks.<br /><br />It is one of the best audio books I have listened to for a long time. Normally, stories with flashbacks worry me, but Puzo uses strategic flashbacks with consummate skill.<br /><br />I was stunned--absolutely blown away. There is a reason this book is a classic of modern fiction.<br /><br />I am definitely a Mario Puzo fan now.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A story of Lincoln's effort to abolish slavery during the Civil War. Mostly about the politics to get the amendment passed. I suppose some people would think it boring. But the story is very well written. Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones performances are epic. They say this was a true depiction of Lincoln. If so, my question when I look at Washington today is. &#34;Where have all the Lincoln's gone?!&#34; If your a history buff don't miss this one!
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|Some real laugh out loud moments, but story really dragged. This movie needed better editing. Melissa McCarthy's cameo was hilarious
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|A brutal depiction of the holocaust through one man's experience. This movie is not for the faint of heart. Very graphic scenes of executions. It just leaves you shocked of how brutal the Nazi roundup, treatment and execution of the Jews was.<br />It's a long movie, but well worth the watch. Extremely well done. No sugar coating here!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Never much interested in mysteries and detective stories, but for various reasons decided I needed to read the originals, and have thoroughly enjoyed them. i will say though, that there have been a number of places where the scanning for electronic version has mistaken the words, but not so much as to make it unintelligible, just noticeable. Can't complain too much, though, for the price and size of the collection.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This film advertised that it was an action movie. Well it delivers!  Lots of one liners. No deep plot here. Just taking the pain to the bad guys. If your looking for some mindless action. This is the movie for you.
0345803485|5.0|since i'm required to write a lengthy review, the book arrived ahead scheduled, in excellent condition, um, read it many times and finally decided to get my own copy. hope this is enough for a review. bottom line- excellent vendor, excellent product, excellent review
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a joy to read this book and learn how one lone woman, survived and thrived her hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.  The author admits to her frailties and inexperience as she heads into a rugged environment with one goal in mind; that is, to find peace after the devastation that followed her mother's death, and the resulting break up of her family.  I am grateful that Cheryl shared her experiences and feelings so honestly with her readers.  She won my admiration.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Must watch. History and drama all together. Be sure to watch Season one first so you can establish your villains and heroes.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I'm sorry to see this series end, but Sookie has come full circle. To further her adventures would be repetitive and I'm happy Charlaine wanted a coherent end to Sookie's adventures without 'milking' the series. For all fans of Sookie, Eric, Bill and Sam- there is an end to the old, and all have a new beginning. Read it now!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very fun to play and you have to think,you don't have to pay to unlock more genes just keep playing and win on all level difficulties,<br />It has a gene that causes zombies! great stuff.
B0088W6LAK|4.0|Not he best Sci-fi but great for working out on a treadmill. Star Gate is sort of like Star Trek without the Enterprise.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I liked the storyline very much.  However, the language in the book was not necessary at all.  Castle and Becket never use that kind of language in the series and it's a huge hit.  Why was it thought to be necessary in the books???  I was very disappointed!  Other than that, like I said, the stories are great with tasteful love scenes and interesting and intriguing murder mysteries.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Where have I been? I recently discovered &#34;JB&#34; on PBS specials. Bonamassa is a great talent. This is another CD worth investing in.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very good game,I am addicted in a good way, lots to do overall very good extra coins and things quite pricey but easy to make money on game anyway.
B004OEMRGI|5.0|Im leaving this review, which is almost exactly the same as the one I left for Bombino's other album \\"Nomad\\":<br /><br />I cant even handle how much I love this musician. When I heard the first 2 chords of this record, I got a kick of adrenalin, my eyes went wide, my jaw dropped, and I remember thinking, \\"WHAAAT??!!\\".  I do however, have to admit that when the vocals came in -  I wasn't so sure. NOT because this guy cant sing, but  because honestly,I didn't know if I could get use to listening to another language. I kept it in my wish list for a bit and went back to it 3-4 times re- listening to the samples. Quickly I was pulled in more and more until I realized one day I was singing some song is some other language as I was doing the dishes.. it was crazy. I started looking into who Bombino was, reading his story and finding out more about him, because I was so curious about a guy who was making music I couldn't understand but still loved. The last thing I did before I ordered both of his cd's was watch the official video for the song \\"Azamane Tiliade\\", off his album \\"Nomad\\" ... And with that, it was a done deal.<br /><br />These guys are  just letting it all out in the studio, and though it sounds corny, IT DOESNT EVEN MATTER that I cant understand him. I don't care. This guy is so far beyond talented and full of so much life, you cant help but sway back and forth with them....its like a trance. Honestly, it almost makes it better that I cant understand a lick of what he's saying because I started to focus on the affliction in his voice instead. Its a pretty unique experience when you get a strong feeling just from the tone of a persons voice. This record is a giant combo of everything I personally love, and one thing I didn't know I loved:  garage/dirty rock/blues/soul/funk/ with a native flare. Talent oozing out of each note. He's crazy!  If yore tentative, its so beyond worth it to take a chance because I cant even imagine NOT having this cd along with his other, \\"Nomad\\"\\", which is a bit more polished, however neither outshine the other in my opinion. They are both so great in their own way. Hope this helps you decide to give it a go
B005HEFB6M|4.0|This is a great show but what is up with the begining theme song? I think they could have chosen something different as a theme song. Other than that the show was great.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Not open on Kindle and I just buy it. Can I have my money back, I don't think so. What I can do now?
B007EC27QM|5.0|Very convenient to have on my Kindle.  Like it very much.  Easy to understand, user friendly, would recommend to all who need to have a calc on hand.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I have been Amazon for at least an hour selecting books, movies, and game apps for our Kindles because we are driving to FLA. Saw this and wanted it for our child, who LOVES Wizard of Oz and Temple Run. So very disappointed that a Kindle Fire will not support this app!I am missing a version that is supported??
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game has awesome graphics but it's too hard for my 4 year old it's defiantly better for a kid that can read well. The aromor options are really cool but I think it's too hard to unlock the options.  it could lead to your kid wanting to buy points so they can unlock the armor they want.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Interesting, juicy, nighttime drama! Definitely recommend just one episode watch. One hit and you will be hooked! Sex, lies, videotape...I mean podcasts, webisodes...Lawyers? Who knew?!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My son loves this game skills it teaches good problem solving skills, the graphics are good and it flows with no glitches
B009GED1IY|3.0|There was no clear story and for Tom Cruise being the big &#34;star&#34; he could have been in it more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is wonderful I have bad Evernote for about two years. I don't know how I managed before I started using Evernote. I use it every day, I can't live without Evernote.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I love Jake and Anne so much, and their portrayal of these characters, while a little predictable, was still very raw and real and I totally got pulled in to the movie.  Have seen it twice now, and loved it both times.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I just love kate morton books . I've read all of them. This book is fantastic. It has drama murder and love. You just fall in love with her strong female characters. The story is simple yet intriguing. If you love house at riverton, you will love the secret keeper. Utterly unputdownable. I'm looking forward to her next book.
B001PP9ALY|4.0|Loved the effects and the action.  The story is a little out there, but I believed it all to enjoy the movie even more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves horses, I've looked for other games that she can vet the knowledge about horses and couldn't find any. When we found this she started playing and loved it, it teaches you all about the horse world
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Great film, but very dark, and it was a brutal ending. Incredible acting, and WOW, I never need to fly to Alaska!
B008NF45S2|4.0|I really like this app except for one thing it very very slow actually getting to the printer but once it finally does it is nice and to be able to print from the kindle is wonderful
B0071XO8RA|3.0|It seemed to take for ever to wade through this book and then almost none of the questions were answered very well. Who? Why? When? I guess we need to read the series to find out but I am not willing to spend any more time doing so. I just will never know.
B004TL3R24|5.0|I decided to get this to carry my 190xprob tripod. I already had the manfroto padded carrying case, but I wanted something that was quick to pull of my back and use. I find it very easy to carry the tripod, but when going through some gates like at the commuter tracks, then I have to be a bit careful not to bump the head on something. I find this strap more comfortable to carry the tripod than the manfrotto padded case that I have.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game runs smooth. It is easy to play. Scrat is adorable. I enjoy building creative plans and collecting coins.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|It's so easy to use! Wish it had been around when I was in school! I amazed my kids with something!

B00CH87HF4|5.0|love the gameplay.  had no idea the was a game like this available for the kindle<br />I am hooked.  don't want to turn it off.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Amy knows exactly what Amy wants, and she's not at all shy about getting it! Keep your wits about you as you read this novel, because Amy's well-laid plans might escape your notice if you don't. The chapters alternate between input from Amy and Nick, but be sure you know the timing and location of each one, or you'll be fooled! Oh, and remember to breathe now and then!
B007MC0IAG|5.0|This book is a great  to read book because it is simplified. I recommend this book to year fours plus (age 9 plus). It will tell you information such as how fossil are made, who was the first person on earth and lots of other information.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Following in the vein of the wonderful Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is the first of the movies celebrating the delightful story of Frodo Baggins, as he carries on in the footsteps of his mentor, Bilbo. The characters and the cinematography are outstanding, and the story is followed to the letter. A treat for all ages, but a tribute to the magic of Tolkien!
B00CFOI2QS|5.0|What does it take to get these classic Hammer films remastered onto Blu-Ray in the USA (most already exist in the UK). Love to see HAMMER release a Blu-Ray Box-Set of these great Horror classics:<br /><br />HORROR OF DRACULA (Lee/Cushing)<br />CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Cushing/Lee)<br />CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF (Oliver Reed)<br />THE MUMMY Cushing/Lee)<br />BRIDES OF DRACULA (Peter Cushing)<br />PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (Herbert Lom)<br /><br />Anyone agree?? Let the studios know.<br /><br />DAVE
B005LAJ16I|4.0|A good taste of what we might be faced with as a result of invading the Arab countries in our desperate search for oil. Great characters, wonderfully twisted plot that hooks you from the first episode! Can't wait for more!
B00785P2QC|1.0|DO NOT BUY GAMES FROM. THIS COMPANY!!  Not only will  they rip U for big money, they  Will not ever respond  to you when U have a problem a really scrappy company . Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I enjoyed following the characters from the previous two books, but thought the story became a bit of a fantasy toward the end of the book.
B0052REUW0|5.0|I admitt that when I started to read this I was a little dubious that violence really has been decreasing even though I had seen some evidence of it from scientific scources over the last few years. What the author did was amass such a large number of studies and statistics as to render the nul hypothesis to less than 0.01. I will henceforth watch the news with an even more skeptical mind and I will point out to fellow veiwers that news does not represent reality but only what sill sell the most advertising. Thank you Steven Pinker for yet another great read about an important topic.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am ready for the next chapter each time I finish one, I love playing it! It is a very well done game.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The book was one of my favorite reads and I was sure I would be disappointed.....I wasn't.  I thought the movie was well done AND true to the book.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A lovely story! Sweet, sad, and stimulating.  Interesting if you have been to England, to follow his trip. Nicely written.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I assumed from the beginning that it was the judge. Why? Because Wargrave was the only one who knew that all of the guests were arriving. He kept a level head, asked legitimate questions that strategically avoided his own self involvement, and his death was very out of pace with the others. Note also, that we never got a look into his mind but in chapter one. Speaking of one; I can't believe the others didn't notice U.N. Owen is UNO or the Spanish word for one.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Funny, I've read the reviews and am shocked that anyone thought it laughable.  Now if Ben Stiller played lead, as another reviewer mentioned, it might have been a film to watch.<br /><br />Still shaking my head in amazement that this is considered comedy.............well, I'm not much of a movie goer, but not seeing much film for quite a number of years, I've not been sucked into entertainment complacency.  Poorly done, poor story line, no substance, no flow, poor character development, poor acting, pat, politically correct scenarios thrown in everywhere, pandering, etc.<br /><br />As if that wasn't bad enough to make me walk out, the language of the supporting actress was.  Utterly disgusting!  Filling a movie from start to finish with foul language must be a criteria for award winning films these days.  Of all the things SLP didn't have, it definately had that.<br /><br />Like others, one star only because I couldn't give it a zero.
B005544TRQ|5.0|good concept, just wish season 2 was on prime...<br />I guess i will have to wait till it is to keep watching... or go directly to their website...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. it is great in its simplicity. great way to pass the time when waiting. the prizes are awesome and fun to obtain plus they are worth the pay out.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book showed me a different side of love.  I really liked the change that happened to Christian; he grew from a controlling person to a loving one.  His controlling nature was brought about by the worse kind of abuse, but he overcame his proclivities because of his love for Ana.  He also recognized the damage he had done to others and tried to make a mends for his actions.  Ana grew too. She grew from awe to fear and from lust to love.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Maybe Dennis Rodman should have read this book before going to  North Korea and making a fool of  himself. Most people have no idea how ruthless this regime is.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Perfect for my needs. Both month at a glance and individual days. Room for notes and any remit Dee's you need.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|This was a very disappointing movie......it had no connection with book..which was a good read.....sad that they went for a money<br />name and ignored the character ....more than just a physical miscast.....entire movie was a failure.

B00B31AA8C|5.0|It always makes me miss Frank alot- What a brilliant parody album. He is sorely missed. We hungry freaks salute him.
B0051GY0LS|3.0|Found the book something out of the Famous Five detective club for kids. The plot was to simplistic with the end result easily known long before the book ended
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I had a hard time giving this book a rating. I really enjoyed the beginning of this novel. The writing is beautiful and I immediately liked Sam as a character. At the half way mark though, the book started to drag. There were a few key story elements that hadn't been explained yet. So at this point I was asking myself why haven't these characters thought about this possibility yet? The answer to all of your problems is obvious! Move to California!<br /><br />About 2/3 the way through the book we learn that they tried moving to a warmer climate but it was no use. After this eye opener the book picked up again and finished on a high note. After I finished the book I was left wondering if the ending made up for the earlier oversight. It did, kinda.<br /><br />I really enjoyed learning more about Sam. He's responsible yet playful, sensitive yet courageous. He carries such a burden for someone so young, not to mention the horrible childhood he had. Sam definitely hasn't had it easy but he still is able to find a reason to smile. I also enjoyed reading his lyrics throughout the book. He has a thing for music and is constantly turning every day activities into songs. Cheesy but romantic.<br /><br />This book progressed at a much slower pace than what I'm used to. But this book is categorized as YA so that makes sense. The love story side of the book was an interesting one. Grace falls in love with the wolf before the man. That's sweet and weird all at the same time.<br /><br />The wolves of Mercy Falls are wolves in the winter and human in the summer. When the temperature drops below a certain degree they change. A different take on why werewolves shapeshift but ok I'll go with it. But the constant running from one heat source to the next like it's life or death became a little annoying after a while. A lot of their struggles seem like they could be solved by common sense. Then again, they're teenagers.<br /><br />That being said, I liked this book. It is beautifully written, Stiefvater definitely has a way with words. The sentences flowed so well it was like reading poetry. Also, Sam alone made the book a worthwhile read for me. The beginning and the end of the book were great, because of them I'll be moving on to Linger. I just hope that the middle will be better this time around. I'm reluctantly giving this book a 4 out of 5.en, Stiefvater definitely has a way with words. The sentences flowed so well it was like reading poetry.

B00AKFG15S|5.0|Must read all the Chronicals in order. The story starts off slow but will keep you turning pages and buying the next book enforce you go to sleep. Each book ends with a huge twist
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|For me, The Wolves of Mercy Falls series started off as a so-so read. Linger was definitely better than Shiver, but Forever...? WOW! This book manages to be uplifting, heartbreaking and magical all at the same time. I've been on the fence about this series for the past two books but this third and final installment makes me wish for it to never end! If only all of the novels could have been like this! I have a feeling that this story is going to stay with me for a long while. I typically don't re-read books because honestly, who has the time? But I'm going to make an exception for Forever. It's so much more than just a werewolf book or just a YA tale of boy meets girl. I turned the last page only mere minutes ago and I'm already missing Sam and Grace. Isabelle and Cole too, fancy that!<br /><br />I'm never going to get tired of Maggie Stiefvater's lyrical writing style. It is art in text format; it really is. I'm currently contemplating starting her Books of Faerie series just so I can have another dose of her beautifully written prose. Sam and Cole's song lyrics are packed full of emotion and meaning. I think Maggie should consider producing a Wolves of Mercy Falls album. I'd buy it and I know that I wouldn't be the only one! The combination of her writing style, the characters' lyrics and random bits of quoted poetry turn this book into a living, breathing entity. Regardless of whether you like or dislike Young Adult werewolf fiction, Maggie's writing will win you over and you'll grow to love the story. Don't believe me? Read an excerpt and see for yourself!<br /><br />Sam and Grace's love transcends space and time. It's so innocent and new but somehow manages to be as meaningful and deep as some of the greatest romance stories of all time. There's no sex in this book, there's barely even any touching but the message that's portrayed is incredibly powerful. I could feel the love that they have for one another through the pages. Forever was the first time that Grace and Sam were wolves together and I loved every minute of it. Back to my earlier comment, their love even carries over to their canine selves when all other thoughts are lost. That's how powerful their connection is. Look at me trying to do the impossible: describe the relationship between Sam and Grace. Just read the book. You'll see.<br /><br />I was surprised to find myself as wrapped up in Isabelle and Cole's weird relationship as I was in Sam and Grace's. Theirs is an entirely different kind of \\"love\\". I'd describe Roth's and Brisbane's as light while as this unwitting duo's is dark. The contrasts and similarities between the two couples evoked such powerful imagery and feelings; it's also one of the reasons why I loved this book so much. This opposite ends of the spectrum effect wasn't as present in the previous installments.<br />The ending is a real page turner. In fact, the entire book is. Unfortunately, due to real life getting in the way, I had to put the novel down a mere 20 odd pages away from the end. The finale to The Wolves of Mercy Falls series took my breath away. It's happy and sad, satisfying but heartbreaking; in short, it was everything I'd hoped for yet it left me craving more. I'd previously given another Young Adult book the number one spot for 2011′s YA fiction but it's not too late to change my mind! And change my mind I am! Forever is in a class all of its own, it has no equal. I loved every word on every page.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|While Sheryl has had many opportunities that others do not I think her portrayal of the business world was right on.  It's time we stand up for what is right and promote each other as women.  We all need to LEAN IN and know that we have the right and the obligation to sit at the table. I could relate to just about every chapter. I don't know what comes first, the chicken or the egg but what does it matter?  Can't have one without the other.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Maggie Stiefvater's lyrical writing style is back in full force in this second installment. I didn't fall completely in love with Shiver as many others did but Stiefvater's style is so remarkable that I just had to file the whole series under \\"must read\\". Linger did not let me down. In fact, I loved this book! The addition of a new character and two new points of view made all of the difference. Shiver was good but Linger was better!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore Sam and Grace but the story didn't revolve exclusively around them this time around and for that I was grateful. The two love birds have sort of switched shoes in this book and I found that the role reversal suited their characters better. For the hardcore fans, there's still plenty of Sam and Grace goodness and their relationship is stronger than ever. Their love story is hopelessly romantic. Stiefvater manages to convince even me, a skeptical cynic, that happily ever afters are possible.<br /><br />The new character, Cole St. Clair, stole the show for me. He's definitely my new favorite in this series. I wasn't a fan of him at first but he quickly won me over. He's a bad guy struggling to be good, or is it the other way around? It was hard to tell at times which is one of the elements that makes his character so intriguing! Cole is a famous rockstar looking to escape the spotlight and his past by joining the pack. I could totally relate to the way he describes the benefits of being an animal who relies on instinct vs the downfalls of humanity. We've all wanted to crawl into a hole and hide at one point or another in our lives. Cole puts those feelings into words and the outcome is incredible.<br /><br />At first, I thought that having the story told from four different points of view was going to be confusing. However, that wasn't the case and Stiefvater pulled it off beautifully. The different narratives really allow readers to get into each character's mind and to know the nitty gritty details of their inner workings. My only complaint about this novel was the lack of werewolf appearances. After all, this series is called The Wolves of Mercy Falls.<br /><br />Linger is a piece of art in book format. Stiefvater's lyrical writing style is unparalleled. The content is chock full of emotion and the words flow so well that you'll find yourself on the last page before realizing that you just read the entire novel in one sitting. There's also a monster of a cliff hanger ending that'll leave you impatiently awaiting the release of Forever later on this summer. If, like me, you weren't completely sold on this series after the first book; I encourage you to give Linger a try. You won't be disappointed!ty details of their inner workings.

B009E3EY38|5.0|This Blue Ray is of good quality and it is great that they can bring this great band to the point of technology.
B00CNX4YMM|5.0|Many hate on this band because they supposedly sound like AC/DC.  Their not AC/DC nor do they sound like them.  What makes people believe they do sound like them is the screaming vocalist and that they make some great rock n' roll.  Black Dog Barking will be a trend setting album for future rock, definitely a definitive album for Airbourne.  Much of Airbourne's music will get your blood pumping and is surrounded by great lyrics.  Those songs on this album include \\"Back In The Game\\", a very Cinderella Sounding song; \\"Hungry\\" which is about always pushing for what you want and the title track which has a similar theme to the other three especially when vocalist Joel says \\"It's not the size of the dog in the fight, its the size of the fight in the dog\\".  Highlights of this album are every song on it.  You will not stop listening to it unless your a hater, in that case you have to stop thinking Airbourne as an AC/DC knockoff, cause their not.  Like any band you can hear their influences and there are many, one of which is AC/DC, but other bands like Motorhead, Cinderella and Def Leppard are all evident in their music.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This is very nice - it does everything it's supposed to - just doesn't stand up easily - I'd recommend it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|the story moves along well and the characters are likable.  Special effects exceed budget although character development could be stronger.  Enough to keep you coming back for more.

B004GHNH7Q|1.0|I agree with the other negative reviews of this title.  Nowhere in the basic description does it note this is a collection of essays.  After purchasing for Kindle, there is no taking it back and I could have purchased this for my son for less than 5 dollars at any bookstore new.  [[ASIN:B004GHNH7Q Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird]]
0061906220|5.0|After just one read/sing through the kids in my preschool classes want me to immediately read it again! They look forward to saying \\"Goodness, no!\\" and the little song really shows off their rhythmic abilities. Nice find!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The book is a wonderful book!  It includes a thoughtful history of several people, businesses, and movements that illustrate the concepts the author presents.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I lfound the book very interesting but towards the end it just seemed too unrealistic and I lost interest. Learning about the flower meanings was very interesting and I did enjoy most of the novel.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|If you love Quintin Tarantino's movies, you will love this.  Wonderful!  An action packed ride from beginning to end with wonderful humor to lighten the intensity.  I have seen it three times and still love it.
B000LJ9ZWE|5.0|I am not a watcher of old movies, but Westworld is a grand exception. It holds characters played by lots of movie greats; chech the cast listing before you watch. I liked the dialog and under lying meaning that pop. Watch it you will enjoy it only if you stick with it. Great movie!!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|What is not to love... Fun, bouncy songs. He has an incredible voice. It is very relaxing and I enjoy the CD very much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun little game to pass the time. Easy to use -no problems loading or freezing. The pop ups are a little annoying but theirs are easy to click away (not like some that are difficult to find the x). I am happy with this for a quick game
0545123291|5.0|Great read, I am really enjoying the YA books on the market right now. I admit it, I was a &#34;Twilight&#34; fan, and this has been a fun &#34;replacement&#34; for me.

B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am just about done with Season 3 of The Good Wife, and, thus far, Season 2 is my favorite. The show continues to get better during this season:  the characters become more interesting and developed, and I think the writers really hit their stride as far as coming up with intriguing legal themes to explore and political rivalries to showcase. I loved almost every episode of this season. I kind of wish Season 3 had me as excited to watch each episode, but I'm hoping Season 4 is great!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Simply awesome.  Great game. Complicated but fun.  Do not use hints for a real challenge.  I wish it was longer and cannot wait until the next room.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|Finally!!!! After all these years I've seen Scarface. A must see. Al Pacino, what can you say? He OWNS this role.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its not fun with out buckets imean it takes like amonth to make obsidian and without eggs ,placeable redstone,pressure plates levers eft you can't make a harmless prank on the monsters.and seriously there is no changeable skins and can't change to and from creative.
B004SEUIWO|5.0|Musicals aren't for everyone, especially me. But, this movie was supurb!!! The cast was fantastic, and well cast for their parts. I loved the story line, and especially Richard Gere's part as a slippery lawyer! Smoooooooth!
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I love every song on the album! Love that I can digitally download it and play it anywhere I go!
B008602KQI|5.0|After listening to the trilogy of the Hunger Games, I decided to get this movie. I hadn't watched it when it came out because there were too many negative comments on the shaking of the camera in the action scenes....when movies do this, I get a severe headache....well, I didn't find the camera movement anymore than any other movie. I loved this movie!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show that was hard to stop watching.  The ease of access through Prime is great and quality was excellent!
B00CMEQD30|3.0|I did enjoy this book, though I felt the author could have done a little more to contribue to the overall coherency. I had a difficult time finding out which speaker was actually talking, which stilted the otherwise excellent dialogue. Also there were a great many words used outside of their proper definition, which was entirely too confusing. I also (personally) disliked the heavy focus on non-violence. There were several instances that could have been powerful moments that were diluted by what became a preachy sort of rhetoric, though I understood the author's desires in developing the story in the manner that she did.<br /><br />On the other hand, the author does write a good story. I thoroughly enjoyed the history of the Law Book, and thought the premise thoroughly original. The two protagonist's backstories were well fleshed out, and created sympathetic characters that the reader wished to see succeed. I enjoyed the Windchildren and Woodchildren very much, as well as the gods of the magical land. Sempervirens was a captivating villain as well, and I thought the author handled her quite well.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent one-time read.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another classic Jack Reacher story by Lee Child. I alsways find these books hard to put down and this one was no exdception.
B007RCJNDE|1.0|14 books down the hole, the end of this book was a let down. I am not sure how it should have ended but this was a bit of a fizzer.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have been really happy with all my purchases over the years and will continue to shop Amazon.  I am always amazed at what items I can find.  Shipping has always been faster than I expected and I haven't had to return anything so far.
B0016492BW|4.0|Classic British humor! Though it's Blu-ray, don't expect the quality to be perfect. Its an old movie, Blu-ray wasn't invented, etc... So I don't know if I would spend the money on Blu-ray, but either way, its a hilarious movie!
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I tried three different products all failed! Finally I got this one works for long range to take advantage of city free Wi-Fi services.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Does what is needed to do. Easy way to get to LinkedIn without running to your computer. I use this version more frequently than the computer online version
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I got it back when it was free!!! it's awesome and very useful!!! I'll get it even if I have to pay for it, worth every cent!!!
B002O2THRO|4.0|I read the book years ago. I saw the 2012 version; which was great. This older version is also great! Some parts in the movie that I don't remember explain it clear in the movie
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I see I am not alone in saying I never write reviews but just had to for this one. Laying awake at night frustrated and completely unfulfilled after this disappointing end to a trilogy simply made it impossible to ignore my grievances.<br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />I get the symbolism of the ending. I do. However, when you invest two previous books into the detailed relationships of the two love stories (the entire basis for their resistance), you cannot then just hang them out to dry in the finale. Wait I guess you can bc that's exactly what the author did. There is absolutely no further development of Alex, Julian and Lena's relationships. Instead, they just seem to coexist and you forget what they are fighting for. The love that was so beautifully developed in the first two books, the love that gets readers excited to see its path, its struggle, and its end was just abandoned, Yes, the ending was supposed to be open ended for the reader to draw their own conclusion but that doesn't work when there are so many stories left unresolved. Instead it just seemed rushed. An easy way out. Had i known while reading delerium and pandemonium that Julian and Alex would just end up as side characters i would have been totally heartbroken. I adored the first two books. Went to bed thinking abut the characters story until I fell asleep. Heart racing, excited for tomorrow when I could pick up where I left off...but by the end of Requiem I had totally lost my passion. Completely anticlimactic ending to an otherwise fantastic trilogy.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I saw it on the big screen with my wife with a negative, chick-flick attitude. But I was surprised how good the movie was! Great acting, the graphics were great, and I liked how they did the 'live' singing. If you listen good, you can hear some flunders from some of the actors, which make it more like a 'play' than an actual movie
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Funny, shocking, violent, gross, intriguing, with a protagonist who invokes a sympathetic character. Great acting and a totally different premise than anything I've seen before. I could not wait to watch the next episode.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It's fun to play. Like that you can up your scores. Will enjoy playing for some time to come with friends.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love historical fiction and this book didn't disappoint me. This is a story about the people that actually ran the plantation and how endured the injustices of the owners, yet pulled together and survived it all.
0142418471|5.0|Daughter claims John Green is her favorite author and has NEVER been disappointed by his books. &#34;Will Grayson&#34; was no acception.
B00BDJ5ZVQ|5.0|This is not what you would expect from a doctor in his category .. It is one you will not want to put down until you read it all ... am reading it again to comprehend all he writes about ..
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|The game itself is fairly addictive...you collect stars and power-ups, upgrade your moon, and get closer and closer to the ultimate goal, which is to return to Earth.  It's well-executed for what it is...a space-themed platformer, where you sneeze from orbit to orbit by tapping the screen.<br /><br />I was wary about the permissions, but I've been playing it for about a month now and so far nothing bad has happened.  In view of this, I think this one is worth a try.
140123769X|5.0|There are good comics and there are great comics.  These are great.  The storyline and characters are terrific.  The art is wonderful.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|It had much more of a plot than expected and the diminutive Cruise actually pulled it off. Like his &#34;miscasting&#34; as Lestat, I've had to eat my words twice now.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy these puzzles. I enjoy the selection that I am given and the degree of difficulty so not only I can enjoy them but my grandchildren too.

B00BHU9DUK|4.0|Good cinematography. Costumes and set were amazing. I enjoyed it, but don't think most men would like it...it's a chick flick.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|i guess it was suppose to be a comedy but it wasn't very funny to me and since i only ordered the preview edition of the show i only saw very little of the first episode and i did not like what i saw.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|He was my favorite doctor, but Amy Pond is Uber annoying. My daughter is 4 & she loves this show as well. She likes to talk to people and ner favorite episodes.
140525355X|5.0|Excellent item!  Very nicely packaged collection.  :)<br />Wanted this collection for myself & now my 6 year-old gets to have it & enjoys it completely with mom and dad.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I'm still not a fan of Sanderson as I find his dialog between characters cheesy at best, but I do think it's worth reading.  The battles last a little too long and weaves \\"just miss people by inches\\" a few too many times, but it is a nice, sweet ending to a series that I have loved.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a fun and addicting game.  I don't usually purchase games but after playing the free version I enjoyed playing so much that I went ahead and purchased it.
0913866156|5.0|If you love Tarot and do not own this deck, do yourself a favor and indulge. The artwork is fantastic and the cards are of the highest quality. This is truly an essential for any serious Tarot collector.
B0081336FO|5.0|These two are terrific! Always kept me interested. Love the humor. Laughed out loud many times. Cannot wait for the next season.
B0060D15AK|5.0|Rated this 5 stars because of the actors, the comedy and overall one of the best. I would recommend this to<br />everyone.
B007ZYJT1U|3.0|Sad, dark story. Not for young kids.  The name is a misnomer. Do not find that out until late in the movie.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. Much better than the movie. It was a fast read and had a happy ending.
B0081336FO|5.0|the &#34;treats&#34; in each episode for those who have read the original stories are wonderful.  Benedict and Martin are unbelievable together.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has written another great book, if you are a true fan, you will not be disappointed! Great read!
0545091020|2.0|Several of the cd's skipped or stop playing all together in my computer. My co-worker had the same problem with her cd's. I loved the book and the narrator was great, it's the quality of the cds which I don't like.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|SRK and Kajol have outdone themselves with this movie. How poignant and endearing. All sorts of emotions are displayed, love sympathy, hurt, bias, heroism, etc. I can go on with this list. Modern day theme,  well casted, well produced. Great storyline.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Action packed and a great read! I read all 4 of the series and loved each one. It is worth every penny.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked this book! I read some of the negative comments before I read the book and found that none of the complaints seemed valid after I read the book. I liked the twists and turns in the book and have recommended it as my choice for my book club.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I just love it, it so handy, the quality is very good, i am just worried about the magnet a little bit
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Worth getting in the long run. You should buy this game. Don't wait gain this game now. Run run as fast as you can.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|it is a great game because they have so many vehicles and hills to race on. and it does not freeze or take a long time to load. the only thing I don't like is when you flip over the neck cracks and it sounds nasty ,but it's a great entertainment. go and buy  it
B000002GYW|5.0|I have always loved this CD -- it tells a story through basic rock music and images.  The picture on the cover is really a summary of what the songs are like.
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|I just think the game is difficult to figure out. I would not recommend this game to others. Thank you
B00846WWVM|3.0|I have played a a few of the popular physics games, and this is a variation on them.  Well done and interesting, but I dropped it after a few minutes.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I like this game very much but i reached a point that i have to spend $3.99 to continue playing. That is a bummer in a game that was suppose to be free!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a fun story line and fun game even if you have to wait for you energy to replenish ive seen no lag or anything wrong g or bad so far
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I find this game challenging yet simple to understand. you strive to reach new levels by not flipping over the vehicle. very cool.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Amazing. I couldn't put it down, the love and loss was perfect.<br />This sequel to If I Stay was perfect for any teen or young adult
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This story has made me cry . It has made me think about life. It can be described in only one word. Amazing.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I enjoy this game! It's fun!! I thought it would be lame/ ok but it's fun! I love it a lot. I recommend it to girls or guys. I'm a girl and I enjoy it a lot, it works great on a kindle fire hd or just regular kindle fire. No glitches or anything! Best choice I made ever

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Wonderful turn around story of unrequited love, with the real &#34;thing&#34; lurking throughout; she deserved the Academy Award!  Good job...
B00CH87HF4|4.0|All in all very entertaining. Playable without spending cash, but the option is there for people that like the boost. Worth checking out even if you are a cheap skate<br />!

B006WAIV6M|5.0|Charles Duhigg unbundles a complex topic in an easy to read way, with a life changing payoff at the end of the book. Not only do we get a unique insight into ourselves and how we function, but we also get a simple, easy to implement mechanism that will change the way we live our lives. Awareness puts us in a place of choice, and this book does exactly that; it makes us aware of what is driving us, and gives us the methodology to bring about the changes that will alter the course of our lives.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|My favorite book ever.  Inspiring and full of wisdom.  Easy and fun story that reveals the way to fulfill your destiny and follow your dreams
B009AMANH4|5.0|As most people feel, this movie was brilliant, and will remain a classic.  If there were a couple of errors, (like giving Mary Todd a more cheerful disposition than she is known for), forget them.  The heart of the movie is perfect.
1878424777|3.0|The four agreements themselves are all good ideas, and worth learning about. Some of the examples given are simplistic to the point of silliness, and the occasional God reference caught me off guard, although I realize not everyone will find religious undertones off-putting.<br />Peter Coyote has a rich, soothing voice, and he presents the material in a straight-forward manner. I listen to the cds when I'm stuck in traffic, and I find it very calming.<br />These cds are probably not going to change anyone's life, but they are good for taking the edge off in traffic.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Stock up on your snacks before you watch this movie:  you won't want to miss a second.  A young Indian boy finds himself adrift on a lifeboat, crossing the Pacific Ocean with a tiger for &#34;company&#34;.  The two establish unenforceable rules, but batter winds, storms,and a freaky island.  I'm not one to give away plots.  Just see this movie over and over!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|do not even waste rental fees on this predictable... lets make jamie fox<br />look tough movie... hated it..... what were they thinking?
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Steven Soderbergh has retired (probably) and SIDE EFFECTS is his swan song. It is a fine psychological thriller with as major statement about the pharmaceutical industry and the rather nonchalant some physicians are dispensing drugs today - drugs that have many potential side effects as the seemingly endless commercials on television advertising drone on. Take Soderbergh's skill as a director, Scott Z. Burns' screenplay, and a dandy group of very fine actors and the result is a film that not only entertains but challenges the viewer's ability to keep all the twists and turns straight.<br /><br />Martin Taylor (Channing Tatum) is released form prison on an insider trader fiasco and returns to his young wife Emily (Rooney Mara) who in Martin's absence has had a miscarriage and rather severe bouts of depression and suicide attempts. She is under the care of psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) having a history of being under the care of Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Dr. Banks prescribes a new anti-depressant Ablixa (the only drug mentioned that is a pentagram instead of a real drug) and among the side effects are somnolence and somnambulism, and while on the drug Emily kills Martin. With Emily plea-bargained into mental hospital confinement and Dr. Banks' practice crumbling around him, the case seems closed. However, Dr. Banks cannot accept full responsibility and investigates to clear his name. What follows is a dark quest that threatens to tear what's left of his life apart even as he discovers the diabolical truth of this tragedy. The story steps into the territory of adultery of a novel sort, lesbianism, casual general drug use/abuse by nearly every character in the story, and forensic medicine as manipulated through psychiatrists' minds.<br /><br />In addition to the main characters, each of whom delivers superb acting, there are some fine contributions by the minor characters as played by Polly Draper, David Costabile, Mamie Gummer, and Ann Dowd. This is a clever story with many at times confusing elements but stay with the action and the thoughts and the piece becomes a well-oiled thriller.

B001OSIV62|4.0|I remember when Philip petit walked the wire joining the two towers. what no one saw was what it took to prepare for that even. What an amazing feat!
1576754227|4.0|I am reading it now. So far it's just common sense ideas like making lists of what you need to do. I hope to put all the suggestions in this book to good use at home and at work. I will also share it with my family and friends.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun game- same as the game on the apple app store. Works great on the kindle fire first generation.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|Mary poppins is a timeless classic that I could watch over and over. It is by far one of our favorites. Quality and sound were great as well
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This CD is a great colledction of Hawaiian singers, representing many types of Hawaiian music. So glad that this movie picked these songs.
B008B0QH5S|2.0|Having had a love affair with the Pet Shop Boys for such a long time, I expected the album to be more like their traditional music. I wanted it to be up and dance-y. No. Boring. Too bad. They've lost their touch for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|downton abbey only gets better, unlike so many tv shows it stays fresh, the actors interact like real family, cant wait for season 4
B00004TWZF|3.0|Maybe I did not look hard enough but I expected this to be in the original language with a choice for subtitles but it is all dubbed into English.  That is a bummer, but other than that I still love this movie and it is in great shape - love the French soundtrack as well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Slowing starting book.  Fast read throughout the middle.  Worst possible ending ever.  I wanted to rewrite the ending myself after reading the book.  It was like Gillian Flynn stopped thinking or caring as she ended the book.  Will not read her again.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|He still has it after all these years His voice has improved with age and he still knows how to write a beautiful song
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this game so much to the point that I dream about it.if your gonna love this app.you fly around blowing stuff up while trying to unlock more armour.if you unlock all other armours you get the great Igor armour
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|The characters are far too mature to believe. The story is too sugary and the twist at the end only just saves it.
0446672653|4.0|I liked this book better than Many Lives, Many Masters.  I wish I could regress to discover my past lives. What a tale it would tell.
B008JOLG7U|5.0|Enjoy hearing all the JLo classics and some of her new hits.  This is fun dance music that's the perfect soundtrack for cleaning or getting ready to go out!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Every one is different and really good. The acting, script, and plots are good. I would recommend this show to everyone
B00CFOY244|3.0|The movie was good, but no more than 3 stars.. Even tho they had some A list actors.. I would watch again

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This app is very cool it has some bad words in it but great graphics. On my kindle fire HD it takes a lot of GB but it was worth it. It goes slow at times but is now speeding up and I've only been playing for about 20 minutes.

B002QFYJF4|5.0|I was impressed with the sound and picture quality.<br />As far as the movie, I really enjoyed it.  I liked the different characters, even though most were not the most pleasant, they were interesting.  Magnolia was different from your average movie, with several storylines running concurrently.<br />I recommend.
B0063M22QO|5.0|You have to actually develop a strategy to complete some moves.  It keeps the mind thinking, active. I can get into this game.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|My husband, who was an English Lit. major, was not crazy about this book.  I loved it.  Perhaps it was the simplicity of the writing style that put him off.  That's one of the things I rather enjoyed about it.  It moved really quickly, keeping it's message at all times in the foreground, without me feeling like it was beating me over the head with it.  I found it to be uplifting, which was exactly what I was looking for at the time, as I rarely read fiction, but wanted something light to keep me occupied as we were moving home after four years living abroad.  If you are looking for literary sophistication, this book is probably not for you,  However, if you are looking for a great adventure, easy to read, with a good message, give it a try.  I would ad that my friend who suggested it said he's read it 3 different times and took something different away from it each time.  One day I will read it again myself and see if it's the same for me.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Let me just go ahead and warn you, this will be a completely ridiculous and fun (for me) review. I'm kind of a ridiculous person anyway, and this book just brought it out in me even more. I don't do \\"scholarly\\" reviews, but I'm guessing you've already figured this out, amirite? I write FEELINGS reviews, and Tangled gave me a lot of FEELINGS.<br /><br />My feelings for Tangled include, but are not limited to: happiness, pure joy, lust, shock, awe, lust, outrage, pity, lust, enlightenment....<br /><br />Speaking of enlightenment, Tangled taught me a lot. The story has a unique narrative. The fourth wall is down, and Drew is directly speaking to the reader, making asides as he tells the story of falling in and earning love. I mentioned to some friends that Tangled made me feel powerful, like I had been given a handbook to the male mind. I really like men. I like to know how the really think and feel. I have a guy sense of humor, so any book that gives me that is a treat. So back to enlightenment, Tangled offered some nice gems. Such as:<br /><br />*Men really do think about sex as much as you thought hoped they do. That's right, I said hoped. I've been with the same man since 1997, sixteen years, and after all this time, this is reassuring and hilarious to me. This knowledge makes me feel powerful.<br /><br />*Older sisters are the best. Drew's older sister Alexandra was hilarious and scary, maybe my favorite character in the book. Alexandra will rage on Drew and call him out for his stupid man ways. Her husband, Drew, and their friends don't dare cross Alex, but they love her fiercely. She will be the first to call Drew out for being an idiot, but also the first to have his back. Did I mention her title?<br /><br />*Ladies, men are on to us. Yep, they know that we talk about them, in and out of the bedroom. When I read this, I immediately asked my husband if this is true. I mean, I talk about him with my BFF to his face, but I was curious if all men knew this. Apparently, they're not as oblivious about some things as we'd thought.<br /><br />*Men love your body and they want you to love it too. They want to see you, and they want you to embrace being seen. When you are comfortable in your skin, there is nothing sexier to a man. I already knew this, but it's nice to have it reaffirmed. It is an amazing and powerful thought.<br /><br />*Smart men have a healthy and respectful fear of women.<br /><br />*Smart men also know who really holds the power.<br /><br />*Any man, even the most revered of bachelors, is capable of falling in love. That's not to say that any woman will do-- only the right one. But when he does finally fall, he falls hard. Forever.<br /><br />*Men screw up sometimes. They do. It's inevitable, and besides the point. What's important is that when he does make a huge jackass of himself, the man that is worth your love will do anything to prove his love and make things right.<br />Drew's determination to earn Kate's trust and love was at the heart of Tangled. It's Drew's journey from a \\"guy\\" to a \\"man\\".<br /><br />So you see, reading can be fun and informative. Use this knowledge!<br /><br />Tangled was such a great experience for me. I started chuckling on the first page, and the story only got better and better from there. Drew was a hot mess. Sexy. Intelligent. Arrogant. Ridiculous. Honest. It was an absolute joy to watch this man fall in love. Kate was amazing, too. She was also intelligent, but also sexy, strong, willful. She stood toe-to-toe with Drew each step of the way. He didn't seduce her against her will, she chose him. And that, to me, is the sexiest part of their relationship. The entire story had me hooked, and wow, was that climax (literal and figurative) EPIC.<br /><br />Just like the characters themselves, Tangled was Sexy, Intelligent, Charming, and Witty. I cannot wait for more of Drew and Kate, and author Emma Chase.tly, they're not as oblivious about some things as we'd thought.<br /><br />*Men love your body and they want you to love it too.

It was an absolute joy to watch this man fall in love. Kate was amazing, too. She was also intelligent, but also sexy, strong, willful. She stood toe-to-toe with Drew each step of the way. He didn't seduce her against her will, she chose him. And that, to me, is the sexiest part of their relationship. The entire story had me hooked, and wow, was that climax (literal and figurative) EPIC.<br /><br />Just like the characters themselves, Tangled was Sexy, Intelligent, Charming, and Witty. I cannot wait for more of Drew and Kate, and author Emma Chase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awsome! But I have a few sugetions one of them is do the map as Hawaii and make the collection iteam a Hawaii hat! Also u could make a new hoverboard! It could be desighned like Hawaii! Please do this sugestion! Ill be your biggest fan even know I probably already am but please do!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Great movie for all ages.  Love the story and the animation.  The family has watched this movie several times and we still find it just as entertaining as the first time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Lots of fun, very good well thought out game. I continue to enjoy playing it, not necessary to make in app purchases to expand and enjoy.
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|High noon without Gary Cooper... not much else to say. If you like movies where the characters couldn't hit the broad side of the barn with a howitzer at the beginning but suddenly at the end when the bad guy shows up could hit a fly resting on a horses... (um... well you know where) from a mile away with one shot then this movie is for you... and how come when someone is firing a machine gun at a crowd of bad guys and is mowing them down left and right the lead bad &#34;dude&#34; never ever gets hit..?<br /><br />&#34;Last Stand&#34; is a nice title and in this case I hope it's naming is prophetic...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the graphics, but the game needs a change of scenery or different levels.  Maybe it can go from day to night.
B00CL6GAD2|2.0|In my opinion this was a waste of good actors, money, and my valuable time (not necessarily in that order). I gave it an extra star because any 1 star movie I don't fall asleep 1/2 way through gets the extra star for effort... this one was close... but dozing off doesn't count... ;)
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I like the seasons.  I like that you can try more than one level at a time so if you get stuck you can try another level.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|For me, and I'm not a &#34;techie&#34;, I have difficulty navigating between the different categories, such as from who is in which category, and the finding someone specific to link to, after trying to respond to a request. But that's me.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|great movie, wonderful performances, my only gripe is that the DVD I purchased from Amazon is poor quality; the disk keeps stalling/stopping.  I missed the date by which I could return the faulty disk, my fault for not opening and playing it as soon as it was received.  So in a word - disappointed.
B0086700CM|4.0|It has taken a little time to get the feel of this game, but the more I play it, the better I get at it. I have enjoyed the challenge of the game and I will continue to partake in playing it. Thank you for making this game enjoyable as well as challenging.
B005VPXR3Q|5.0|i loved the book and the movie! great plot wonderful actors and very very creepy. this is definitely one of my steven king favorites.
B000RLKXEK|5.0|We enjoy relaxing to this one, and have watched it several times for the unique and charming characters. Smart and well written.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Wow Lady Antebellum just keeps coming up with great songs. This is my third Lady Antebellum album and all have been winners.  I look forward to the next album.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Every chapter leaves you in suspense! You will not be able to put the book down it is truly brilliant.
B00CRW2066|5.0|one of those rare albums that just gets better and better the more you listen to it.  if you love the national you ll love it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I downloaded this book several months ago on a whim, and it sat in my library unread until I was on a weekend trip to Lake Tahoe and found myself without wifi and needing something to read on my iPad.<br />What an awesome book! A novel plot, plenty of cool science to geek out with, and an exciting finish. Well Done Mr. Weir!
B00C061I3K|1.0|I always thought Daft Punk was overrated, but I respected them for their sense-of-groove and sampling expertise.  \\"Get Lucky\\" was problematic so I was worried about the album.  The lyrics to \\"Get Lucky\\" are atrocious, and certainly a far cry from Chic, and if they were unaware of the artist I believe many would think it was a parody song.<br /><br />It's bizarrre that they have taken my idols from pop music of the 70's and made them sound bad.  I just rewatched \\"Phantom of the Paradise\\" the other day and I renewed my love for Paul Williams.  A great songwriter and singer (and actor) actually.  The lyrics to \\"Touch\\" are so bad it seems to be comic, and Paul's voice is displayed in an unflattering production enviornment that just makes you wish to hear him again singing something good.  Not a fan of \\"Evergreen,\\" but the writing there is classic compared to \\"Touch.\\"  There's even a weird caliope-like fast part towards the end that I think is supposed to evoke the \\"Goodbye\\" song from Phantom?  Where is that disc...<br /><br />My \\"buy decision\\" came down to Giorgio Moroder.  I was severely let down after the Nile Rogers buzz/anticipation turned out to be \\"Get Lucky,\\" a tune that not only makes a real Nile Rogers sound like a sample, but also makes you wonder how Pharell materialized here - and why they manage to strip him of any soulfulness or charm.  But Giorgio Moroder - if he was involved I would have to make the purchase - I remember hearing \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and thinking I had never heard anything that sounded like it before.  The Donna Summer albums were masterpieces.  He invented digital music!  Daft Punk pays homage by including Giorgio's spoken word, but it is so awkward that again, homage almost turns into parody.  And does Giorgio provide any musical support - their lame kind-of \\"Chase\\" chord progressions fail to satisfy.<br /><br />So I got the CD, low expectations based on the single, and it is a lot of tracks, many in the 4-5 minute zone, that are lyrically challenged, dull and forgettable.  I am actually a little p*ssed - don't drag my 70's icons and sounds into your personality-less sonic world just to claim them as your own.  When you invite talent like that, you had better enhance or elevate it.  This and Justin Timberlake's album are the marketing (vs. talent) coups of the decade.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show completely engrosses you.  From the pageantry to the characters, setting to story, it demands your endearment.  I will watch every episode until the dark day it completes its run, whenever that may be.  PBS should be proud to air it. It truly is a masterpiece.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|First, let me say the book is well written. My short review here is not to criticize the author's writing ability. I was turned off by the book the second I read she received a book advance of 200K plus. Which, in my opinion, was the true motivating factor to go off and \\"find herself\\".
B00CKQ1092|5.0|DEP's &#34;One of Us Is the Killer&#34; is a great album from start to finish. Every track has something else to offer and the band is as hard hitting as ever. The album is similar to the style of Option Paralysis but taken to the next level. Greg's vocals keep improving with each Dillinger album and with this album you'll be amazed at his range capability. If you enjoyed more recent Dillinger (Miss Machine to Option Paralysis) then don't miss out this album. This will be considered Dillinger's classic album in years to come.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love the entire season. I am a fan-girl I suppose.The sadneess though makes me cry because I love the actors and the characters they play.
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|I tried to listen to this album several times and I thought that it might eventually grow on me but it just hasn't. I wouldn't consider the album to be horrible but it doesn't offer anything new or different for the band. I was expecting a new direction and sound from the band especially from the reviews it was getting.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Cute game in the line of all the Angry Birds, but you need to link it to your Facebook account to play - that's why it's called &#34;Friends&#34;.  If you aren't on Facebook, there goes that idea.
B001F12J0C|1.0|I could not hear the dialog because the director talked all the way through both 2nd & 3rd DVD!  Waste of money.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a fun game to help pass the time.  You all know the drill, and the only thing that is annoying is the ads every few minutes.  You can get the same app without the ads, but its not free.  Clever, eh?
0525952926|5.0|Follett is an amazing writer.  Can hardly wait for the last book in this trilogy!  Have been reading his books for decades.  He never disappoints.
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|Great gift set! Anyone would love to get this cool gift set. Even the box is cool! As a movie buff and collector I love the little gifts that accompany this awesome film. Great bargain for $$!
B005OZE9SA|3.0|the product is generally okay and works as intended though it does pick up a bit of electrical noise that I have noticed through the monitor. It seems if adjusted that it does not end up on the recording or Skype but is quite annoying listening through the monitor having this noise and trying to adjust for it.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|I like the old Hotmail better. I don't like outlook. I have trouble finding things. It is hard to use. Bring back my old Hotmail!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This APP for Kindle Fire acts and feels just like the facebook page on my desktop!  Great for keeping up on the go!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a great app. waited a long time for it to come out on the kindle fire. so glad its finally here
B0095G5AFU|4.0|This app is great for helping me keep up with my things to do list.  There's even a feature where it will read aloud what you have written.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Have not seen the movie. Glad I waited. This book was refreshing and eye opening to the human condition. I saw an excerpt for this book on a kindle ad. It sucked me in and I loved every minute. Thank you Matthew!
B008R6MI8G|5.0|Liam Neeson is such a great actor and he puts it to work in this movie. It is true so it is even better. If you like drama-watch this movie, you will like it.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Good acting  by Day Lewis. Nice angle of the Presidency and history at that time. Well produced. A good watch.
B008133MDK|5.0|Great story lines. Good acting. Interesting modernization of an old character. Thoroughly enjoyed both seasons and looking forward to 3rd.
B00BF123WG|5.0|While we do not know the full true story I think this gives a fair idea of what happened. Nice.
0880794968|5.0|I really like this Universal Waite Tarot Deck! The artwork is very colorful.  I do have the Original Rider Waite Deck and the colors are much more dual.  I also have The Mystic Dreamer Tarot too; I love that deck. The backs of these Tarot cards have a dark blue with lots of pretty gold stars. The only thing I don't like is the wording at the bottom of the cards - on some of the cards is not centered???? Seemed a little strange to me. But I think this is a great deck to add to my collection and to learn with! I recommend this Tarot deck (Universal Waite Tarot Deck).
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|no story line really. A bomb for two of my favorite stars. I really found it hard to stay interested.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|The movie is excellent in all respects. I thinkthat Mr. Affleck should have been entered as a movie dirctor for the Oscar's.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|At least by being a Prime member, I didn't have to pay for it.  The movie just uses Fox News type stereotypes against Arabs, so I can see why some may like it for the stereotypes.  But then again most of them are not witty or funny.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Beautiful cinematography littered with pained performances from Hanks and Berry.  Philosophically disjointed and purports a series of new age spiritualist beliefs which are interesting to consider but have little coherence.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This story gave me chills! It is full of unexpected twists and turns that kept me reading. I never expected this to be such a dark thriller. This intense read was a mystery so I do not want to give it all away but just let me say so much more is going on than you think.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Must see couldn't stop watching it can't wait till season three comes out will be purchasing it on amazon even if I watch it on Abc
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I was given an ARC in exchange for a fair review and I am beyond pleased. I love action and this book transported me right into the middle of it! If you like an amazing James Bond like hero, you will love Ian Fleming. I enjoyed the historical detail and description in this spy novel. This fast paced book had a little something for everyone and I would definitely watch it on the big screen!
B00B9ZBZ2C|2.0|Of the dozen odd books I have read this year, I found this to be the most contrived, flawed and boring.<br /><br />This came in as a recommendation from a friend. I find the writer's writing style pretty good but the whole story was quite exasperating. It is really far fetched and even if I were to believe everything the author is trying to feed us, I don't think the book deserves any words of appraisal.<br /><br />I read this and thought ok, Im glad that is over.<br /><br />On to a better next book, definitely one which is not about children being murdered in Russia with detective agencies and communism running wild.<br /><br />Before reading this book, I read a clockwork orange and friends, this was quite the debby downer. Warn!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the best of iron man can get<br />It is just like timpal run it is a good ap for kindle
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book deserves more than five stars. It deserves a million. More than a million actually. It deserves a trillion or googooplex haha that's not even a number. The fault in our stars is the perfect mix between comedy, romance, and sadness. It's too perfect. I laughed and cried and now I'm very upset that the ending was so amazingly perfectly sad it was just... Extraordinary
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A nice ending to a story about how violence thru anarchy affects people in the aftermath.  The first book sparked my interest and when I finished the 2nd, the 3rd, &#34;Mockingjay&#34; was a must!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best online bingo I have found so far!  Super addicting. Sucks the time right out of my day because I get so caught up in it I don't even realize how long I've. Been playing. It.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Making movies of comic book storylines can be entertaining and exciting.  When there is supposed to be historical basis to the story, however incidental, some nexus and grounding in the facts is required.  Nothing of the kind exists in Django.  This is an exercise in self-indulgence and a waste of time.  Not even as a comic book can this effort find a niche that should appreciate what it offers.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Long wait for this one, but well worth it. No stinkers on this one. Beginning to end, full of toe tappers. Highlights are Unbelievers and Hannah Hunt.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This is a deceptive movie that delivered a lot more than I expected. It is only superficially about sushi and delves powerfully with what leads to fulfillment in life in Japan, and possibly beyond. Very well done and impactful. Plus, I found out I have never eaten real sushi :(
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Sean Penn is amazing on how well he can play a character.  He has come a long way since Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Very talented!!!! This looked to be a scary time in our past.  Great scenery!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I love this series - you simply cannot go wrong with Dexter. I hope it goes on forever! Hoorah for Dexter!
B00CFITJKW|2.0|This game would be cool if the controls were easier to use. Please make the controls use the gyroscope. Wasted $4.99
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I kept reading this book waiting for it to get better.  The ending is SO terrible (although it may be the only smart choice the main character makes in the whole book!) Sure there were some steamy parts but other than that, the author just tries to justify and even glorify abusive relationships. This book is a weird Twighlight spinoff or something.  Wish I could get my money back :(
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This was bad on so many levels, I can't even begin to list them. I still can't believe that this was actually accepted for publication. It was trite and cliched, with cutout, cardboard characters and an embarrassingly formulaic plot. I actually squirmed while reading it, and was so embarrassed that I forked out the cash to buy it.
B005R32L66|4.0|I use it often and it's very useful. I would recommend it for anyone who has to do business calls also
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had wonderful experience reading this book. I am happy to be living in a world such a book can make NYT #1 best seller.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Too much flipping back and forth between stories and timelines.  Confusing. It's Frustrating in waiting for things to pick up and story to develop, and it never happens.  Little of no character development.  It's like a 3 hour First Act.  You never get to see the Second or Third Act.  I want 3 hours of my life back.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you liked the first two, the final book won't disappoint. No earth shaking surprises but still an enjoyable read.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This is a must read and should be required reading for all high school graduates. The world would be a better place subsequently...
B005SFR7YE|5.0|All elements of the story are beautifully presented.  Just great!<br />Every week or so I miss the music and watch and listen again.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It was a bit too long and drawn out in certain points. I read this book in several chunks of time, because it didn't engage me enough in certain plot sections to read all at once. It's a great concept, and I do recommend it, just beware that it will get slow at points but you should forge ahead!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My daughter watched this movie many times in a very short span of time!  We will rent it again soon.
B0063M22QO|5.0|segments are quickly solvedbpiquing your interest to.move on to the next one. When traveling I will stay occupied with my Kindle.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Gillian Flynn's writing is brilliant and keeps you guessing what will happen next.  Once you think you've figured it out she throws a curveball
0061733199|3.0|Dry and hard to follow.  I have read much better books on survival.  I could write a better one.  It does have a variety of good information if you take the time to root it out.<br /><br />I'd rather go with some of the old classics.  This is a less than perfect re-write of them!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love the game. once u start u cant stop playing it.  its great and simple &bull;  love the different cars but I have to say the Backgrounds could be better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best free app available for the Bible! It is essential for any Christian serious about the Bible.
B0061S073A|2.0|I wanted this due to having to have my amazon account linked with the kindle and thought it would solve the problem of my 5 yo not being able to purchase things accidentally or without my knowledge, but when kindle is turned on it has to be signed into Kids Place not the other way around which I thought it would be where I would have to sign out of kids place. In order to look at anything on the web, especially youtube he is not in Kids place therefore I'm not protected against the purchase problem. I have not explored this extensively, but this is my experience thus far, don't know if I am missing something, some sort of setting that I'm not utilizing, but as it is, it is not helpful in my opinion
B00280LYIC|4.0|I was reading this book at school for a report and the whole story just pulled me in. This book is really good and I would recommend it to anybody who was into Greek Mythology. I love how the author described the monsters and how he connected his story to Greek stories.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This ap is one of my favorites. You can download YouTube music to your tablet for free....how cool is that!!???
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Super fun. Love playing it. Upgrading is the best part. They should add more levels though. Still good regardless of how many levels there are.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Everyone will enjoy this ap. Connect to the weather channel.com for your weather updates every day! A must have ap!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!! I don't care about the price! IT IS ADDICTING!  This is all I have to say. Ps to the haters: ITS CALLED WAITING FOR UPDATES AND TRYING IT OUT,DUMMIES!
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|This is a great movie and my kids love it!  It was a last minute purchase for my son's birthday and was a hit!  Enjoy!
B003SHUMRI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever! I saw it in June 2012 and loved it ever since! If you're looking for fun music and cool dancing this is the movie for you
B009K0P10K|4.0|After watching Season One, I had to buy Season Two, thank you Amazon. I loved the first Season, but the second was not as good. I felt they were all over the place in the second season. Regardless, I am still in it, and very excited to watch Season Three. Loved Emily VanCamp in Brother's & Sister's, and she is fantastic as Emily Thorne in Revenge.<br /><br />The cast of characters is great, and I especially love the relationship between Noland and Emily. We would all be blessed to have a friend like him.  This show series is definitely worth your time investment!
072325804X|5.0|beautiful treasure
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie made my husband laughed really hard, which is very unusual, since he is very picky about movie. Even though it showed some very vulgar languages in it, but hey, what do you expect? It is a movie filmed for the grown-ups. I do not see those vulgarity that inappropriate, since the reality has already been much dirtier. This movie also brought us to our childhood memories, which is very sweet and touching, it allowed us to wonder and cry, and taught us even though the reality is vulgar and dirty, at least, every one still held a pure unadulterated dream that made all our miserable life happier and more meaningful.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|While I am a business owner myself, this book pointed out so many things I have seen and many others I didn't realize. We need to encourage women to stand up, lean in and to make the decisions that will bring them the most fulfillment.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|A familiar story from an old-time comic book series. A &#34;super&#34; hero, but without any &#34;super&#34; powers -- just a well-trained and very buff regular human with a need to do things that require heroic action.<br /><br />The first season's story arc ended quite nicely, with the baddest bad guy being defeated, with the misunderstood hero gaining cred, and enough unresolved stuff to provide for next season's story arcs. I look forward to September.
