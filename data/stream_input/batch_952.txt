B001AVCFK6|5.0|with when of genuine box dvd or blu ray with hundreds of hours or others of no-claims bonus for our films and Star Trek series. An unquestionable pleasure despite everything to be able to buy these new dvd. To create to us a new series with our héos and their life...    That of pleasure of having a box not existing in France. U.S.A a pleasure for so much of inaccessible things for the rest of the world!!!
B002UXRH10|3.0|Not as much fun music or dancable tunes to this one....thanks Chris Brown for sending Rhianna into this pessimistic mode
B001RIY4WE|1.0|Just as with many others, I was unable to get this disk to work using my player.  My computer IS (obviously) connected to the net, but it still would not play this disk.  It detects me as \\"Out of Range\\" in Canada, and when I hit \\"Continue\\", it crashes my player software.  Avoid at all costs.
1401308201|5.0|I loved this book!  They sell this book at the gift shop at the musical and you'll pay $50 for it!   It was really interesting how they came up with the idea for the musical and they tell everything in this book.   If you are really into the musical, Wicked, you will enjoy this book.  I bought it over a year ago and I still love looking thru it.
0307346617|2.0|To put it simply, this is boring in comparison to the Zombie Survival Guide. the ZSG was at least funny as hell. World War Z is boring. It should be called World War zzzzzzzzzzz. It's actually quite easy to put down. I hope Max writes a more interesting or funny book next time.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who loves the classic films. Together we must have seen this film before at least a dozen times. I wasn't expecting a lot of difference between the DVD version and the blu-ray version but I was wrong. The colors and details of the imagery just pop out at you! Blu-ray is the perfect showcase for this classic!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle may not quite equal Kate Smith, but she reminds us of her. It sounds as if her voice comes from her very depths, yet it sounds so free. She's someone we hope to hear again and again.
B001T3RA8M|4.0|How have i never heard of Garth Nix before?<br /><br />How have you never heard of Garth Nix before?  (My wife says she's heard of Garth Nix before...)<br /><br />If you can, don't walk, but run to your Amazon accoutn and buy this book today.  You won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Sabriel is the heir to her father's legacy, the person with the singular task of keeping the Dead sealed in Death.  She grows up on the border between a world very much like our own and the Old Kingdom, a place where the rules of nature bend and change to the magic of the Charter.  On her quest to find, and restore, her father, she will find love, face evil, and walk the paths of the Dead.<br /><br />Nix keeps the plot moving, and barely a page is wasted.  Pick up this book on an empty Saturday, clear your schedule, and sit back for an enjoyable read.
0385504225|4.0|As many others have pointed out, Dan Brown is not the most refined of writers. The \\"Robert Langdon series\\" is remarkably formulaic. There are slight variations, but essentially each begsin with Robert dreaming, waking... being contacted (or already having been contacted) by some entity. An old man is always in trouble, usually he dies. A woman related to the old man is always involved, and always ends up being a romantic interest to Langdon. If Langdon is being held by authorities, a deus ex machina usually comes to his rescue. While you may not always know exactly what's going to happen in terms of the story, you usually have a vague idea.    However Brown compensates for his lack of polish and finesse with mounds of cultural and historical references which should lead you to other more absorbing works. This addition to the Langdon series is no disappointment for those who are willing to look past the formula and delve into the theories of lost arts and informations. Especially in the DaVinci Code and the Lost Symbol, much of the subject matter is unknown to the general public, making these rather interesting topics known to us that we might seek further knowledge of them. THAT precisely makes his works effective and worth reading.    1) Easy, light entertainment reading  2) Exposes you to the surface of significantly more heavy material    That is the virtue of Dan Brown's writing. I highly recommend this book (as well as the DaVinci Code) to anyone who is not so full of himself that he considers these novels below him.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|Great movie! Plays perfect! Super funny! The digital copy is an awesome way to carry the movie with you and keep the younger kids occupied on longer car trips if you dont have a portable dvd player.  I only wish Disney would do this for all their movies! I never buy BluRay as I dont have a player so its hard to find a DVD copy with the digital copy anymore! I am very satisfied, this was a great find and an excellent purchase!   A great addition to any family movie collection.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I first saw this movie in an IMax theatre and it was incredible. You can get nearly the same feeling from viewing it on blu-ray disc. Eventhough the movie is titled \\"Batman\\", it could have easily been titled \\"The Joker\\" due to his fabulos character, scenes, and humor. I actually enjoyed The Joker better than Batman in this movie. Too bad the character that played The Joker, Heath Ledger,  died in real life. It would have been great to see a spin-off movie featuring The Joker....
0061150142|5.0|I love this author!!!  I get to a certain point in her books and cannot stop reading!!!
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|You will cry but mostly laugh during this movie (unless you don't). Loved it in the theater and now at home but the case it came in was opened upon arrival so now I just wonder about the quality of the disc (is it bad in some way?). It's probably just an unlucky/weird irregularity that it arrived with the open case and a disc that looks oddly pressed (the bottom of the disc looks like it has a unusual blotch on the disc). It works fine though and hasn't decreased my enjoyment of the film<br /><br />Love Pixar and rank UP as one of their best animated movies.
B000VZGK3K|5.0|The stars just keep popping up in this superbly directed, beautifully shot and extremely well acted bio-pic. It certainly deserved every Academy Award it received and probably several more should have been awarded. Leonardo DiCaprio provides an eerily realistic visual similarity to Howard Hughes no doubt enhanced by his stellar portrayal of the lead character. The list of actors and actresses just keeps growing as the movie progresses and each one of them steps up to the plate and hit more home-runs with their characters too. This movie is a \\"Must See\\" and without a doubt is a welcome \\"Blu-Ray Worthy\\" addition to my home movie collection. Get it, watch it, you'll love it !
B002BIULQ2|5.0|Good movie for the grand-daughter.  I did not particularly care for it as the other Miley Cyrus movies.  Not a good role model for young girls.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This movie was not at all what I expected, but I should have known, as you can never guess what Tarantino is going to do next. Having said that, it was an awesome movie. My wife and I both loved this movie, despite the fact that it is almost entirely subtitled. I usually don't keep interest in subtitled movies because I just don't get it (usually because it's a foreign film, and I'm not foreign, unless I'm in another country) but after a few minutes I stopped even noticing that I was having to read half the movie. The acting is superb and the story is brilliant. Some people accuse Brad Pitt of poor acting, but I would say he is one of the best actors of our generation. \\"But he acted like a caricature in this movie\\" - as if you think he didn't act exactly how Tarantino wanted him to act. His character in this movie was Brilliant, and defintely stole the show even though he wasn't in a lot of the movie. Even the scenes where you just hear his voice are exceptional. It was both hilarious and serious all at the same time, which made me laugh even harder. His Italian accent was probably the funniest part of the whole movie. You add this to Seven, Fight Club, Snatch, Interview With a Vampire, Benjamin Button, Kalifornia, True Romance and the rest of his movies and this simply solidifies Brad Pitt as one of the finest actors of our time. You add this to the list of Tarantino's movies and realize that he was Solidified as the Greatest director of our time a while ago, this just keeps it going. Great movie, great actors, great story. This may be the \\"Feel Good\\" movie of the year! I'm pretty sure this is also the most historically accurate depiction of Nazi Germany ever. Especially the ending, cause that's exactly what happened in real life. Anybody that disagrees is a moron.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Love this video.  Great spin on a great story.  It was delivered quickly as well.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I do 99% of  the shopping from Amazon for my family. We have enjoyed Christmas Vacation on DVD for years. This movie has become a regular tradition to watch at least once every Christmas season and sometimes twice. You'll laugh yourself silly. We just got it on Blu-Ray. The  picture quality is outstanding! If you haven't seen this movie, then it's a must see for anyone with a sense of humor.  Signed, Significant Other
B00284BMBM|5.0|Idol runner up Daughtry as the rest of his band return for a second round with Leave this Town, a pretty neat rock album with a very mainstream sound. Daughtry's sound is sort off compared to Nickelback and the like, and while that makes sense they don't seem like imitators either.<br /><br />This second album still sounds very Daughtry, much like their first one. It does show slight improvements as far as lyrics and arrangements, but mostly the same spirit is still there. Which, honestly, is not a bad thing cuz they were pretty good before anyway.<br /><br />So as I usually say, if you liked them before, you'll like this and if you didn't then this won't change your mind.<br /><br />To tell you the truth the thing that annoys me the most about the album is not the music itself, but the generic looking album art. The font that spells the band's name is called Bleeding Cowboys and can be downloaded for free on the internet... I mean seriously...
B000KGGB2A|4.0|this is one cd that did not seem to make it over here at all. i saw one of the video's Shine and that song was great it was a great work.   i could not get this song Shine any other way then gettting the whole cd and once i got it i was shocked to hear there voices it was really good.
B002VH7P4O|3.0|First off: the sound is great, the Apple isn't some flimsy plastic thing, but a rather solid, heavy casting.    However, if you're interested in using this product with iTunes and desire to have album art and documentary videos in a standard compliant file format rather than in some proprietary Flash crap, you only get to enjoy it after jumping through a lot of hoops.  I spent in all about 2 full days to:  a) convert FLAC to Apple Lossless, such that the full-resolution is available in iTunes  b) convert Apple Lossless to highest-quality VBR MP3, such as to have reasonably small, yet great sounding MP3s to load on the iPod  c) dissect the Flash files to extract the JPEG images and reconstruct PDF liner notes for each album, and despite the effort, the PDF files still can't be indexed and searched, so maybe if I had some more sophisticated OCR software, I could run a second pass over these files to turn them into \\"searchable image PDF\\" files, but the OCR software that's part of Acrobat Professional couldn't hack it.  d) replace the abysmally low-res album cover art embedded in the pre-encoded files with high-res album covers ripped from the Flash files  e) convert the Flash videos into H.264 videos that can be views from within iTunes.  f) fix spelling and missing track meta data in various places, e.g. the ridiculous 2009 date for the music (if you're looking for 60s music, you don't care when the music was remastered, but when it was written and performed), the remaster date belongs into a comment field, etc.    To this moment I haven't figured out how to remove the write protection on the USB stick, which was advertised as having \\"extra capacity for other tracks\\". I wanted to use that extra capacity to save a backup of my PDF liner notes and Apple Lossless encoded tracks.    So if you're looking for the ultimate in sound quality for a Beatles release, it's hard to beat the 24-bit FLAC files, unless you have access to the master tapes. On the other hand, given hownice the packaging and how good the sound quality, it's thoroughly disappointing that the most basic tasks, such as meta data tagging, PDF booklets, MP4 videos were simply missing. For that amount of money it stinks if you have to basically create a re-issue of the product on your own time.    It would also be nice if there were instructions somewhere how to disable the write protection on this USB stick, such as to be able to use the extra space, as the press release said would be possible.
6301966562|4.0|I had seen the movie several times but lost my other copy. My wife liked the ending song but never had seen it. I enjoy the music the best. The computer story is dated and the phone modem a real throw back but the story is a feel good one with great songs even if Edgar has to bit the big one.<br /><br />I think someone should press it in DVD but they do not so tape is the only option. The quality was good on my old rental. I forgot about the old Be Kind Rewind part.<br /><br />This is a comedy love story. Really a love triangle but for me the music is the best part.
B002OHDRF2|5.0|Ordered this for my husband for Christmas - he was very excited!  Exactly what I ordered and I received it very quickly!
B002AT4K9Q|3.0|If you love cars and car movies, you'll love this movie. Do not watch this movie for plot or the great acting, it is not a classic :) but for pure entertainment, lot's of action, and great fast cars: then you found the right movie.     This is the second best movie in the Fast & Furious series with the first one being the best of the series.
B001HVZO9S|5.0|If you haven't seen Drumline, you don't know what you're missing. This movie will be a classic that you can't forget after watching it.   The sound clarity and hi-def images makes it worth adding to your blu-ray collection.  Want to know more about the story of this movie, find the imdb website and see all that you need there.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Lately, Hollywood has seen science fiction films as a way to show off: look at what we can do, look at how creative and imaginative we are.  DISTRICT 9, thankfully, follows in the tradition of what science fiction set out to be: thoughtful, deep, with resonance in our contemporary culture.<br /><br />The film follows a colony of roughly one million aliens (dubbed \\"prawns\\" due to their crustacean appearance) that have essentially crash-landed on earth.  Unable to go anywhere else, they have been restricted to District 9 in Johannesburg, a run-down shantytown typical of refugee camps.  After 20 years, the inhabitants of Johannesburg have become fed-up with their neighbors.  It is time for the prawns to be relocated.  However, in the midst of handing out eviction notices, Wikus Van De Merwe (an outstanding, Oscar-deserving Sharlto Copley) becomes infected with a prawn concoction, a substance that is slowly altering his DNA.  Wikus is suddenly forced to side with a people he has subjugated and ridiculed, and must fight to save not only his own humanity, but the existence of an entire species.<br /><br />It's true, DISTRICT 9 becomes bogged down near the end in special effects.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film are phenomenal, showcasing humanity's interaction with what we don't understand.  The effects alone are worth the price of admission; the effects are outstanding, with the aliens interacting flawlessly with the humans around them.  Yet it's the story, the emotional power behind it, that will help DISTRICT 9 stand the test of time.  This will go down as a science fiction classic, another in a long tradition of sci-fi films that dig deep beneath the human skin, that aim to shine a spotlight on our human foibles.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This series is great. I am currently 15 years old, and I've been reading these since I was 10. I am a girl. It is honestly overall a great read. I have had friends who enjoyed it and I don't really agree thta thi series is best for boys. Snicket is a witty, quick and definitly interesting writer. I have read a large amount of books in my days and haven't found anything like these books.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The PS3 Dualshock 3 wireless controller I purchased is just like the one that came with the system.  Excellent.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We originally received this game as a Christmas gift a few years ago...we cannot explain how it has gone \\"missing\\" however in the past several months and when we saw that Amazon had it as one of their \\"hourly deals\\", we scooped it right up!    It is a nice game that just doesn't take too long - it might take a good 20 to 30 minutes to play one round, yet you do not feel completely 'tied down' to it.   I love the challenge of this game, it is a great game for more 'visual' people -  It is great for learning about spatial, and visual concepts for younger kids.   It is easy to transport, is a great \\"learning' game without feeling like you are \\"learning'...just a fun game!    :)
1401323820|4.0|If you like the show \\"Castle\\" you will enjoy this book. It lets you into the mind of the character \\"Richard Castle\\" in a way the show cannot portray.  The mystery is very well played out, and you will be pleasantly surprised by then ending.  I probably would read it again, to catch the little details I may have missed the first time around.
B002U9JEVA|2.0|I listened to the sample tracts of \\"The Fall\\" so I could decide if I wanted to buy this album. As I was listening, I was trying to determine why I had enjoyed her music in the past. I went to one of her previous albums to remind myself; the reason I loved her music before was the smooth, silky feel of it. This is rough like wool. She's still a great singer; I just don't like this style. I will skip purchasing this one and stick to the Norah I loved.
B001DEXDNI|4.0|Just got into Annie Lenox, and this album is really full of her hits. I enjoy singing along. Also recently a friend of mine passed away...the song Why has special value to me.
B001NESPHC|5.0|After hearing a song by Melody Gardot on KCRW I ordered the CD for myself, mainly due to the reviews she received on Amazon. A day after it arrived and I had had a chance to listen to it, I was so excited about \\"my new find\\" that I ordered 3 more as gifts. All I can say is AMAZING!!! I cannot believe that this singer/songwriter is only in her early 20's! I'm not doubting her, it's just that I think she is perhaps an \\"old soul\\". The melancholic sounds and lyrics on this CD suggest that she is well familiar with all aspects of love and life. I really believe that she does have her own stories to tell and life experiences to share; that she is not some kid, playing \\"dress-up\\".    I love it that Ms. Gardot wrote all but 1 of the songs herself, and in addition to her gorgeous vocals also plays the piano and the guitar. Her voice - pure, moody, sensual - is absolutely spectacular. There isn't even one song on the CD that I like less than the others. Her jazzy, Bossa Nova-esque version of Over the Rainbow is the best I've ever heard of that old song. I've been listening to My One and Only Thrill for 3 weeks now - as a background at dinner parties, or just relaxing on a chilly winter night with a glass of Syrah - and I admit it - I've grown addicted to this CD.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I bought this for my family of Trekkies and we have enjoyed it more than once.  If you love Star Trek and haven't purchased this movie yet - please do so.  This is one you will want to watch over and over again.  The graphics are incredible and the surround sound is to die for.  Awesome movie.  Awesome price PLUS Free shipping from Amazon when purchasing over $25!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|My 7-year-old daughter loves all the Disney princess movies and had been asking for Snow White for quite awhile.  You should have seen the expression of joy when she opened this gift on Christmas.  She's watched the movie several times already and has played with some of the special features.  If you have a \\"little princess\\" this is a MUST ADD for her collection.
B002N1AF7W|5.0|\\"The Man Machine\\" was my first exposure to Kraftwerk back in the late 70's, and in the remaster, the work sounds that much better. Nice to see it raised on such a pedestal. Although I have the original vinyl, I haven't compared the two side-by-side, but the remaster is powerful, clear and clean, which does the music great justice. There is so much clean detail - like the subtle breathiness of the single-word vocal in \\"Spacelab\\", or the clean staccato beat at the start of \\"The Man Machine\\", and the detail of the sounds in it.    Not having the direct comparison of new to old, I'll stick to the tracks, which are especially informative when comparing to Kraftwerk's \\"Computer World\\" (1981) - very different compilations. \\"The Man Machine\\" is like a \\"working man's\\" (actually, \\"working robots\\") compilation compared to \\"Computer World\\". If you liked the latter, you'll like this even better if you like simplicity. \\"The Man Machine\\" is analogous to the imaginative liner notes (actually photos), which show the four Kraftwerk mannequins going off to a day of work (arriving promptly at 7:59 to their recording studio). It's practical and hard-hitting in most spots, interleaved with the \\"experiences\\" of the day. Brilliant - and so much different than the also brilliant \\"Computer World\\". You will not find anything like \\"Numbers\\" or \\"It's More Fun to Compute\\" (from the latter CD) here. In comparison, \\"The Man Machine\\" world is quaint and familiar, rather than being edgy.    Track 1 (The Robots) \\"We are programmed just to do, anything you want us to\\". The PERFECT intro to this compilation. The track just brilliantly gives the feeling of marching forward, somewhat in a plodding but well-defined way that you might imagine a robot would do. A lot of vocoder here, and the remaster picks up all the very fine subtlety - the breathiness and echo. Just great.    Track 2 (Spacelab) Starts with the sound of a door closing. Perhaps the door to the studio? Now, the robots go to work - making sounds quite unlike the first track! This track is far more fluid and spacious. The melody is mostly uplifting, but with a few melancholy lines -  both feelings are carried in a smooth melody which overlays a very staccato beat.    Track 3: (Metropolis) The start sounds like the power is coming up, over the sound of a \\"beating heart\\" of the city, which smoothly transitions to another smooth melody - something you might attribute to smooth movement. Feels like you're watching the goings-on of a Fritz Lang style art-deco city through the eyes of \\"the robots\\".    Track 4: (The Model)  The robots hit the night club. Another smooth, charming melody - sounds like the Kraftwerk \\"robot\\" equivalent to Robert Palmer's \\"Simply Irresistible\\".    Track 5: (Neon Lights) Nostalgic. The start is so simple, and a bit melancholy. Day passes into night in the robot world, but here (as in \\"the Model\\") we have human vocals. The musical lines are so simple, even though they layer as the song proceeds. The synth  That comes in at 2:00 in the song mimics the lyric - \\"shimmering neon lights\\". The slow tempo, crossed with the smooth melody and staccato beat gives a peaceful feeling in this seemingly \\"cold\\" robot world.    Track 6: (The Man Machine) Just in case you were forgetting where you were from hearing the last two tracks, we're now back to the working, robot world. Seems like the complement to track 1 in many ways - simple clean musical lines, with \\"sound effects\\" in many spots that are used as musical lines, overlayed in the usual brilliant Kraftwerk way.    To conclude - I can't help to re-iterate the vast difference between this compilation, and \\"Computer World\\". I'm leaning toward the latter as the \\"better\\" compilation, but both are beyond 5 stars, so it doesn't matter - if you are into Electronica, you must have both.
B002RKXO5E|5.0|I would have loved to have attended one of the UK concerts on this tour, but living in Canada, was unable to do so. Watching the BluRay was the next best thing and it was amazing. The Abbey Road sessions were also wonderful and an added bonus. I would highly recommend this to any Take That fan.
B001GCUNW6|1.0|Well, if you buy it I hope you'll have better luck.. the feature presentation had a audio mastering problem that I thought was going to blow out my speakers.. and just about my ears. The problem was when I requested a replacement it had the exact same problem... Here's the rub. I asked for help from customer service as I really wanted this movie and received zero responce. Amazon always takes care of the monetary end of the problem but never seems to go the extra mile when needed.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|this is clint eastwoods final movie and it is a very good movie.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Not only is this arguably the best Bowie album, it's one of rock's greatest albums, period. The title track kicks things off with an epic 10 minute ride through what essentially is three songs melted seamlessly end to end. Now your price of entry is covered, you get hit with \\"Golden Years,\\" \\"Stay,\\" and \\"TVC 15\\". It's amazing to me that all these Bowie classics are right here on the same disc. Don't miss this one.
B000050HTO|5.0|this two cd collection is a great overview of Dylan's work. It begins way back with classics like Blowin' in the Wind,and moves into the later years with Lay, Lady, Lay. Any Dylan fan would like this especially to remember his voice (?) as it was and certainly not as it is today. A friend of mine heard him last month and was sorely disappointed. Well, a voice can't last forever. Perhaps, he thought that the inimitable Dylan sound would last forever, still sounding like gravel.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|this is my mom and i's favorite version of the christmas carol.  i had no problems with the dvd itself, and the movies is just as great as i've always remembered.
B0025KVLUG|5.0|Bought Yellow Sub, Let it Be, and Abbey Road in stereo (only way they come) and the Mono collection. shipped FAST and a definite MUST for Beatle Fans.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|An interesting re-imagining of the key Star Trek characters giving an alternate timeline explanation for the changes made to update the cast for the new generation of moviegoers. Usual bluray extras, nothing spectacular.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Bought Yellow sub, Let it Be, and Abbey road in stereo ( only way they come) and the Mono set. FAST shipping and a must for Beatle fans
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Many other reviews mention the formatting and editing issues. If that's a big deal for you, heed them.    My recommendation is based on 2 factors:    Entertainment  1) For me, this is easily the most entertaining film version of A Christmas Carol. Faithful to Dickens and filled with laughs and heart, it stands up to repeat viewing better than any other version. This includes comparison to 2009's very lackluster, 3D animated version by Disney/Zemekis.    Commentary  2) Brian Henson's commentary is great. Many DVD commentaries (by directors, actors, writers, producers) is spartan and/or self-serving. Brian speaks throughout, giving insight into the writing, directing, acting and (most interestingly) secrets of muppeteering. Very enlightening.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|Bought Yellow Sub, Let it Be, and Abbey road in Stereo ( only way they come ) and the Mono Set. FAST shipping and a MUST for Beatle fans.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|Got to me quick and before the scheduled Time.  Okay movie.  Plot is weak.  Action good.
B00129H7VS|5.0|If you want to know what it was like to fight in WWII, watch this series.  My relatives who fought in the war says it's spot on.  Hard to watch at times but a great series - highly recommend.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is a great twist to the old Star Trek series.  The plot was exciting.  The acting was good.  The space scenes were great.  A must see for everyone who is into sci-fi or an interesting movie.  Only issue I had was the unlikeness that a cadet would become a Captain after one crazy mission.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|what is there to review really? This is a great movie with a cool case. You also get the Digital Copy, so where are the con's? There are none. Got it for less than $20. If you liked the movie, then pick this up. I wish I had known about the one with Batman's bike before asking for this one for Christmas!    Thanks for the great gift Baby ;)
1592332803|5.0|I would have to say that I do like this cook book. I have tried the lemon bars, the brownies, and the chocolate chip cookies from this book. All were easy enough for my children to follow and they tasted just like the egg/dary recipe versions. My girls who are 14, and 11 were able to do the cookies with out any help.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I went to see Avatar the day it was released in 3D and i am glad i made the time to go see it.  There is no doubt that this film will be a milestone in the movie history.  Because of the 3D technology and the visual effects, I never felt so in-tune with a story.  The actors and James Cameron bring us with them to Pandora and that virtual world become so real that when it's over you already miss it and wish you had an Avatar that could stay with them.  The story is captivating and over two hours feels more like one.  I never go back to see a movie again and normally wait for the DVD release, but this time i am pretty sure that i will go back , because I already miss Pandora.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Very excited to have gotten this in 1 day.  I watched it multiple times.  It is a modern classic!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I loved this CD by Susan Boyle. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous and pitch perfect.  Listening to this CD is about listening to fine music. It also displays a range of different types of songs and just takes you away to another place.
0679746323|5.0|I know about Chinese history, but after reading this book, now I know a whole bunch more.    For the life of me I cannot understand some of the negative reviews except those might be Mao supporters who wrote them.    Mao was undoubtabley the most vile person this planet has ever had. He and his cronies murdered over 70 million on their own people \\"in peace time\\".    One of the best books I ever read on the subject.    Great work.

1401224253|4.0|Mark Millar has taken the imagination on a different tour of duty this time, and come up with a winner again.  Can this guy not create?    Red Son and the concept behind it was radical in its thinking, and probably as unique a storyline I have read this year.  All three collected works are published here in strong hardcover fashion adding to the unique industrial style of nostalgic Russian society in the 20th century.    The artwork and style, of which I just touched upon, was refreshing, and unique.  DC has hit upon a nerve, and found a good forumla for major blockbusters (those involving storyline, good artwork, and either Batman or Superman) and making them more about the dilemma, the situation, the world, and not about the character themselves.  Side Stories like Azzarello's Joker was unique in its introspective view of the madman.      Red Son will be re-read and re-read until something about it doesn't sit right, and is eventually tossed in the same pile along with the Killing Joke, and the Dark Knight.  Basically I have read these, and will pick them up again and again and again...

B001KVZ6G6|3.0|Incredible film - especially on Blu-ray! The detail shines it's best on blu. POSSIBLE SPOILER: I don't like that this movie contains about 8 very sad parts - it might be just me. I wanted a fun and upbeat and happy ride - but about 1/5 of the film is just completely sad and depressing. Overall - awesome. Pure visual beauty throughout! Pixar rocks - looking forward to Toy Story 3, Pixar!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I fell into Season Two before seeing Season One and was always lost, not understanding key pieces like the meaning of SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original) or who was Donna?  I am not a T.V. junkie because most of what is on is either for teenagers or poorly written.  From the pilot episode to the end of the first season I was hooked.  This is intelligent, funny, smart, keeps you guessing and is keeps getting more and more complex.  The writing is outstanding.  The acting is real, the characters meld together you fall in love with each one.  I have my entire family hooked on this series. This is the hidden sleeper.  It is like discovering Sex in the City, Weeds or the Soprano's for the first time. You never know what is going to happen in the next episode and FINALLY the writers know how to close the loop, with every character.  They may leave you hanging but it isn't over stupidity; they draw you in.    Don't do as I did by watching the second Season first, you will be lost.  The first Season in key.  It is definitely worth owning; you will want to watch it over and over again while you wait for the next season to start!!  I would highly recommend purchasing this!
B000TEUSJK|5.0|Found it to be an excellent movie.  Seemed pretty real.  Enjoyed the story being told without censorship, yet it was not trash or ponography.    Will watch it more.
0440242576|3.0|Skipping Christmas is one of John Grisham's shorter books at 177 pages. It tells the story of a husband and wife known as Luther and Nora Krank who decide to skip Christmas and go to the Caribbean for ten days to relax in the sun. The decision is made in part because their daughter Blair has signed up to do a year in Peru with the Peace Corp and won't be home during the Christmas holiday. Luther Krank is a tax accountant by profession and considers himself a man who deals aptly with financial figures. Luther has come to see Christmas as an unecessary expense and feels the money he wastes at this time of year could be better put to use solely on him and his wife at a sunny resort, while his neighbors slave away in the snow and ice of another cold winter.<br /><br />Luther cancels all ties to Christmas: no donations, gifts to friends, the annual Christmas party at his house, office party and company dinner, and last but not least putting up his frosty. This latter area of The Frosty causes exceptional irritation on the town organizer, Mr. Fromeyer, who also lives on Hemlock street, two doors away from the Kranks. Each house on both sides of the street gets adorned with Frosty the Snowman attached to their chimney each year. This corporate effort has won local awards in past years, and when Luther Krank refuses to put his frosty up it plummets the neighborhood into a distant finish in the Christmas competition for best street display.<br /><br />All of these things put tremendous pressure on the Kranks to fall in line and obey the status quo set down by Mr. Fromeyer, a man of substancial influence in the community. When the Kranks daughter Blair calls on Christmas Eve and informs her parents she is coming home for Christmas, and bringing her fiance, a doctor she just met, it sets off a chain of events for the Kranks as they are harried in cancelling their junket in the sun for an impromptu Christmas display for their daughter. The whole thing ends in fun as the town pitches in to help them in this herculean effort while Mr. Krank is giving the tickets to the resort away to a neighboring couple who are suffering with the wife having come down with cancer.<br /><br />This is a simple story about the pressures of Christmas and what happens when one family decides to try and break the mold by making alternate plans. John Grisham is an accomplished writer and weaves a good story here. It is neither deep or overly witty, but delivers what Mr. Grisham was trying to do....tell a story.<br /><br />Charles Hamilton Sr, Former Executive Director Northwest Teen Challenge and author of From Darkness To Light and A Step Of Faith.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1432721127 From Darkness To Light]]p them in this herculean effort while Mr. Krank is giving the tickets to the resort away to a neighboring couple who are suffering with the wife having come down with cancer.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|This is a fantastic documentary to open your eyes to what is going on in today's food industry.    There is so much more info available and this documentary only skims the surface.  If you really details you can do a simple internet search and find literally hundreds of sites dedicated to each topic.  Of course there is way too much info to fit into one movie, so again I say this is very well done and is very good for those who think they can trust the government   (the FDA) to watch out for our well being.

B000002KKD|5.0|The B-52's ought to be my favorite band. Their funky, fresh, and unique style of music really attracts a guy like me. This is their debut album, originally released in the summer of 1979. This album, in my opinion, is the most unique and fresh of them all. Their take on New Wave and rock music is very amusing and fun to sing along and dance along to (\\"Rock Lobster\\", \\"Lava\\", \\"There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)\\"), while their unique take on pop rock is very funky and enjoyable (\\"52 Girls\\"). Some of their later albums were less enjoyable for me and became over-commercialized, but \\"The B-52's\\" truly stands out as a significant part of music history. 'Tis a shame their guitarist Ricky Wilson died. His guitar work on these songs were wonderful. Overall, I highly recommend this awesome album!

B002P5XXR0|5.0|I grew up listening to James Horner music -- \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\\" \\"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock,\\" \\"The Rocketeer.\\" They were favorites before I even knew who \\"James Horner\\" was. When James Cameron and James Horner collaborate (as in \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Titanic,\\") it seems to bring out the best in Horner. The Cameron/Horner duo strike well again with \\"Avatar.\\" In fact, I wasn't too hyped about the film, but was interested in the score. After hearing the score, I'm actually more interested in seeing the movie. The Leona Lewis song is a very good one (she's terrific talent) and although I'm not sure I like as much as the song for \\"The Mask of Zorro,\\" it's terrific.    At times, James Horner tends to repeat motifs. He has done this for many years, and the subject is a touchy one which is hotly debated. At certain points on this CD, I am reminded of other Horner works, but this is certainly one of his freshest scores in many years. If you like Horner music, this is a \\"must-have.\\"
B000063DI9|5.0|Even without a clear-cut standout song, Iron Maiden's seventh album stands as the best front-to-back effort of the band's remarkable three-decade career. Judging from the reviews of not only mainstream music critics but other Amazon users, this statement puts me in a clear minority. But at no point -- before or since -- have they been able to replicate this record, the indisputable peak of their progressive years. The longer this album sinks into the band's catalog, the more impressive it looks.    Seventh Son, as has been noted ad nauseum, centers lyrically around a child born with clairvoyant powers, who tries in vain to warn a village of an impending holocaust. As interesting as the lyrical story is, however, the musical depth is what sets Seventh Son apart from the rest of the band's catalog.     Even when speaking of a band who is as serious about album quality as Maiden, it's common to speak in terms of an album's best several tracks when reviewing a release. The musical depth on Seventh Son makes that impossible, as this is the only album in the band's catalog that doesn't have a single weak track. Moonchild and the woefully underrated Only the Good Die Young are perfect, wickedly fast bookends to the album. The ten-minute title track and the atmospheric Infinite Dreams both rank among the band's best songs. The Evil that Men Do (one of Seventh Son's four top-10 singles) showcases frontman Bruce Dickinson's remarkable pipes at their best. Even the slightly lesser known offerings (The Prophecy and The Clairvoyant) are just as notable and are undeniably excellent.    Perhaps the greatest testament to the album's incredible depth is that the song that is arguably its weakest track musically -- Can I Play with Madness -- not only was a chart-topping single in the UK, but remains a live concert staple to this day.     Other albums like \\"Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Piece of Mind\\" might have more standout hits beloved by critics and fans, and certainly, by the time Seventh Son was released, Maiden was well established as one of the world's biggest bands. In fact, many longtime fans disappointed by the band's more direction beginning with 1986's \\"Somewhere in Time\\" likely felt that the band had already peaked.     But in terms of a progressive, thematically unified, musically deep collection of songs, Seventh Son stands at the top of Iron Maiden's impressive body of work. It truly is the definitive album of a band whose phenomenal catalog makes it nearly impossible to choose just one. If you're looking for a primer on one of the most talented, fascinating bands in rock history, this is the perfect place to start.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|Even if you already have the original Relapse CD, it's definitely worth the price to get these seven additional outstanding joints.  MUSIC BOX literally makes me furiously bop my head and pound my fist--- it's off the chain!!!!!    These beats are beyond incredible.  Dre especially really outdid himself on Refill.  \\"Drop the Bomb on em\\" and \\"Hell Breaks Loose\\"-- both of these songs have this retro \\"70s action flick\\" kind of vibe in the back tracks and it sounds awesome.      \\"Taking My Ball\\" and \\"Buffalo Bill\\" are both beyond sick.    Em's flows are as amazing as ever.  This whole record shouts out: SHADY IS BACK!!!!  Ignore the critics and please: cop this CD today.    Eminem is the greatest MC on this planet.

630463949X|5.0|This is an excellent dvd.  I had another one, but it was so good that I gave it to my uncle, who is a grammy winning musician lead guitar player.  I think his style is kind of like Lindsey Buckingham's.  All of the band members are at the peak of their talent as a great artist and they really show it in this dvd.  I think this is their best work so far.  I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, and even bigger Stevie Nick's fan.  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is looking for most of their greatest hits along with a few new songs that sound wonderful.  You will not regret your decision.  I have watched this dvd at least 50 times since I have owned it.  I bought it when it was first released years ago and just recently bought another one.  After giving it to my uncle, I felt like I really had to have another one.  My Fleetwood Mac collection was definitely not complete without it.  I love it and I'm sure you will too!!!

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|After reading the graphic novel twice, watching Watchmen in the theatre, watching the directors-cut DVD, the tales of the Black Freighter DVD & the motion comic and playing the video game, I can honestly say that this Ultimate Cut is spectacular. It feels complete. I was suspicious of the \\"new\\" DVD on offer but after reading the description, I decided to give it a chance. It was most certainly worth it. I enthusiastically reccomend all of the above mentioned Watchmen entertainment and especially the ultimate cut DVD.

B00008S2VG|5.0|the american life era was the second time she decided to go back to her natural roots. some of the songs are also very personal since her Ray Of Light and Like A Prayer albums, however this would be her last album to have a mature theme and lyrics. i must admit that the american life song, although silly at best, does have some catchy beats and it does sound experimental, but it's not her best song so far. i've never seen anyone mixing the acoustic guitar with electronic beats before. the rapping part was funny. after american life, comes hollywood which i think is one of the stronger songs on the album. she also had perform this on the 2003 mtv music awards where she did her infamous liplock with britney and christina. who could ever forget that??? american life couldn't have come at a better time when America was at war. I wouldn't say that American Life matches up to the great albums Ray of Light and Like A Prayer, but it's one of her most cohesive body of work since from the 2000s.<br /><br />TOP 5:<br /><br />1. Nobody Knows Me-very catchy and fun to listen to.<br /><br />2. Die Another Day-i just love this \\"analyze this...analyze this..analyze this..\\". this was from the die another day soundtrack. the video was interesting to watch. definately the best song on the album.<br /><br />3. I'm So Stupid-i love this song. it's like she's poking fun of herself.<br /><br />4. Mother and Father-this song talks about parents and how her mother's death affected her and her father. highlight of the song \\"my father had to go to work, i used to think that he was a jerk\\". it's humorous and sad at the same time.<br /><br />5. Love Profusion-pretty song<br /><br />honorable mention: Easy Ride- Somehow I crack up each time I listen to these mash up beats of the hip hop electronic beats and the violins.

I Loved it,as a matter of fact I looked at it over and over, so you know it have to bee good.
B000MRAAJM|1.0|So after reading these reviews I now know i'm not the only one with some of the problems.  The biggest problem with this BluRay set is the sound quality.  The volume range on my TV goes from 1-100.  I watch tv at around a 20-25.  These disks require 50-60 on the volume scale and I still have trouble understanding this british guy.  I really don't know if it's his voice, the way he emphasizes different syllabels b/c of his accent, or if his voice just isn't loud enough over the background sound... but something about it is very frustrating.  I find my eyes are completely loving the graphics, while my ears are straining to hear his voice and understand the commentary.  I really did like the woman and the US version more.  By reading these reviews you will soon see you are not alone.     The other HUGE downside of this series is you don't get the extra material explaining the filming of the scenes.  30% of this series to me was hearing about these crazy cameramen that went in hot air balloons, sat in -100 degree weather for weeks, sat in huts for months not seeing anything, etc...  It was truly amazing to hear about how they got all this footage.  It was years of work, that this series just decided all that didn't make the cut?  Well, I'm dissapointed.  In my oppinion it really must have come down to $$$$ b/c this was a great part of the series    Also, lets put the whole debate of 1080i vs 1080p to bed.  The difference her would be minimal at best for viewing quality.  The series was shot in 1080i, and could not be produced (even on blu-ray) in 1080p.  The confusion hear was created by a misprint on some of these DVD sets where on the pack it said 1080p.  This was a mistake, and has been corrected on all new packaged copies.  (This explanation comes directly from BBC)  The resolution is still STUNNING, with the shots from space being absolutely fantastic.  If you are new to blu-ray and need a one to show off, I still believe this is the DVD set for you.  The shots arestunning, and truly show the capability of bluray.  (AMAZON: just take the 1080p out of the description, tags on reviews, and in the tag suggestions.  It is misleading and could be considered false advertising to people that make their purchase decission based on this stated fact.)  Consider getting the US version though if you liked the extra footage along with the womans voice and commentating sound quality.  If i had the choice to do it again, I would definitely get the US version even if it's a little more expensive.      There is ONE advantage to this Blu-Ray set, and that is if you are used to watching the US version there is small amounts of extra footage embeded in every episode.  This is bc the BBC version has each episode being longer, and this required more footage.  It definitely doesn't make up for the lack of bonus footage, but is a tiny morsel of something good that came out of the BBC Blu-Ray series.  Happy viewings!
B0029XIWCY|5.0|Time was when Columbia reissued \\"The Quintessential Billie Holiday\\" on CD, in their CBS Jazz Masterpieces series, proudly proclaiming \\"Digitally remastered directly from the original (sic) analogue tapes\\". Despite that claim, sound quality left much to be desired, and is perhaps most politely summed up as muffled.     That ended appropriately with \\"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\\", and was overtaken in 2001 by the reissue of the 10-CD boxed set \\"Lady Day, The Complete Billie Holiday on Columbia\\" which retailed for £100. Not a bad price, unless you stopped to reflect that the dedicated collector would have expended several times that amount already on previous vinyl and digital reissues. The price was geared as much to the LP-sized package as to the contents, but sound quality was vastly improved.     Having stayed my hand then, I am delighted that this magnificent compilation has been repackaged in a CD-sized box and is now available at a price that puts it in reach not just of the ardent collector, but of the casual purchaser also. The set includes a 68-page booklet, which comprises a song index (invaluable if you want to locate just one) an appreciation of Lady Day by Gary Giddins, a shorter essay of her effect on literature by Farah Jasmine Griffin, and a discography. Photographs are scattered throughout the essays, and there's a colour montage of some of the original 78 labels.     Giddins makes a nod in the direction of John Hammond, and the latter deserves credit as the catalyst for these recording sessions. He was not a hard-nosed record producer (most of whom were unsympathetic to jazz) but a genuine fan who could afford to indulge his passion. To digress, I'm glad also that Giddins has highlighted the irony of the sympathetic portrayal of Louis McKay in the biopic \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\", but the irony didn't end there. McKay acted as a paid consultant on the movie, which portrayed Billie as having been introduced to drugs by one of the members of an unnamed white band with which she was touring. Had Artie Shaw chosen to sue it would have been no contest!    To begin with Teddy Wilson got label credit and Billie's vocal was confined to the middle section. Later her own name was used increasingly, and she introduced the song, the group played the middle section, and she sang the ride-out. My favourite disc is number 6, which includes such sublime masterpieces as Some Other Spring, Ghost of Yesterday, and Body and Soul. Billie is very much in the driving seat, and the various groups provide the most wonderful homogenised accompaniments, against which she weaves the lyric. But whichever you choose to play there is treasure, and this set must rank as the Best Buy of the Year.

B000YKE87W|4.0|I always considered Placido Domingo to be the best tenor of all time. I still do, but the qualities in his voice are what make me appreciate Jonus Kaufmann.

I look forward to his future recordings and will be one of the first to purchase them.
0385532458|4.0|Since I am from Mississippi, of course I would love Mississippi Authors and want to read their works.  John Grisham just happens to be one of my favorite people and he has never written anything that was not really enjoyable.    One of the things I liked about this particular book; it fit right into the nicht that I needed at the perfect moment.  I was looking for something that I would really enjoy, something that would not keep me having to go on and on, something just like this book, short stories that were terrific.  I could read one or five, whatever I had the time to do.  I loved the book.      While I loved this book, sometimes I don't always like the encouragement of artists to think Mississippi is just a backwoods full of idiots or crazy people.  While we certainly do have those in our state, we also have really good and even great people.  This state has put out untold numbers of talented people that most people know.  We also have so many people that are intelligent and yet kind and gentle.  We have our snobs, we have our psuedos, we have a great diversity of people.    I suppose you can tell that I love Mississippi.  I love to see other places and their peoples, and other cultures and so forth, but I have Mississippi mud between my toes and I love my State.    Thanks, John Grisham, for yet another fabulous book.  I thought it so good, that I gave one to my grandson for Christmas.

B002SQ3664|3.0|First off, this is not a Woodstock documentary. I it is a story that just happens to center around the event. The film is an adaption so it has a general script to follow and still has to adjust to become a visual experience. Some people were added others were combined for brevity.<br /><br />Not saying you will appreciate the movie any better but you defiantly need to watch the voice over commentary to see what was trying to be produced.<br /><br />I thought it was cute but nothing worth re-watching. Not that I would ever take those substances that were imbibed in the movie, however this was a much more accurate rendition than the earlier movies attempted to portray.<br /><br />The introduction of the Character returning from Vietnam was for the movie and a tad over the top. However, I had just come back myself as was stationed at West Point (not too far away). I actually made it to the muddy parts but never to the stage. Other people may have been virtuous however, I know someone who made a bundle on selling a combination of oregano and tea mixture (which smell similar to other substances).<br /><br />Any way I applaud the effort to make this film. I just do not see it having any social redeeming quality.<br /><br />Well one exception \\"No stuping in the bushes\\", Sonia Teichberg.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so could not compare to other versions.

0545128285|4.0|As a fan of both the fairy tale genre and the Harry Potter-verse, this was a perfect addition to my library.<br /><br />I liked reading it, especially with the addition of Dumbledore's notes to each story.  I wish that there were more stories, perhaps with the additions of the wizarding world variations on the stories that most muggles know and love... but alas, such is the hopes of the non-author.  Given the other collections of fairytales in my library, I would have been extremely happy with a large collection, spanning hundreds of pages, perhaps not double-spaced with huge margins on each page.<br /><br />You don't exactly get your money's worth for this book, but given that the price goes to support a charity, I still deem it a good purchase.

The quality of the animation shows through better in full 1080p if you have it.

This book may not be the most suitable for the young readers, but is a great way to learn about an ongoing human rights issue.  The story is well-written and allows the reader to relate as much as possible.

B002ZEZ6PS|5.0|A SUSAN BOYLE DOUBLE-DEAL should be well worth the effort.  Most Susan Boyle Fans want to have BOTH a DVD and a CD for each recording of Susan Boyle. The SUSAN BOYLE DOUBLE-DEAL should have been offered the very first time around.  As it stands now--after so many millions of Susan's first DVD have been already been sold--a Susan Boyle STAND-ALONE of her Britain TV Appearance on Dec. 13 should be offered here in the USA and at AMAZON.COM for \\"I DREAMED A DREAM: THE SUSAN BOYLE STORY\\".  I'll repeat that for clarity.  For the DVD use the FULL BRITAIN TV VERSION shown on December 13, 2009 of \\"I DREAMED A DREAM: THE SUSAN BOYLE STORY\\".  It is the longer and better version than the other ABBREVIATED one which was shown online here in the USA. Many SUSAN BOYLE afficianos world-wide would certainly purchase the DVD alone.<br /><br />As one of many millions of SUSAN BOYLE fans I highly recommend for each subsequent SUSAN BOYLE release that HER LABEL  also offer a SUSAN BOYLE DOUBLE-DEAL for each of those future releases.  At the present time, SYCO (Simon Cowell's label) is SUSAN'S LABEL for her first two releases only.  Hopefully, Susan will have a subsequent label that guarantees SUSAN more of the profits of her superb gift of singing and interviewing.  Although SUSAN does not fancy herself as giving a good interview, Susan's public has viewed that ability far greater than does SUSAN.
B002EWD0I6|2.0|I was very disapointed in this BBC production. Although it is well done, it bears very little relationship to the books which together form one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. I guess the producers didn't think the books were dramatic enough and felt obligated to add plot lines not in the books. More respect for the source material would have produced a better product. If you love Lark Rise to Candleford, do not buy this. -Marge McCracken
B002R0F3Q2|1.0|This album hardly ever rises above being mildly distracting. The musical ideas are very sparse indeed, and to cover up this deficiency, Ms Keys frequently resorts to the repetition of musical phrases and she chants. The songs on this album are all very ordinary and, indeed, jejune. Imagine an album of B-sides from singles by Beyonc&eacute;, and you'll get the picture.<br />Ms Keys' singing of her unmemorable and somewhat tedious material is unremarkable. Perhaps she was as bored by her own songs I was?<br /><br />Standout track? The first song, and it only qualifies because the rest of the songs are so uninteresting.
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|Here's the rub: This story is a good \\"what if?\\" story. Marvel comics use to do a comic called \\"What If?\\", and this story definately fits there! What everyone who is giving it one or two stars is forgetting, or ignoring, is that as soon as Nero appeared, he changed the entire timeline for the universe! So, yes, Uhura was never interrested in Spock, that was Nurse Chappels place! And Kirk's father didn't die that way... and Vulcan was never destroyed.... and Captian Pike was NEVER on the Enterprise with Kirk..... and and and and and!<br /><br />So, the real issue here is, was this a good alternate possible scenario for our favorite characters? Not too bad in my oppinion. I thought the basic way that the crew was thrown together was novel. And the story was interresting, not really great. The actors were passible (I actually enjoy the group that has created \\"Star Trek: The New Voyages\\" much more! Probably because they do it out of love for the Star Trek Culture rather than money!)<br /><br />I felt that the music was definately over the top. The Enterprise itself was ok. We REALLY didn't need Scotty's pal!! And truthfully, the Uhura/Spock thing was not necessary at all! Very uncomfortable!<br /><br />Hopefully, their next effort will rectify some of these issues, or at least call it \\"Star Trek: the Alternate Universe\\" or something like that, for as all Star Trek fans know, this was NOT Star Trek as we accept it! Live long and prosper all!

B002HWUU1I|5.0|Strict Joy is an achievement. It chronicles every feeling of falling out of love; unexpected loneliness, second guessing yourself, blindly thinking you still have a chance, guilt, questioning life, wondering why it all had to happen, and at the end, acceptance, however bittersweet it may be. The music never condescends the listener with any sappy breakup songs that scream \\"poor me\\". It's more of an audio diary of the decline of the real relationship of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, and if any musicians these days know about catharsis, it's these guys. It also doesn't hurt that they're two of the best musicians working today, and they are a revelation when put together. As if they're already great enough when they're each on their own, there's nothing better than hearing these two harmonize.<br /><br />The album begins with the sweeping, charming Low Rising, which I've loved to death since they performed it on the Tonight Show however many months ago. I have to say I like most live versions of this better than this studio version (partly because of the mix) but that doesn't change how good of a song it really is. Then the album has a two-song slump, which is the only low point of the whole album. No matter how many times I've tried to like Feeling the Pull, I just cannot. And In These Arms is better, but I really can't find anything to it; it just feels standard to me. But after this slump comes one of the best parts of the record, tracks 4-6. I can't explain how much I love all 3 of these songs. They of course all contribute to the scope of the full album, but if they were released on their own as an EP, it'd be one of my favorite EPs released by any band. High Horses isn't necessarily one of the best on the record, but it's a good song nontheless. After that, every track (and I mean every track) is golden, with the exhilirating The Verb being one of the very high points of the record (which actually isn't saying much, because nearly every song here is a high point of the record). Back Broke closes the album in a desperate, sad, and very real fashion, and if someone told me this was exactly how the couple ended their relationship, I wouldn't doubt them.<br /><br />Buy Strict Joy. I might've given you some of the best advice you've heard in a while. This is worth your money, and much more. It's one of the most satisfying listening experiences I've had all year. If you like the music from Once, then I hope you'll like this; though keep in mind, those songs were about falling in love, and these songs are about falling out of it.he record).

B002VPE1AM|4.0|During the Titanic roll-out, Director Cameron observed that his highest purpose as a filmmaker was to take his audiences to places they otherwise could not travel. If you look back over his accomplishments, he's at least consistent, and more consistently than any other director, even Spielberg, James Cameron has delivered on that promise. (I would also argue, in another place, that Mel Gibson is 3 for 3 on that same, albeit implicit, challenge.)<br /><br />Avatar is, as the reviewers have extolled, \\"immersive,\\" particularly in 3D and Dolby 5.1 (although I'd also argue that, even without 3D the viewer would literally be pulled into the frame - think the two great long scenes in \\"Children of Men\\" for immersive cinema). Cameron has created a compelling, believable society and culture for the Na'vi, pretty obviously based on northeastern American woodland Indian culture, and a strange world, of strangely beautiful  flora and fauna, for the Na'vi to inhabit (although like the worlds of Star Trek, this is, with a few interesting exceptions, a largely bipedal and quadrapedal world). And Cameron, through standard story devices, wins our total sympathy to his uplifting vision. With different scenarios and visual pieces, he's done this before (and so, of course, have scores of filmmakers, over and over): \\"narrative tension 101,\\" with a good guy and a bad guy in a very asymmetric duel (Billy Zane, Paul Reiser, Michael Biehn in The Abyss), a monstrous, prehensile capitalist, HUGE technologies, HUGE vistas, very simple, very emotional thematics - Cameron knows, intuitively, that stories can be fanciful and and even unbelievable, but the emotional kicker is real, does indeed course through our nervous systems in ways that we've all felt and understood before, like \\"puppy love,\\" so real to a 14-year-old but absurd to grandpa, who's been there before...but forgets how real, how true the FEELING of the thing is.<br /><br />So hats off to Mr. Cameron and his crew for the Na'vi and all the glorious effects he's surrounded them with. I've docked him a star simply because he's repeated so many familiar elements of earlier pictures and now showing us anything new in the story department...but I'm already reconsidering that, because, as a cinematic experience - which is of course how we approach this work of art - this movie is thrilling and, yes, takes me to a place I could never have got to without having been led by Mr. Cameron's sure hand.<br /><br />So: 4 and 3/4? 9/10?ffects he's surrounded them with.

B001JNNDEW|5.0|I've owned every version of this film that's been released on disc and the Blu-Ray version is a great addition.

1416583408|3.0|As a dog training book - 0 stars. This is NOT a how to train a dog book. It has maybe 2 pages on dog training. I think Ms. Horowitz would likely have a hard time training a difficult or dominant dog if she tried. A Chessie would have her for a snack :)    As a \\"how dogs think\\" book: 3 stars. There is SOME interesting information in here. The data on dog vision and olfactory ability is quite interesting. There are some severe flaws as well. Ms. Horowitz appears to be a city girl that did not grow up with animals or dogs. Her world view is that of owning a very nice well socialized dog in an urban environment. She appears to have spent no time at all with trainers and users of working dogs, people that KNOW dogs and sometimes bet their lives on their dogs. She should have spent time with hunters, guard dog trainers, rescue dog trainers, military dog handlers, etc. She states that dogs don't hunt, if they try they don't do it well, or if they do hunt they don't hunt cooperatively (in packs). Anyone with long experience with dogs, especially in a rural area, KNOWS this is WRONG. Some dogs are stone killers and some run in packs. Ask the elderly couple that got EATEN by a dog pack recently about this if you happen to run across a good medium. She never seems to touch on the sad occasions when people, especially children, are severely injured or killed by dogs. They aren't all sweethearts with wagging tails and I would have loved to see some research on why the \\"bad ones\\" got that way. The \\"fake heart attack\\" test of dog emergency response was not too bright. Dogs know you are faking!    As a memoir of dog ownership: 5 stars. Her pound rescue dog Pump sounds like a fantastic dog and her memories of this dog are very touching to read.    Finally - this book needs an editor. The same things seems to repeat in the book.
B001UN1KVE|5.0|I've always wanted to own this film on disc and never go around to buying it on DVD. Then they had it for $9!!! on Blu-Ray and had to bite. The great thing about this edition is it comes with the Blu-Ray PLUS the original DVD edition that includes an extra bonus feature not included on the Blu-Ray. (Why it's not on the Blu-Ray I have no idea) This film has never looked or sounded better on Blu-Ray and is a must for all Mel Brooks fans.    One thing to note: They just released a Mel Brooks collection on Blu-Ray, HOWEVER, that collection does not include the DVD in this release that has the extra bonus featurette. So, if you're a completist, you'll still want to pick up this release along with the collection if you want everything you can get from this film.    If you loved Star Trek and Star Wars, you'll love this film!

This product has been out for many months, so I am not too hopeful.<br /><br />Update: I continued to try out this DVI adapter every couple months or so to see if the issue would be resolved. Finally, when I tried in July 2011 the problem was gone.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|It is true that any negative reviews you read about James Cameron's AVATAR is completly FALSE.    People who hated AVATAR somehow got their political buttons pushed the wrong way; they took offense prematurely when they should have lightened up and enjoyed a historical masterpiece.    I hear people complain that AVATAR is a remake of \\"Dances With Wolves\\" + \\"Pocahontas\\".  Okay, so what's wrong with that? Those are 2 great stories. But neither one of those great stories have the presentation that AVATAR is able to deliver.    Okay, so we got the politics and classic story out of the way.  Pretty much every movie these days is based on some other story and politic. That's nothing new.    Now let's talk about what makes this story unique and one of a kind -- the cinematography and CGI special visual effects.    When CGI characters look exactly like real people and living things in every way, that is truly special.     When CGI characters can make you feel \\"connected\\" to them as if you feel connected to real live people, that is truly special.    The acting is absolutely fantastic. Heck, even the CGI characters did an amazing acting job. :)    Can we please give Best Actor to Jake Sully (the blue Na'vi) and Neytiri (the Na'vi princess)?    This is truly one of those masterpiece movie that I would love to watch every 3 months or so. :)    I will surely be one of the first in line when it comes out on BLU-RAY!

B001AVCFJM|4.0|This is not the best Star Trek movie, however it is a good movie. If you are a fan of the original series brace yourself to be disappointed. Spock has gone emo, Kirk is nothing but a young, overconfident guy that gets into a lot of fights. Supporting characters are average with Uhura as Starfleet's top communications officer an improvement. Other good points are the opening 3d scenes involving the birth of Kirk and also the musical score and sound is fabulous. Everywhere you look will be elements of different series and movies, but slightly changed to try and make it more exciting. The \\"lens flare\\" effect was effective and did add to the feel of the movie even with the poor vanity lights bridge design. The plot is basic timetravel good guy / bad guy and clips along at a bleeding pace. If thats all you want then the movie will be fun. If you watched the original movies then you'll see how bad copies of Spock and Jim affect the plot and ultimately damages it to keep this movie from getting 5 stars. Also, this movie is yet another remake of Wrath of Kahn with Nero being Kahn. You'd think they'd have learned their lesson from Nemesis. It is not necessary for every Star Trek movie to copy from its predecessors! Star Trek plots are starting to get damn near religious in repetition and I find it disappointing! The original series was far more original (yes I think the whale movie was one of the best)! Star Trek 2009 is like a buffet of every Star Trek series, both good and bad with a tired plot. It has exciting visuals and sound. In the end I felt Star Trek The Motion Picture and its subsequent sequels starring the real Leonard Nimoy and were still better, pure classic, and more awesome than this. Star Trek 2009 is a children's movie with little content beyond its comedy and fighting. I still enjoyed it as it doesn't take itself too serious and is more of an homage.    My expectations for a 2nd movie's plot being totally original are now sky high, and I fear JJ Abrahams will not be able to repeat the success if he goes the safe route and does the same thing again.

B002VPE1AM|1.0|Mozart was a very gifted twelve-year old, cranking out all manner of compositions seemingly beyond his tender years.  The sad news is that the works he created as a mature composer seem hardly any more sophisticated, to still echo with the jolly emptiness of childhood, a distinct lack of a fully formed, tragic worldview.  Watching James Cameron's Avatar, I kept having to fight off the sensation that, for all its marvelous technical achievements, I was watching the work of a gifted, precocious twelve-year old.  But one that had fully absorbed a lifetime's worth of meticulously correct environmental claptrap.  Al Gore's enlightened fingerprints are all over this movie.  The ease and utter lack of moral complexity that accompanied the main character's betrayal, not just of his comrades but of his whole planet, was breathtaking.  Given Cameron's gift for finding the noble and the romantic in tales of treachery and betrayal, perhaps his next project should be a sympathetic telling of the Major Nidal Hasan story.<br /><br />While I was initially puzzled by the uniformly rapturous reviews accorded Avatar (especially when compared to [[ASIN:B002SJIO4A District 9 (Single-Disc Edition)]], a vastly more original movie) I could only conclude that it's Avatar's syrupy post-Christian, post-American values that so enthralled the critics.  Surely its bland stew of recycled pantheist/ nature worship clich&eacute;s appealed to the sophisticates for whom the faith of most Americans is to be ridiculed.  And surely no movie has so passionately depicted Americans, in their role as earthly imperialists, and the US Marines in particular, as the spearpoint of that conquering role, with such visceral contempt.  Perhaps it's because no organization clings more tenaciously to the values and traditions that once defined this country that the U.S. Marines tend to be singled out for contempt and loathing by the likes of James Cameron.  While Sam Worthington's \\"warrior, jarhead tribe\\" character was mostly squared away in his appearance, watching Stephen Lang's rah-rah speech to his ragtag troops before the big climactic battle I was reminded of nothing so much as the \\"gutter trash\\" bounty hunters with which Robert Ryan had to pursue William Holden and the other members of The Wild Bunch.  Who wouldn't root for their defeat?  This was plainly Dances With Wolves with bigger arrows and more impressive face paint.<br /><br />And I suppose the timing for Cameron's movie was just right.  The sight of the World Trade Center towers vanishing in a whirlwind of pulverized concrete and human remains is a rapidly fading memory, one which our education establishment works tirelessly to erase all together.  So I suppose it was high time for a movie where people can once again cheer as the American fighting man is impaled with the arrows of noble, environmentally correct aborigines, where earth in general, and America in particular, can finally be subjected to a humiliating trail of tears as we're driven from the Eden-like Pandora and forced to retreat to the planet which we (of course!) ruined.<br /><br />So I confess to being chagrined and puzzled that at movie's end, a substantial part of the audience applauded.  It's as if people were to applaud after having been urinated on for 2 and a half hours.  But I suppose if the urine is raining down in spectacular 3-D, well you just have to clap.uared away in his appearance, watching Stephen Lang's rah-rah speech to his ragtag troops before the big climactic battle I was reminded of nothing so much as the \\"gutter trash\\" bounty hunters with which Robert Ryan had to pursue William Holden and the other members of The Wild Bunch.

B001OQCV60|2.0|I went to this movie to accompany my 14 year old son, not expecting much. I thought it would at least be fun fluff.<br /><br />I agree with the comments that the film is crammed with unnecessary and distracting jumpy editing; MTV is right.<br /><br />I also found a third of the dialog incomprehensible and mumbled, with Robert Downey, Jr. being the worst offender. It was a pity that he happened to be the main character. I could mostly fill in the resultant blanks due to context, but it was very annoying. I grew up on BBC and American TV in New Zealand and pride myself on being able to understand pretty much any English accent, South African, or pretty much anything else. I'm not noticing any problems with my hearing or with understanding dialog in any other movies.<br /><br />I didn't mind the anachronistic martial arts stuff. As others have pointed out, Guy Ritchie apparently has the Matrix 'Burly Brawl' DVD too.<br /><br />The CG effects looked cheap and nasty (and not just after Avatar) and the sets dreary.<br /><br />The plot was reasonable.<br /><br />With a different director and a different editor, this film could at least have been the fun fluff I had expected.

0316069906|5.0|The book is very easy to read and understand.  I learned quite a bit about factory farming, which the book really covers well.  A few weeks after reading the book, my wife and I went vegetarian, on my 60th birthday.  Back in May of 1978 I stopped eating all meats, with the exception of poultry.<br />After reading this book, I realized that eating poultry was factory farming, and it is ugly and cruel.  I have now been vegetarian for 2.5 years, and it has been easy.  I am also an environmentalist for life, and you cannot eat animals and be an environmentalist.  Growing animals for human consumption if very bad for our environment.  This book made me more aware of this issue.<br />A wonderful book, that I highly recommend.  I do hope he helps others to go vegetarian.<br />I am a serious runner, in my 35th year.  Quite a few older serious runners are vegetarian, and are doing great at getting older.
0060555661|4.0|Initially, I was intrigued by the title of this book when I saw it on a shelf in the University of Chicago, School of Business bookstore. I am still reading the book, but find it both informative and interesting in that it goes to great lengths (which is good for me) to explain differences between investing and speculating (of which I have been doing more of the latter, regretfully). The book also explains some of the psychologies of various investing strategies; why, how and who uses them and, more importantly when to use them. I am still learning about various bond strategies and plan on purchasing government bonds as a hedge against inflation in my IRA.  This is a great book to keep nearby when you don't want to watch TV during the holidays (or for any time for that matter).
B002QEXN2K|2.0|Let me preface this by saying, John Mayer is GOD. The man is a musical genius and he is one of the best musicians in my lifetime. That said, this album sucks. (that hurt to type....lol) Someone said it sounds \\"like background music you would hear at the dentists office,\\" and damned if that isn't ABSOLUTELY true! The songs are boring, LAZY (Noel St John is 100000% accurate about \\"Who Says\\" sounding EXACTLY like \\"Stop This Train.\\") and uninspiring. The ONLY song I like is \\"Perfectly Lonely,\\" and even that is WAY more for the song writing aspect than the song itself. \\"Crossroads\\" sounds like an interlude, or like John just needed something to sandwich inbetween 2 songs. This really is a swing and BIG MISS for Mayer. But, I guess everyone is entitled to one. He's still AWESOME, but this is NO Continuum. Skip this one....

Although the digital copies of the three movies expired (the first two expired in Aug. 2009 and the third expired December 31 2009), the collector's set is still a great buy!

1883217040|5.0|This book is simple, concise, to the point, and does not get overly verbose. This is probably the best music theory book I have seen. If you want to learn about chord structure and scale structure, this book is amazing. You will be reading chord changes after just reading the first couple of chapters. Excellent book!

B000005RTV|5.0|1982 was probably the greatest year for heavy rock and this album is part of the reason. Although not necessarily a classic on the level of Screaming For Vengence or Number of the Beast - Battle Hymns holds its own.    Although the band is huge in Europe this album is very American in attitude and topics.     You don't have to growl in order to be heavy.  Get this album!    BTW - I bought this used from goHastings seller (Hastings Video and Music store) and it was in excellent condition even thought it was listed as good. Shipped very quick also.
B001P06GX4|5.0|The high marks that this game are well deserved.  It is so fun to play a game that is NOT laden with lots of rules.  My husband, sons (4 and 6 year olds), and I have had a blast playing this game. What a great way for children to learn about spatial configurations and about game strategy!  I would highly recommend this game especially in cross-cultural settings.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|On Spike TV's Awards late this year, B Pitt promoted this film jumping feverishly to the savory apporoving grins of Tarantino .  During that ceremony one of the best and underrated movies of all time, Fight Club was \\"inducted\\" to the Men's movie hall of fame.<br /><br />During this mock awards ceremony's acceptance speech, Pitt, Norton and Fincher, the trio responsible for the most radical film criticism of the excesses of consumerism, read reviews of Fight Club. When released, the movie was trashed by the most broadcasted critics.  Among them Roger Ebert.<br />A solid advocate of the status quo.  The status quo dynamics that have us in today's economic crisis.<br />Favored by the interests behind the movie production.  The only way to achieve such fame and success as a critic.<br /><br />He called Fight Club movie \\"Macho Porn\\"...ohh but he loved this sadist feast.  I dub Inglorious Basterds Macho Porn.<br /><br />Porn main approach is the objectification of women.  Here Tarantino makes objects out of the Nazis.  I imagine this childish and highly amusing genious planning this prank.  Trying to find the plot that would accomplish three objectives:<br /><br />A-The ultimate exploitation film, his core genre.  As violent as possible.  obscenely violent. As violent as a Zombie movie, which we know he loves.  But with human beings. That no one would care about their massacre, just like with Zombies:<br />Nazis!!!<br />B-Chum with the Weinsteins even more, and the all across very powerful Jewish movie making group and rest of the Jewish community.<br />C-Play them.  Yes.  a Psychological Ambush.<br />Probably with a didactic intentions. Tarantino, above all seems a nice guy, crazy nice.<br />Is Pitt on the ambush as well? my bet is yes.<br /><br />The holocaust was and is such an abhorrent, abominable event there are no words in the English dictionary to describe it accurately.<br /><br />Their leader was a monster.  An abnormality capable of amassing colossal amounts of hate and injecting it to the ignorant masses.  Yet all human beings.<br />Yet Hitler is not alone. Kim Sung il, Milosevic, Idi Amin, and other \\"precious\\" specimens for scientific study, have come to remind us of the deep ends of the dark side of human nature.<br />And the ability of charismatic sociopaths to turn otherwise normal<br />human beings in to sociopaths.<br /><br />There is another of my favorite movies, 8mm, in which the character is faced with a similar, not as excruciating dilemma, as the jewish people face.<br />When victim or witness of acts of unjustice and cruelty so outlandish, retaliation is our most deep and instinctive reaction to make things right and seek revenge.  Most times more volently and cruel than the original acts suffered.<br />The need for such catharsis is desperate.<br /><br />But is it justifiable, effective from a moral,ethical, constructive perspective.?  And more important, healthy to stoop down to a socyopath's level??.  I understand that much of the film plays out as caricaturesque, and fun.  But how much real acid wrath is underneath??<br /><br />So tarantino channels all these repressed anger produced by this tragedy. Other films have elegntly and assertively dennounced it's aberration,serve to warn about the dangers of imperialistic fascism. But have not accomplish to help release the natural anger repressed underneath by many affected.<br /><br />I take the liberty of putting  fictional words or thoughts on the director's head.  The ideas he might had when concocting this indulging fantasy, in order to achieve his mis-directed chatartic spectacle, and exacerbate the affected minds into his no end trap:<br /><br />\\" You hate Nazis...yes, you've said so covertly in so many movies, for so much time.  So there you go.  Have yourselves a party of sadistic torture.  Taste on screen the dirty revenge you've silently asked for decades. And after that think about that pleasure you experimented. The vouyeristic escapist gratification of seeing other humans, who tortured your family, Now tortured and burn alive in return. Thousands brainwashed by a mad demonic genious.  Ponder what it says about yourselves.  I wash my hands.  The group is unruly, is clearly labeled basterds!\\"<br /><br />\\"a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to drink, smoke, screw and beat one another up.\\"  Said Ebert about Fight Club.<br /><br />I'll modify to close about basterds: a celebration of violence in which the heroes write themselves a license to torment obscenely both guilty and innocent because their enemies have committed heinous acts.

But when dealing with such volatile issue,my radar goes to a red light.<br /><br />My second worry based on recent history, about this film:<br />Last year the Oscars were more politically influenced than Ive experienced before.

B00000JPH6|2.0|It's kind of scary. Don't get this film for your little ones. I definitely would not recommend it for children below 10.
B001992NUQ|5.0|This is already my favorite movie. The 10th anniversary blu-ray has definitely hit the spot. The opening to the movie is hilarious... the graphics have been completely remastered for blu-ray. It is awesome. The \\"cigarette burns\\" throughout the movie are even more apparent, which is awesome. The only thing I had to complain about is that the extras aren't stellar. some of it is interesting, but I expected more from deleted scenes.  Overall though, excellent. I wouldn't trade it for the world!
B001OQCV60|5.0|Nearly hundreds of actors have played Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson, and it may seem rash to call Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law the best Holmes-and-Watson-duo so far. But I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan my whole life, and most of the portrayals I've seen of the character only focus on an aspect or two of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character.  In Guy Ritchie's film, as in Doyle's \\"canon\\", Sherlock Holmes is an avid boxer, a martial artist, an iffy musician, an opera lover, a dabbler in many sciences, and a master of disguise.  Most importantly, he's an expert in logic and deduction.  He playfully torments his housekeeper Ms. Hudson (Geraldine James) and shares an antagonistic but symbiotic relationship with police Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan).    The movie opens with Holmes and Watson apprehending serial killing Satanist Lord Blackwood (played broodingly by Mark Strong).  Blackwood is executed, but when he seemingly rises from the dead, the deductive duo must determine whether it's a supernatural occurrence or if there's a logical explanation.  It's exactly the type of mystery Doyle would have devised, with plenty of twists and opportunities for Holmes to show off his genius as he races to stop a plot to take over England and (gasp!) America.  Everything from the experiments Holmes performs in his Baker Street flat to his climatic revelation of the mystery on the Tower Bridge seems perfectly in line with Doyle's writing.    One of the only departures from the canon that bothered me was Sherlock's introduction to Dr. Watson's fiancée, Mary Morstan, played as a delicate English rose by Kelly Reilly.  In the stories, Mary was Holmes' client in \\"The Sign of Four\\" before Holmes first encountered Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia.\\"  Then again, the continuity of the stories was rarely important to filmmakers, or even to Sir Arthur, so I'm just nitpicking.    As a film on its own merits, \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is almost perfect.  The movie's opening shot grabs you, and Guy Ritchie's directing stays gripping all the way through the end titles.  His version of Victorian London is moody and atmospheric.   Hans Zimmer's quirky score blends well with the film's tone and Downey Jr.'s off-kilter Holmes.  Meanwhile, Jude Law transforms Dr. Watson from the bumbling comic relief of most movies into a cool, competent sidekick.  Perhaps owing to his own considerable acting chops, he's the rare Watson who manages to be as interesting and watchable as Holmes.  When he leaps into action, he relies on a sword-cane and a trusty revolver, while Sherlock favors a riding crop (which diehard fans will recall was his preferred method of self-defense in the canon).    Rachel McAdams manages to tweak Sherlock's classic adversary into a feisty action heroine.  All the while, another familiar adversary skulks in the shadows.      Even when Sherlock Holmes feels a little bit more like James Bond, he doesn't feel any less like Sherlock Holmes.  Ritchie finds a way to depict Sherlock's fighting as a mental exercise as much as it's a physical feat.  In the same way, though \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is grander and more commercial than Guy Ritchie's usual films, it doesn't feel any less like Guy Ritchie.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Final Fantasy 7/ Advent Children, Two Disc Set (I own the Blu-ray FF7/AC Complete also) is pure CGI heaven with just the right amount of action and pathos to both rock and emote! Even the soundtrack reaches across a broad spectrum of emotions ranging from exhiliarating fun to suspenseful action to a touch of humor to deep, heavy sadness. Oh yeah, believe it!    May I also mention that I have NEVER played the game in my entire life. I'm not X,Y, or whatever generation, more like \\"boomer', and as one previous reviewer predicted, I was introduced to FF7/AC in the \\"new millenium\\" via YouTube music videos. What I saw, blew me away so I continued to explore the FF franchise.    Hollywood has its Shrek, The Lion King, Toy Story, Kung Fu Panda, you name it, but Square-Enix has produced one of the most defined and humanistic 'video game-based\\" full-length feature film which I have ever set my eyes upon.    Yes, I admit (like many fans/players), I felt an emotional connection to FF7/AC's CG-animated characters, especially the main protagonist, Cloud who had suffered so much loss. Hey, would it hurt for him to crack a smile?! If you're searching for one of the hippest, cutest, and ultra-cool video game heroes to root for, look no more. Cloud and his friends fit the description and then some. From hair to clothes to accessories (dig those wolfy doorknockers Cloud) to shoes to gestures to dialogue to the neatest fight moves, FF7/AC brings it on! Everything is so \\"fly\\" about this movie.    It certainly helps to be familiar with the prequel, FF7/Crisis Core but don't get me wrong, FF7/AC, a true CGI marvel, can stand on its own. I personally chose to backtrack for a beginning since I have never played the FF games. Needless to say, video clips and plot synopsis are all available on line to fill in the gaps enabling a seamless storyline. BTW, the English dubbing is spot on! Thank goodness, no generic dubbing! All the characters sound the way I imagined them to be.    With the minorexception of some reverential/philosophical talk which may go over the heads of a very young audience, I of the \\"baby-boomer\\" generation got the biggest blast out of FF7/AC! Since I own the Blu-ray version as well, the technology has resulted in imagery of photographic quality. Every detail and subtle facial/physical nuance can be detected perfectly. Indeed, \\"not reality, but actuality\\". Blu-ray also offers almost a half hour more footage and sharpness of scenes beyond compare. The regular DVD gives a more \\"softer\\" look overall but a knockout just the same. There are in-depth interviews with FF7's creators from director, artists, composers, etc., etc., etc. in the latter disc as well. I enjoyed discovering the journey of FF7 making it one of the most influential video games ever.    Guys and gals, young and old alike will fall in love with the techno-magic and the honorable characters as they evolve to battle evil forces. Now, isn't it so natural to root for an underdog hero in everyday life? Well what are you waiting for? Time to watch FF7/AC once, twice, thrice..................!!!!
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Alicia Keys never disappoints! I absolutely, love, LOVE, this CD. I love that she's evolved and that she tried new things on this album. Thank God we all like different things, because some of the posted reviews made me consider not buying this CD. Alicia Keys doesn't sound like anyone but herself, and comparing someone so gifted, creative and unique to far lesser artists is an insult. I put this CD on, and just let it play until the end. \\"Love Is Blind\\", \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\", and \\"This Bed\\" I usually repeat a couple times each listen. Unlike other artists, she didn't saturate her CD with guests spots. But Alicia Keys doesn't need to. She can sell a million copies on the strength of her name alone. The only thing I wish is that the original version of \\"Empire State of Mind\\" was on the CD. Keep doing your thing, Ms. Keys!
B002MU4NL8|5.0|I consider Galaxy Quest a guilty pleasure .... it's just plain fun.  Slightly dumb? Yes.  Good acting? Sort of.  Funny?  In a stupid kind of way.  I would recommend this movie though, whether old or young, as it's just plain fun!
B0013FDM7E|2.0|I had anticipated a much better plot and storyline for this movie. While Smith did a wonderful job portraying the character, the ending was abrupt and needed further development.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show has everything, it's campy but not too much, it's sexy and has very sexy characters and some sex too.  I've always been fascinated with the idea of Vampires and Werewolves.. this story has it all.. and more!  There's romance, supernatural, telepathy, witches, and more!  The books are great too!
B001JAFYFG|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  The special effects before CGI were very well made and the acting phenominal.  Peter Ustenov should have won an oscar for his performance.  The movie itself was very good and not boring at all there was alway something to keep your interest in the movie.  So for those who never saw Logan's Run I would suggest you you buy the movie in Blu-Ray and live a futuristic adventure (prove me wrong).  Good viewing.
B001FGDFB4|5.0|I had a great experience with the purchase. The book's condition was as expected and shipping was quick.  Thanks!
0307266303|5.0|I'm as slow a reader as I am a runner, but I couldn't stop reading this book and whizzed through it in a few days. McDougall weaves a patchwork of stories together while prudently interjecting himself and his own stories. If you're even just an occasional runner, this is a must read. And if you know somebody who runs, this would be a perfect gift.

B002RSDW80|1.0|First, let me say this movie had all the potential for being great - great actresses and a unique story (or rather stories). However, it went on and on and then on some more. Where was the editing????  Speaking of editing, they could have left out the digs on Republicans (hello.....at least 45% of the nation!!) and the fake Texas accents would be funny if not done surely in poor taste.  I guess it's ok to be a bigot if the targeted group is either Southern in nature or Republican.  Julie Powell and the entire writing team of this movie, you should be ashamed!!!!

1400032717|5.0|The idea is brilliant, although seemingly impossible to pull-off:  write a first-person account of the complicated life an autistic child.<br /><br />The dog's apparent murder \\"investigation\\" is the channel that you navigate down from inside the mind of this boy who you immediately lose yourself within, but the story is about loss, love, parenting and the complicated world that seems much simpler inside the confines of this child's mind.<br /><br />Simple prose with a beautiful story that you lose yourself within.  I loved it.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|It's not about the drugs, the bands, the gossip or the groupies.  It's about the music. Or, rather, the passion for the creation of the sound.  The filmmakers have taken us on magical tour of three guys who show us if you love what you do chances are you will succeed.  Like other viewers have mentioned, we didn't want it to end.  Bravo, Davis!

He opened it on Christmas morning and started filling it out right away.  He doesn't want me to read it because he says it is his private journal.  I am happy that he likes to write in it and express his creativity. He is also reading the other books in the series that he received.

Don't waste your money on this movie!
0375704027|3.0|It seems obligatory to begin a three-star review saying how much I enjoyed Haruki Murakami's other fiction. In truth, I liked the energy of the few short stories I've read but I picked up the novel because of its reputation in its own right.    In truth, I found much of the book bordering on dull and unreal. Early on, the main character befriends a guy simply because he's the only other person he's met who likes _The Great Gatsby_, but despite the begging of a comparison, there is none: _Norwegian Wood_ is lifeless for long stretches, and some of the dialogue is actually monologues of psychobabble (especially in the long, long chapter at the sanatorium). The characters weren't particularly engrossing, the plot was meandering. I didn't see why I should care about any of it. (Thousands upon thousands of novels are published every year. I can only read the tiniest fraction of them.) I couldn't figure out whether the problems were in the original novel or the translation.     The novel starts with a man in his thirties (my age) reflecting back upon his college years, which were made terribly painful and bittersweet by a love triangle (or quadrangle if you include the haunting memory of a dead friend that binds two together). But the thing is, the novel doesn't feel like it takes place anywhere. The narrator seems almost entirely devoid of any historical awareness. As someone who is acutely aware of the differences between now and when I grew up, it boggles my mind that someone whose critical years were in the turmoil of the 1960s doesn't have more of a sense of distinctive vividness about that time. Except for some passing references to student protests, the novel feels like it could just have as easily been set anywhere else at any other time. The main time-specific references are the riot of Western 1960s music that runs through the novel, and the attitudes about sex are. . . distinct. As a result, the novel has a sketchy feel, which is not helped by the characters repeatedly defending themselves emotionally from the shock of tragedy by retreating into themselves and outwardly becoming apathetic. So reading the novel feels like drinking flat Coke.    There are different ways of looking at this flatness.    Argument I: It's the fault of the author: the description doesn't even try to be rich. Attempts to appeal to the senses are few and far in between, and the description that is there feels random. This comes across as `thinly veiled autobiography', to which you can normally apply slightly lower standards in that you accept a sense of veracity as compensation for less coherence. (Life has so many odd and random bits.) But this apparently isn't autobiographical. It's also noteworthy that the novel was written while the author was living in Europe, which could help explain the feel of having been written by someone who only read about the setting.     In short, the author is basically depending on the audience knowing what Japan was like in the 1960s without having to explain it. (Similarly, would Jane Austen be so popular today if it weren't for the films based on her novels? She likewise never describes anything of clothes, architecture, etc., so we're dependent on outside information, which we get from Hollywood.)    Argument II: It's the translator's fault: the translation is so heavily laden with Western culture references that it seems insincere, so I decided to see if anyone had written about this translation. In fact, someone wrote an entire masters thesis on translating this novel. I didn't read the whole thing but what I read was revealing. Parts of the novel were actually first written in English than translated into Japanese. But more important, there have actually been two translations. When the novel swept through Japan shortly after publication, an translation came out for Japanese students of English. Apparently, it is dense with Japanese cultural references compared to the translation available now in the US. Thissuggests that what strikes me as a lack of vividness is an artifact of the translation, which bleached out what I as a reader needed. (And I've seen some rather good Hong Kong and Korean movies that have ripped off important parts of the story of Norwegian Wood, so the author's instincts seem right.)    Be it a problem with the author or translator, once I hit page 220, I stopped and strategized. I wasn't looking forward to finishing this novel. It had become a chore. I needed more context. So I got out my old Beatles cassettes and played them while reading. I haven't listened to the Beatles much since I was the same age as the protagonist during the key years. The effect of adding a soundtrack was radical. It was like struggling to watch something on an old tv with really bad reception and then banging the side of it and -- voila! -- suddenly it's perfectly clear. The songs added a sense of time/place and magnified the emotional cues, to the point where I felt like it had ended maybe twenty pages too short. I was very surprised to find myself sorry to reach the last page and have to put it down. (You can also add to the context by watching a video on youtube called `Student life in old Japan'.)  ******************************  It's been a week since I've read the novel. It's getting better. I catch my memory twisting it around, adding things that weren't in it, deleting the dull stretches. It now seems much more haunting than when I was in the midst of it.    I'd still criticize the main character. I couldn't describe him. He's like a cameraman in a movie that you only see when he actually points the camera at a mirror. So it's hard to see why other people, especially women, are interested in him.   ******************************  Over a year later: I was shocked to reread this review. I now have fond memories of this novel, even if I can't attach them to any particular scenes. I totally forgot, for instance, the sanatorium chapter. This book almost seems more like a memory virus than a novel. . .
0307386848|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times.

There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).     Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").     Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times.

B001OQCV24|4.0|Emmerich films have been a bit uneven for me.  He created a whole universe with Stargate, but then twisted history a bit with Mel Gibson in The Patriot.  He created a great film in Independence Day and wiped out the World Trade Center before anyone thought about it, yet made a hammy, cheesy flick called Day After Tomorrow.  His 10,000 BC had potential, but there were too many plot holes.<br /><br />2012, despite its viral marketing campaign (or because of it) hyped the film to include the Mayan predictions and how we were all gonna experience a disaster in 2012, yet the Mayan prediction stuff was maybe two minutes of the film.<br /><br />But I digress.  John Cusak decently plays our divorced pal who has issues with his wife and new boyfriend (gosh, where have I seen that before?).  Little daughter bonding (War of the Worlds remake); bratty son who has no respect and little sympathy from the audience (Day the Earth Stood Still remake); only the rich folks will get on the arks (with one guy saying the mobs will be fine and the critics saying \\"You think everyone will hold hands and sing Kumbaya?\\" (great line by the way) When Worlds Collide from the 50s had a similar storyline).  Yet Emmerich puts it together!<br /><br />Best scenes:  Driving a Chevy around giant fissures and through buckling parking garages.  Driving a van in a zig zag fashion, dodging fireballs; all the space scenes with sun flares!<br /><br />Clearly Roland has watched the same films as me!  The film took a little bit of every science fiction plot I've seen from the Fifties onward, and yet made a joyride out of disaster films.<br /><br />I knew I was in trouble when the kid in the beginning of the film was playing with a model of the Titanic (does Cameron get a kick-back?).<br /><br />[Possible spoiler]  Little girl at the end, when everyone is safe, asks, \\"Daddy, when are we going home?\\"<br />Damn, wasn't that kid paying attention??<br /><br />But seriously:  California realistically sliding into the Pacific made me look at housing prices in Denver, CO.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|I will be the first to admit that I have never been a huge fan of any of the Star Trek televsion series with the exception of The Next Generation, and I certainly have never considered any of the shows to be cool.  Star Trek has become largely identified (whether unfairly or not) with it's geeky legions of trekee fans and its stars who refuse to give up the limelight (I'm looking at you William Shatner).  But with J.J. Abrams' reboot of the beloved series, something amazing has happened:  Star Trek is cool.  That's right, for the first time in what seems like eons, we have a Star Trek film that just about eveyone can love.  Abrams wisely decides to take us back to the early years of the crew of the Enterprise; when Kirk was a young rebel who was nowhere near being ready to assume the role of captain and when Spock was an emotionally conflicted and even arrogant young genius.  The heart of Star Trek lies in the relationship between these two.  At first they butt heads but soon they grow to respect one another and devlop a strong friendship.  The entire cast of the film is outstanding and a special kudos to Simon Pegg for his wonderfully funny take on the beloved Scotty.  It is also a blast to see the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, worked into the story via a time travel plot that seems to have come right out of Abrams' popular TV series, Lost.  Star Trek is not a great film, it is, in the end, pure summer entertainment.  But it is summer entertainment with brains, heart and, as mentioned before, and an effortless sense of cool that has never been associated with the series until now.  Here's hoping that Abrams and his creative team can truly take this new franchise where no Star Trek series has gone before.

B001OQCV60|4.0|This is definitely not a film for the Holmes purist, but I somehow think Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would not object to this contemporary rendition of his classic detective novels.      This time, Sherlock (Robert Downey Junior) and Dr. John Watson are facing Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a murderer and member of a secret cabal of mages whose ambition is to take over England. The cabal's artifices are designed to make Lord Blackwood appear as though he has arisen from the dead. Further devices will poison the entire Parliament if they do not align themselves with the new order.  Our fearless duo is aided by Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) and various others.      The film's fast-paced and takes us through a grittier more polluted London. Sherlock is not afraid to get his hands dirty and he's definitely depicted as a brilliant but dissolute individual.  Everything happens so quickly that you are really going to need to pay attention to keep up with the clues in this action packed epic.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2009

While he's redirecting the newly fired employees' anger to finding their new goals, he's on his way to his life's goal--10 million frequent flier miles--when Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) literally grounds him.  Her brilliant and economical idea:  use teleconferencing to fire people.      But first, Ryan's got to teach Natalie the ropes so she can design the program. The two of them go out on the road where Natalie learns such things as how to accumulate miles and which travelers to get behind to get through the lines faster.      In this case both have a lot to learn from each other.  Natalie loses her love and Ryan thinks he's found his with Alex (Vera Farmiga). The story's poignant and painful and truly one of Clooney's best roles.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2009

B002NUULNG|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this blu-ray because of all the negative feedback about the new CG scenes. Luckily, I bought it anyway and was blown away. Sure, the famous opening sequence has a CGI Major now, and yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds, but the rest of the film is magnificent. The transfer is superb, and the other CGI inserted into the film adds a layer of depth. It helps the city feel more alive. The sound is exceptional coming out of my 5.1 system (it had those rear speakers working!), and Kenji Kawai's soundtrack still sounds oh so good after all these years -- the warm blanket over a cold movie. Speaking of warmth, they've re-colored some scenes to match the sepia tones of the second film, and I think it was a great choice. The film feels more modern now. They also got rid of the green 1s and 0s in the opening sequence's text credits, which after The Matrix co-opted it, is a good thing.     If you're a fan of the movie and have any doubts about this blu-ray, don't. The original film is on the disc, but I have to say, 2.0 pleasantly surprised me and it will probably be the version I watch again from now on.

0547258305|3.0|\\"Graceling\\" has been highly recommended to me by a number of people and so I have to say that I was stunned that I didn't find it to be the fantastic read that everyone else did. What makes this even harder to understand is that I read Cashore's \\"Fire\\" first and quite liked it.<br /><br />My first observation was that I was over 100 pages into the book before anything of note seemed to happen. Yes, there was the evil king, and there were the sidekicks, the introduction of the love interest, and the introduction of a truly fascinating world, but honestly even at 150 pages I could have put the book down and walked away.<br /><br />The writing on a technical level was okay. The descriptions were apt enough, but the character development seemed underdone, even for YA. (\\"Fire\\" fairly blazed in comparison and certainly had a better romance)<br /><br />Overall, it's worth reading, but I'd have to warn anyone that there is a chance that you'll have to grind through some pages before the pace picks up. Some of the action scenes require a little imagination to figure out what's going on and towards the end you'll need to suspend your belief to accept what happens.

0887307280|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and so I purchased a used copy from Amazon for about $5. Let me start by saying the first 60 pages of the book are pretty good, but after that, the author focuses your attention on documenting everything your business does and running your business like a franchise, even if you have no plans to ever franchise. Never once does the author consider different advice for different types of businesses. For example, a doctor or lawyer or dentist running a private practive would have very little in common with the types of businesses and advice the author uses as examples throughout this book.<br /><br />The author has no formal business education and has learned, in time, as anyone would, what works and what doesn't by offering advice to other people's businesses. He focuses your attention on the advice he has given that had successful results, with no mention of the businesses that failed from following this authors advice.<br /><br />There is no mention of how to determine the value of your product or how to properly prepare for taxes (those self-employed will agree these are two of the biggest issues of running a small business).<br /><br />Had I not made a promise to a friend that I would read this book, I would have thrown it into a garbage can right around page 180, where the ridiculous advice and examples were getting so bad, I had to put the book down and walk away from it. I would re-sell it on Amazon, but I couldn't live with myself, so when I'm done, I'm throwing it away.<br /><br />If you really want to learn about the proper way to run a business, my advice is to NOT do as this author says, instead do what this author did NOT do - go to school! Night classes at a community college or online will give you REAL information and being able to interact with the instructor about specifics of your small business can answer questions and concerns not thought of by any author, let alone one who is just making it up as he goes, as this author clearly is.<br /><br />The sad thing is, the book is even written poorly. Not only is the business advice just simple observation (hey, if McDonalds does this and that, and they're successful, you should do what they're doing!) but the style in which it is written appears to come from someone who doesn't understand proper grammar, sentence structure or even basic story-telling.<br /><br />While I have no doubt there are people this book has helped, I'm more curious how many people this book has hurt. Which one will you be?The sad thing is, the book is even written poorly.

B002WY65UQ|4.0|This is not a high brow film. It is pure sugar - not recommended as a daily diet but great as a sweet snack. The original version and sequels were very risque for its day and this remake does a good job of trying to update the movie without going overboard.<br /><br />An English school that accepts those girls that have been thrown out of every other school is not only in financial trouble but the government means to make an example of them too. Will all of the different factions (goths, sexpots, toughies, geeks, etc.) of St. Trinian band together to save the day?<br /><br />Rupert Evertt does not do drag justice (which is amusing....) but all the characters are fun to watch. Colin Firth and Stephen Fry (brief cameo) were my favorites to watch. There are a lot of talented UK actors who appear in this movie and then there is a scene by Misha Barton.<br /><br />This movie has more of a cult following then strong comedy to recommend it. I do not think it will appeal to the masses but it is silly fun.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|THE MOVIE:  While I hated this when I saw it in the theater, oddly enough I found myself thinking about it a lot afterward, and now that I've re-watched it on DVD I've developed a kinder, gentler attitude towards the movie and even have a great regard for it now.  Sure, the characters are underdeveloped and at times irritating, and the narrative is languid, but the authenticity of the story is strong and convincing and the relaxed pace is mesmerizing, and allows the steadily escalating threat to creep up on you and throttle you when it needs to.  Overall, I'd say this is a worthy successor to \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\"<br /><br />THE DVD:  When played, the DVD goes right to a minimalist DVD menu with options to play the movie with the theatrical ending or a single alternate ending, so, to help keep the verisimilitude of the film intact, we're spared having to sit through a parade of movie trailers.  On the downside, I've heard that there were a number of alternate endings made, one of which I managed to catch online, so we may be hit with a double-dip that includes all of these somewhere down the line.  Apart from the alternate ending, the only other feature on the disc is a trailer for Dicaprio's new flick, \\"Shutter Island.\\"<br /><br />Fulfilling its promise to recognize the fans, Paramount has included a list of people who submitted their names to be included on the DVD, and the list can be accessed only after going through the movie itself.  The list runs for 15 minutes and seems to include thousands of names, so if you're looking for yours, have your Pause and Forward Frame buttons ready.<br /><br />THE PACKAGING:  Lame.  The outer artwork for the DVD is decent, but the DVD itself looks like it has rental copy artwork, being coated in plain gray paint/ink with plain text.  As usual, there's no chapter insert, and as is becoming more and more usual, the plastic DVD case is an Eco Box, which means it has sections cut out on both sides of the inside.  So, be prepared to have another DVD case to replace this with.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT:  If you saw this in theaters and were disappointed, you might want to give it another chance and see if it grows on you.  Perhaps the biggest fault of this movie was the massive marketing machine behind it, which built up expectations for some people that it just couldn't reach.  The DVD treatment could be better, but it is surprisingly pretty good:  the menus look good, there's an alternate ending, and the list of fans is here.  However, the packaging is weak and there could always be a \\"Paranormally Special Edition\\" coming down the pike later this year with the rest of the alternate endings, so if you haven't been swayed yet, you might want to keep waiting in case a better DVD comes along (maybe without an Eco Box!

B002OHB3CG|5.0|I love this album. It is warm, sincere, and powerful. The acoustic guitars and orchestral arrangements stand out and are in the spotlight like never before. This shows them in a more of a relaxed warm light and it is refreshing to hear it without the electric guitars. We get to see the background of the songs up close and personal in an intimate set, while in the studio albums it all blends together. Both approaches to the Within Temptation music are great, just different, and I believe this is why they have released this live cd.     I can understand reviewers saying that the songs on here are somewhat the same on their live dvd 'Black Symphony' and that they could have picked a different song line up. I understand this, but honestly what is the problem here? They picked songs from all three ablums, 'Mother Earth,' 'Silent Force,' and 'The Heart of Everything.' This acoustic album has 6 out of 12 songs that are not on 'Black Symphony.' Count them, that's half of the songs and the rest are the band's popular songs, give them a break will ya? Also part of it is a question on whether the band put out too much live material in between the studio albums. I personally don't think so. Also why are reviewers saying it's a problem to play a song that is acoustic based in an acoustic set??     If people are going to compare this to 'Black Symphony' lets get something straight. 'Black Symphony' is great but has an entirely different feel from this album. One it's a huge live concert, two it's an entire symphony backing the band, three the crowd is very loud, and four the band is under considerable pressure and the vocals are less than perfect. On the other hand 'An Acoustic Night at the Theater' is inimately focused and well recorded. Sharon's vocals are wonderfully precise, the orchestral arrangements able to be heard clearly and distinctly without blaring noise, (which happens at live rock shows, that's why acoustic sets are different) and there is very little noise from the respectful crowd (which I am thankful for).  I am not saying that 'An Acostic Night at the Theater' is better than 'Black Symphony,' I am saying that they are both different and shine in their unique ways.   This album brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend it.

Unlike Blood Mountain, CTS is more about the songs - the sound and vibe of the whole piece - as opposed to meticulously perfecting every single note. As a result, Crack the Skye is a more \\"accessible\\" musical statement with a looser feel. This took some getting used to after Blood Mountain, but I'm glad that Mastodon doesn't stay in a rut and that they challenge their listeners!    One other thing that separates Crack the Skye from Blood Mountain is that it was recorded to analog tape, giving it that somewhat mushy sounding tape compression that - I feel - smears the instruments together, particularly the drums. On Blood Mountain you can hear the crispneess of every drum hit and the tasty bite of every pick on a guitar string. Crack the Skye actually sounds better at lower volumes, so it took time to hear all the fills and audio sweeteners in the background. I'm a big fan of Brendan O'Brien's work and talent, but I would've preferred digital recording and perhaps printing the final mix to tape before mastering.    I loved track 4 (The Czar) right off the bat - it is similar in arrangement to \\"Sleeping Giant\\", which is my favorite tune on Blood Mountain. The Czar is quite emotional and worth the price of the CD alone. For some reason, the first three songs of Crack the Skye didn't impress me at first, so I'd usually start the CD on track 4 and listen from there. The song with the Neurosis singer absolutely kills - he might've hacked up his spleen while singing it! After some time I came to appreciate the first three songs, and now I hear the album as a continuous whole. The musicianship and songwriting of Mastodon isin my opinion unrivaled in the genre, and kudos to them for having some of the best (if not the best) vocals in metal music today.     I wish Mastodon would come to Spokane....

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Where do I begin with my review of \\"Abbey Road?\\" It is the last true statement of John, Paul, George and Ringo's collective mastery of the rock/pop medium.  This ingenious album is deservedly on the Mt. Rushmore monument for its kind.  It plunges you into its brilliance from the opening track, \\"Come Together.\\"  This song alone has been covered by other bands and individuals nearly nonstop for the past forty years.  From the raw urgency of \\"Come Together,\\" the listener receives an immediate counter-song that is equally jaw-dropping in \\"Something.\\"  The guitar strings themselves seem to want to tell a story on this track, and in my opinion \\"Something\\" signifies the maturation of songs like \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\\"  Even what are today lesser-known songs like \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" drive home provocative lyrics mixed with irresistible beats and hooks.  Epic rock songs like \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" and \\"Carry That Weight\\" are also here.  This is what I would point someone to if they asked me why the Beatles were so well-remembered.  Enjoy.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|At first, with the release of hit singles \\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face\\", Lady Gaga had some of us shaking our heads saying to ourselves, \\"here it is, the next generation of the manufactured pop mess\\" or \\"she is trying WAY too hard with those get-ups and costumes\\".  But then she released \\"The Fame Monster\\", an EP where each song is just as good as the last, and some of us sat back, listened and changed our tune to hers.<br /><br />Lady Gaga has admitted that this is a collection of songs she wrote to try and deal with her fears, which adds an appreciable layer of depth to this otherwise fluff-at-first-glance pop star.<br /><br />With such songs as \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Telephone\\", and \\"Teeth\\", Gaga embraces her sexuality, attitude and dominance over men and relationships.  \\"Dance in the Dark\\" showcases a girl who is being emotionally beaten down by her boyfriend but \\"loves to dance in the dark 'cause when he's looking she falls apart\\".  \\"Alejandro\\", an ABBA cover, has been heralded by pop singer Darren Hayes as nothing short of an aural orgasm on his Facebook/Twitter/Myspace status.  Hayes makes no secret of his adoration for the pop superstar.<br /><br />\\"Bad Romance\\" will worm its way into your head, begging to be played on repeat for the following weeks to come.  \\"Telephone\\", the duet Gaga does with Beyonce, is much better here than on the remix that was created for the music video.<br /><br />On \\"So Happy I Could Die\\", Gaga has no shame as she admits attraction for another female and openly discusses masturbation.  This is refreshing in a world where stars like Adam Lambert are starting to sing openly about being attracted to men.  Lady Gaga is the answer to that female voice that has been waiting to be heard, helping to pave the way for openness and tolerance in the music community, at the very least.  She embraces who she is and if you have a problem with that, she really doesn't care.  She demands respect and with this EP she deserves it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a ballad that might showcase Gaga's vocal range abilities, you won't find it here.  This is a collection of tracks you can move to but at the same time you can feel the deeper content striving to break through the surface.  The beat grabs you, throttles you and doesn't let go--it will coerce you to dance along at the club, leave it on the radio while you're cleaning the house or add it to your iPod's \\"exercise music\\" playlist, (whether you like it or not).<br /><br />If anyone is going to start listening to anything by Lady Gaga, this is the CD to start with.Gaga's vocal range abilities, you won't find it here.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I am, right now, probably in the worste shape that I have ever been in in my entire life. A while ago I was revved up to start exercizing and losing weight so I started exercising on my own. That didn't work out too well because I was basically fumbling around trying to create exercises on my own, had no idea what I was doing. Then I went online to try and find a good video that could get me started. I read the reviews for this one and it seemed like it would be a good one to start out on if a little strenuous for beginners. I started it. I did the first level every night for a couple of weeks. It was tough but i could do it. Then I moved to the second level for a couple of weeks. And after I was able to do that level sort of okay I started mixing level 1 and 3, and 2 and 3, doing two levels each night five to six nights a week. It was working even without me changing my diet which I wish I had because I probably would have seen even better results. But the results I did see were that I was gaining muscle, becoming more toned, i was building stamina and endurance, i was able to do more for longer periods of time. However, I ended up injuring myself. I don't know how exactley because I always payed close attention to her advice on how to hold yourself so that you don't injure yourself. I ended up hurting something in the back of my left knee. Anyways I was already deep in the program and I didn't want to give up and I assumed that the injury would just heal on its own. It would just be a matter of time and stopping would have set me way back. I had the discipline to keep going and I was nowhere near the goal I wanted to reach so I kept going even though it was painful. This was in addition to the shin splints that I got which were excruciating and the pinched nerves here and there. So you can imagine how much pain I was in,I was hobbling around most of the time, but I didn't want to give up. Now, my advice to you is GIVE UP! I can't affford to go to the doctor but if you can then DO IT. I kept going despite the injury and now it's worse than ever. I had to stop completely doing any type of exercise that put any level of impact on my knees. Now I can't even walk around the store for thirty minutes without my knee bothering me. The level of motion is way down in that knee. It hurts to raise it forward, where my thigh is parallel to the ground, or backwards where my lower leg is parallel to the ground. I am afraid that this injury may be permanent and I'll never be able to do the types of exercises that will help me reach my goal or have the range of motion that I used to have in that leg. I feel like an old lady and I'm only twenty-one! The video is good and it will help you to get healthier and lose weight but be very careful to avoid injuries and if you're injured STOP AND (if you can afford it) SEEK HELP!!!!you can then DO IT.

B00204AA0O|5.0|Where to begin.  I believe that you can begin and end with one song... \\"Human of the Year\\".  The vocals between halleluiahs might be her best singing ever.  I have been listening to her since 2006.  Her voice is the best I have ever heard her in this song.  This is a great album.  It is a very good listen.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle demonstrates beautiful interpretations of many different styles of music.  I especially love her jazz.  I Dreamed a Dream is wonderful and it was also nice to hear her sing something different.  I think she should put out a jazz recording.
1579128149|5.0|I have always loved learning about the elements, and they have fascinated me since I was a little child.  They are the most basic building blocks of the universe, and Just by adding a proton, an element goes from being relatively safe for human life, to quite dangerous.  Gold (79) is harmless, Mercury (80) will slowly kill you, Thallium (81) will kill you fast, Lead (82) slow once again unless you are shot by it, Bismuth (83) will sooth an irritated stomach.  Polonium (84) will kill you again.<br /><br />I love the idea of the book itself, and having a consolidated periodic table of the elements in book form with photos of the available real-life forms is a wonderful tool.  The author did a tremendous job, not only in the photos, but in the information.  There are basic descriptions of how the elements are grouped on the table itself, and on each element page, a great description of how it was discovered, how it is used, and how it fits into the larger picture of the table.  Each page is also augmented with the electron order filling, atomic emission spectrum, and solid/liquid/gas states of the elements.  The author has amassed quite a collection, and the photos are quite beautiful and detailed.<br /><br />The voice of the print tends to be conversational, and has wonderful comments such as, \\"[these] are called the alkali metals, and they are all fun to throw into a lake\\", and it describes such an effect as \\"either a thrilling and beautiful experience or the end of your life as you have known it\\".  There are great facts, like did you know that aluminum used to be considered so valuable that Napoleon would put away the gold plates and used aluminum to serve his finest guests?  Bananas are radioactive due to Potassium?  The association of rain with bad health could be due to arsenic leaching from wallpaper?  I love the characterized of diamonds as just \\"overpriced cubic zirconia\\".<br /><br />I have one technical negative in that the book seems rather fragile.  I noticed finger prints rubbing off on the pages easily and discoloring the black background on each page.  To see if it was just me, I retrieved other \\"coffee table\\" style books from my shelf, and even those with glossy black pages did not seem to show fingerprints quite so easily.  I fear the production quality of the paper does not match the excellent information.  The binding also feels weak (as a person who reads a lot of books, old and new, I notice this).<br /><br />Overall, recommended reading, and I learned quite a bit.  It's is my 5 year old son's favorite book right now, and he could have me read him about the elements for hours (no kidding).on the pages easily and discoloring the black background on each page.

B001NXDSLQ|1.0|I was expecting much more from this special edition. The only extra was a short infomercial for the Museum at Bethal Woods. No commentaries, not supplementary concert footage, not even a trailer. Lame.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised.  I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it.  It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.<br /><br />It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty.  He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\".  Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter.  Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal.  Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.<br /><br />People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.<br /><br />In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)

B000UX6THK|5.0|One of the most original and interesting tv shows was the 1990s series Twin Peaks, and it has developed a bit of a cult following. The show was created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, and initially centered on solving the murder of a teenage girl, Laura Palmer, in a quiet Northwestern logging town called Twin Peaks. But though the series focused on Laura's death, the show was compelling because it highlighted the interactions between the interesting and eccentric characters, exposed seedy events infusing the town and environs -- complete with paranormal undertones. Basically the series explored the mystery of life, the mystery of death, and the mystery of the woods surrounding Twin Peaks.<br /><br />Although the first and second seasons have been available in DVD format for a while now, the critical pilot episode was not included in these previous editions. However, you can now get the complete series of Twin Peaks -- the pilot episode plus seasons one and two -- with Twin Peaks - The Definitive Gold Box Edition.<br /><br />The DVD collection also includes noteworthy additions such as international versions of the pilot, an interview with David Lynch, Log Lady introductions for each episode, the \\"Falling\\" music video featuring Julee Cruise, Japanese Georgia Coffee commercials, the \\"Saturday Night Live\\" opening monologue and \\"Twin Peaks\\" sketch featuring Kyle MacLachlan, and behind the scenes pictures.<br /><br />This DVD set is a great way to experience the show.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I love this book!, I think the love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is timeless. I believe, eventhough the story was written in the 1800's, mostly anybody that have been in love could relate with the complexity of feelings portrated in this story. As well as to relate, not only with the main caracters but also the surportive; the embarrazing relatives, the adoring aunt, the beloved sister, the lost love, etc...<br />What ever I could say will not do justice to this master piece.
B00006B1HH|5.0|It's a timeless musical that's loved by all, and the extras take you to another level. The full screen made it more enjoyable for me to watch.
B001OQCV60|3.0|How was the movie?<br />Quite a decent period movie with brilliant sets (bridge under construction, the ship construction site etc.), good acting (mostly) and not a bad story. By itself it would classify as an easy 4 star affair.<br /><br />But there is nothing Sherlocky about this movie.<br />If anything it was a missed opportunity to make a timeless classic character into a slightly more contemporary role in an interesting movie that would appeal to the movie going crowd of today. That is where I feel it failed.<br /><br />If somebody is a Holmes fan like I am, it probably won't gel in. If you are not a Holmes fan and haven't read his stories, it won't make a difference anyway from what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created.<br /><br />As an actor Robert Downey works very well. My problem is with the characterization of Holmes. In parts it is Holmes but mostly his eccentricities and brilliant thinking and deduction were lost in the movie. Only two parts that stand out in this regard are when Holmes goes to the restaurant with Dr. Watson and Mary Morstan (although the part was too short and too mumbly) and the last part when Holmes summarizes separately to the Home secretary and to Lord Blackwood how he uncovers their game (but again too mumbly). Both these parts out of a movie over 2 hours long don't do justice to the \\"concept of Sherlock Holmes\\".<br />And some of the things added to his character, like the bare fist fighting, martial arts fight scenes were, to be honest unnecessary for me.<br /><br />Even if the movie was almost the same but the lead characters were called something else and the title was changed, it would still work as a decent movie worth your time and money.<br /><br />One successful execution of (slightly) revamping a character that stands out in my mind is Batman. What Christopher Nolan did was to take just a decade old movie concept and revamped it, made it more modern, more edgy and vulnerable, more fun but not cartoonish but stayed true to the Bat roots. Now think of this movie like somebody makes a superman movie 20 years from now but this superman being who he is can also spin webs, drives a supermobile, wears a mask but can still run faster than a speeding bullet and has a body of steel - it might be a great movie but will not be superman movie.<br /><br />As an aside, Judel Law/ Dr. Watson was fantastic. Irene Adler was again a misfit character. Any Holmes fan feels similar adulation for Ms. Adler as Holmes did - the only women to outwit him. Here Madam Adler seems more lost and in need of help.<br /><br />Guy Ritchie and Lional Wigram had an opportunity to create a modern day legend of a 100 year old character. Unfortunately it is now gone for another few decades. If there is a sequel (there was a mention of Dr. Moriarty) and it stays along the lines of this movie, it will stil miss the loyal base. If it goes back to the original Holmes, it will probably alienate the crowd who liked this movie.<br /><br />Anyway, watch it as an interesting and fast paced movie and it is worth the money for sure. I just wish ....

B002XUL6RG|5.0|In spite of the care and patient control with which this powerful film is shot and edited, \\"Hunger\\" is a deeply visceral and moving film, featuring a brilliant performance by Michael Fassbender in the lead role.  There are scenes of violent and intense brutality here, but what is more powerful are the simple shots, of a face, of a look, of a gesture, washing hands, of sores on the back of a dying prisoner.  While the film is based on real events, with deep political ramifications, the film itself is not so much political as a plea for humanity, that sides with the wounded sensitivity detected in the eyes of those guards who had been unable to desensitize themselves to the routinely brutal treatment they gave to the prisoners in an effort to break their spirits, as much as it sides with the humanity in the dehumanized IRA prisoners it depicts.<br /><br />The film details the horrific prison conditions that motivated IRA leader Bobby Sands to begin a hunger strike in 1981, that led to his death and that of 8 other prisoners, but also eventually won some concessions for the IRA prisoners, that they had been unable to achieve in any other way.  The film opens on one of the guards, washing his hands of the violence he'd inflicted on a prisoner but also unable to wash away his own sense of culpability and fear, and, later, unable to build a connection with the other guards who seem more immune to what they do.<br /><br />It isn't until about a third of the way through the film that we are introduced to Bobby Sands, who is clearly something of a leader among the men, and it isn't until the final third of the film that Sands takes center stage, and embarks upon the hunger strike that gives the film its title. This is not so much his story as the story of a situation, that affected all who were involved in a number of ways.  There is very little in the way of back story here - it is all about the immediacy of the situation, in which the past is mostly irrelevant and what matters is the continuation of the struggle for recognition, as something other than common criminals.  What I found fascinating (and brilliantly depicted here) was the core paradox of their prison rebellion: that in order to win recognition as human beings and soldiers whose cause was unpopular but not evil, that in their struggle for equality, they had to debase themselves, to reject clothing, to smear feces on the walls in protest, to exploit and attack their own bodies as a demonstration of the inhumanity of their treatment.<br /><br />The film is told mostly through carefully controlled visuals, chiaroscuro with a wide range of tonality between the darkest darks and the brightest whites and colors, with a minimum of dialogue, except during a powerful and lengthy exchange between Sands and a priest about his decision to embark on a new hunger strike, and his willingness to take it all the way.  While director Steve McQueen (no relation to the actor) has a very distinctive style, his approach here reminded me somewhat of Robert Bresson's [[ASIN:B0001Y4LE6 A Man Escaped]].  Both films tell their story in a minimalist style, with carefully controlled framings that show only what is necessary to capture the impact of events, leaving aside all that is superfluous.  The camera frames bodies and faces very tightly, in medium and close shots, inside the actual prison cells, and only opens up more wide to convey the depth of the prison corridor, or to contrast the openness of the visitor's room or the out of doors with the closed off nature of the cells.<br /><br />Apart from being overwhelmed by the intensity and importance of the subject matter - this is a story that needed to be told, from inside, and I can't imagine a better telling than this - apart from all that I was stunned by the power of the filmmaking.  This is one of the most impressive directorial efforts I've seen in a long time, and an amazing debut by Steve McQueen, and I expect it will be recognized as oneof the most important films of this decade by the film historians who care about substance and style over commercialism and buzz.  This is definitely one to have for the library of the film lover who likes to study films; there's a lot to learn here.  I can't say how happy I am that Criterion is doing the releasing on this one.<br /><br />Here's what to expect on the disc:<br />  *  New, restored high-definition digital transfer, approved by director Steve McQueen (with DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition)<br />  * Video interviews with McQueen and actor Michael Fassbender<br />  * A short documentary on the making of Hunger, including interviews with McQueen, Fassbender, actors Liam Cunningham, Stuart Graham, and Brian Milligan, writer Enda Walsh, and producer Robin Gutch<br />  * \\"The Provo's Last Card?\\" a 1981 episode of the BBC program Panorama, about the causes and effects of the IRA hunger strikes at the Maze prison and the political and civilian reactions across Northern Ireland<br />  * Theatrical trailer<br />  * A booklet featuring an essay by film critic Chris Darkeof this decade by the film historians who care about substance and style over commercialism and buzz.

B002WY65W4|5.0|Just imagine: a world where any car or home you find, you can have; a time when you can shoot off your guns in the middle of Times Square; a place where you can eat all the Twinkies you want...if you can find them.<br /><br />  The only problem: running for your life from zombies, and a constant fear of using the bathroom.<br /><br />  Welcome to Zombieland.<br /><br />  Rule #1 of this review: If you haven't seen Zombieland, run to the nearest theater showing it. If it's closed, wait outside until it opens. Yes, this movie was that good. Even more, it lived up to the hype.<br /><br />  For years, the pinnacle of a horror-comedy was Shaun of the Dead, and with good reason. That movie made even the meagerly depraved laugh at the sight of fellow human beings becoming lunch, as well as pelted with classic LPs. But now, with Woody Harrelson at the helm, Zombieland has taken the crown.<br /><br />  Rule #2 of this review: Summarize the movie in a way that explains what the viewer will be watching, but don't give too much away as to ruin any surprises.<br /><br />  The world has been decimated by a plague of zombies. It is unknown how this came about, possibly some mutated mad-cow disease, but by watching any other zombie movie ever made, you can probably make a safe assumption as to how this came about. Did we really need another explanation as to why there are angry, flesh-eating people running around oozing blood? Not really.<br /><br />  Columbus(played by Jesse Eisenberg) begins a journey from his college apartment in Austin, Texas to his home in Columbus, Ohio to find his parents, in the hope that they have survived this zombie apocalypse. Armed with his trusty double-barreled shotgun and a handwritten set of rules to help him survive, he sets off, avoiding public bathrooms along the way as well as walking corpses. On his travels, he meets Tallahassee(played by Woody Harrelson), an afficionado of the zombie-killing trade, whose sole purpose in the aftermath of zombies is to find an edible Twinkie.<br /><br />  The two scavengers come across two sisters, Wichita(played by Emma Stone) and Little Rock(played by Abigail Breslin) who con them into giving them, pretty much, all of their survival gear, and leave them in the dust on a course to an amusement park. The lads catch up with them, eventually, and through their trials of surviving in a world full of zombies, learn that family doesn't necessarily mean a blood relation. A heart-warming tale, filled with a helluva lot of zombies.<br /><br />  Rule #3 of this review: Say something nice.<br /><br />  Ok. Amazing.<br /><br />  There really is no other way to describe this movie. Jesse Eisenberg, while believed to be a poor-man's Michael Cera to most of the film-watching community, does an outstanding job as the safe survivalist, adding dry humor to the clown of the film, Woody Harrelson. Woody Harrelson, of course, plays the role of the gun-toting, \\"have some fun killin zombies while you're still alive\\" renegade. If the Twinkie jokes weren't enough, Harrelson garners enough one-liners to give the most distinguished of internet forum dwellers something to do. Emma Stone is, of course, hot. That does not diminish her presence as a cut-throat, \\"do what it takes\\" survivalist, especially when it comes to protecting her little sister.<br /><br />  The film itself is rife with action and comedy. The use of slow-motion zombie kills, the trashing of everything in sight, and the visual gags of the zombies themselves(such as a zombie clown) all come together under an umbrella of a fantastic survival movie in line with Lord of the Flies. It's just a little more campy, so as not to get too full of itself.<br /><br />  Oh, and a certain cameo had me almost on the floor laughing, if I wasn't stuck in movie theater seating.<br /><br />  Rule #4 of this review: Explain the movie's flaws in a critical, but helpful, fashion.<br /><br />  The only thing I can say that this movie lacked was a full-fledged plot. Luckily, it doesn't need one. If it did have an elaborate plot, the movie wouldn't have had quite the power it holds. Sure, they throw a love interest into a zombie survival story, but why not? Who wouldn't be interested in Emma Stone? And yes, ladies, there's enough Woody Harrelson for you, too. This movie is just good, knee-slapping fun. With zombies. Like Columbus' Rule #32 states: Enjoy The Little Things.<br /><br />  Rule #5 of this review: Give the movie a rating on a scale from 1-5.<br /><br />  I give this movie 5 out of 5 Twinkies.<br /><br />  Now go see it, already. Oh, that was Rule #1, wasn't it.quite the power it holds. Sure, they throw a love interest into a zombie survival story, but why not? Who wouldn't be interested in Emma Stone? And yes, ladies, there's enough Woody Harrelson for you, too. This movie is just good, knee-slapping fun. With zombies. Like Columbus' Rule #32 states: Enjoy The Little Things.

B002RVCD0U|2.0|I was disappointed in this sequel, tho the special effects and most action was terrific. The plot was disjointed and the characters unclear to me. The ending was predictable early on, and was a clone of \\"I Robot.\\" The film's monotone coloration was depressing, and the Terminators stereotypic - including their menacing growls (huh?) and skeletal teeth (they eat hot dogs?) The attempt to weave in Arnold S. at the end and reproduce the molton-steel gimmick (Terminator 2)felt disjointed and like an afterthot.<br />Save your money.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|give tarantino credit for at least two things; he's an original and he has a sick, playful, demented mind. and that can take a guy a long way in today's hollywood. i have some reservations about subjecting this movie's subject matter to tarantino's comic book approach but the movie's sick, loopy charm won me over. tarantino and cast are obviously having a ball. just realize it's a comic book (or graphic novel) and don't make the mistake of taking the movie or tarantino too seriously. 4 and 1/2 stars.
0439023491|5.0|My book club has finished both of the books in this series. Our consensus-a great read! In Catching Fire she brings in the realization of cruelity within the sections. I think it emphasizes the importance of communication within the context of this series and our world today. It definitely keeps you hungry for more!  Can't wait until August for the concluding book.
0099529939|5.0|Having read all the Conan-Doyle stories as a young lady, I was shocked that my uncle had not read even one of them. I bought this book of the  Novels for him as a starter toward the literary enjoyment I wished to share with him. He received it as a Christmas gift this year and has talked of little else. He loves the typeset, the fact that all the novels are in one book, and the beauty of the hard bound book itself. The stories are classics and he is reading them with relish. I , and he, would recommend this collection to anyone who loves good literature and the crisp turn of a page as an adventure unfolds.  5 Stars !!
B002VT6C0K|1.0|I purchased this book because of all the great reviews, but now I think I am losing my mind.  I was greatly disappointed in this book.  I thought there was no character or plot development.  Just short stories of horrible/bizarre/unbelievable things that happen to people.  I felt their responses are unlikely and unrealistic.   I must be in the twilight zone.  I consider myself well read, often choosing books that would not normally be my first choice, only to be pleasantly surprised by writer's and subjects I am unfamiliar with.  This book left me surprised, but in a completely different manner.  I want to write a longer review but I am speechless.

If you have more than 4 people, you can play in teams or get the expansion pack. Definitely one of the best strategy games on the market. Highly recommend this game to anyone.

0545123267|5.0|Shiver is being heralded as the new Twilight, and I completely agree. Shiver is the best new supernatural, young adult romance since Twilight came out way back in 2005. I was a rabid fan of Twilight when it first came out and never thought anything could measure up to it. This was before I got my hands on Shiver.<br /><br />Shiver is the story of Sam and Grace. Grace has always been fascinated by the wolves in the woods behind her house. One night, she is attacked by the wolves, but is saved by the wolf with yellow eyes. She deems this her wolf and watches as they return in the winter and leave in the spring. Then, one summer she meets a boy with those exact eyes that she is sure is her wolf.<br /><br />I didn't want to like Shiver. I'm not a werewolf person. I've always preferred my leading men cold and dead. I devoured half of Shiver in one sitting before I even knew what happened. Sam and Grace's relationship is electrifying and has that breathless, aching romance that so many readers fell in love with when Twilight came out. Shiver does that and more. Grace and Sam desperately need each other, but their relationship is much more balanced than Edward's and Bella's. Shiver also has many more plot twists than Twilight ever dreamed of having. I didn't think I was invested in Sam and Grace's relationship until the very end at which I almost cried when things starting going south. I won't say any more than that; you wouldn't want me to ruin the ending for you. I almost never cry at books, and the talented Maggie had me shedding a tear or two despite my best efforts. This book left me with the great, \\"Ahh, that was amazing. My life is great\\" feeling while aching for more. I also immediately wanted to read it again, to bask in all of it's glory instead of feverishly racing through to discover the ending.<br /><br />My only gripe, and mind it is only one, is that Sam is a song writer and the book included his flowerly, slightly emo songs. I really just wanted to hug him and tell him he was fine on his own. We don't need songs to know how amazing you are. There aren't that many songs, and it did very little to detract from my love of the book.<br /><br />I give Shiver a five out of five. You can not go wrong with this book. I'm so excited about this book, and I'm even more excited for the sequel, Linger, to be released on July 20, 2010.on his own. We don't need songs to know how amazing you are.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|Not a bad movie if you look at as complete within itself. Being a true treky it changed the time line of the orignial series, making the series quite moot, with no original vulcan and Spocks mum no longer alive. The special affects are great and the movie fun to watch. Having the original Spock was great. Good entertainment.
B00000DHRX|5.0|What an amazing singer. His voice takes me away.  I love to close my eyes and fantasize while listening to this wonderful collection of songs.  George sings like an angel even when he's talking nasty!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|That's me. Never heard of, nor saw, the featured performer. Nevertheless I would say to others like me, even if you immediately hate Celine Dion, you will find much of entertainment value in this arena, which seems to have every dream device that Jerry Lewis might have thought to surround himself. That you will hate Dion is quite unlikely. She is surrounded by dancers, acrobats, singers, and every sort of fireworks imaginable, yet she manages to hold center stage quite easily with strong vocal performances of songs with which the audience, if not you and I, seem quite at home. She looks good, handles herself well, is personable. Multifariously costumed as well. What more can you ask....except, perhaps, Ol' Blue Eyes, with whose image and voice she does a duet.
B002Q9VPFM|4.0|There is no Ultimate Cut in Germany (or Europe in general) so I ordered this box from Amazon.com. Shipping took about ten work days which was absolutely fine.<br /><br />I had read about the Director's Cut on a website and was completely happy with the Ultimate Cut. Some people seem to prefer the movie without \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" cut in, but since it's the same in the graphic novel I did like it.<br />I doubt I have to say much more about the movie itself: I assume that if someone didn't like it at all he/she wouldn't buy the Ultimate Cut, so of course the movie is great.<br />The box is full of documentaries and extra stuff, until now I haven't even seen everything but keep watching. It also includes a digital copy of the theatrical version - for those who mind to carry Watchmen around an their iPod or something.<br />To me, \\"The Complete Motion Comics\\" was a pretty interesting and wonderful feature. It's also available in Germany but lacks some quality since the German speaker doesn't really seem to grasp the comic's mood. (Besides, I haven't even read the German translation so all I know is the English one.) The original version is spoken well though and I enjoyed watching the comics (although I do prefer reading them).<br /><br />The box itself looks pretty nice, with glossy pictures of our beloved (if so) heroes inside.<br /><br />I think that Watchmen fans should buy this box for it's truly worth every cent. People who aren't too familiar with the graphic novel but like the theatrical version should rather have a look at the Director's Cut. People who can't really accept \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" cut in should also refer to the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Note that the Director's Cut is NOT included in this box.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|A good action flick, but the \\"widescreen\\" is only 4:3 widescreen (Anamorphic widescreen is much better). The fine scenery deserves to be seen in Blu-ray.
1595141715|1.0|I was debating whether or not to rate this one stars or two. I was thinking about giving it two stars because I was very engaged in the book when I started reading it, it made me want to keep turning the pages. I chose one star because it was such a huge disapointment.     I could write many pages on how Hannah Baker is, frankly, an idiot; however, I really don't want to waste any more time on this book.    Bottom line:   concept = cool  Hannah Baker = shallow  book = ruined by Hannah's excuses for killing herself.       I am so glad I didn't buy this book before reading it.   What a shame, this book had so much potential...
B000002G23|4.0|This is every song Album the police made.  Some extra stuff live  songs that they could have left out.  I do not care for the hard/punk rock tracks as much, but as a box set I can listen through most of it.  I am a true R&B head, but this music is a bit of everything.  The early stuff is more rock, and punk, but most is just some good music.  I enjoyed this CD box set, and is one that is on my playlist on my pod, and Zune.  They are a tight group, I put them up there with Rufs w/ Chaka.  Just some good music.  The drum player is one of the best! What can we say about Sting, he is a soul brotha MAN. You will be surprise how many hip hop folks have sample the songs of Police (look at the credits on some of Fluff (puff) diddy.  lol
B002SJIO5E|1.0|The biggest problem with this film is its lack of realism. For example, a lot of the plot revolves around acquiring the space aliens' weapons - yet, they aren't any better than what earthlings have. Secondly, another theme is the 'rights' afforded to the aliens - eg. notification before they're moved, along with bending over backwards to not offend them, no matter what - to the point of ridiculousness. Third, the commander's choice to lead the effort - his goofball son-in-law - hardly one likely to succeed in anything other than getting himself and others killed. Yet, that would not make the commander look good at all.<br /><br />The idea for this sci-fi is somewhat original, and the special effects are amazing however gross and disturbing.  In District 9 the aliens look like giant grasshoppers, including spitting black fluid, and are attacked by humans.  The plot says they need to move further out of town and out of sight.  So a team of MNA officials go door to door having the aliens sign away their rights.  (ha-ha?)  Of course they want to stay where they are and fight humans scene after scene.  I don't think this is entertainment.  The movie also kept reminding me of the old thriller, \\"The Fly\\" where the main character is transformed into a fly. In District 9, the main character slowly turns into one of the aliens, which looks like a 7 foot bipedal grasshopper.<br /><br />A stalled spaceship over Johannesburg, South Africa brings aliens to earth for 20 years.  The film makes a racist joke of a segregated class (this time space alien)  living fenced off area outside of town - eating garbage is unimaginative.  This has been done often and in many forms.  In the film the slang word for \\"alien\\" is \\"prawn\\" - which is insulting to the aliens.<br /><br />An evil corporation, Multi-National United (MNU) is sent into District 9 to do evictions.  This makes no sense at all.  I guess this was something to laugh at.  The MNU goes to each shanty and knocks on the door asking the alien who lives there to sign a release, that they know they will be moved.  If they don't sign, they shoot them.  Huh?  The movie gets messy and messier.  It seems like the first part was more structured at least, but then the majority of the movie turns into a crazy fight that goes on and on.  Gags such as the aliens liking cat food, alien weapons can only be used by Wikus (Sharlto Copley) who plays the human who becomes half-breed.  Of course we hear jokes of making love to the \\"prawns\\" to start turning into one of them.  It also did not  make sense that the District 9 Slum was controlled by local Nigerian gangs.  Nothing added up other than more people to fight.<br /><br />So it turned into a generic action movie with special effects, some old jokes entwined, but not very entertaining, not what I wanted or expected.lives there to sign a release, that they know they will be moved.

1400032717|5.0|I understand how the book could appear boring tedious and the worst book ever, now imagine living with it. If you have experience with someone who has aspergers, this book will make sense, if you really don't know that much then it will be the worst book ever.  The way that the chapters are completly unrelated is how it's like to live with someone who is an aspi.  I personally cracked up throughout the whole book because I could see everything in that book in my dad who has aspergers.  It's really tough to understand even for me now, that, that really is the way their minds work.  I can promise you that the book is a perfect representation.<br />At the same time I read the reviews of those who say that it is a really bad representation, which honestly really confuses me. Having lived with my dad all my life, I feel comfortable defending my opinion, and my mom who is pursuing her doctors degree developing treatment for aspergers thinks that the book is accurate to a tee.  However, I will have my dad read it and give his opinion.<br />I know one argument most had was about how their children are very affectionate and don't have any of the characteristics that Chris does, but I think it's important to remember that Aspergers has a spectrum just like everything else.  I know my dad really isn't anything like Chris either, but it's all in the way their brain works that really is truly different.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|First we had Silent movies, then there was Sound, Black & White turned to Color, then we even had regular in your face 3D, But AVATAR pushes the envelope to a whole new level..& although this kind of film making is unachievable by most film makers. This is what most films will look like in our near future. So quit judging this highest achievement in filmaking, Just go & see it to appriciate the huge effort put into it.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Well this is my first review..just deal with it. :)<br /><br />This movie WILL change your opinion on CGI. I'm not going to lie I'm kind of a skeptic when it comes to CGI, it's become something that's so easy to produce that directors are pumping out movies more then ever, and aren't taking enough time to make the quality of the animation convincing... (GI Joe for example).<br />  Well James Cameron certainly took his time, and it paid off. I have never experienced a visual spectacle like this. I was concerned with previous trailers the movie was going to be too colorful and not be convincing on screen and look even cartoon like, not at all. I was shocked at how wonderful the pigments were and how rich it appeared on screen. James Cameron's imagination in creating this beautiful planet; Pandora, I wanted to be there. It was magical almost, all the creatures and plants were so life-like, watching this movie in 3D made that even more real.<br /><br />Several critics have given this movie an average rating. This is because they believe it had a weak story line and bad acting. I don't completely disagree but, the movie was not made to have the greatest story-line. I think the creativity takes over the story-line in this movie, and it is very believable.<br />  Basically it's about a young marine sent to understand the way the Na'vi live and survive. There had been a new technology created to give him the body of an avatar. He begins his mission in the hope to relocate these mysterious creatures, as they are sitting on a gold mind of protected rock that will sell for 20 Million a kilo. He learns the way and the Na'vi and falls in love, and becomes a warrior for them. He fights back the human race to defend his new home. (just slightly predictable)<br />  If you keep an open mind... over $300 Million went into the production and took James Cameron over 10 years to produce, let alone it took 30 hours to render a 30 second shot of CGI, you can't beat how ground breaking this movie was, even just for that fact!<br /><br />I strongly recommend it, just to experience something truly different. It's exciting, there were parts that make you want to cry and even make your hair stand up straight. The tension of the war between the humans and the Na'vi makes you really connect to the characters. You can feel the emotional struggle on screen and can really sympathize, if a movie can stir your emotions it's worked. 5 stars!r that fact!

0307473708|2.0|being a fan of the showtime series, i figured i'd try out the book that inspired it.  i wasn't expecting to be so... underwhelmed.  lindsay doesn't seem to develop the characters past their most obvious traits: dexter, the (seemingly) empty soul; deb, the foul-mouthed resident hottie (who i found the most typical and predictable of all the characters, either whining or cursing 95% of the time); laguerta, who in the end becomes inseparably entangled in the story line, is presented sporadically as an idiot woman, dependant on dexter and swooning over him all the same.  rita, doakes, and angel all play small, rather insignificant roles.  rita is seen at the beginning of the book, then halfway through, disappears entirely.  dex reflects at length about how he cares for rita's kids, kids in general too, but that's the first and last of it.  in these moments, dex appears to have, maybe, some normal 'feelings' or at least some vague sense of humanity, but again, that's never truly explored.  even at the end of the book, he has the option of 3 kills, and he chooses the most blase, one that plays to deb's helplessness (both physically and professionally) and less the code of harry.  even 'biney' gets away... wasn't the point of story that dexter kills killers rather than allowing the legal system to fumble with them?  all the while, lindsay presents dex as the ideal man; smart, witty, career-driven, attractive, etc. but the women are helpless, needy, and can never figure anything out on their own (and lindsay often describes deb's 'sex suit,' another bit of writing i found typical, unnecessary, and not in tune with dex's apparent disregard of sexuality).  the story line was written for a man, by a man.  but perhaps that's the genius of it: dexter is so self-absorbed in himself and his killing that he doesn't have the time or care to see any of the people around him in a positive or redeeming light.  and because this book is written in first person with dexter as the narrator, this could explain why no other character is explored past the surface.  if that is what lindsay was getting at, he does a mediocre job of it.  'darkly dreaming dexter' refers to the dreams dex has throughout the book at lead him to the killer... and i use the word 'killer' to describe brian, not dex, as dex does very, very little killing in this book.  he has more of an unreal fascination with death and gore than a need to kill.  the dreams lead dex to believe he may be the killer, which is a concept you (the reader) pick up on long before dex does.  as was usual with more aspects of the book, the idea that dex could be the killer is too short and underdeveloped.  the quick read of 341 small, large type pages could have (and i would have preferred to have) bloated to twice and many, giving the reader a chance to see each character entirely and to weave a more interesting and complicated plot.  perhaps the rest of the books in the series allow for this, but i'm not betting on it.
0553212443|5.0|If you live in the English speaking world and have spent any time around a tv during the month of December, you know the plot.    Is the story worth reading and not just watching?  Very much.  It preserves the poignancy of lost time and redemption that is at the heart of Scrooge's story - even more than a religious message.  Dickens addresses the reader directly, and there is more humor than most adaptations show.    This edition has an interesting account of the first time Dickens read the story to a general audience - the beginning of Dickens' career in performing his work which proved almost as lucrative as the mere writing of it.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|I went to see this film at the IMAX at Jordon's Furniture in Reading, MA and I was blown away. This is, hands down, one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I was completely surprised that the entirety of the film was done in 3D and, at times, was a little uncomfortable but still totally engrossed in the storyline, the characters, and the world of Pandora. Even though the movie was so long when it ended I was sad because I wanted more!    I can't wait to see it on DVD!

B00005JPKE|4.0|There are by now countless movies on the WWII, many are outstanding on their own merit as they showed the war and its utter destruction to human life, mind, heart, body, society, psyche in every conceivable way. With this very background, it is a whole new experience to watch the 'Letters' movie as it still could find some new way and material to tell a WWII war story. Mr. Eastwood has told a familiar story but from a totally different angle (a completely opposite direction to the American side) to say a different story of a war, whose result is known to all viewers.<br /><br />Strength of the movie is that it shows more of the human side of the Japanese boys-turned-soldiers for the WWII. To make it authentic - which it is - the film is made in Japanese - though made by an American!! The film is more interested in the hopeless situation the young lads of the Japanese troupes are in and successfully catches their mindset. \\"I do not want to die for nothing\\" - this comment from a Japanese soldier summarizes it all. It depicts the result of a futile war decided by some incompetent leaders making gross wrong decisions driven by mindless ambition, on the hapless citizens-turned-army of their own country! The boys were defeated - mentally - not just before the battle started, but even before joining the army to fight Japan's 'enemy'. By capturing the pity of the common Japanese in the Imperial Army, the film essentially questions the validity of such a war and subtly endorses the notion of universal brotherhood. The humane treatment of the film seems to pass the feeling that ultimately, the instruments of war are no 'savage' (as the Japanese Army described Americans to their boys) regardless of their nationality, as they are only carrying out the duty as mandated by the rulers.<br /><br />Problem is to do so, the film needed to show some soft aspects of the Japanese leadership also, which will definitely be felt bit compromising. While it is possible, that there 'were' few good Japanese (the real life Colonel Saito of the 'Bridge On The River Kwai'), but they were only few, and showing them as good or bad as the allied forces is a clear distortion of the truth. This is the only point, which I feel the movie - made with some astonishing cinematography and care - could have handled with more balance.(the real life Colonel Saito of the 'Bridge On The River Kwai'), but they were only few, and showing them as good or bad as the allied forces is a clear distortion of the truth. This is the only point, which I feel the movie - made with some astonishing cinematography and care - could have handled with more balance.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|I just got back from a friend's house after viewing their copy of this \\"Blair Witch Project\\" wannabe.  I actually laughed at this movie instead of being frightened or scared by it.  The hand held camera was done first in the BWP and enough already.  It doesn't make the movie any better to watch when you see the floor with a quick movement to the ceiling then back to the floor again.  Stop it already.  The movie picked up at the end but let's face it, it had to do something to save it if possible.  Only the last 10 minutes really does anything but I was left with a feeling of having my time wasted by this whole thing.  The attempt to make you think that this really happened with the credits, sorry, what credits? just a blank screen after having the female lead's whereabouts unknown.  Just feeling jipped.  No major extras for the dvd besides a slightly different ending.  Remember BWP did it first and did it better.  Rent this first before buying or wait a few months and get this in the bargain bin if you must have it.  My suggestion is to pass on this and \\"The Box\\" as well.  You will be glad that you did.

0307389839|2.0|As an avid runner, I was excited to start reading this memoir. However, the content did not live up to my expectations. For a title with running at its epicenter, this memoir spoke plenty about the credentials one must possess to be a successful writer. I disliked the constant bombardment of necessities and characteristics needed for writing and the juxtaposition of these qualities with running. I continued on reading only to realize that if I wanted a guide to writing I would rather pick up George Orwell's \\"Politics and the English Language\\", rather than a running based memoir.     What was most surprising about this memoir was the style of writing. At times I felt as if I was sneaking a peek into the diary of a high school student. For a talented and acclaimed author, I expected a higher level of sophistication, especially when describing his emotions. Not until the last 1/3 of the memoir did the writing attract me. I most enjoyed the pieces about the 26 mile run in Greece and the ultramarathon, where Murakami's imagery and personal determination really shined. Overall, there were moments when the writing whisked near something prolific, but most of the time the material undershot and missed the mark.
B0026P3G12|4.0|After listening to Ms. Boyle's new CD several times just in the last two days I must say that this first effort is outstanding. I will defer a bit to many reviewers who only gave it one star by agreeing that some of the songs are a bit slow in tempo and that at least a couple of them could have been better produced. Indeed, I would have left them off altogether. However, for the most part, this is an amazing singer who's interpretation of previously recorded songs exceeds the originals, at least in my view. And that's very rare. (I just hope she has the good sense to leave Patsy Cline alone.) Her cover of \\"Cry Me A River\\" is among the best I've heard and is superbly produced. In fact, I would love for her to do a cover album of 1940 and 50's standards similar to Linda Ronstadt's 1983 album \\"What's New.\\"    This CD, produced only 6 months after her appearence on British TV, is a well done attempt to satisfy the appetites of millions of ravenous fans. Considering the rush to make that happen I think everyone involved did a wonderful job. I'm very pleased and can't wait for more of Ms. Boyle!

B000UBMWG4|5.0|.. it's the film that started it all! A classic Philip K. Dick novel immortalized by some of the best creative minds in the business at the time. A good portion of credit for this film needs to also go to Jordan Scott Cronenweth (cinematographer/DOP) who not only crafted the visual spaces and scenes, but also created a timeless template for generations of filmmakers showing them \\"this is how it's done\\". Created well before the advent of GUI's and mega-budgets this film stands alone as one of the best Sci-Fi's of all time. The complex blend of visual textures mixed with an expansive multi-layered soundtrack subjectively transplant the audience to another time and place, a feat only a handful of films in this genre have ever managed to accomplish. There's a good reason this film comes in a 5 disc set -- enjoy every one of them.. :)

B000BB1MI2|5.0|\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" (2005) is a fantasy world created by director Tim Burton who has done some off-the-wall movie work. It stars Johnny Depp, lipstick and all, as an androgynous Michael Jackson lookalike. He's playing Willie Wonka, the owner of a candy factory that no longer employs any local people.<br /> Charlie, the title character, has a grandfather who formerly worked in the plant. Willie offers five prize certificates in his candy bars. That way he sells a lot of candy. The lucky five finders of the coupon will receive a tour of the factory accompanied by one companion, and one of the five will get a special gift.<br />Five kids find the prizes, nice kid Charlie and four awful, nasty, despicable brats, rotten little twirps who each gets his or her comeuppance while touring the factory.<br />The wild colors in the factory with its rivers and waterfalls of chocolate are more vivid and startling when seen on in a high definition television screen with a Blu-Ray machine.<br />Are we in a candy factory or a nut house? One actor, Deep Roy, plays all of the hundreds of the Oompa-Loompa tribe that works in the factory. The Oompa-Loompas perform musical numbers, which are like Busby Berkley gone to cuckooland.<br />At times it's a sweet story of a sweets factory, at times is cloyingly sweet, and at other times Johnny Depp plays a cruelly misanthropic and nasty person. He doesn't like kids. He plays a real weirdo.<br />There are some Dickensian touches: Charlie's four pleasant, kindly grandparents spend their time lying in interlocking beds facing each other in front of the fireplace. Charlie and his wonderful loving family live in their ramshackled tipsy house with holes in the roof. It's based upon a famous Roald Dahl children's story and was a movie previously with Gene Wilder.

B000F1IQN2|5.0|\\"Munich\\" (2005) is a powerful, well-acted, very suspenseful film by Steven Spielberg about retribution and the stressful toll it can exact on those practicing it. In 1972 at the Munich Olympics eleven Israeli athletes were brutally slaughtered by eight Palestinian terrorists. Israel in retaliation began a campaign to hunt down and kill the eleven people who were believed to have planned the attack. As a result of the Israeli plan hundreds may have died in retaliatory actions.<br />In the final scenes of the movie two characters are talking, and in the background can be seen standing proudly the World Trade Center before the horrific attack of September 11, 2001. After that event the United States began a campaign of retribution that caused the deaths of thousands, and as of yet the masterminds of the attack have not been found or punished.<br />The movie deals with the grim realities of the Munich tragedy and its aftermath. Golda Meier, the Israeli prime minister, selects one man, Avner (actor Eric Bana) to head a five man team to kill the responsible parties. The movie painstakingly traces the team's attempts to kill off the planners. Each member of the team comes across as a real person, each brave and resourceful. Daniel Craig portrays one of the team members.<br />Avner is a decent man whose conscience gets to him: he cracks under the stress because of the moral dilemma he's been encased in. He's haunted by the blood bath unleashed in Munich and the retaliation under his leadership.<br />From the standpoint of being a thriller, this is an extremely well-developed film aside from its moral and political implications. The masterful sense of timing, the cinematography, the characterization, the casting, the narrative velocity, the intensity of the action - all contribute to catch your attention and hold it. The scenes of the hostage-taking and the brutal airport violence, like newsreel footage, are not shown all at once. They come at you at different times in the movie making it a gripping experience.<br />John Le Carre and Graham Greene in their thrillers almost always dealt with the moral dimension of the situation, and this move is powerful because it is much more than a thriller; it deals with the moral consequences of actions and reactions.a gripping experience.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|Paranormal Activity is a movie that play's on the viewer's fears and pushes the imagination over the edge. While I was watching this movie it was impossible not to think about sleeping alone with only the sounds of the night around me. I remembered those times where things felt...off. Time when I would wake up in the middle of the night with a strange feeling of being watched or footsteps in the hallway. Is it ghosts? Maybe. Am I the victim of my own imagination? Most likely. All I know is all of those things were in the mix as I found myself in Katie's and Micha's haunted home.     Paranormal Activity begins innocently enough with Micha purchasing a video camera to try to catch the strange disturbances in their home. On their first night they set camera up they catch their bedroom door moving on it's own. Micha feeling that he is onto something unique continues to interact with the demon despite a clear warning that to do so would be very dangerous.     As the night's go on the haunting become more malicious and more terrifying as it eventually gains enough power to haunt the couple during the day as well as the night. Each new attack continues to break down Katie and Micha. With each new attack I felt my own sense of dread rise. I began to fear the inevitable moment where the clock on the camera would slow and the demon made its next attack. I could feel the frustration and exhaustion from a lack of sleep and the sense of futility as their house became their prison and the eventual realization that there was nothing they could do stop what they had unleashed.     The use of the handheld camera was excellent as it seemed to reduce the line between movie and reality. Like the movie Cloverfield expert use of the handheld camera can heighten the viewing experience and brings the viewer into a nightmarish reality.     Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who is in tune enough to their surroundings and often wonders or worries about the things that go bump in the night.
0545123267|5.0|I recieved this book as a birthday gift over Christmas break and from the moment I opened it I could not stop reading. It has that same hook-you-from-page-1 quality that the Twilight books had. I read the entire book in a day and was still wanting more. I thought the author did a great job with the setting and plot. You just wanted to root for Sam and Grace. I would recommend this book everyone!!!
B001F12J3Y|1.0|We already had the DVD version of this movie and the kids love it. My now 16 year old daughter insists that we watch this movie before everyone goes to bed every Christmas eve, so it is now a family tradition. We were very excited about the blu-ray 3D version and bout it when it came out last Christmas.     What a rip off! The blue and red lens glasses are a joke. No matter how much you increase the brightness and contrast of the 1080p HDTV, the images are blurred and doubled. The red lense is so dark you can barely see any light through it at all, even looking directly at a 100W light bulb. The high price for this extremely poor quality product is purely criminal and should be illegal; and would be if this country still had the false advertising laws we had when I was a kid.    I noticed that Amazon has grouped together all reviews for The Polar Express; the movie itself, the DVD, the regular 2D blu-ray, and this lousy 3D version. This practice hides the true rating of this poor product and on first glance would indicate there are 392 five star ratings for the Blu-ray 3D Polar Express. This is false advertising in itself and shame on Amazon for this unethical practice. There are actually ZERO four and five star ratings for this product! To all who are contemplating buying this trash product, don't waste your money. Buy the staight 2D blu-ray or DVD versions. The movie itself is wonderful.
B001QOGY9K|5.0|After movies like Bolt, and sitcom \\"gold (rolls eyes)\\" like Hannah Monterrible, Wizards, and the Jo Bros, I had almost lost hope for Disney. But now there is hope, and this movie is proof of it! The Princess and the Frog is awesome!    The Story: The story is a very good twist on the fairy tale \\"The Frog Prince\\". The story is about a waitress named Tiana who is a workaholic trying to raise money to open a restaraunt, a dream of her father's that never happened. But at a costume ball, she finds out that someone else placed a bid on the restaraunt and she has until the following day to outbid him. Desperate, she wishes on a star for a miracle....and meets Prince Naveen who was turned into a frog by the villian Dr. Faciller. When he offers money if she kisses him, Tiana kisses him and gets turned into a frog herself. Together, they travel through the bayou in order to break the spell. The story is great, and the character's development through the story is nice and smooth. It's a great musical love story that is just as great as Beauty and the Beast (my favorite Disney movie). There are also great morals. This story never got boring or slow and while it wasn't LOL, it did make me laugh at parts.    The Characters: All the characters were either good or great, none were annoying. But I want to talk about two: Ray and Louis. Ray is the hillbilly like firefly. Now, I thought I was going to be annoyed by this character, especially when in the trailers, he says \\"Don't make me light my butt!\\" and \\"Just follow the bouncing butt!\\". I thought, great! Another Mater (Cars, Pixar). But I was wrong. Ray is a sweet character, not just a silly sidekick that is there to entertain the kiddies and make problems for the characters. He even helps the two main characters fall in love. Remember the ballroom scene from BatB? Well there's a scene similar to this where Ray sings \\"Ma Belle Evangelline\\" while Naveen and Tiana dance. This scene is beautifully done, and Ray's song is beautifully sung. Ray is definitely a character you will grow to love.    The other character I want to talk about is Louis the alligator. I also thought he would be annoying. He wasn't annoying, but he did seem kind of unneeded. He didn't really do much throughout the film. However, his trumpet solos were beautiful. Louis is a good character, but I think the film could have done without him.    The Animation: Yes! The 2D animation is back! The animation is beautiful, and you know that someone actually drew it, not just doing it on a computer. The 2D animation adds just a little bit more magic to it all, and it is fantastic!    The Music: Oh my god, finally some real Disney music, not just HM or the Jo Bros singing! I've seen all the Disney animated musicals, and this is just another great one. The music will get stuck in your head, but you won't care because it is just so great! I got the soundtrack for Christmas, and I listen to it almost everyday.    The Cons: Everything in this movie was awesome, however I was surprised at how dark it was. There was witchcraft, voodoo, and a graveyard scene that could really freak little kids out. I was sitting in a theater with the sound system turned up, and there were times where I felt just a tiny bit scared. Parents with little kids should make sure they can handle it. But my little 7 year old cousin watched this, and she loved it. The \\"scary\\" scenes didn't really bother her. It just depends on if you think your kids can handle it.    Overall: This movie was great! I loved it, and I hope the future Disney movies are like this. The future looks bright people!
B000ZELISO|3.0|I bought this for my daughters for Christmas. They are dyed in the wool Harry Potter fans. My older daughter has read the books twice and the younger one finished the last one last May. That being said I will review their reaction to both the movie and the product, since Amazon insists on combining the actual movie content and multiple product format reviews.    BD Live - Blu-ray disc review: I have read the negative product reviews for this disc complaining about the verticle lines running across the screen. We didn't observe any of this in the copy we received. After reading about the problem I went back and played it again to see if I missed something. Our copy is crisp and clear, everything you would expect from Blu-ray. I noted that the originator of one of these negative reviews provided a subsequent comment that Warner Brothers promptly replaced her disc with a good one, so this must have been a batch problem. We were just lucky I guess. I pre-ordered this disc back in early November at a great price of $15.99. It arrived in plenty of time before Chrismas. Well worth the money.    Movie Review: I enjoyed the movie, having never read the books. I thought it was one of the better movies of the series. My daughters also enjoyed it, however they were dissapointed and downright irate at several points when the movie took off on tangents; like substituting the wrong character for certain scenes, leaving out whole sections, and adding entirely new scenes that were not in the book at all. I can sympathize with their frustration. I have never understood why screen writers feel the need to create completely new content scenes for movie adaptations while dropping valid scenes.
B0013FSL3E|2.0|This movie was way overhyped. I don't really get what critics were so amazed by. Yes, the animation is awesome, but everything else is just...bleh.     The first 5 or 6 minutes just have Wall-E and a couple cute visual gags that I just smirked at but overall it was kind of a boring start. When he meets a new robot Eve, it gets a little better, but overall nothing really happens. When they get into space, you see more robots and we find out that all humans are living on a spaceship and everyone is fat. Then we get a small chase scene, a little bit of action, but overall it's very forgetable. The last twenty minutes are the best part. I found my self crying for a character that I hardly cared about (How the heck does Pixar do that?!), and it's a happy ending. But really, other than the last twenty minutes, this movie is very boring and kind of confusing at times. I smiled at a couple gags, but nothing was really LOL funny. Now I know, sometimes you have to have a serious movie that can't really have LOL moments, but there's serious, and there's just plain boring.    Also, this is almost a green movie. Really Pixar? Don't get me wrong, I care about the enviornment, but I'm just tired of all this green stuff getting shoved down our throats.     This is when I started losing intrest in Pixar, and it's next film (Up) is a little better but not by much. Overall, it's worth seeing maybe much, but really if you don't see it, it's not much of a miss. However, the short Burn-E is hilarious! The rental price is worth just seeing that, who cares about the movie.     Burn-E: 5/5    Everything else: 2/5
B002T45VX6|1.0|I'm a big Shakira fan and I've loved her music since I was 9.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I didn't pay attention when I ordered but I was more than happy when I got my Blu-ray Planet Earth set narrated by David Attenborough.

B002RVZV9K|2.0|Judging from all the enthusiastically positive reviews of this film, I thought that there might be some kind of surprising chemistry or musical magic that occurred when these three very different guitarists got together--well, there wasn't much, as it turns out. The bio sketches of these three figures were interesting as separate clips, but the jam session/discussion was REALLY lame. It was just all too contrived. It was funny when Jack White was asked what was going to happen when the three guitarists got together and he answered \\"Probably a fistfight.\\" Not likely, of course, but I expected a fistgight more than seeing the three guitarists sitting together and all three just plain ol' strumming the chords to \\"The Weight.\\" Boring! Any one of them (or any novice guitarist, for that matter) could have handled that. What was the point? That song isn't in any of the three guitarists' reportoire, anyway. Couldn't they come up with some kind of jam that exemplified each of these three guitarists' individual styles? That happened to a slight extent on the \\"In My Time of Dying\\" jam, but overall the jams mostly just had them playing the same thing. And sorry, Edge just looked out of place playing a slide blues song, even if he did a fine job, of course.    And do any of these guys really care about what strings the other guys use? I'm sure none of them could care less, and in fact I think Jack White said that he really couldn't care less about what strings HE uses!    Yeah, this was just a goofy idea to have them sit around together and practically read a script for a discussion. The most fascinating parts of this video were the opening shot of Jack White making a miniature diddley bow, and the rare, very early footage of Page in his pre-Zeppelin days. Edge's soundcheck in the goofy \\"living room\\" was the most interesting part of the documentary in that setting (the \\"discussion\\"), although it was just thrown in as an extra in the Special Features.    Watching Jack White writeand record a song was cool, I guess, but the resulting piece was pretty much a throwaway tune, as I'm sure he would agree. I mean, how inspired are you going to be to write a song when some film director requests it and sticks a camera in your face while you do it?    This was a novel concept of filming this so-called \\"informal\\" dicussion, but it didn't generate anything interesting, IMO. Anything that is so contrived just isn't going to be natural, nor will it result in any real synergistic artistry. OVERHYPED.
0595440096|4.0|There aren't a lot of book premises one can find that are more depressing than taking the journey with a brilliant woman as Alzheimer's claims her brain and her life.  So, I started this with a bit of trepidation wondering if I'd really be inclined to finish it.<br /><br />However, Genova is a good writer. And her approach of telling the tale entirely from Alice's perspective as she discovers, then experiences the increasing effects of Alzheimers, immediately pulled me into the story.  In fact, for me, it was a bit like hopping on a run-away train. You know it's not heading anywhere good, but it was impossible to hop off. As horrible as I found Alice's descent into ever-increasing memory loss and her struggles to cope with it, I didn't want to put it down or stop turning the pages.<br /><br />Of course, the tale does pull at the heartstrings because of the sadness of the situation.  But, fortunately  - it also pulls at them through moments of hope, joy and self-realization found within the struggle. And, I'd challenge anyone to read it and not wonder how you or a loved one would be able to handle this disease.<br /><br />Still, I would have liked and related more to the tale if she had given more depth to characters in Alice's family, and their perspectives. In fact, I think if she had interspersed this book with chapters from the husband's perspective - it would have greatly improved the depth of the tale overall.<br /><br />A favorite line: \\"This disease will not be bargained with. I can't give it the names of the state capitals and keep the memories of my husband.\\"<br /><br />Bottom Line: Well-written, depressing tale of trying to live with Alzheimer that takes you on an engrossing trip to a world you hope you never have to experience.
B002QB1910|5.0|I knew what this album was about..Her troubled times! Most artists make their best music on what they are going through! Which is what makes it heartfelt. It's not her best so far.(my opinion only) But needless to say, very enjoyable to listen to. And again, the beauty of the internet is all about research. Listen to samples on Amazon or even on Youtube. Enjoy the sound before buying the entire cd. So for anyone to have been disappointed in spending even .99 cents :( .... your own disappointment for not investigating what you're buying. take care all music lovers

1906694176|3.0|For the ending of this book alone, it is worth reading. However, while I wish I could say that this book was of the same caliber as that of the prior two books, in my opinion it was not. The book picked up right where the last left off, with Salander in the hospital being treated for her injuries. Blomkvist continues to sleuth on her behalf in order to expose those who have made her life hellish and attempted to frame her for all manner of crimes. Of course, in his spare time he also still manages to attract every woman within a 500-yard-radius like a bee to honey, but I digress. All of the other familiar characters from the prior books return.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot of the book, so I will give a general review. The overall feel of the book to me is that it was the least edited and least considered of the three. This would make sense if Larsson had intended to go back and do some more tweaking and editing before publication, but he was obviously unable to do so after his death. There are entire sections of the book that meander on and on with no apparent purpose with regard to moving the story forward. These sections would have benefited greatly from some serious editorial paring.<br /><br />To me, the plot did not at all move along at the same clip as the prior books. The suspense just wasn't there to the same degree. I recall that I simply could not put down the previous books, but I was nowhere near as riveted by this one. In addition, there were a number of somewhat annoying grammatical errors, sentence fragments, etc.<br /><br />For the good points of the book, the ending (if that is what we can call the last 150-200 pages) is a very nice, tightly written section that ties everything together beautifully. Again, it struck me that perhaps Larsson had written the ending earlier than the rest of book three, as it appeared to be the best-constructed section of the entire book. For the ending alone, this story is worth reading. I wavered between a 3-and 4- star review for this reason. Ultimately, I considered whether the book, standing alone without the other two, would be a 4-star book, and I don't believe that would be the case.<br /><br />As an aside, one minor issue is that on the book cover of the copy I picked up while in Belgium, the first blurb says \\"The Trial\\", as if the book is mostly about Salander's trial itself, which it is not. The trial itself takes up about the last tenth of the book. Whether this type of advertising will occur with the North American edition I don't know, but I write this warning simply so you might know what to expect.<br /><br />In summary, anyone who has read the first two books simply will not be able to deny themselves the final installment, nor should they. Although I did not find the book to hold the same level of suspense and I sometimes found it rather dull, the ending of the book makes it very worthwhile reading. It is a great loss that Mr. Larsson passed away before he could really fine-tune the final book, and before he could write another.for this reason.

I always give cookie boxes as gifts, but how could I produce a delicious, jealousy inspired vegan cookie??  We all know cookies MUST have eggs and REAL butter!  Then my sister gave me this book as a gift.  Skeptical, I choose 9 cookies to bake which included: Lazy Somoas, Peanut Butter Pillows, Grapefruit Icebox Cookies, Chocolate Crinkle Cookies, Chocolate Chip Chai Spice Cookies and Chocolate Dipped Macaroons.    My conclusion:  BEST COOKIES EVER!!  The ingredients needed for these cookies were not really that expensive, hard to find or exotic.  The directions were clear and amazingly accurate!  They made almost exactly how many they said they would (always more, never less when the amount differed) and they cooked for almost exactly the amount of time they said they would need!  The cookies themselves turned out beyond wonderful.  Delicious and beautiful, as if I'd stopped at a high end bakery (and really pretty easy to make, which of course I would never admit to those who will be receiving the cookies as gifts!)    I would honestly say this is the best baking cookbook I own.  The poor thing looks like it's been in my kitchen for 10 years not 1 week!  I can't wait to get their cupcake book!

1594488843|5.0|The surprising fact(?) is: Motivation is best served intrinsically (with a side of french fries)<br /><br />Daniel H. Pink has done it again. He has produced another book that helps us all re-examine our lives. This time he questions: why we are driven to do certain things with our lives and how we can nurture motivation in the right way, as Pink states: to have Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. This book along with his other three books make a quasi-quartet/tetralogy on being and working as a creative/learning individual in the 21st century: [[ASIN:1594482918 The Adventures of Johnny Bunko: The Last Career Guide You'll Ever Need]], [[ASIN:B001TLNI08 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future [WHOLE NEW MIND UPDATED/E  5D]]], and [[ASIN:B002NSLN5I Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself]]. This book is thinly veiled as a marketing/business idea book (a genre I usually do not warm up to). Pink defies this and makes a truly cross genre book, i.e., includes how to motivate your children properly and ethically.<br /><br />While some might be upset with the amount and variety of data behind his science. I believe the author makes this point clear throughout the book. He often states that the information goes deeper and you can go there if you really want. He directs you to the deeper information in various places throughout the book.<br /><br />While the author denies that philosophy exists in this book. It comes through clearly, especially when compared and contrasted with his previous books. Sadly some parts of his philosophy I do not agree with, i.e., everyone becomes very \\"creative\\" once certain motivation factors/stimulus are in place. Other than that, the \\"Otherness\\" of this book is astounding.<br /><br />Another \\"bigger picture\\" area that is touched upon, but not really given a proper example is 21st century organizations [[ASIN:0385517254 The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization]]. Fifth Discipline to put in Pink's elevator pitch terms is so last century. A better example of 21st century organizational art & practice is [[ASIN:1874719764 Ants, Galileo and Gandhi]]: Designing the Future of Business Through Nature, Genius, and Compassion.<br /><br />All in all another exceptional book by Daniel H. Pink!so last century. A better example of 21st century organizational art & practice is [[ASIN:1874719764 Ants, Galileo and Gandhi]]: Designing the Future of Business Through Nature, Genius, and Compassion.    All in all another exceptional book by Daniel H. Pink!

B000T9OP7G|5.0|Honestly, it boggles the mind that this show, which was the highest-rated new scripted series of the 2007-08 television season had only a two season run. It was very good and Fox dropped the ball as far as cancelling it after the second season. Well, as many of you know, this show takes place in between T2 and T3, with the result that T3 never happens given the time travel that the characters on the show do. In T3, Sarah was supposed to die of cancer in 1990s, but since Sarah and the gang jump to 2007, they jump over the year in which Sarah would have died. Sarah, of course, keeps worring that she will still die of cancer and the first season makes it a point for the viewer to remember whose Chronicles these are - not John's. The first season brings back threads from T2, such as showing what happens to Dr. Peter Silberman and bringing back Dyson's widow who, with great reservation, helps Sarah (who hasn't aged a year) continue her fight against Skynet (fearing that more innocent people will die simply for playing a role in constructing Skynet). We finally get to meet Derek Reese, John's uncle. Meanwhile, Sarah finds herself trying to explain the past to Charley. Given a telivision show budget and everything they managed to pack into the writer's strike shortened season of just 9 episodes, it's amazing how good Sarah, John and their terminator protector Cameron look dogging Agent Ellison (an FBI agent is putting everything together) and Cromartie, the terminator on their trail. Recommend.
B002SK2X3C|4.0|Well, this one certainly lived up to the bookshop advertising. Once I started, I really could not bear to put the book down.    At the outset, I must disagree with another review in the WSJ that regarded Larry McDonald's account of his early life as probably being of interest only to his family. Far from being of marginal interest, it provides the reader the essential perspective required to understand  his attitudes to working life and the events he witnessed at Lehman Brothers.  Amazingly, some of the most modest episodes in his early working years later proved pivotal to the main story.    I learned quite a bit about bonds too. Certainly not the most promising topic with which to captivate a reader but the basic technicalities are explained in an earthy, enjoyable way. Also, and crucially for the book's success, this understanding was just enough to make me feel like I was in the driving seat, right there alongside McDonald and his great friend McCarthy, as they pulled off two of the most spectacular trading coups that Lehman Brothers ever had.     This book really sprang some surprises.  One of them was the great passion that drove the bond traders and their support people. No, really. Though the love of making money was all too clear, their passion ran way beyond coarse avarice. Instead, it inclined more to vindication of their value judgements, brought down upon a market governed by irrationality and corporate smokescreens. And the passion was all too believable, as some of their calls needed nerves of steel. It is made clear that short selling, whatever else one thinks about it, is not a risk-free method of making money. For me, the highlight of the book was a spectacular, cathartic outburst by McCarthy during a massive short. This is non-fiction but script writers for Wall Street 2 could do worse than take a few leaves from it.    In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, the feelings of admiration and respect engendered by this book for financial traders and investment bankers, came as the greatest surprise. I really could not help but admire many of the people described, even though it would have been hard to work with a few of them. A picture is painted of fierce cameraderie usually to be found only in the armed forces. According to McDonald, high intelligence, hard-headed realism, and principled, rational motivation were abundant in the middle and senior ranks of Lehman Brothers, and indeed, these virtues were even coupled with modesty in some cases. The main story is one of the increasingly desperate attempts to marshal these qualities and steer a deeply-divided firm away from danger, all of it foreseen well before the GFC.       In telling his story, he does not deny or diffuse our anger but rather, he deflects it toward the executive management on the top floor. Plenty of blood-boiling fuel is provided to confirm our worst prejudices, but McDonald and his colleagues boo and hiss the top dogs on Floor 31 along with the rest of us.     And yet ....and yet ... the praise I have for Larry McDonald's story is tempered by the conflicting emotional directions in which it led me.     First, the book invoked the thrill involved in massive short selling of bonds of a target corporation. The aim is quite cold, calculating and explicit; to make the backside drop out of the bond price, drive the corporation to bankruptcy and then clean up when the bond price falls below liquidation value. This, we are encouraged to think, is the way to establish the true market value of a bond and if the corporation has really been financially imprudent it only has itself to blame for the consequences. Any responsibility for the devastation this can cause to the target's employees is then seen to fall on the corporation's shoulders. McDonald's accounts of these market plays are truly gripping, but they do not encourage the reader to dwell upon the wider consequences.     However, when Lehman Brothers becomes the troubled corporation,the sentiment is quite the opposite. Events unfold like a slow-motion train wreck combined with Greek tragedy, where people, rather than money become the main focus. And McDonald really does feel for the individuals involved. He knew them as personal friends and his sympathy with their plight undoubtedly comes from the heart.    The inconsistency comes dangerously close to hypocrisy. The line taken by McDonald avoids this but only narrowly. Firstly, he does acknowledge that lines on financial charts  no longer appear to him as simply abstract ideas, but as issues with human consequences that he now understands all too well.  Secondly he makes it clear that allowing the collapse of Lehmans solved nothing but instead hurt everyone else world-wide, and unnecessarily so.     And therein lies his final and most important point: the tragedy was not simply that the collapse happened but that it did not have to happen.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Wow!! So I am new to the twilight phenom. I saw the New Moon movie and decided it was worth a read. I downloaded the entire series onto my kindle one week before Christmas and finished the series 2 days before New Years. I got into the first novel, loved the second and thought the third was perfect. It brought everything together and should have been the END!!! Then I started the Breaking Dawn-WTF??? Pregnant? Monster Babies? I mean come on...it just took a dive off a huge cliff in the worst way. Read the first 3, the are an easy great read, but trust me you will just end up throwing this book down saying to yourself this is rediculous. What was Stephanie thinking writing this? It's aweful!!

B002T9H2LA|1.0|2.5 Hours of reading bad, purposeless dialogue. Don't be fooled by the Tarentino fanboys, this is pure garbage on par with Deathproof (at least in that movie you only had to LISTEN to the bad dialogue) This movie is so utterly painful to watch that after viewing you actually feel anger toward friends for not warning you. Of course now you have to read about how you somehow \\"didn't get it\\" or some such by fools thinking they are somehow clever. At this point in time Quentin can do no wrong and his fans will defend this horrible film as they have done in the past. He has now crossed over into the Woody Allen side, films I can't stand but somehow have a huge following.    1-18-10  Watching Quentin's face during the golden globes was great, as the night went on and he went \\"globeless\\" I laughed my freakin a$$ off. He has become so egotistical because of all these pretentious smug idiots calling him brilliant. The Main nazi was the only winner. QT thought he would walk away with an arm load of trophies, DENIED! Hope he enjoyed the \\"swag bag\\" maybe he can get a Tony for books on DVD!    3-8-10  Sorry QT, no Oscars for you either. Thank god I don't have to hear anymore hype for this dull POS of a film. I don't really care for award shows but I was rooting against this overhyped falsely advertised \\"movie\\"
0307269752|1.0|From this Librarian's post at [...]<br /><br />This was a truly overrated book with thin female characters, a flat largely unlikable male lead, an intriguing mystery that derailed into cliche and an ending that redefines anticlimactic!<br /><br />The titular and most interesting character is defanged in the end of the book and subjected to a gratuitious and violent subplot...<br /><br />There is a good story in search of better writing and rounder characters and an editor. I only read this becausemy wife had to for a book group... we both agreed it was way too long and the payoff was weak... plus the story didn't takeoff until halfway through...<br /><br />Try Follett or Archer for more intriguing drama epics, or early Grisham for  quicker mystery... and those are just a few authors that come to mind initially...<br /><br />Oh and on page 1 I realized it was a translation thanks to some awkward grammar that at times was laughable...<br /><br />I know it's harsh but I call them like I see them... in all fairness I don't read too many \\"adult\\" books...<br /><br />Josh
B0013ND30M|5.0|I first watched Sleeping Beauty years ago in Day Care.  And of course, I must have watched it time and time again with my sister and my cousins.  This Disney movie is based on the classic Brothers Grimm tale, about a princess named Aurora, who under the spell of a wicked witch will \\"prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die.\\"  Fortunately, one of her fairy godmothers revoked the spell, by saying that yes she would prick her finger, but rather than die, she would sleep for one-hundred years without aging one second.  And that she would awake to love's first kiss.  Like Aurora, I have always dreamed of finding true love, and living Happily Ever After.  This is such a wonderful movie.  The scene when Flora, Fauna and Merryweather put the kingdom to sleep before Aurora wakes up, makes me cry every time I watch it.  Make sure to add this first-rate film to your collection, before it goes in the Disney Vault!
B002EEY8LM|4.0|I really love The Warriors! I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13 years old. This version is great.

B001CXWWBE|5.0|I was experiencing a lot of dropped connections between my onboard LAN port on my ASUS motherboard and my DNS-321 NAS.  I wasn't sure if it was the NAS or the NIC at first, so I tried this intel gigabit NIC after reading all the great reviews on another site.  After plugging it into the computer, all files transferred perfectly between my computer and the NAS.  I'm running Windows 7, and the OS recognized the card instantly without the need to install any drivers or software from the CD.  So far everything works great.

159562015X|4.0|I am extremely skeptical of self help books but at a recommendation of a business school prof, I bought this book and took the online strengths finder test.  The results (my 5 key strengths) and the explanations in the book of what they mean and how best to utilise them in my life and career were extremely useful.  As the book explains, your strengths are innate and not learned skills.  They should stay consistent over time whether you are 19 or 50.  You will find that you see yourself (and others) differently and have a better perspective on why you approach certain situations in one manner but others approach it differently.  If you have ever done Meyers Briggs or other personality tests and really felt like the results were speaking to you, this is similar.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Similar to Brown's other books in the weaving of historical facts and secret society tid-bits into a fast-moving storyline. Living close to DC with family members in the Masons, found this book to be particularly interesting. Even though Brown's books are fast easy reads, they typically contain some profound and provocative thoughts. This book cuts to the heart of religion and the notion of \\"god\\". Found that fascinating and has led to some great discussions.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|I am writing to review the DVD itself not the movie. The movie of its own is very good, and I enjoyed it in the theaters. However, the DVD is a waste of money. There is nothing in the way of special features or options. There is no real main menu page. There is an alternate ending, but its not even the good alternative ending. It is totally unworth it. There were several endings shot for this movie and they decided to put the weakest of them as the alternate ending. There are much better versions that could have been added. Had they wanted to really expand this DVD, they could have. Instead they wanted to make a buck, and release this ASAP. Look at the Blair Witch DVD. We all know that its a fake movie, however the film is loaded with special features that keep pretending it really happened and it adds to the whole feel of the movie. For this DVD, there were infinite options for features beyond the movie. There are none. Everyone knows it is fake by now (hopefully) and its is also revealed that there is an alternate ending, why not go balls to the wall and do more?   If you love this movie, get it. Don't buy the blue ray, totally not worth it. But rent it first. It does not hold the power that it did on the big screen
9113020730|4.0|This is the third and almost certainly final novel in Steig Larsson's remarkable Millenium Trilogy.  This much anticipated book will not disappoint Larsson's fan base.  Volume 3 brings Larsson's complex and intricate plot to a satisfactory conclusion, tying together the threads and complications from the previous two novels.  It builds and fills out the principal characters and through a skilful mix of fiction and fact explains, exposes and explodes Sweden's defence and intelligence apparatus as well as its smug and complacent society.<br /><br />The Millenium trilogy is written to be read as a whole.  The plot is built steadily, layer by layer and unpicked methodically in the same manner.  Volume 1 gave us Millenium Publishing and the crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist.  It introduced Blomkvist's strange, reliant relationship with the key protagonist, the unlovely, unlikeable, unorthodox and intellectually unique Lisa Salander.<br /><br />Volume 2 developed and rounded out (if that is the right phrase for Larsson's short, anorexic heroine) Salander, exposing the contradictions and complexities of her character and ended leaving her wounded, probably fatally, from a bullet in the brain fired by her vengeful father.<br /><br />Volumes 1 and 2 were masterful crime fiction books, each capable of being read on its own and not necessarily in sequence.  In fact Volume 2 was arguably the better book, with its stronger and more engaging plot line.  It put necessary meat on Lisa Salander's thin bones and made the reader fear with her, not just for her.<br /><br />The Girl who kicked the Hornet's Nest is Larsson's compromise and it lacks both the tension and the deep plausibility of volumes 1 and 2.  While it is a necessary and highly enjoyable read it cannot and does not stand on its own.<br /><br />Volume 3 continues in Larsson's dense, detailed style.  We learn more about modern Swedish life and locations.  The principal players remain in character and their life journeys entwine and unwind satisfactorily.  We can identify with them from start to finish.  The bit players are treated with greater abandon.  They march on, perform and disappear.  Similar people, similar names, similar functions, similar fates.  But the story is not about its bit parts.  It is, as it always was, about Millenium, about Salander, about Blomkvist and about the place and importance of crusading journalism.  It is also about a society that in its complacency and its indifference is in danger of letting the un-elected take over its democracy.<br /><br />Do read The Girl who kicked the Hornet's Nest.  If you have read Volumes 1 and 2, you will not be disappointed.  But you will be sad that Larsson will write no more about Millenium, Salander and Blomkvist.We can identify with them from start to finish.  The bit players are treated with greater abandon.

B002QGUFWE|4.0|Five stars for The Fame Monster EP, three for The Fame (she really came into her own on the EP; The Fame has a lot of filler songs). No stars for the censored music! Don't buy into the amazon disclaimer that \\"any apparent edits on this release are intentional and part of the final mix,\\" because an uncensored version of the album was just released in Australia. And the awful word that they chose to censor (and censor, and censor)? BITCH! Like the one hit wonder song from the 90's, or \\"it's Britney bitch,\\" etc. Those songs were on the radio and weren't censored. Why would they repeatedly censor that word on an album that people are paying money for to listen to in their own homes? And why would they only release a censored version of the album and play it off like it's intentional? I would have never purchased this album if I knew it was censored. It bugs me every time I hear those songs. \\"I'm a free bit!\\" Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Hoping that this issue is somehow resolved, though I'm not holding my breath.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Great music which fits beautifully with the movie.  It might not be mainstream, but to me, that's the best thing about it.  Give this cd a chance!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is a great, funny, and intelligent show. The casting was perfect. It is rare that I like comedies; I prefer dramas. However, this show is intellectually stimulating. There are so many jokes that you have to be well-educated to understand, but yet the show is not over-the-top that way. I would recommend this show to anyone who wants a good laugh with a complex finish.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I rented this movie from my local library since I had nothing to do. From the moment I started it I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching it. When I saw I was about an hour and a half into the movie, I thought \\"oh no it's almost over\\", but then I saw it was 3 hours. I couldn't  have rented a better movie. Told all my friends and am now purchasing it from Amazon. Why amazon? Because word has gotten out how great this movie is and no other store has it in stock. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has read Pride and Prejudice and perhaps thought it too \\"stuffy\\". This movie is far from stuffy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Simply and completely amazing. My best friend and I have read both this and the survival guide Max Brooks wrote. At first I didn't think this one would keep up with the previous book, and then i started reading the book. I was practically hypnotized by it until the end. My friend called me a few hours after I was done, because he had finished as well, screaming his head off about how great it was. I could only agree with him and add even more to his praises. World War Z has to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. Brooks simulates almost perfectly a military debriefing of the war against the undead. It had me almost believing that I was there and that it actually happened. I was engrossed in the read the entire time. You don't have to be a zombie book or movie buff to enjoy this book. I am not, but I completely fell in love with this one, and I am not ashamed to say it.

B001P06GX4|5.0|This was a \\"Santa\\" gift to our family.  I have spent almost every day playing this (one-on-one), with my two boys ages 12 and 13.  When one of them mentions being bored - I grab Blokus!  My 13 year old learned real quick how to block mom and hog up the board for the win.  (laughing)  I loved seeing his brain at work and how he couldn't wait for me to finish my turn as he was already prepared for his next move.  My 12 year old tried to cover one corner of the board quickly from the start and learned real quick that that was not a good strategy as mom easily blocked him from doing more.  We haven't played this as a family yet due to my husband's busiest time at work but we plan on playing it on New Year's Eve.  You can also play this by yourself which is something I have yet to try but will since I'm a puzzle person.<br /><br />This is educational due to the strategy involved.  It's great for the brain to be actively involved in puzzle games.<br /><br />Fun Game! Worth the price!

0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol has its own special place in my Dan Brown 'Favorites' list.  I'm a huge Dan Brown fan, and yet have mixed thoughts about The Lost Symbol.  I started this book, like a lot of people, with enormous anticipation.  I'm ranking this book #2 on my Dan Brown list - behind Angels & Demons, for a couple of reasons.  I was not able to read the Lost Symbol is large quantities, like I did Angels & Demons.  A couple chapters here, a couple chapters there...it took me three months to get to page 250.  That being said, I didn't find the first half of the book to be the page turner I expected.  However, because of some down time around the holidays, I was able to read the second half of the book in two days.  I really enjoyed the second half and was unable to put it down!<br /><br />The LS met my Dan Brown intelligent writing expectation with another religion/science/secret brotherhood story.  The Lost Symbol was well researched and written in an interesting style that keeps your attention and keeps you wanting more.  I give the book four stars and recommend to anyone who is intrigued by technology, religion and secret societies.
0316069906|5.0|\\"I'm not better than anyone, and I'm not trying to convince people to live by my standards of what's right. I'm trying to convince them to live by their own.\\" -p.114     This book ought to be read by everyone. It is probably the most read-able (and at times, very funny) book about the meat industry yet written, and on one of the most important subjects of our time. In the days of global warming awareness and healthcare debacles, people cannot afford not to know what is in this book.     I was drawn to buy this book because of its stellar reviews, but I half-expected it to be a regurgitation of other animal rights literature I've read over the course of my 13 years as a vegetarian. Some of the book, by necessity, is just that: a narrative-style compilation of fact-sheets long waved around by PETA and the HSUS, and a whopping 60 pages of footnotes at the back to show for it. But the book goes beyond the gruesome facts of factory farming to explore questions of why facts alone are not convincing when it comes to food, why we eat what we eat, and what options are on the table.     The book is clearly targeted at a multitude of audiences, so it's more accessible than most animal rights books. Readers who have never even heard of a CAFO before will get a lesson on the truth of meat processing. Readers who know in the back of their minds that the meat industry is awful but choose not to acknowledge it will get a profound moral dilemma. Sworn vegetarians will get a sense of direction and an effective platform. There are many different ideas to grab from this book, and as Foer himself pointed out: You may not agree with all of his conclusions, but you can't argue that this discussion isn't worth having.     The greatest credit to \\"Eating Animals\\" is that it's simultaneously sympathetic and unapologetic. Foer does not demonize meat-eaters, and he has deep respect for several meat farmers he meets along his research. At the same time, he does not toy with moral ambiguities oroffer a nice (but futile) easy way out as Michael Pollan does. Foer says unequivocally: This is wrong, and you have a decision to make, and it's going to be hard. There is no such thing as an innocent bystander. \\"Not responding is a response--we are equally responsible for what we don't do. In the case of animal slaughter, to throw your hands in the air is to wrap your fingers around a knife handle.\\" (226

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Okay, so I had only seen a few episodes before I bought this set as a gift for my sister. I liked what I had seen but have now actually sat down and watched 3 episodes so far and I'm hooked! lol..only thing I don't like about the show is all the nudity/sex scenes. There seems to be quite a lot of them, so if that is something that bothers you whenever you watch shows then this definitely isn't an item for you! :P Other than that, I still like the Twilight series, but this show portrays vampires in a more realistic way than on those movies.
B000063WDH|4.0|Great raw punchy Blues and R&B cuts. Old school recording style only enhances the sound these guys create. As far as I know nobody is recording stuff like this other than the Black Keys today. They have turned back the clock magically and will probably convert a new generation of blues fans.
B002MRRRAA|5.0|This is a great set-list.  The band sounds at their best, although you can see some stress between the band members. They even end the show in their trade-mark ways.  Fun to re-live what a nirvana live show was all about.  I miss them.
B002JTHFV2|5.0|\\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" is U2's best album and is a sonic ambient trance masterpiece. 25 years ago the boys from Dublin, aided by the magical production talents of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois created one of the most remarkable recordings in rock history, including \\"Bad\\" - the best song of all time.    An impressionistic sonic landscape textured with transcendent chords of ringing infinite guitars, emotional howls of holy hell, and chthonic rhythms that plant the whole glorious cathedral firmly in the earth.    \\"And you hunger for the time  Time to heal, desire, time  And your earth moves beneath  Your own dream landscape.\\"    Indeed.

B002P5XXR0|4.0|I loved this movie, and the soundtrack was everything it should be while it was backing up the visuals.  Horner is very good like that - his soundtracks never overpower the story.<br /><br />Standing alone as a soundtrack, much of this is really good, as you'd expect.  Very dramatic.<br /><br />Really the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that certain parts of the soundtrack sound like Horner is just sampling from stuff he's done before.  There are a couple of Titanic moments, some Braveheart moments, and in \\"The Destruction of Hometree\\" there are a couple of \\"Mask of Zorro\\" pieces - not reminiscent of, but taken directly from - that I find very jarring.<br /><br />Still a good one to have in the collection, though, I think.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book was surprisingly entertaining.  I had read one of her other books and found it to be dull, cheesy, and not too funny.  But thid one was different. Emma, the main character, is crazy, sincere and has odd secrets like every woman.  It is a great, fun book!
0060254920|5.0|I`m very happy with the copy of this book.  I bought it for a Christmas present for my daughter.  It`s wonderfully illustrated.  Reading this book with my daughter brought back a lot of wonderful memories to me from reading it as a child.
B001ECQ6PG|4.0|Nice little portable so far.  I have had issues with slightly warped records rubbing on the support pads unevenly as the record turns, and this results in slight pitch and speed issues.  But this is a portable and not really meant for serious use, so I can't complain too much.    The thing is pretty light weight, and worked out of the box.  Definitely happy with it so far.
B002QZKK6Q|5.0|This is easily one of the best album of the year.  I too heard of them through NPR All Songs considered.  Then I watched the \\"Tiny Desk Concert\\"  They seem to have great energy and chemistry.  I missed out on their last round of touring.  I hope they come back to the US soon.  Dreamy, idle, good sounds.  A little beirut, a little brit-folk, all musical goodness.
B002Q9MZF6|1.0|There are a few pieces that have been written thoughtout the ages that manage to transend typicall expectations and, through the creative team's art and brilliance create raised standards for all who follow in the given genre.  I have firmly believed that Pucchini's \\"La Boheme falls into that category.    However, what I saw broadcast was a tired bus and truck version of a masterpiece.  Provided one closed one's eyes, much of the singing was more that satisfactory, but the performances, and at times the casting was so horribly intrusive as to cut the heart out of the piece, and opera verismo without heart can find no part or reason for existence.  I could nit-pick over various issues that never should have occurred (I guess the team working on the film couldn't bother reading the actually libretto, thus we wind up with Mimi living below Rudolpho, or introducing her before her lite-motif or for reasons I cannot fathom, the subtitles distorted to the translator's idea of \\"well, that's what he WOULD have meant\\"  Pish-tosh.  Cafe Momus was suddenly upgraded to Maxine's for no discernable reason, other than I guess the set-designer thought it looked good.  Enough has been said about the bad lip-synking which is always totally distracting.  The \\"acting\\" generally stayed in the field of bad melodrama - a style of performing Puccini tried to move beyond with the Verismo form, but I guess the production team knew better.  I recall one particular horror where there was a double shot of Mimi during her first act Aria (Si, Mi Chiamino Mimi) where her hands were in front of her mouth on the closeup- but on a hand-banister for the middle shot???  Was this an indication of Schitzofrenic behavior or bad first year editing???  Don't get me wrong - I am by know means a rabbid traditionalist, but poor, or unsupported arbitrary choices only succeed in confusing and losing the audience and I for one, found myself quite lost, confused, and ultimately disappointed in so many unnecessary,shoddy and inexplicable choices.  I finally had to pull out the old Theresa Status tape to get rebalanced.  Between \\"Boheme, The Movie\\" and the Met's production of Tosca this year, one can only hope that Puccini is met with appropriate respect in 2010.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I'm a big fan of Muse but wasn't sure about getting a DVD of a live performance, since sometimes they're not as good as studio recordings.  Well, in this case, Muse goes all out and puts on a show that grabs you by the throat in the first moments and doesn't let you go until the very end.  There's not a dull moment in the entire concert, and the tracks are all outstanding.     The quality of the video transfer is excellent, with superior clarity and color that's much better than what you'd expect on a DVD (compared to Blu-Ray, which isn't available).  Some reviewers have complained about the quick cuts in the editing, but I liked it and felt it was consistent with the way the show was put together.  The same thing is true of the shots of the crowd, which I don't usually care for, but in this case, it added to the realism and the excitement.  So I give it a score of 10 out of 10 for video quality and a visually appealing show.    I listened to the DTS track the first time and felt that the bass was overdone and the instruments overwhelmed the vocals, at least on my system.  I also felt that there was too much echo or reverberation. I think maybe they wanted to duplicate the sound you'd have heard if you'd been there, which it probably does, so by all means give it a try, and then compare it to the PCM stereo track. I tried various adjustments but was unable to get a good balance with the DTS track. I ended up listening to the PCM stereo track instead, channeling the sound through all 5 of my speakers, and I was much more satisfied with the balance and the overall sound listening to it that way.  For audio, I give it a 9 out of 10, just because I'm not sure what to think about the whole DTS thing.    Overall, this is one of the best live performances I've seen on a DVD, and definitely one that I'll watch and listen to many times.     The CD is also outstanding, though I agree with those who have said they wished that \\"Plug In Baby\\" had been included on the CD.  Havingsaid that, it hardly seems fair to complain since they managed to get almost 72 minutes on the CD.  The sound is much better than many live CDs, with good balance, clear vocals, and without excessive crowd noise.  You hear the crowd but they don't overpower the music.      So, this package offers both a video and audio reproduction of a high-energy, well-produced show that ranks with the best live performances by any band, ever.
B002VECM6I|5.0|Great movie, great story, great ending...go see this with family, friends or by yourself you will not be disappointed.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is large triple decker hamburger, oozing with cheese, the kind of thing you know has no redeeming value, but you can't stop ravenously inhaling it until it is gone because it goes down so easy.  First, let me preface this review with my admitted bias...I LOVE ALL THING STEPHEN KING.  (For the most part...the regulators and the books written around that time were not my favorite.)  But, the Long Walk was written during a time he was using the Pseudonym Richard Bachman...he wrote Thinner, this book and a couple others before he was \\"outed.\\"   The Long Walk is based on an interesting premise.  Set in a not too distance, unspecified future of the United States, 100 young men are \\"given the opportunity\\" to apply for a competition called the Long Walk.  All 100 start walking on a predetermined route, and the prize is won by the last boy still standing and alive.  Walkers are given strikes for not walking fast enough or stopping...and if they get 4 strikes, they are shot and killed by the accompanying soldiers.  The main protagonist, Garraty, is telling the story from his perspective.   And the roadside kill nature of this book makes it difficult to put down.  I know that this surprised me years ago when I first read it, and it surprised me again when I read again recently.  For some reason, it reminds me of that Shirley Jackson short story about the town that periodically picks colored balls from a bag, and stones to death the one who picks the black ball.  The future of the US is grey and hazy, but it is an alternative one.  There are vague references to the Colonel in the story being of charge of jack boot enforders...and different outcomes to wars or invasions.  But for me, that was all just distraction from the main thing...could I survive?  What if I had to walk for three days straight???    This is a quick read, but you will rememeber it forever.

0061537969|5.0|Being a dog owner I couldn't help but love The Art of Racing in the Rain.  I often wonder just what our beagle is thinking and make up scenarios for her.  Enzo confirmed that dogs are reacting to situations just as I thought. The end was a three tissue ending but I loved every minute of it whether happy or sad.  I even sugggested that my husband read it although he is not a fiction fan.  He is just taken with Enzo and is thoroughly enjoying it too.  Must be darn good to win over a non fiction lover.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This is a worthwhile read for anyone who wants to understand how the intellectual edges of society function, and to get a good dose of reality to dissipate the thought that everything in life is based solely on innate ability. Gladwell does well to pay tribute to the fundamental needs of ability, but also demonstrates how luck and timing play a significant role to unlock the abilities of those on the fringe that make the difference between world wide success and being just another Joe.
0385504225|1.0|We waited three or four years for Dan Brown to follow up The Da Vinci Code. He should have quit while he was ahead, reputation relatively intact.  This book is so bad, I feel cheated.  Time to go into retirement, Dan. Have fun investing your fortune, travel the world, join a monastic order or whatever turns you on. But please, no more of this rubbish.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|4.2 stars<br /><br />There are many things to love about this movie, especially the genre-bending. I liked how we gain sympathy for the aliens, and how well District 9 was shot. The technology is quite convincing, the characters interesting--especially the well-played lead--and overall I thought this was almost a truly classic film.<br /><br />But, I just couldn't get by the (to me) excessive gore and violence in the early going. It jarred me too much and while it did create some sympathy and antipathy as planned, it also turned me off somewhat. This became clearest towards the middle of the film when we start to really get in the aliens' heads and feel for them, at which point I realized how numb the early gore had made me.<br /><br />Other than that, I thought this was a very intelligent, engrossing movie that transcended its genre nicely at various points. Jackson's involvement clearly brings world-class visual effects and feel, and that's a major plus. The blu-ray version is fine looking, quite realistic indeed. Take away some of the blood and guts and this might be almost Star Wars-quality, and a great movie for kids as well as sci-fi fans. As it stands, it's still excellent, but with caveats.
B0029LHW68|4.0|Right off the bat let me just say, the choir is a nice touch. I have always enjoyed listening to 30 seconds, i have since thier first LP. Every song on here is a wonderful musical journey through the mind of Mr. Leto. Im a sucker for electonical sounds to begin with so listening to this album was like ever so slowly opening a christmas gift. Climaxing for me on song number eleven, a wonderful industrial sounding track. Giving me just a little flash of N.I.N or Stabbing Westward. So short but sweet.... I recommend for fans of 30 seconds or something non mainstream.
B001EIOOWC|4.0|Beautifully shot and tightly scripted, Eastern Promises is both brutal and touching. Cronenberg shows that he's matured immensely and presents a truly solid, almost flawless crime flick with many emotional overtones. Mortenson is tremendous, showing little but revealing much.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the script, not one cheesy line in the movie, and the plot moves organically towards a satisfying finale. The over-ballyhooed nude shower scene is notable not for Viggo's hanging wang as for the stark realism of the violence, which is all too realistic. Too much so for my taste, but I've always found Cronenberg overly violent and squirm-inducing; remember Shivers and Videodrome?<br /><br />In any case, this is his finest outing on most every front, and he's really learned to handle actors and get their best work. Watts is also excellent, as is Stahl (a very fine performer indeed in almost all he does). Shore's score is very fine, but you can hear echoes of LOTR and I almost expected orcs to come jumping out of a closet at various points.<br /><br />Not recommended for kids or those who can't stomach occasional very graphic violence, EP is very much recommended for movie lovers who appreciate tight, edgy crime thrillers.
0810983915|5.0|\\"The harvest is past,<br />The summer is ended,<br />And we are not saved!\\" -- Jeremiah 8:20<br /><br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is that rare book that works equally well from many perspectives and at many levels. Here are a few of them:<br /><br />--Humor being poked at unrealistic expectations that will appeal to youngsters<br />--Recollections of summer fancies and foibles from long ago for parents and grandparents<br />--Lessons about what's valuable and what's not<br />--Humor that doesn't telegraph where it's going so you are excited while waiting for the punch line<br />--Insights into the different values of kids and adults<br />--Perspectives on how moms and sons see the world differently<br />--A sense of how time heals wounds and pain<br /><br />I thought this was the best book in the series so far. I appreciated the timing too; there's snow outside my window and I wouldn't have a good reason to think about summer otherwise.<br /><br />I admire Jeff Kinney for his ability to remember what it was like to be young, but to also express the adult perspective accurately in ways that are enlightening to youngsters rather than demeaning about anyone. There's a lot of love expressed in this book. Bravo!
B002ZXGSWE|1.0|I agree with the other two reviewers, this Stargate is LOST!  I'm a big fan of the SG-1 & Atlantis Stargates, and I keep watching SGU hoping it gets better.  No such luck, the girl on girl love scene was the worst SyFy (sic) I've ever seen.    Then there was the episode \\"TIME\\" they're on a jungle planet, this looks promising, some good story telling maybe? Please?  Then the episode ends with, I'm thinking a cliffhanger, with the second part due for the next week?  No way, the next week is a completely different storyline.  What happened did the writers think we won't notice this stupid writing.  Then the lesbian love scene- yikes!  This is not my kind of science fiction story telling.    Maybe after the mid-season break the real writers will start working on making this Stargate work.
B001OQCV60|5.0|I am a long-time fan of Sherlock Holmes.  I have read every Sherlock Holmes story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  I have followed the Granada Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett.  I have loved it all.    I saw this movie today in the theaters, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!  It left me breathless!!!  It doesn't aim to strictly follow Conan Doyle's portrayal of the characters like the Granada series did.  Nevertheless, the \\"WOW!!\\" factor of this movie was over the top and fantastic! I love how it digs into Holmes' psyche, and how the movie portrays the way his mind works. And Watson and Holmes' friendship/partnership was electrifying on screen.  I am praying for a sequel.  Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law did a fantastic job!
1416594787|5.0|Another totally enchanting, impassioned and enthralling opus from the author of \\"The Selfish Gene\\", \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\", \\"Unweaving the Rainbow\\" and \\"The God Delusion\\". What evolution by non-random natural selection has provided for us to marvel at is indeed truly amazing... I hadn't even heard of the dancing sifaka or the blue-footed booby before! This is Dawkins' personal summary of the evidence that the \\"theory\\" of evolution is actually a fact as incontrovertible as any in science. And what evidence there is!!! A very timely and highly necessary book. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B001SC9G5O|4.0|Nassim Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is about human's inability to gauge randomness and inability to make the distinction between randomness and determinism.    This book is a tough read.  It has a slight academic prose which is a bit abstract.    Not exactly light reading.  The book is in three parts.  Just get through the first part because the second part is a bit more pleasant to read.    Here is my takeaway and highlights:    - makes a compelling explanation why the best of the wall street traders, including MBA's and PhD's, just loose it all during Black Swan events, very significant unexpected events.  - Provides some insight behind the thinking amongst academics.  - Financial news is practically noise.  - Makes an argument that investment managers and traders with the best track records maybe the result of randomness, not skill.      Here is my takeaway.  As the the title implies, people can be fooled by randomness.  People may attribute their or other people's successes with skill, but in fact be a result of luck or randomness.  In an ideal world, the result would be predictable, but with noise or randomness, the result is not longer deterministic.  It is how the human mind handles itself in the presence of randomness.  People either anticipates randomness, expects it, or just forgets it.  The human mind is imperfect.  Even if it recognizes the presence randomness, the mind doesn't always respond to randomness in the most rational way.    This is the kind of book that Malcolm Gladwell would write or read except in a tougher-to-read prose.    I would recommend this book for investors or traders.  If you're not, you might apply some of his ideas to other issues.
B00005MCWZ|4.0|This is Hawkwind's 1970 debut. This album is truely great and truely spooky.<br /><br />What it is is very spacey, early-Floyd tinged rock, full of dark nuances, and sound effects.<br /><br />What it is NOT is the Hawkwind that developed right after this album. The songs here actually seem more composed, recorded carefully as songs and soundscapes. They don't have that driving, monolithic bass pump that Hawk would make their trademark starting on [[ASIN:B00005MCX1 Doremi Fasol Latido]].<br /><br />But this is still terrific freekaziod space rock made by a band who defined the non-commerical end of the genre.<br /><br />This is not the Hawkwind you know, but it is great Hawkwind.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  The topics covered are very intense and at times hard to read about, but it is well worth pressing through.  The story is very inspirational and it is so clever to have the narrator be the main character's dog.  I read the book in one four hour sitting.

I eventually bought it for him, because he was so enthused to get it...I told him to read it 2x so he would understand what he read, and I will get him another one.  He did!  Now he have 4 of them, and I referred it to my friend who has a 10 yr old son, and he read 3 of the books in 4 days.  For boys who really didnt want to read....THEY BOTH LUV IT!

It was especially good for me because I have visited Paris several times and could picture in my mind the different areas of the city.  I thought I had it all figured out but at the end I didn't and was surprised again and again.  I will recommend this book to everyone.  One of my favorites of all time.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|This is my third CD by Buble, and each one is competent, with a few wonderful tracks, and a few I don't care to hear more than once. I expected, once I began buying his releases, to have them in my ears repeatedly, but in the past three years I found I really don't pull his albums off the shelf very often. Sometimes his song choices puzzle me...on this release, I don't know why he wanted to do \\"Cry Me a River\\" which I consider a woman's statement. (I'm old enough to remember, to own and to like Julie London's version from the late 1950's.) My wife, who also likes Buble but sees his imperfections, had a problem with his choice of \\"You're nobody 'till somebody loves you\\" which she has always seen as a bad message, although she understands what the lyricist was going for. Even Michael can't make her like that one. \\"Georgia on my mind\\" has been over-exposed, in my view, and since Ray Charles made it one of his signatures, I fail to see why less soulful singers should even try it. Bottom line: die-hard fans will buy this and like it as much as the rest of his products. Casual fans who buy it may end up saying \\"It's decent, but not outstanding.\\" Thus my three stars.

B0006U6Q7A|5.0|I was hooked from the very start of this wonderful program. The first song is the Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana, being played on solo violin, accompanied by piano. And who is the violinist? It's none other than Lorin Maazel! After I recovered from that, I enjoyed fabulous interpretations of some of the other great orchestral pieces in opera, including rarely heard ballet music from Verdi's Otello. The concert ends with the Libiamo, which is sung by Stefania Bonfadelli, and Roberto Aronica.  What a musical treat!
0812973992|4.0|The historical event of the tightrope walker is a great metaphor for perilous lives of the people below with everyday challenges/despair, even with their feet on the ground.  People need to connect and they try desperately, but in actuality, life appears to be the lonely walk from one end to the other, where walker needs to concentrate on the present step, not the one in the past or the one in the future.  Although there are a couple of turns that are predictable, most of the stories of the characters are so beautifully written and very engaging and provoking both emotions and thoughts that the weight of their existence become tangible.  I highly recommend this book.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|...why did we need to have Spock and Uhura making out on the transporter pad?  I felt that way after seeing it in the theater, and I feel that way even more after watching the DVD.  I don't think any Star Fleet officer would engage in such a public display of affection with another officer, and the fact that it's Spock makes it even less - dare I say it? - logical.  It's the one part of the film where I think the director and writers tried a bit too hard to veer off the well-worn \\"Star Trek\\" path, and it fails mightily to me.  The rest of the film, whatever quibbles some hard-core fans might have with it, was quite enjoyable, I thought.
B0002DB52M|5.0|`Dogville' is one of those films that you really have to see multiple times to really appreciate.  Maybe that is the case with all good films, for no film can really be considered a masterpiece after one solitary viewing (or can they?).  I've seen `Dogville' a number of times, and even though I was quick to laud it after one viewing alone, it has really settled with me as one of the most important and most controversially monumental films of the past decade, maybe even forever, the more I see it.<br /><br />With each frame, director Lars von Trier has captured something so organic and so human it is the epitome of brilliance.<br /><br />Now, I totally understand why people may hate this film, or find it pretentious and `artsy' (I really hate that label).  For me, this is BY FAR von Trier's finest film.  It is visual impacting, morally aggressive and seemingly conflicted in its direction.  The films final moment (where everything comes to a brutal and shocking conclusion) is one of the most visually and mentally exhausting sequences in film this past decade (maybe even forever) and it is for that reason that I feel this film could be labeled confusing or even pointless.  It is far from pointless, but I can see why some may draw that conclusion.  The films pacing and the way in which the film is painted (the stale, almost vacant visual surroundings) can be off-putting to some, especially those belonging to the A.D.D. generation spawned by overindulgence in Michael Bay cinema.  That addressed, it is the pacing and seemingly plain surroundings that add so much depth to the production.  The chalk outlined template used as the basis for the films unraveling has so much meaning and carries with it so much weight.  Sure, it is definitely `artsy', but it is art with a direct and poignant message.<br /><br />Let me just say, labeling a film `artsy' in an attempt to discredit it as `trying to hard' or not really being `entertainment' is a joke when you consider the fact that cinema is an art form used as a way to express the opinions and concerns of the writer/director/actors.<br /><br />`Dogville' tells the story of Grace, a beautiful stranger fleeing gangsters who winds up in the small town of Dogville seeking some sort of solace.  Tom, the towns moral guide, persuades the townsfolk to give Grace a chance, and while they are at once skeptical, they let their guard down and welcome Grace into their lives.  She performs various odd-jobs for the townsfolk and garners their respect and friendship, until they label her costly and decide to take full advantage of her in order to make up for what she `could' cost them in the end.

B00247RVGS|2.0|Ordered this movie.  No where does it say that this item is for Wide Screen and I own regular screen Tv.  I was not looking for the Wide Screen.  If you do not want the Wide Screen version do not order this product from Lilahs
B0029O08WA|2.0|Wasn't impressed with this one at all! To much of the indie artists.Its ok but not as good as the twilight soundtrack! I still haven't tired of that.3 songs on this I even like at all.Waste of good money
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Unless your name is Marty McFly and you have a flux capacitor equipped DeLorean, the 1980's are over.  Face it people...Metallica will never make Master of Puppets 2.  It is 2009 this is Metallica now and the album they made is Death Magnetic, and it ROCKS!!!  Death Magentic is great from start to finish and I believe it is their best work since ...And Justice For All.  I have loved Metallica since I was a kid and this is the album I've been waiting for since 6th grade.  Get this if you are a true thrash fan.      P.S.-  Yes, unlike St. Anger, Lars DOES use a snare drum on this CD.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|If you love seeing Jesus get the hell beat out of him and tortured for hours this is the way to go! Pure black metal in my opinion, I don't see why Christians like watching their savior destroyed... I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is one of my favorite movies. I would advise against watching this unless you hate Jesus.
0385504225|2.0|Although the subject matter was very interesting; the book on a whole was a long winded attempt to give all of the \\"facts\\" with very little character development. Wait for the movie, this one could be  done in 60 minutes or less.
B0002HMQUS|4.0|I've used this monopod and head for about three years now - mostly for shooting kid sports. It's built like a tank, easily supporting my 7D and large lenses (70-200mm f2.8 and 300mm f4.0, often with a 1.4x teleextender added and sometimes a flash unit).    Two dislikes:  1) I wish I'd bought a four-section monopod instead. Collapsed this one is still too long to attach easily to my camera backpack, and it's awkward to pack for travel in a carry-on.  2) I'm not a fan of the swivel tilt head. It's a little hard to attach and detach lenses. And when you tilt to portrait mode, the default position is just a little past 90 degrees. Not a big deal, but you do have to compensate for it (or be more careful to set it at exactly 90).    Overall it's served me well and is an excellent value. However, I'm going to replace it with something more compact and get a more sophisticated head with quick release plates. Of course that will be more $$!
B00112V0E6|5.0|The album was in new condition. It had never been played.  I will check with this seller first next time I want an old album!!
031606792X|1.0|I loved \\"Twilight\\", and found \\"New Moon\\" palatable.  The third book, \\"Eclipse\\" was overbearing, and now this fourth book is down right nauseating.    You can read the other reviews that give away the spoilers, but my annoyance with this book, and the series overall with the exception of \\"Twilight\\" is that an entire world of immortal vampires and werewolves exist only to serve the needs of Bella.  As much as the author tries to create Bella into a strong character, the girl simply comes off to me as selfish and self-centered and well, absurdly fortunate for her mythical protectors to save her from her otherwise mundane life.    The love between Bella and Edward in \\"Twilight\\" was magical and incredibly romantic...so long as they had each other, they could conquer everything.  It was touching.  Then Bella, in the subsequent books, is met with one disaster after another requiring the entire vamp and werewolf clan to rally to \\"protect\\" her against all odds.  The final book was more incredulous (as if a vamp/werewolf book could get more unbelievable) when Bella gets pregnant with the \\"Bedward\\" love child after ONE night of implied love making (as evidenced by torn pillows and bruises). Bella refuses to give it up even though the child is killing her and her pain is suffered by everyone, particularly Edward and Jacob.  Forget her eternal love for Eddie and his sorrow at potentially losing her because of her decisions (yet again), forget how much Jacob suffers because she keeps asking him to come back to visit her, it's all about her and this love child.  She's a strong character, only because she is so incredibly selfish.    Then she gives birth in a scene that would be fit for the Exorcist, complete with vomiting blood and needles jabbed in her heart.  Stephanie Meyer, to her credit, definitely put some twists in the book.  I was not surprised by them, but appalled.  No, there was no typical romance involved with this transformation.  It was downright gross.  But then after all of it she becomes a beautiful vampy lady with not one but two special powers.     The complete scrapping of the eternal love between Bella and Edward, the intimacy they shared and the development of their relationship as a couple, as a result of the love child, annoys me.  The lack of any character development with the other characters annoys me even more, as each character's story could be a book in and of itself.  Oh, forget any other details except those which involve how \\"beautiful\\" or \\"dazzling\\" or \\"graceful\\" the vampy beings are.      I did not finish the book, so perhaps I am not at liberty to comment about the other aspects, or the book overall.  I couldn't bear to finish it.  I went ahead and read the reviews, including spoilers, so I do not feel compelled to finish the book, rather, I have simply returned it.    For those of you who want a really good alternate ending:  [...]

B000AMPZF8|5.0|No, it's not like their new stuff.   This album blew my mind when I first heard it, and subsequently blew the minds of everyone I told to listen to it.  This was before anyone in the US knew who Muse were, before they became global superstars and had major pop singles.  If you like \\"Starlight\\" and the later singles, you might not like this. It's proggy, spaced out rock from another world, yet its production is somehow not overblown like their more recent albums.     Supremely artsy, heavy, intense...  it grabs you at the first song and simply doesn't stop.  \\"Megalomania\\" is one of the most thrilling, spine-chilling album closers you're likely to hear.  Hard to believe it's only their second album.  \\"Bliss\\" is stratospheric, \\"Space Dementia\\" is so far their best amalgamation of classical music and rock, complete with a viciously noisy coda, \\"Plug In Baby\\" and \\"Hyper Music\\" are pure frenetic energy, and \\"Micro Cuts\\" is their most intensely dramatic, operatic fuzz-fest to date.    In case I haven't made it clear:  THIS IS MUSE'S BEST, MOST ACCOMPLISHED ALBUM. BUY IT NOW.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|This movie does for the Star Trek tv and movie series what the new version of Doctor Who does for that series: it discovers new possibilities in the original concept, gives it more of a heart (not that the original was heartless, but this has even more heart), and makes it accessible to a current audience that has no reference frame for the original.  It's nice to own a version that I can download to an iPod!
0061120081|5.0|Well, I'd recommend if you have some time during a holiday or vacation, take this book with you. I couldn't put it down for 3 days. I missed it somehow through my high school and college ed. It just might not have been on my reading list for my classes, but I would say it's better than just seeing the movie.      The writing is amazing. The characterization and descriptions put you into the world of growing up in Depression Era South. But more important, it shows how we absorb the world growing up, the good, the bad, and the ugly. And sometimes, we can see changes in our lifetime that seem small at first, but can grow into something bigger. The point of view from a child growing up is the special human interest that I think has made it so interesting over the years.    No wonder it was given the Pulitzer. If you have to catch up on classics, this is a good one to start with.
B001N26GFC|1.0|I couldn't watch this film past the first 20 minutes. It's that bad, folks. The main character, Poppy, is the personification of a ditsy, astonishingly irritating pill of a woman.     I'm a big fan of the campy, cheesy, B-movies from the 70s. These sorts of films are so bad, that they're good. A real guilty pleasure. Happy-Go-Lucky is just plain lousy, with no redeeming qualities.     Poppy is a 30-year-old teacher, who behaves like a hyperactive 6-year-old. Of course a 6-year-old is usually ridiculously cheery, as most kids that age are. But to see a 30-year old act like this, is gruesome.    There still aren't that many films, where women are portrayed as commanding respect. In my humble opinion, the character of Poppy, is NOT a positive role model for young women. Unless they aspire to be empty-headed, annoying, and trite.
0439023483|1.0|The Hunger Games, the book. 1 star, the review.  This book wasn't bad, rather shallow. It would have easily benefited from another 100 or so pages. Mine main problem with this book was the stupidity of the main character, she may be cunning in some fields, but here inability to detect love is infuriatingly annoying. The ending of the book is rushed and once again infuriatingly obvious. It felt as though you were reading the book a second time. The book is by no means written masterfully and like most teen novels is driven only by hormone stimulating action and suppressed desires. The beginning is fair since there is a certain element of mystery, but once you realize all that will be told of the capital has been told the only thing that keeps you going is wanting to finish quickly so you can burn the ending pages and write your own, which would probably be better.

0307474275|5.0|Despite all the reviews claiming that this book is formulaic, dumbed-down and full of plot holes, I absolutely loved every thrilling, page-turning minute of it.<br /><br />Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code opens with the murder of Louvre curator Jacques Sauniere, who spends his dying moments creating a hidden code to pass on information that a secret society and the Catholic church have been battling over for centuries. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and Sauniere's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, must work together to clear their names as prime suspects and unravel Sauniere's secret. The action rarely lets up as Langdon and Neveu struggle to stay ahead of their enemies, the religious history is fascinating even if some argue not entirely accurate, and the riddles are so clever that they blew me away.<br /><br />A bit of advice for anyone reading this book: enjoy it for the rollercoaster that it is. Don't stare too hard at the infrastructure - just enoy the ride.

0316017922|2.0|The Outliers delivers one incredibly strong lesson in its first chapter: beware of the effect of arbitrary decisions on people's lives.  Beware cut-off dates on ages for example.  This is admirably shown in William Gladwell's first chapter.  Hockey players in Canada are chosen on teams based on their talent, but also based on their age on January first.  Those born on December 31 are effectively one year younger than those born on January second.  Obviously many younger players won't be as adept as older ones, but so it goes.  This means it may be advantageous to have two start dates for Kindergarten in schools.<br /><br />A second strong lesson of the book is that timing, out of one's control, matters.  People born in the middle 1830's in history were the most successful people in history.  Cute stuff, but not too usable.<br /><br />The third lesson is somewhat unremarkable; although vital: social background and elite status matter in success.  Children of dedicated, usually wealthy, parents who are flexible in their own accomplishments do better than those from rigid, poor families.  Duh.<br /><br />The point of the three lessons is that people don't succeed by themselves, but their location in time and place determines the limits on their success.  This point is told in very engaging ways by Gladwell.  It is worth the time to read his text, but there are some caveats.<br />____________________<br /><br />Isaac Chotiner's valid question (The New Republic, February 04, 2009) on why the chapter on airlines and culture was included in The Outliers can be answered with these three related points.<br /><br />First, Mr. Gladwell did not want his book to justify racism. If wonderful family and social support is necessary for success, then a variation of William Shockley's argument that affirmative action is of no practical value to people doomed to failure would be true: why help a poor black student with a single parent, when he or she could never be a great success like Bill Gates or Bill Joy.<br /><br />Second, the Korean chapter suggests that a few tweaks to culture can fix a problem and allow reasonable success.  Similarly, affirmative action for law students seems to work out OK, as long as IQ is above 120.  Please note that this is questionable research.<br /><br />Third, Gladwell above can be seen as differentiating great success, ability combined with wonderful circumstances and timing, from \\"good enough\\" success, which society can support at certain intervals such as during schooling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Gladwell made three choices that undermine his likability and discernment.  He's simply not self-reflective in his editing.  Gladwell seems so full of himself and has simple politics.<br /><br />First, his excessive demeaning of Langan was coarse, bordering on mean. Langan is such a buffoon that he doesn't know there is no \\"thumb right on you (p. 96)\\" at Harvard.  However, readers of TNR's article on Zeke, Rahm's brother, may have noticed his words \\"But it was Harvard that was most oppressive (The New Republic, July 1, 2009, p. 27).\\"  Maybe Langan, wasn't all that wrong.  Furthermore, Reed College and Montana State should have been slapped by Gladwell.  They failed disgustingly; almost inexcusably.  Instead, Gladwell blesses their bureaucratic ineptness and laziness in dealing with Langan, because liberal Reed doesn't have a rigid (i.e. bad) bureaucracy.  Reed, a small liberal college, simply let go one of its most promising students. As a student at Stanford, with parents having limitations, at the same time as Langan, I struggled to get my financial paperwork delivered months after it was due each year.  I was never shown the exit - I was given emergency loans to pull me through.  One of the 'red state' arguments against affirmative action is that it's affirmative only for preferred (i.e. liberal) people.  Langan's situation makes ones wonder: is social support reliable as policy to help all people succeed?<br /><br />Second, the most beautiful chapter in the book concerned how Gladwell's mother didn't claim racist discrimination in England after realizing that she and her ancestors had enjoyed generations of success because of the light tone of their skin.  Sweet.  Her blessed son disparages an abused man Langan (who has overcome a great deal) in print and left a pointless sentence in his book \\"Kiddo, when you leave New York, every place is Bridgeport. (p. 138)\\"  Yes, Mr. Gladwell may be on the A-list of the chattering class and power clique at Harvard, but his framework is immature.<br /><br />Third, Gladwell acts like a 'fellow traveler.' The chapter on KIPP read like a propaganda piece by Shaw when visiting Stalin in the 1930's, where his railroad car attendants had read his work!  Yeah, sure.  My high school junior read the chapter and asked \\"Is KIPP for stupid people?  They work so hard, but only 83% are proficient.\\"  Gladwell may be smart, but you could sell him some swampland near Forrest Gump.r didn't claim racist discrimination in England after realizing that she and her ancestors had enjoyed generations of success because of the light tone of their skin.

B002ONC9MS|4.0|AN EDUCATION features some really nice performances in service of a story that was, for me, not very meaningful or compelling.  Set in London, in the `60s at a time just before the Beatles arrived to shake things up, we meet Carey Mulligan, a student at an all-girl high school.  She is super smart & witty (naturally, because she will grow up to be her own biographer and write the book upon which the movie is based), and this has made her restless and reckless.  She's very interested in boys, but seldom gets to meet any that stir any interest in her.  She's a sweet-faced girl who is just looking for the right opportunity to get into some serious mischief.    She's the only child in a fairly lower-middle class family.  Her father (Alfred Molina) is deeply ambitious for her...and obsesses about her grades so that she can get into college.  He's naïve about the world though, but runs his household as though he's the authority on all things.  In reality, he's such a tyrant because he's afraid to experience new and unfamiliar things.  Mom understands the restlessness of her daughter, but has assumed a passive role in the family...she sees more than she lets on, but she also does nothing about it.  So into this situation strides Peter Sarsgard, a charming, suave and sophisticated bachelor who is clearly MUCH older than Mulligan.  They meet one very rainy day when he gives her a ride home from her music lessons, and she is immediately charmed by his easy wit and urbane manner.  He clearly sees a girl who is very naïve, but very much ready to let her hair down.      He charms her parents (in scenes that are incredibly difficult to swallow...yes, he's charming and well-to-do...but the fact that she's perhaps 17 and he's clearly 30ish gives up a creepy vibe that I find hard to believe her parents don't pick up on), and soon the two are engaged in quite a crazy fling.  He introduces her to fine restaurants and bars and to another couple, consisting of another man who appearsto be Peter's best friend and his girlfriend, an empty-headed blonde (Rosamund Pike, quite funny) who is very upfront in admitting that she's along for the money and glamour.  The four become inseparable, and Carey begins to concoct lies to get away from home and spend more time with these folks.  She eventually devises a doozy of a lie that convinces her father that she's going to meet CS Lewis and visit Oxford...when she's really going away with this creepy guy in order to loose her virginity.  And she eventually discovers that these two men of leisure are con men and thieves...yet is easily convinced to stay with them.  She's enjoying the glamorous life, after all.    Eventually, as you might suppose, things are exposed and the carefully constructed lies fall apart.  The entire story is so frivolous that it's hard to believe the movie can be engrossing.  But most of the performers give such excellent performances that for the time of the movie, you can overlook the fact that these are mostly petty thieves and liars, or terrible parents who are willing to look the other way as their child engages in a highly inappropriate relationship because it might open some doors for her.      The film looks great, with excellent period costuming and detail.  London feels like a city on the edge of bursting away from the staid, old-fashioned past into a center for a youthful revolution.      But it is the acting that really makes the film work.  Alfred Molina, finally playing a British character, is really quite wonderful as the father.  Towards the end of the movie, he has one small scene, sitting outside the door of  his daughter's room, that is simply the best one-minute of movie writing and acting this year.  It's a tiny little moment, but wrenching in its perfect evocation of what it means for this man to have his heart broken by his beloved daughter.  Sarsgard is good in his role, but hugely unlikable.  He certainly carries a creepy, pedophile vibe...and I still maintainthat he would have turned her parents off.      However, this is young Carey Mulligan's movie and she utterly commands it.  Surely an Oscar nomination awaits her.  Her character is so trivial and unlikable...yet Mulligan makes us see the way her innate intelligence and curiosity get the best of her.  She does bad things because she is compelled to EXPERIENCE something outside her limited world.  And when she is inevitably disappointed, we can feel the anguish and the realization that she is indeed a little girl still.  Great stuff.    I'd also like to mention that Emma Thompson appears in a small, but hugely satisfying performance as the headmistress of the school.  She has one of the best lines of the year (if you've seen the trailers for the film, you've seen it).  Mulligan says something like, \\"I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman\\" and Thompson throws back, with the most casually sweet vitriol, \\"Oh, you're not a woman.\\"  You gotta see it to believe it.    I heartily recommend this movie if you're interested in some very nice performances.  It is slow paced and not a great deal of import happens.  For me, when it was over,  I realized how truly nasty so many of the people really were, and the charm wore off quickly.  I know for others, the glow lasted much longer.  Either way, I think the film is well worth supporting.
B002MW50KO|4.0|If judging music is always an acquired taste, then how much more so for Bob Dylan's seasonal `Christmas in the Heart'?  I hear a clamor of dissent:  Naysayers believe that the Bard of Hibbing is overreaching into territory that is clearly not his.  I can only try to saw through the objections with some answers that counter the premise that this is not his album, nor is it the material he was meant to master.  However, after a sample listening of the C.D., if you still don't think it's your cup of rhyme, then leave it on the table for someone else to savor.  I think even Dylan, himself, will understand.    If you're reading this review, you most likely possess and treasure '[[ASIN:B000GFLAI0 Modern Times]],' the latest and probably the best of Dylan's tri-Renaissance work.  Here on '...in the Heart' we have many of the same players:  Tony Garnier on bass and cello; George G. Receli on drums and percussion; and Donnie Herron, the virtuoso, plays on steel guitar, mandolin, violin, and trumpet.  And, just as significant, Jack Frost is still at the producing helm.    Frost's production is impeccable:  The clarity of the music is crystal clear and emulates the desire that Dylan has consistently coveted throughout his career,  and I love the supporting voices that garner nearly every song without going mushy (say, in contrast to Phil Spector's controversial hand with The Beatles' \\"The Long and Winding Road\\").    Still, many may find Dylan's voice unsuitable to the material.  For me, I've described his gravelly voice of late as being Leon Redbone`s successor, so many of the traditional numbers are given a rustic appeal other renditions lack.  \\"Here Comes Santa Claus,\\" \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" and \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" work in spades for me.      This isn't to say there isn't overreaching.  \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" is meant to soar, and Dylan's voice doesn't muster what is necessary to carry it through.  With all due respect, I have a feeling that for some of you, my exceptions may prove your rule.        Clearly the best songs are lesser known works which are garnished by Bob Dylan's most excellent supporting band.  \\"The Christmas Blues\\" (Sammy Cahn & David Jack Holt) gives the dinner club jazz sensibilities inherent in 'Modern Times,' and \\"Christmas Island\\" (Lyle Moraine) competes with The Beach Boys' \\"Melekalikimaka\\".  Perhaps the best song, \\"Must Be Santa,\\" (William Fredericks and Hal Moore) incorporates what could be described as a ho-down at a Swiss Lodge.  It's highly festive and full of good humor.  If only all the songs could be this good, we'd have one of the great Christmas classics of all time.      When one hears a C.D. throughout and cannot appreciate it after several listenings, then it's easy to dismiss.  I still haven't tired of 'A Christmas in the Heart,' which is still playing in the car, on the C.D. player, and in the I-Pod inside my head alongside the fondest of my most recent Christmas memories.

I must admit -- after hearing for a long time about the wonderful and transforming power of the mind -- that I was taken aback by Tolle's thought -- perhaps a little startled to find myself nodding yes, as I flipped pages after pages. The way he presents it: a fight between the heavenly Angel and the evil One on your shoulders, in your head (of course, Tolle's insight made it out to be quite less humorous, even a bit pernicious if one  fails to rein it). Control it, and you're enlightened. Tolle explains in a Q/A format some of the most profound quests that have eluded humans for centuries. His pantheistic take on God might appear unsettling to some. However, most of the other topics touch on the do's and don'ts you could probably find in most inspirational literatures.    Tolle goes further:  Consciousness: the Way Out of Pain; Moving Deeply Into the now; Mind Strategies for Avoiding the Now; The State of Presence; The Inner Body... and many more subjective topics.  In general, he states that most of our ills exist because of our lack of knowledge on how to control our inner self, how to tame it into accepting \\"what is,\\" and surrendering beyond reproach.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Warning: this review contains a significant spoiler. If you really have no idea what the movie is about, and don't want to know...read no further. I don't discuss anything beyond what you find in virtually any review about the film...but be warned nonetheless.     THE READER is fabulously well-acted, and thus it is a gripping drama. When it's all said-and-done, though...I was left perplexed as to how to react. I didn't have mixed feelings about it...I literally wasn't sure how I felt.     That may be both a huge accomplishment and a failing. THE READER essentially conspires to make us sympathize (to one extent or another) with a Nazi war-criminal. In a way, the film may be doing this to help illustrate how easy it is to turn away or ignore horrible things going on. To give some sense of how so many Germans could have turned a blind eye at the atrocities of the SS during World War II. Yet by the same token, the film cheats in evoking these feelings because we are introduced to the main character years after the war, and are led to see her in a sympathetic manner...feelings that stick with us throughout the film.     Kate Winslet plays Hanna, a 30 something woman working as a conductor on a streetcar in post-war Germany. She lives a quiet life in a tiny apartment, making a very small ripple in the world. One day, she shows a little kindness to 15 year-old Michael, and when he returns to Hanna's apartment to thank her some weeks later, the two fall into a deep, passionate and highly inappropriate affair. Hanna clings to Michael for some kind of comfort, yet she is also quite demanding on him. She will give him virtually anything he can imagine sexually, yet she holds up a very solid wall against his efforts to build a truly intimate relationship. He is, understandably, madly in love with this amazing older woman who is teaching him things his friends can only imagine. And he also reads to Hanna (at her insistence): short stories, novels like HUCKLEBERRY FINN, etc.One day, Hanna just disappears and Michael is left bereft. Years later (I won't explain the circumstances), Michael finds that Hanna is on trial for war crimes...apparently she was a guard who led a fair share of women to the death chambers and also left a large group of women and children to die in a church fire. There is no question she was involved...but to what extent? Did she have a valid reason? And does Michael know something about Hanna that could help her? And if he DOES...should he use it, or should he let Hanna \\"suffer\\" a large punishment?     This dilemma is at the crux of what the film is about. It explores guilt and it also explores the idea of a \\"shared\\" guilt. I know the book upon which THE READER is based was written by a German, so I believe both works also are working at understanding the national guilt Germany feels, or the world thinks it should feel. And it was this exploration that left me perplexed. Am I supposed to sympathize with Hanna? If I were in Michael's shoes, would I want to help her or hurt her or ignore her?     And in this story, Michael is also deeply affected by the sense of loss and betrayal Hanna's sudden disappearance left him with. He has become a person who is closed-off from his feelings and reluctant to open himself to others. Frankly, he's become an unlikeable, uptight jerk.     How the relationship between Hanna and Michael grows and changes and concludes is the through-line of this movie. It is certainly and interesting and compelling drama.     And the three stars of the film make it very, very watchable. Kate Winslet, who can do virtually no wrong, gives one of her best performances. Her character is frequently unlikeable (even before we know about her past)...yet we can certainly see why a 15 year old would be hopelessly smitten by this damaged person. And although her old-age makeup isn't always the best, Winslet develops her character convincingly over several decades. The young Michael is played by David Kross, avery talented young man who very convincingly portrays the reserve of a child of a wealthy family, as well as the enthusiasm for sex that only teens can have, along with a very touching effort to try to understand Hanna and make her happy. Older Michael is played by Ralph Fiennes, who once again shows how many different ways a closed-off, repressed person can be played. It's another type-casting for Fiennes, but as always, he pulls it off as no other modern actor can.     So while I found THE READER a perplexing puzzle at times, I still greatly enjoyed the film. It is crisply directed, and the cinematography makes the German countryside sparkle. It is not flashy, but it is still softly powerful and disquieting in how much it can make us care for these far from perfect people.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|A great film for those whose IQ is below 70.  Unreal what a studio will do to hype a movie.  Evidently, this is exactly what Paramount did to make a buck off this ridiculous piece of nothing. Silly and trite, don't waste your time viewing this kind of crap!
B000001ES9|5.0|When I was in junior high in the mid-70s, Rush was THE band.  I remember buying their first three albums in one package on cassette under the title \\"Archives\\".  Since the advent of CDs, I've been hoping that it would once again become available in this form.  Well, after waiting and waiting, I finally decided just to buy the albums separately since that seems to be the only way these will ever be available.  The songs from these albums are best heard live, like on \\"All the World's a Stage\\" to be fully appreciated.  If you are a big Rush fan, you MUST own \\"Rush\\", \\"Fly By Night\\", \\"Caress of Steel\\", and \\"2112\\".  Required listening for new and longtime fans!
0061767581|1.0|A long time watcher of the Hills, this book was the novel version of the show. While Conrad changed the names of the characters, you could easily tell who was who. Very boring book.
B0029O08WA|1.0|They've really gotta kidding with this terrible soundtrack. A bunch of cheesy, boring songs that don't fit the movie or the Twilight series at all.  In the 1st one there were Linkin Park and Paramore songs.  This one obviously should've featured more Linkin Park, say like \\"Papercut\\" since it was on Stephenie Meyers New Moon Playlist? This wasn't a difficult task at hand. Also Evanescence \\"Going Under\\" especially needed to be included and also in the movie when Bella is drowning.   They didn't even get someone to do songs for the movie, like Paramore for the 1st. Maybe Flyleaf would've worked? Someone good would've done special songs for this movie. Did they put in any effort at all?  Avoid this soundtrack at all costs!  I hope they try harder for Eclipse.
0385340990|4.0|If you like your fiction mixed with a little history to add plausibility to the story, then you will enjoy this book.  It was fun, interesting, sad, romantic, intense, suspenseful and silly.  All in all, a good read.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I think that this is a good glimpse of what we have been missing from someone who has been in the prayers of millions of fans and people around the world. It hurt to see such an amazing artist fall from grace but that pain is replaced with joy at the releasig of her new album. This album while pailing in comparison to The Bodyguard( which in imcomparable no matter what album) is an excellent album to get back in the business. This album clearly shows that she still got it going on. The only thing she might be missing is her range and pitch but she can still get up there a little bit. We love you Whitney and we wish you good luck as you take your place back on the throne. Great album!!!!
079070546X|3.0|Expect a nasty email from the seller if you give them less than many stars!
B000AYEL1A|1.0|If you want to see the worst of 4 versions of the same story (twice done in the '30s, then once in the '50s with Judy Garland probably the best and this turkey) then you can start with this dud. One mistake was to set it in a rock period plus from what I heard from various sources, Streisand fired several directors before settling on Frank Pierson (Dog Day Afternoon)--someone she could control.  I know many fans believe that la Babara can do no wrong but she was clearly off base with this remake or revision and \\"Yentil\\".  In all fairness, she still has one of the most glorious voices of all time but as for her acting, forget it. The last musical that I found at least entertaining of hers was \\"On A Clear Day You Can See Forever\\" directed by Vicente Minelli and scored by the great Nelson Riddle, whom who had a struggle dealing with La Streisand's ego.  If you want to see a decent version of this story, either check out the 1937 version with Janet Gaynor or my favorite, the 1955 one with Judy Garland and James Mason in one of his best performances.  Kris Kristopherson, thankfully, has improved since this picture.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Despite what Kenye West does or says, Taylor Swift is a force in music that few can resist.  Unlike many performers today, she writes many of her own songs and the lyrics are truly heartfelt.  Her songs touch on themes faced by young girls and women all over and the feelings expressed are genuine.  I purchased the CD for 2 specific songs but found myself playing it over and over for other songs like 'Hey Stephen' and 'Breathe' that have now became my favorites.  I'm looking forward to even better things from her.
0316069906|5.0|I got this book for Christmas and was not able to put it down. I have been a vegetarian for 25 years and this book reminded me why. I think all people should read this book, not to convince them to become vegetarian, but because we all should be making informed decisions about what we do in life. I beleive in full disclosure so we can make informed choices and this book provides that for an act that we all do at least 3 times a day- eat.
B0026P3G12|5.0|After seeing Susan Boyle on TV, I couldn't wait till her album was relesed - she is a rare gem - play her CD many times over - am truly happy for her and her new found success - with her beautiful voice she will be around for quite some time - this is a must buy album - you won't be disappointed.
0553381687|5.0|This is the type of story you think about all day.  It does take a little while to get hooked, then<br />watch out!  You will find yourself contemplating the character's situations throughout your<br />day.  Each main character is well developed and you understand the story from different<br />angles.  I am looking forward to the whole series.  Very well written adventure with substance.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I am in awe of Meryl Streep.  I can't think of a bad performance by her.  I did approach this movie with some reservations, having heard that the Amy Adams character was annoyingly whiny.  Well, she is whiny, but I find it easy to believe that she is completely authentic. From what I can tell, Julie Powell is kind of a pill.  The relationship between Julie and her husband felt very real.  The relationship between Julia and Paul - completely magical.  Kudos to Streep and Tucci.  Stanley Tucci gives a somewhat subdued performance which just showcases his fine acting skills.  I hope he is recognized come awards time.  And just for a bonus, we get an absolutely charming, if too short, appearance by the awesome Jane Lynch.  This may be my favorite movie of the year.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I'm not gonna rehash all the great reviews already...They are all spot on. The way the Nigerian gang leader got dusted had me LMFAO....Great movie!!
B0024FAR5W|4.0|I really enjoyed this show more than I thought I would considering it virtually glamourizes the outlaw lifestyle.  Fortunately, the show proved a little less shallow and the characters, despite their human failings, quickly grew on me.  But, even the most depraved of these outlaw bikers are probably more socially motivated and acceptable than any you would ever run across in real life.  Then again, the Hell's Angels are the originators of Toys-for-Tots.<br /><br />Of course, as someone who rides, I suspect I'm in the principle demographic the show targets.  But, the well scripted dialogue and human drama should play well for broader audiences too.  The only thing that I didn't find researched well enough were the principle bikes used in the production.  I've known former members of The Outlaws and Hell's Angels, and just can't imagine any veteran biker sitting atop a brand new Sportster (Harley's least expensive bike, which is probably why they were used in the show) with \\"prissy\\" handlebar attachments and such.  Even less hard-core Harley enthusiasts wouldn't dress-up their bike to resemble a foreign made crotch-rocket, much less a member of a subculture that still worships the shovel-heads and pan-heads of yesteryear.  They'd probably take more pride in a leaky, dirty, old rat-bike that constantly needs fiddling with.  In fact, at some bars, just parking a sport bike in the lot will get it torched.  I'm not knocking sport-bikes or Harley owners who choose to modify their bike to look like something other than a Harley; that's where $100,000 custom choppers got started.  But, new and spiffy don't fit the outlaw biker image at all. I'm mean we're talking about people who wear jackets they never wash (on penalty of being pummeled by the other gang members), even after the entire gang has urinated on the back.
1416972242|5.0|This was an entertaining trilogy to read. Not as deep as one would like at times, but definitely fun to read. Good engaging story.
0385504225|3.0|A nice story because it is set in Washington, but with nothing really new, as far as the intrigue is concerned, compared to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Angels and Demons\\". Some supposedly central elements of suspense are also easily predictable: it does not take long to suspect that Mal'ach is Zachary and that the spiral staircase under a big stone is the Washington monument. As for the chapters following the death of Mal'ach, they are as unnecessary and boring as the moralizing end of Mozart's Don Giovanni. I wish Langton had really died in his tank, so that the author would have been forced to re-invent himself in his next novel. By the way, concerning the power of minds on matter, one should read the Iranian philosopher Avicenna, who wrote very interesting pages about noetics,  1000 years ago, in his \\"Ishârât\\" and \\"Shifâ'\\".
B0026P3G12|5.0|This album is very well done. The songs included are good. Susan's voice is excellent. The studio work is outstanding.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|I attended the second evening show over the summer and he blew me away (along with the rest of his solid band)...this combo DVD/ CD does great justice to a great show
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan was as good as the first time I heard her sing! was surprised there were mostly Xmas songs though on her 1st album. I am hoping she does one with songs for all times during the year, not that you can't listen to this one all year long because its a mix.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's Debut album is Susan at her very best. And every song personifies the image and wonderful vibe so many of us have become transfixed by. She is an amazing talent, a talent that though kept hidden for so long is now bursting into bloom all over the world. Rock on Susan!
B002T9H2L0|1.0|This review is for the 2-disc special edition blu-ray -- as many others have noted, our disc was defective in that it takes forever to load (like 20 minutes) then hangs up when you press play. However, we were able to get it to work by clicking on chapters and going directly to chapter 1.    That said, I almost wish the disc hadn't worked at all. I think another review said it best \\"so bad its bad.\\" If you have to see this one I'd recommend renting.
B0025KVLUQ|1.0|As with the White Album, Abbey Road does not play with total clarity of sound as it is meant to. It will skip in a couple of places after only being played once or twice in my car - one of my favorite albums of The Beatles and one of the first of the remastered albums to supplement my collection.
B0026P3G12|1.0|While I am a big fan of Susan Boyle, the selection of songs on this cd is incredibly boring and not worthy of her talent.  Whomever picked out the songs to be included SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY, and, if it was Susan herself ....I am afraid there is a bleak picture ahead in marketing another cd with her name on it.
B002VKE0XA|1.0|We went to see this thinking it would be scary.Don't believe the hype it was boring.If you need help falling asleep buy it, other than that stay away.
B0025KVLU6|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in the fact that after only one playing on my cd player in my car the album refused to play again with any quality without skipping and messing up. I'm extremely disappointed with this particular shipment as one of the other \\"albums\\" also skips, which is something I've not previously experienced....and don't see any replacement taking place to offer me better quality cds.
0316069906|5.0|I have been a vegetarian for the last 25 years and an animal lover since the day I was born. I have read every book on both of these subjects and this one is one of the best!
B002MRROKS|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loved it! He is a avid nirvana fan and this was a added bonus to his collection!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book blew me away. I was first given it by a friend and thought I going to hate it. By that night I couldn't put it down. The magic system and world along with the story line was truly original. The characters felt real to me and by the end I was craving the next book.  This book takes place in a world where ash falls and the thought of green plants is considered silly. We have the Lord Ruler, an evil man that appears as a god to his people. He rules over the nobility and skaa in the final empire. Kelsier is a legendary theif intending to overthrow the final empire with the help of his selected crew. He saves Vin, a young skaa theif and after finding out that she is mistborn, starts training her in allomancy(the ability to burn metals which brings on certian powers). Together they attempt to overthrow the empire.  This book kept me up a few nights but it was worth it. I highly recommend reading it!
0545140315|5.0|Penny Lane (yes, as in The Beatles song) is just sick of guys. After one particularly nasty break-up with her childhood friend Nate, she forms The Lonely Hearts Club and resolves never to date another high school guy. After all, all they do is jerk you around, treat you like dirt, make you change who you are, and cause you to abandon your true friends. What Penny doesn't expect is most of the girls at her school happily flocking to her new club...and people (namely, the principal and the guys) getting angry at her. And then of course, there is the tiny matter of a certain very nice, very cute boy that Penny can't seem to get off of her mind...    The Lonely Hearts Club is a kick-butt, fun, and powerful read that isn't just about the romantic ups and downs of teen dating and swearing off guys, but about friendship and loyalty and never allowing a boyfriend to compromise who you are or make you give up your girlfriends. The many dating dynamics in the book are so, so true, which makes it an easy and enjoyable novel to get into, and Penny's witty voice will make you laugh and cringe with her at the same time, especially as the many girls share their dating woes (who knew guys could be so mean?). Penny's club is unconventional, but it is so fantastic to see how she turns her pain at rejection by guys into something positive and fun for the girls in her school, and it won't fail to entertain at the same time as despite her best intentions, Penny just can't stop liking guys. The Lonely Hearts Club is not about moping around; it's about boys, The Beatles, picking yourself back up again and coming out stronger, and being the better person (most of the time). It'll leave you downloading The Beatles' music and wanting to form your own Lonely Hearts Club. Thank you, Elizabeth Eulberg.    Cover Comments: I love, love, love this cover! The Abbey Road spin-off is cute, and it's very fitting considering all of the many, many Beatles references. I also like how the tastes of each girl are as varied as the characters. The only thing I don't really care for is the font of the title. It's just too swirly for me, and since the rest of the cover has such a presence and attitude, it just doesn't fit. Other than that, this book really stands out!
B000W93CXQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. it really makes you think about life and whats really important. it is a compelling story about a boy who spends all night listening to the tapes that is now dead crush left behind. he spends all night trying to figure out why he is one of the reasons why she killed herself. and what he finds will change his life forever.
B000H1RFKU|4.0|Being one not to double dip movies I already on DVD, Training Day was an absolute must own in Blu-Ray.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|If you are considering buying the dvds for season five, know that this is some of what you will receive:      3 discs with 4 episodes, 1 disc with 3 episodes and 1 disc of bonus features    a high quality picture on the blue ray version    packaging that is comparable to any other dvd sets, but very different from previous seasonal sets of Lost.    A \\"season play\\" feature that will let you play a dvd continuously, and, will remember where you left off if you substitute another disc.    Bottom line:  what you really get if you purchase this set of DVDs is a diappointingly brief set of bonus features - given the shortened season - and, a surprisingly illuminating 28 minute (or so) spoof on an \\"In search of....\\" style documentary on the Dharma Initiative.  If you are old enough to remember Leonard Nimoy's voiceover - complete with sensationalized tone and spooky, otherworldly suggestive music - then you will have a handle on the kind of thing they are trying to do here.      They did a fine job of creating a 70's investivigative tv show; it is quite realistic.  Its benefit however, is not its artistic rendition but what it offers in terms of providing a few more nuggets about Dharma, Hanso, and selected other characters.  Surprisingly, the episode seems to know nothing of the mystique of the island - something that would be ripe for this species of show - but instead focuses on strange disappearances of people and odd alliances of institutions on the \\"mainland\\".  Although that genre of tv show tended to tantalize with more questions than answers, this version - nonetheless - does provide viewers with a few pieces of the Lost puzzle that they might not otherwise have.        In sum, I don't care about the packaging issues previously named.  I do wish there was something more given that the set was the same price as before with less shows.  But as a Lost junkie who wants the shows, what's a fan to do?
B001FB55HQ|5.0|Back in 2003 as I was driving with my Mom from seeing Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and we starting with ideas about a possible 4th film. We mentioned it taking place in the future where Humanity was actually at war. That there would be no more Terminators going back in time to help John Conner since the end of T3 showed the beginning of Judgment Day at the end. Low and behold the makers of Terminator Salvation decided to do just that. Taking place in 2018 the film shows an end of world scenario kind of like 28 Days Later, where most of Humanity is dead, or underground fighting and hiding from the Machines. It points to a bleak world where Skynet has enslaved some of the Human Race. Terminator Salvation was a much better improvement than T3: Rise of the Machines. Not that T3 was alwful, but it could have been more darker, less humorous. This film was dark and lined up with T1 and T2 in James Cameron style. I was very surprised by the cameo appearance of you know who if you watch this film. I was surprised not to see the T-1000 or T-X models but I don't know if they have been invented yet in this period of the future, although Skynet mentions \\"they've sent their best Terminators in time to defeat John Conner and all have failed\\". This film stayed in storyline with the first 3 films, and has a great cast along with Sam Worthington that kept audiences guessing. You can have a good Terminator film without Arnold or Linda Hamilton. It was great though she lent her voice though and Christiane Bale did a great John Conner. Overall the film is perhaps one of the best sci-fi films of 2009.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Great movie. Effects are astonishing and unmatched. Story was good and will be greatly improved in sequel. Avatar is one of my all time favorites now. Great work James Cameron and keep it up please.
0545123267|5.0|This was the first book I had read by Maggie Stiefvater, and I am happy to say that it was everything that I wanted and expected Twilight to be! The plot was engrossing and I enjoyed the new take on werewolf lore, and the characters were three-dimensional and likeable. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book, as Grace and Sam struggle to keep Sam in his human form. Their relationship was realistic, and it was nice to see a teenage couple do things together and actually enjoy each others' company instead of staring moodily into the others' eyes and talk about how their relationship is doomed to fail.Grace is smart and resourceful, and I just have to say, I love Sam! The only problem that I had with this book is that Grace's parents are ludicrously absent from the picture, but this is a minor problem. Ms. Stiefvater sure knows how to tell a good story, and after reading Shiver, I look forward to reading the sequel, which comes out this summer.
1401323820|4.0|A fun book if you enjoy Castle.  A very quick read. I was a little disappointed as I expected a higher level of writing. The plot works and is tied together nicely at the end.
B002X20W2E|4.0|This is a great album, very raw, very real, very in-your-face. Even the songs with silly, over-sexualized lyrics work because they add to the album's bravado, producing a somewhat ironic effect (i.e., good girl turns the tables and becomes the aggressor).    The style is varied enough to please a wide audience, including reggae and rap influences, ballads, accessible pop, electric guitar-based rock numbers, etc.    My only quibble is the guest appearances on some of the tracks. Although Will.i.am is harmless on \\"Photographs\\", Young Jeezy's rap on \\"Hard\\" completely ruins an otherwise brilliant song with drug and violence references that go way beyond what is acceptable for Rihanna's audience, not to mention his absolutely intolerable bark. I would have picked a softer, more intelligent artist for this song, someone like Kid Cudi or even Jay-Z.    All in all, an exciting, addictive listen and worth every penny.
0646497855|5.0|This is the MUST HAVE book if you are preparing yourself for IELTS. I always thought IELTS is about proficiency in English but i was wrong. IELTS is all about techniques and strategies in answering the 4 components of IELTS.     I have purchased the e-book a few months ago but didn't have time to sit in front of the computer quietly to study. With the hardcopy available now, i can bring it along wherever i go and it's really handy. It not only provides me with the necessary knowledge to sit for the IELTS but also improve my English generally. Thanks Simone for writing this book and i highly recommend this book if you are preparing for IELTS.
0451530837|5.0|As always, an Austen novel is a pleasure to savor like a very fine wine. Her language is so exquisite, makes one want to keep re-reading her books over and over. I recommend all of her books (except possibly Northanger Abbey - which I read was written when she was very young and IMO she yet had to fully mature as a person and a writer)
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Wow, this CD by Whitney Houston is so great.  So happy she is back as I love her singing.  It is upbeat and great.  Was rocking out to it in the car today.  She sounds great and thankfully Clive Davis has so much faith in her.
B002R0F3Q2|1.0|I usually love Alicia Keys, but I do not like this album!  Nothing, and I mean nothing, catches my attention, and I was really surprised that I would feel this way. It is so-so and so off the beaten path for her in my opinion.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has an incredible voice.  The CD is good and wonderful to listen to.  I will be happy if her next one has some fast songs on it.  She is incredible and I am so happy for her.  What a story she has.
B00005N5S2|4.0|Over all this was an excellent film. Many of General MacArthur's idiosyncrasies were brought to light through Gregory Peck's portrayal of the General's professional life. However, in order to better understand General MacArthur, and the points highlighted in this film, I recommend that you read \\"America Caesar\\" first. There are some historical inaccuracies, such as President Roosevelt handing him a \\"McArthur for President\\" campaign pin and President Truman complaining about MacArthur making him wait to be received. However these cinematic liberties do not detract from the overall film. One thing that the film failed to properly demonstrate was General MacArthur's extraordinary personal bravery. As with most great men, the general public misunderstood him and relied upon the tainted opinions of news-writers and columnists of the day. This film does strike a type of a balance between the varying camps of opinion. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the lives of great men and World War II.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|I love this CD and have completely worn out one already.  I can listen to Stevie Nicks songs over and over again.  I would recomend buying it.  It has all of her great songs on it.  If you love her you will love this CD.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Excellent quality and price.  Couldn't find it for sale locally, and then Amazon's price was outstanding in addition to having it available.
B002VKE0XA|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I saw it three or four times while it was in theaters.  On first viewing, I immediately realized that this movie would have a completely polarized response, and it did.  Everyone who saw it was either completely creeped-out and liked it, or they were bored senseless and hated it.  My advice is to read Roger Ebert's review.  He really nailed this movie's appeal.  You can judge for yourself whether you'll like it or not just by what he had to say about it.    This is not the kind of horror film that's been coming out over the last ten years or so.  It is not gory.  It is a very subtle meditation on the sort of things that scare us when we're alone in the dark and our imaginations get the better of us.  There is no background score, only a deep, sustained rumble that ominously creeps in when the \\"activity\\" is present.    Everyone knows the plot by now.  A young, suburban couple has decided to film their lives in an attempt to prove/disprove and eventually deal with paranormal disturbances they have been encountering since moving in together.  The activity is most... well, active...  at night.  The camera is left on while the couple sleeps, and captures mild activity such as doors moving on their own and the sounds of what could only be footsteps.  I won't tell anything beyond that, but suffice it say that if you are willing to let yourself into the feel of this movie, it can be a fun and truly scary experience.  If you're waiting for something shockingly horrific to take place, stick with Saw sequels.    Now, onto the actual Blu-Ray...    I gotta admit, I was happy to own this movie, but I was kinda let down by the lack of special features.  The only thing on here other than the movie itself is an \\"alternate\\" version which is completely identical until the last scene of the movie.  The alternate ending is also available on it's own, so the need for two whole versions of the film seems extraneous.  No commentary, no deleted scenes, no interviews, no nothing.  The story of how this movie came to be released is actually very interesting, especially the involvement of Steven Speilberg.  There is even another ending (the original one) that could have been added.  Why did Paramount leave so much off of the release of one of the most talked-about movies of the year?  My guess is that this edition is just to tide us over while a more features-happy release is prepped.

B000F3T7X8|5.0|this album balanced japans experimental side ('burning bridges', 'taking islands in africa') pop side (\\"pop\\" for japan anyway) ('gentlemen take polaroids', 'ain't that peculiar') and the amazingly sombre 'nightporter'.   as a long-standing definitive japan album the inclusion here of once-rare b-side 'the experience of swimming' makes this is an absolutely must-have japan opus.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|This is one of those movies that you just have to see atleast once, and not listen to other peoples opinion and decide for yourself if you like it or not. Ive noticed half the people i talked to about the film loved it, the other half hated it.  As you can clearly see by peoples ratings through Amazon that its about half 5 stars and half 1 star. Seeing it in the theater was truly an experience because people were really freaked out, i was too to be honest! But at the same time everybody was having alot of fun. There was alot of hype behind the film so the theaters were only showing it at midnight so it was packed from the front row to the very back, and had to buy tickets a day in advance.  The reason this movie stands out so much to me was because its setting was more like \\"real life\\" rather than a typical \\"hollywood\\" setting. Seems like the most recent horror/thriller movies made in the past decade have lacked uniqueness and creativity (The Unborn, The Haunting in Connecticut, The Grudge, The Messengers, etc) . They tend to  use more loud noises to scare the viewer, but Paranormal Activity was giving me the chills while it was completely silent.  Overall I havent felt the chills during a movie since probably The Exorcist. There was a couple scenes in the movie that i would consider top 5 most frightening scenes in movie history!  Leaving the theater I was making fun of the girls that were in our group because they were still scared, but that night i almost didnt turn off the lamp in my room before bedtime! Oh yeah, for the record, I seen a couple reviews comparing it to The Blair Witch Project just because theres some motion in the camera, this is nothing like The Blair With Project.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|I first saw the Ascent of Man on PBS in the late 70s (it was filmed in 1973-74) and was delighted to see it available on DVD, although I think it was out on VHS at one time.  This BBC/Time Life 13 part series followed on the heels of Kenneth Clark's \\"Civilisation\\" and just preceded the British ITV production of Bamber Gascoigne's The Christians, also a 13 part series and available on DVD.  But \\"The Ascent of Man\\" was the first serious documentary to try to tie together the development of man, and indeed civilization,  along scientific lines.  Dr. Jacob Bronowski gives these 13 \\"essays\\" - his words - from a personal perspective and surely reminds those of us who attended university in the 60s and 70s how fortunate we were to have professors of his caliber talking philosophically about the progression of science and what it meant.  Dr. Bronowski's theme is continuously visited - that  being that science has repeatedly been controversial and frightening, far more than liberating.  One episode illustrates this in a detailed discussion of the suppression by the Vatican of Galileo's telecopic observations, not from a particularly malicious religious motive, but rather simply because it challenged the power structure of the day.  Dr. B's point is that this drove scientific invention north and led the way to the next, and perhaps greatest of the early physicists - Isaac Newton.  And he makes this point very clear in his discussion of the science evolving in World War II, so much so, he visits Auschwitz-Birkenau and in a dramatic gesture walks into the pool of water and mud near a crematorium and raises a handful of mud that contains the ashes, representative of several hundred thousand killed there.  This poignant moment - Bronowski was a Polish Jew but emigrated to Britain well before the War but he lost many family members in Auschwitz - was made to show that science must communicate and it must be human.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed all over the world, these \\"essays\\" require multiple viewings to completely understand Dr. B's threads of continuity, but that is the way it should be with a great thinker.  I was particularly impressed with his singling out of the tragic case of Boltzmann, the Austrian scientist, who discovered the mathematical relationship of entropy ( S = loge (W)) as being one of the greatest scientifc minds of all times, only to commit suicide in his mid-50s.  Dr. B himself died suddenly of a heart attack a year after the program was completed and one wonders if there is not a personal price to pay for such erudite scientific and philosophical enlightenment.  Full marks for this series, far superior to the later BBC Connections series, and a model for Dr. Carl Sagan's incredible \\"Cosmos\\" of 1980.  Curiously, Dr. B. does not devote a program to scientific space exploration, which led Dr. Sagan a few years later to do Cosmos.  One word of caution......this series is not for those who expect flashy special effects with a lot of noise and fast camera takes.  You have to pay attention and listen and think deeply here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A  post apocalyptic thriller that will leave you burning for more, this tightly woven tale of drastic twists and turns is one of the truly great young adult novels.

B00004DTLJ|2.0|If you're looking for an album by the band that made the classic metal trilogy of Strong Arm of the Law, Wheels of Steel, and Denim and Leather, then look elsewhere.  By 1985, THAT band had apparently been driven insane by their inexplicable lack of commercial success and decided to make a desperate stab at pop radio with this album.  Although I can tolerate a few of these songs now that I'm old, the album as a whole is just flat out terrible and embarrassing.  I am bewildered by all the rave reviews here, but even pop garbage has its fans.  Unfortunately for Saxon, though, their fans in 1985 strongly disagreed with this new direction, and their prestige, along with the status they had managed to gain among metalheads, went in the trash for the next ten years.  Recommended only for completists: there are at least ten Saxon albums you should own before this one.
0689853637|5.0|Over the last 10 years, new kinds of books have surfaced; I am referring to the books that are a product of paper engineering.  Students in art schools are often assigned projects wherein they design a miniature site of buildings, a city landscape, a town or village, and even a zoo.  This book, \\"Winter's Tale\\" is paper engineered by Robert Sabuda.  There are only two handfuls of such artists in the world who create these designs. There are six different winter scenes, and five of the six have a smaller fold-out scene tucked in the corner of the double page display.<br /><br />  Animals are cut out in three dimensional forms, opening up larger than life, as you open the double page.  It's awesome to see the creativity that has gone into the design and construction of the scene, whether it is of an owl spanning its wings open, foxes coming out of their cave, wearing their new winter coats (fur) or the tiny rabbit running into a nearby bush with a carrot.<br /><br />  As you turn the next page, you will discover the old bear basking in the waters of the dancing river, then on to the family of deer playing in a blanket of snow as the chattering squirrels climb up a tree.  Then, you will turn another page and watch the moose wading in a swamp, while the beavers are playing in a woodpile.  The last scene or tableau is by far the most spectacular with many Christmas trees decorated with snow, animals playing in the background, and a snowman waiting at the door of a house that lights up when you gently pull the tab; there is no need for a tiny fold-out scene to be tucked in here, as this final scene is the grand design.<br /><br />  Little hands might want to re-fold some of the parts; discourage them from that.  Be gentle as you open and be gentle as you close the scene.  You will want to keep it for many more years as a keepsake.  The spectacular and breathtaking artwork is something to behold; there are stunning visual effects of glitter, foil paper, and detailed folds for all to enjoy.  It's a classic!<br /><br />  There is a small opening (door) on the back cover for accessing the battery area; use your Phillips screwdriver to open and close it, and in between, remove the batteries, maybe even get a few spare, and re-pack all the items for next winter,in a box,and you'll be up and running.<br />  Enjoy your visit to \\"Winter's Tale\\"...I am enjoying it right now.for all to enjoy.

B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Even though I love the Platinum CD, I did not buy it because I already had half of it. But I did buy the 6 new songs which I think are great. The behind the scenes of the music videos are actually really funny (I saw them on youtube) and she has good music videos.    1. Jump Then Fall - 10/10 catchy  2. Untouchable - 9/10 i like this and the live stripped version  3. Forever and Always Piano - 8/10 not a fan of her voice in this one, but it's a good song  4. Come In With the Rain - 9/10 nice chorus  5. SuperStar - 10/10 my second favorite one  6. The Other Side of the Door - 10/10 my favorite one, love the last verse
B000ZELISO|4.0|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good, as it (most of the time) stayed true to the novels, with some little sit-com like additions (which I personally am not so fond of). A word of warning: If you have very small children (5,6) they may be frightened by some of the more intense scenes. This IS the darkest Harry Potter movie yet, and you have to keep in mind that the movies get progressively darker, so the next two (as the seventh book is being split into to different releases) will only be darker.    A note on the soundtrack:  I found myself turning it the volume up and down at different points in the movie, as win they whisper it trails off into nothi.... and when the yell it GETS REALLY LOUD!!!! It's inevitable that this happens, I've spoken with others who complain of the same problem.    Personally this is the only format I would by movies on, as the visuals are just so wonderfully stunning.
B000002HJD|5.0|If you are a TRUE Doors/Morrison fan this CD is a must have. His spoken words give unique insight into the mind of an (almost) genius. The images Jim is able to create are hypnotic and intriguing if not a little scary. The added tracks at the end are a nice bonus. All hail the American knight!
0525457585|5.0|This book is easy enough to get through. There is always something going on and happens to be more eventful than either of the movies made from it.<br /><br />A sweet tale, appreciating the presentation in hardcover is all the more rewarding.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|I'm a big Terminator fan. It's one of my most favorite movies of all time. I love T1 and T2. T3 was made for the fans and I loved that too just because it got Arnold back in his old role. When I heard another Terminator movie was going to come out I figured it was either going to be mind blower, or really poorly done. Terminator salvation is somewhere in between those two. It's a mind blower because they adapted a lot of new concepts into the Terminator story arc, but it's poorly done because it doesn't follow the originals too well.<br /><br /> T-Salvation is a \\"Super\\" Holly Woodized version of T1 & T2. With all the special effects added in, it kind of took away from the realism of Terminator and made it seem a bit too \\"Sci-Fi\\" or just unbelievable. It lacked the element of realism that made T1 & T2 so fantastic. Watching Terminator Salvation made me flashback to watching \\"War Of The Worlds\\" or \\"Transformers\\" with it's heavy CGI use. It's just action scene after action seen with a shallow story in between.<br /><br /> Aside from the usual focus on John Conner this one mainly centered around Kyle Reese and an unknown Terminator Marcus Wright. I enjoyed the Unknown Terminator more than anyone else in this film. He was the only one that had a \\"personality\\" and \\"story\\" to add to the film.<br /><br /> The weirdest thing about it all is that it seemed to take John forever to trust and accept the Unknown Terminator as an ally...I only guess he forgot about the last to films T2 and T3 where a Terminator only SAVED HIS LIFE! about a dozen times. I mean common what is this garbage! Did the writers not ever see any of the other films? In this movie John hates Terminators more than they hate themselves. You think after all these years he would realize that the Terminators can be programmed to protect people instead of just killing them... or did he forget what he learned from Arnold?<br /><br /> The bottom line is that what  makes this movie such a disappointment is its lack of a developed story, and knowing the series they could have done so much better. It's the future and John is the leader of a \\"resistance group\\" and people follow him on command. I must have fell asleep between T3 and Terminator Salvations because I think there's a movie missing. You know the one they made that explains HOW John became the military leader people would follow? How these massive armies came together to fight the machines, and how the machines organized and developed themselves to be such a powerful and dominating force. Terminator Salvation skips all of that and jumps right into the future. The biggest problem there is that the Machines are more advanced than the ones than we encountered in the first 2 movies that were supposed to be from a much more distant future than the one presented in T-Salvation. That's where the story becomes confusing for the audience. It's more futuristic and developed than the T1 and T3 future, but its set further back in the time than those dates.<br /><br /> When you watch Terminator Unknown throughout the movie, you realize that he is out of place, because he more humanistic than the other terminators. This is something that the T-800, and T-1000 who were created at much later dates could not achieve. Apparently Skynet was able to make a highly advanced Terminator that modeled humans perfectly, so much so that it had no problems reaching either of their primary targets \\"Kyle Reese\\" and \\"John Connor\\" that they spent the first 1-3 movies trying to kill. Even though those terminators where made at a date much later than Terminator Unknown...? That just doesn't make any sense. All it shows me is that the creators of this movie are not followers of the Terminator series. T-Salvation is completely out of place and is pretty much the \\"Batman & Robin\\"of the series (yeah the one with George Clooney).<br /><br /> Watching this film you'll appreciate the action sequences, but if your looking for those nostalgic moments that made T-1and T-2 famous it's not here at all. Pick it up because you want to see a Terminator action film, but don't take it to heart as it has many flaws. For this reviewer the Glass was half empty. Decent film, just not as developed as it should have been and there's no excuse for that. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.Pick it up because you want to see a Terminator action film, but don't take it to heart as it has many flaws. For this reviewer the Glass was half empty.

0307387151|5.0|Details are key. Anyone can tell you that, in any business. Now, in literature it can go a few ways. Lack of details can spark the reader's imagination to put themselves in place of the characters or to personalize the setting. But the right details, it can bring a book to life in a vivid way. Ian McEwan's Atonement is of the latter genre.     Atonement, for those of you who haven't seen the film, is the fateful tale of three young people: 13 year old Briony, her older college aged sister Cecelia, and their gardener's son, also college aged, Robbie. On a hot summer's day in pre-WW2 England, Cecelia and Robbie realize their love for each other and Briony becomes entangled between them. Her desperate and confused accusation against Robbie of a terrible crime sends the three of them on distinct and hard paths. Spanning from pre-war England to 1999, it is the tragic tale of one woman's journey for atonement, and the people who suffer because of her deliberate crimes and confused passions.     The story, all of its twists and turns, made this book wonderful. But the details in McEwan's writing, make this book exquisite. There is simply no other word. One can hear the flies buzzing in the Tallis' garden, one can feel the silk of Cecila's green dress, and one can hear the bombs over France during the war. To be able to create such a vivid picture enhances the roller coaster of emotions brought forth in this book, making it a cathartic experience in the true sense of the word. I read it in one gulp, and felt physically exhausted after finishing after running the gamut McEwan set forth for me in it Atonement's pages.     This is a book to be savored, not to be read in a hurry. And, because I know you wondering, the film is a quite excellent adaptation and beautiful in its own right, but it does not serve as a substitute for this masterpiece. Note for sensitive readers: It has adult subject matter (mostly contained within a few scenes in Part I) and content, and it is definitely not suitable for younger audiences. Beyond those few points, if you are looking for an amazing read that will change your view on all novels, Atonement is that book.     to read more like this visit my book blog at [...]
B0026IBY72|5.0|Jane Austen cover's are plentiful but the idea behind Austenland is for the most part well crafted. I am a huge fan of Shannon Hale's young adult books (esp The Princess Academy) so I knew I already enjoyed her writing style (as well as that of Jane Austen's). The book follows a young woman, Jane naturally, who can't find the right guy because he just isn't Mr. Darcy. Many fun adventures happen to young Jane but always leave her (and the reader) wondering what is true and what is not. Super entertaining with numerous references not only to Ms. Austen's several novels but other novels of the era. The book, though it starts out incredibly promising, eventually just comes to a meager end. After finishing the book, I was a bit surprised (not to mention a tad disappointed) not to be left with that \\"ahh\\" feeling that comes with all of Austen's novels and which I had experienced with all of Hale's young adult novels as well. It seemed as if she was just tired of being in the story and so it had to end. However, I still highly recommend it as an Austen lover as well as a fan of Shannon Hale.
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was little.  Even years later it is still awesome.  I love the unicorns and faries and how the movie is not quite scary, but also a love story!

B0029LHW68|5.0|I don't have a whole lot to add, just want to say that I hear a lot more older rock influences on this album than their previous efforts.  A Beautiful Lie could pretty much be called rather emo (and the only album I like under that category.. love that album), but this new album marks new territory for the band.  I'd just call it good ol' rock 'n' roll and I think it suits them well.  You can definitely tell that Leto is very passionate about music when he is singing and it shines through in his vocal delivery.  The lyrics are artistic just like the previous albums, so no disappointment there.  The music almost makes me think of an epic scene in a late 80's or early 90's love story movie without the sappy lyrics.  It definitely makes you think of good times.  This is War definitely won me over...  5 stars.
6300270424|2.0|This is a bloated, self-indulgent, boring mess.  When this film came out, I remember thinking that if this  is the great Led Zeppelin, then they are quite overrated.  Some of the songs are way too long, the video  sequences are almost laughable and Plant is either having a bad night or is already struggling to be the  Plant of a few years earlier.  Get the excellent double DVD \\"Led Zeppelin\\" instead - way, way better.  It not only shows the band at various points in their fairly brief history but does indeed demonstate  what a terrific group they actually were.  In its wake, \\"Song\\" is now useless.

B00006BTC7|5.0|Must have this to be complete. This is the debut and I have them all even the solo singer stuff which is quite good (much better than good if you get down to it) but nothing compares to this. Generations of listeners will be able to pull out some of the collective inspirations. It is moody and driving and very powerful indeed. Brings old school to a higher level of education. This was my pick for 2002 as the best record released. A cross between Joy Division, New Order and Echo, even a little Depeche is in there. Pop but in a darker way. Very strong vocals, a bit mono but I wouldn't change a thing.
006112429X|5.0|I finished WNTTAK about one hour ago and I am still trying to calm down and compose myself.  What a nerve shattering novel - absolutely brilliant and compulsively readable.  I have read two other school massacre novels, \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" by Jodi Picoult and \\"The Hour I First Believed\\" by Wally Lamb, and neither of them comes remotely close to the emotional impact or literary superiority of this novel. \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" provides a compelling study on the conflicts and challenges of reluctant motherhood and whether or not a child is born innately evil or is influenced towards sociopathy by outside influences and parental nurture or lack thereof.  The book doesn't provide the answers; the reader is left to make up their own mind about these issues, but I won't be forgetting Eva Khatchadourian and her bone chilling son, Kevin, anytime soon.  This outstanding novel gets five stars from me, I cannot recommend it highly enough.

B000002KMV|5.0|Controversy has the unfortunate place in Prince's history of being situated between two of his most critically acclaimed albums, [[ASIN:B000002KLP Dirty Mind]] and [[ASIN:B000002KY8 1999]] (with [[ASIN:B000002L68 Music from the Motion Picture \\"Purple Rain\\"]] just behind that). Unfortunate because on it's own this is one badass album, and in my opinion the superior work.     The title track has long been a favorite of mine in Prince's canon of great songs, that thumping drum accented by those funky keyboard sounds always got my hand reaching to crank up the volume button. For years I only knew this track as the 3 minute edit that was used in the music video and single edit from [[ASIN:B000002MNA The Hits]] collection. \\"Controversy\\" features here as a 7 plus minute jam with added raps and instrumental sections that puts it right over the top of being sooooo good. My all-time favorite Prince ballad \\"Do Me, Baby\\" is also featured here and it too has an extended section from the single edit added to the end of the song. Prince gets hot and heavy here and at first it was annoying a bit, but on repeated listens it feels like the logical extension to how that song should go. These two tracks, along with the hyperactive \\"Sexuality\\" (another funky number), makes for a solid first half of the album.    The remainder of the album is no slouch either. Kicking off with the buoyant pop of \\"Private Joy\\" and concluding with the jaunty \\"Jack U Off\\" Prince adds greater diversity of styles to the mix. The brief and chaotic \\"Ronnie Talk to Russia\\" is a workout of machine-gun blasts, military drumming and Prince's snarling, distorted guitar work. This segues into another funky number \\"Let's Work\\". The only bummer number on this record is \\"Annie Christian\\", which is musically the most out-there track and one I find too tedious to sit through as it doesn't boast of any real melody or chorus to speak of. Lyrically it's an intriguing read, but still far less compelling than \\"Sexuality\\" or \\"Ronnie\\", the other two overtly political songs on this album.    It's hard to top Dirty Mind for Prince's best early work, but on certain days and on certain moments there's nothing better than Controversy.    Final rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars
B002UXRH10|2.0|Did Chris Brown knock her vocal chords out of whack? Why is she singing like this? What's with her voice? The songs on here are sooo bad. Lyrics? Worse! I don't condone violence against anyone and don't mean to make light of the situation, but maybe Chris heard this CD and tried to knock some sense into her. Just sayin'.    Also, I thought it was interesting how, in the weeks and months following the incident, we didn't hear a peep out of her. Then, lo and behold, she has a new album to promote and, by golly, she just felt it was time to speak up. She said she owes it to her fans. Right, more like she owes it to her record company to sell a few Cd's. It would have felt more sincere (and appropriate), to speak out against violence against women immediately after.
B001QWBM62|5.0|To be honest I always went for the big brands (e.g. m-Audio, Tascam, etc.) but lately all that branding was not only overpriced: they were getting old and clumsy. So I went for a new brand with the fear that such a call brings. I was more then surprised: I got the best recording tool in years. It´s dependable, great sound at a good price. There are some down sides: throw away the manual its useless. It takes a while to start up but those are minor things.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Like most reviewers I was blown away by this movie. You truly get lost in this world and come to believe it's REAL.    James Cameron captured every tiny minute detail bringing the forest, the animals, and the natives to life. But what was most astounding was how these digital charters seemed to be possessed by the soles of the actors.   If you saw \\"Beowulf\\" then you know how motion capture doesn't capture everything. The charters in that movie looked somewhat like the actors, but they were lifeless, like hollow puppets.   In \\"Avatar\\" the digital charters have depth, they really come to life, so much so you forget that they're computer generated.    Sure the story is something that has been told before. Even I wished (after picking up my jaw from the floor) that certain charters motivations had been more clearly defined, but what people forget is that this story still has relevance. It's happening in the South American rain forest even as I type this. But the movies majesty makes up for what its lacking in story.    It's ironic that a Eco-minded Mother Earth type story is presented so amazingly by a artificial, technologically advanced medium. The 3D imagery is constant and unobtrusive. He used it to enhance the story rather then be the focus. I had only one slight moment of dizziness at the beginning, but I think that was the intended reaction since the main charter was weightless and floating at the time..:) I just wish he had been able to use the full scope of the IMAX screen, but then it wouldn't be shown in regular theaters.    If your still on the fence about this film...don't hesitate to see it, and if you have the extra money, make sure you see it in IMAX 3D so you can really appreciate it.
0786868724|4.0|Most of my time is spent reading technical journals and books. Unfortunately, this was the first book I have had the opportunity to read by Albom. It will certainly not be my last!<br /><br />While starting out slowly the story picks up speed and brings together the lives of three different, but on some levels, very similar men. Albom takes these three different threads of life and weaves them into a beautiful fabric. In the process of trying to know the inner workings of two very different men of God, he discovers that he also is a man of God.<br /><br />In the same way Albom describes his spiritual growth and understanding through the experiences in this book, I found myself sharing in this reexamination and rekindling of something that should never be luke warm -- my faith in a universal God who loves and accepts each of us--just as we are.
032147404X|3.0|This hold-my-hand-and-show-me-how you do it, is really great for a newbie but if you know what you are doing then just stay away from it. Am a great fun of scott, I watch his every week photoshoptv and have several of his books. This one too what I should warn you about is the second one which is totally rubbish just capitalizing on this which is good enough. if you need to be told what to do on each and every step then this is the book. I think wedding photographers can get a lot out of it, its full of tricks for them.
0380730405|5.0|This review is for the reader thinking -<br /><br />'Yes, I know Rebecca is a classic, and the seminal work of Gothic fiction (where 'the' rhymes with 'tree', not 'duh').  But it a good read?  And how does it compare with the movie?'<br /><br />It's been several weeks since I listened to Rebecca on audio CD, narrated by Anna Massey, and like its title character, the story haunts you long after you've finished the read.<br /><br />Why?  Because the primary characters - Maxim, his brides I and II, Mrs. Danvers - don't so much interact, as haunt each other through the narrative.  Their dialogue, on surface, is formal and prim, yet their conversions are dominated but chilling subtext - innuendo, suggestion, uncomfortable silence, discomforting looks.  Their inner lives dominate each exchange, making Rebecca a wonderful, suspenseful chess game.<br /><br />Anna Massey's audio narration is spot on, capturing male and female characters equally well.<br /><br />The film is classic Hitchcock - filled with beauty and suspense.  However, please read the book first!  No film could ever capture the subtlety of these characters (although Olivier comes close).  Also, the film includes some plot changes - demanded by Hollywood convention at the time - that detract from the story.<br /><br />I strongly recommended listening to the unabridged audio CD, but have no doubt Rebecca would fly off the written page too.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Okay, it goes without saying that this movie is not for everyone. Got it. However, I think it would be unfair NOT to give the movie some credit for at least being creative and taking us in a different direction from what we often see in \\"scary\\" movies these days. And no, you will not see blood or guts; nor will 8 teenagers loose their clothing and then their heads. And finally, sorry, but no zombies will crawl out of the grave and try to eat everyone. If you have definite ideas about what makes a movie scary then you probably will not like this movie. But, if you're up for something different, and not necessarily a horror film, I say check it out.
0307454541|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  I'm not a crime novel enthusiast, but I've read enough to know the parameters of the genre.  To date this is the best crime novel I have ever read.<br /><br />The first 200 pages are good . . . a tad slowish, but there is a sort of easy, good writing style and you keep going, getting used to the swedish names and kind of slow pace.<br /><br />Then, the next 200 pages . . . some stuff happens and it gets real good . . . you start thinking of the book while you're supposed to do other stuff.<br /><br />The final 190 pages . . . you . . . will . . .not . . .. put . . . .it . . . down.  Awesome!

B00288KNJU|4.0|My husband and I were so excited when we purchased our Coraline Blu-Ray movie with the 3D and 2D versions, as well as DVD and digital copy, after having seen it in the theaters we were looking forward to a movie night with some friends to show them the awesome 3D movie! Unfortunately we were vastly disappointed when the glasses proved to be non-polarized cyan and magenta glasses. The 3D version had very muted colors, was only 3D-ish in some parts, and had a constant hue of green or pink. We were exceptionally disappointed with the very poor adaptation, and can only hope that in the future they will be able to sell \\"Real-D\\" instead of the ridiculous two tone glasses for the public. The movie in 2D was still excellent, but lacking some of the WOW you got from the 3D effects we saw in the theatre. Overall, 3D is a waste, but its still an excellently executed movie!

B002FRNCG0|4.0|OK they are young and they are kind of a teen band that can be somewhat hyper-earnest at times. But who cares, they play with sincereity and energy. Their overall sound is the typical american punk-derived emo-type music that can easily go very wrong. But they do have a very good front woman in their singer and the songs are memorable so  this is a good surprise at least. It is better than their previous effort also.
0634022296|5.0|I've had hours of fun sitting around with my acoustic and this book in front of me, flipping to a random Beatles tune and rocking out. Speaking as someone who's been playing music for roughly twenty years, this book is great for some relaxing fun, but I'd also recommend it to anyone looking to learn how to write good pop/rock songs. There's a lot to learn here, and a great value at [...] bucks including shipping. Buy it!
B002NXSRX4|2.0|I'm going to keep it short because this movie isn't worth wasting much time on, but I felt like I had to articulate how much I despise this film.    I knew the movie version was going to differ from traditional GI Joe lore, but adding a Wayans brother to the cast? I kept waiting for the scene were Marlon Wayans would revert to Scary Movie like shtick. Casting him was a game killer.     Here's a spoiler alert too - if your super secret hideout is so easy to find and penetrate that your \\"elite\\" force gets completely owned by a ragtag group of insurgents, maybe it's time to rethink your security measures. Lame.     Giant 'splosions? Michael Bay has nothing on Stephen Sommers. Once again, Hollywood forgoes storytelling and compelling plot in favor of visual effects and bright, shiny, explody things.    I gave it two stars because from a technical point of view, it seemed well filmed. That's were the filmed goodness ended. Save your money, and wait for it to hit basic cable for free.
0811870987|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  My favorite thing about it is how accessible it is to many different audiences.  My dad who is an avid bird watcher really appreciates it, but so do my young nieces and nephews, and it gives them something to talk about with their grandfather-- it even spurred an early morning bird watching trip as a family.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
B000HIVOFU|5.0|This was one of the first SACDs I purchased and I love the quality.  This SACD brings out the best in my system played through the original PS3 (that plays SACDs), I get a real feeling of being there and listening to the music live.  Our favorite is definitely Spanish Harlem. I recommend this disc for anyone really looking to hear the most from their audio system.

B000OVLINI|2.0|Note:  I listened to the book via download from Audible.com.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is the type of book on which I have difficulty reviewing.  It seems like a novel in which symbolism and parallels are plentiful, but the story of which I found eminently boring and tedious.  I had a similar problem with The Road by Cormac McCarthy.  What was probably a meaningful book was drowned in a boring story.  If you are looking for an entertaining and light-hearted read, then this is not a book for you.  If you are looking for a book to contemplate and reflect on, then you may be in luck.  I fall definitively into the former category, leading me to give the book 2 stars.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have owned several pairs of these headphones and I love them. I have very small ears so the \\"in ear\\" headphones do not work for me, they always pop out of my ears while I am on the treadmill. I don't like the \\"outside of the ear\\" headphones because they get all sweaty while working out. These headphones are the perfect compromise. The sound quality is nice and deep for all my digital music devices. I have had one pair wear out after about 5 years of everyday use. I am buying a another new pair right now to go with my new nano for the gym!
B002SQ364Q|4.0|After a second viewing, I think it's not just good, it's Lee's masterpiece.  Elliot's acid trip is as beautiful a piece of filmmaking as I've ever seen.  But what's really wonderful is how the story sneaks up on you, adn you realize it's about the flowering of a human soul.      *    A charmer, and probably a small classic.  The antipathy in some of the low starred reviews is inexplicable.  The film moves gently from scene to scene, gradually revealing surprising things about the characters, but always with a compassion and affection for them that sets Ang Lee apart from other contemporary directors, who seem to delight in hating the people in their own films, and maybe hating humanity.  Watch this after a monster fest like \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" and you'll see the difference between a pretentious poseur and an artist.
0312370849|3.0|Sarah's Key recounts the fate of a Jewish family in Paris in 1942 who were victims of the Vel' d'Hiv.  Thousands of Jews were rounded up by the French police--not the Gestapo--and ultimately sent to their death in Auschwitz.  A particularly horrific aspect of this campaign is that the children were split from their parents and placed in a separate camp prior to being sent to Auschwitz.      Tatiana de Rosnay describes the plight of a particular family through the eyes of ten year old Sarah.  Prior to being ordered to leave their home, she locks her little brother in a secret closet, mistakenly believing the family would be returning home soon.  The author's description of these tragic events makes for compelling reading, and the author should be commended for drawing attention to a bleak chapter in French history that has received comparatively little attention.      Unfortunately, that account only comprises one-third of the book.  The remainder centers on a present-day journalist--Julia Jarmond--writing a story on the Vel' d'Hiv'.  She is an American who has married into a very Parisian family and begins to discover that she has a personal link to the fate of Sarah and her family.    These present day characters are like cardboard cut-outs.  Julia's husband is charming and boorish and doesn't really change.  Julia continuously wonders why she puts up with the antics of her husband.  The dialog is wooden and nobody appears to be listening to what anyone else is saying.  As Julia becomes more and more fixated on learning Sarah's fate, her efforts to find out can only be described as manic and irrational.  Yet these efforts (such as flying to Italy at the drop of a hat when sending a simple email would be more effective) are characterized by the author as praiseworthy in a \\"follow your convictions\\" sort of way.     This book would have been a much better read if it focused more on the events of 1942 and less on the present day.  In particular, the inclusion of a romantic element felt forced and contrived in light of the somber subject matter of the remainder of the book.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar was a wonderful...exciting.....beautifully made, well acted movie with tons of color, fight scenes and lots of movie magic. The plot was good, although  not terribly original. The humans want something, in this case a mineral worth millions for just an ounce, from the natives (8 foot blue people known as Avatars).  The Avatars want to maintain their culture/traditions, beliefs (trees containing the souls of those that have departed) while they keep their land (Pandora) as it is (unsoiled and untouched). The humans don't want to take \\"no\\" for an answer and create a time table for the Avatar to relent or be destroyed. Will Colonel Quariteh and his mighty military dominate? Meanwhile, Dr./Anthropologist Grace Augustine (Weaver) wants to study the Avatar culture and will stop at nothing to protect their interests. She is part of the team that created the technology that allows her to inhabit the body of a genetically grown Avatar while her human form remains safely asleep in a chamber.  Enters the main character played by Sam Worthington (Jake Sully), who was the identical twin brother of a Doctor who was very involved with the project. Sully soon finds himself in quite the dilemma. If he helps the organization find the weakness of the Avatar, they have promised to get his legs back (apparently an expensive surgery that he could not afford if he doesn't do what they want), but this would mean betraying those that he has come to love (Neytiri played by Zoe Saldana).  Jake soon finds that mingling with the Avatar (even if it is for only 3 months during which time he is to betray them) is going to be more complicated than he thought.     There  were several things to love about this movie.  Besides the wonderful acting (Weaver is always great in Sci-Fi movies, and all other characters were equally believable.), the technology used was simply breathtaking. The colors and wonderfully vivid world of Pandora came to life on the 3D/Imax screen.  And while I was expectinga lot, with all the hype and advertising that accompanied this movie, this was one of those rare occasions that I was not disappointed. Whatever you do, take some time out of your life and see Avatar and you will not regret it. And while I know that seeing this on a regular television will not be the same or do this epic drama justice, I will still await the release on DVD.  It will be a wonderful addition to my DVD collection.

After getting a copy for myself, I ordered 4 more and gave them as Christmas presents.  They were extremely well received by all.  Consider this for that person that has \\"everything\\".  Anyone who has even the slightest interest in photography will love this book, but I have found that this book has a profound impact on just about every person who views it.  This is money well spent.  You will not be disappointed!
0618918248|3.0|(Thoughts on reaching Page 82 of \\"Delusion\\")<br /><br />Richard,<br /><br />You may understand when I say there is s:cience (little s) and there is S:cience (big S). s:cience is what us s:cientists do. We scrounge consistencies from the unwilling Universe by guided trial and error and pack them into Mankind's little island of understanding so as to make it larger and more secure so that we may all be larger and more secure. It is what Dr Gould meant. 'God' is meaningless here. S:cience, the worldview side of our endeavor, is the face presented to the rest of the 'world'. This term 'world' is important. It is the collective  psychosis created by all living humans whose active communal values determine the behaviors which allow their particular group identity to pass through time coherently and successfully in competition with all of the other groups with whom they share the 'world'. The 'world' delusion, if you will. What all of us immates here call 'reality'. Mankind looks very different when viewed from outside of the 'world' delusion, much more like an obligate communal bony worm with appendages and an overdeveloped denial system. Our only special tricks are obligate communality, data accretion, and strong intraspecific group competition. Language, personality structure, and the rest come with the lifestyle.<br /><br />S:cience lives in this 'world' and is sort of an interface between the 'world' and the Universe as s:cience sees it. The two worldviews, 'world' and s:cience, are very different. Within the 'world', S:cience is just another religion. It is even developing its own little inquisitional cadre of 'skeptics' and 'atheist fundamentalists'! In what you consider to be the \\"religions\\", I suspect that the mass of the carriers of a 'religion' know little of the actual details of their religion. In a world of S:cience, the carriers would probably understand even less. They would 'believe in' S:cience on, of all things, faith. Who are the main carriers of religion in a multiplexed group structure? We need look only to the convenient distribution curve. Beginning at the highest end (which probably looks like insanity to most of us), and moving toward the Chimpanzee side, we will see a steady increase in the proportion of carriers of religion. There seem to be bands, ranges, where incorporation of the religion is stronger (zealots), whereas carriers of greater capacity can see the holes and those of less capacity see not enough of the story to get excited about. This may be the optimum substrate unit capacity range for that particular religion, akin to the relationship among primates of brain size to maintainable group sizes.<br /><br />Religion is a genetically determined behavior. The 'spiritual' is universal in humans. It is a powerful uniting factor as it was a foundation of every identity group up to the development of multiplexed groups. All gods until that time were war gods. They still are. Necessarily so. War is also a genetically determined behavior. The schism between milieu versus dna in S:cience does not exist in s:cience. It is all one thing, the data of the gene pool and the data of the brain, they move through time as interacting data bodies constantly accreting more information to ultimately use to eat the group next door, which is our sole external collective behavior as groups. We are a very primitive organism, indeed. We must become generally aware of that.<br /><br />You cannot argue religion away in the 'world'. Every religion is engaged in the same argument. Mine, not yours. If a religion loses its substrate, its carriers, it goes extinct with the demise of the last carrier. Like any simple organism, a religion contains mechanisms to avoid this fate. It is not necessary to destroy religions, just modify out their more objectionable qualities. Religions are perfectly serviceable subunits when properly multiplexed into a larger group. Religions constantly bud. These buds move off, grow, and come back tocompete with their parent. This increases the frequency and competitiveness of wars through time. The switch from wiping out our clademates to going to work on ourselves was probably unnoticeable. Information was the difference between winning and losing and the more of it you could carry as a group, and the more organised it was, the more you ate their children rather than they ate yours. Real holocaust to the losers was assured. Strong slective pressure for greater data storage, not so much for data processing. And the larger your brain became to carry the increasing data. And the more of your females died in birthing.<br /><br />50,000 generations from the mostly agreed upon date of controlled fire, 1.2MYA, and this is as far as we have come. The greatest intellects that man might hope to produce have lived and died and this is as far as we have come. An appallingly large portion of our 'world', our collective worldview, is ruled by magic. And thus it will always be. Even in a perfectly S:cientific 'world', for most it would still be magic and faith, with S:cience the only Authority. Boring.<br /><br />But, yes, what to do about religion's propensity for war, its most objectionable characteristic and good reason to modify it. War permeates our entire structure. Any group weak in war went extinct long ago. We cannot stop war. We can redirect war. If we redirect war to, say, the reproduction of Gaia, our only possible justification for what our existence is doing to the current biospheric homeostasis, we might be able to effect this through the religions. The reproductive effort itself would offer many inducements, huge expenditures difficult to track through corporate accounting mazes, way more contracts than any 'defense' ministry could hope to churn out. And no need to blow up large buildings in one's own country to justify a war. At some point in the promotion for \\"Mankind's Seed Into the Universe\\", it will be stated that religions will not be allowed. We expect to meet other civilizations and we don't want earthly religions trying to parasitize or convert them. I, in my cynicism, believe this will provide the fire that, properly directed, could redirect war and propel Gaia outward. The earth would go to seed. The humans selected to inhabit our vehicle will of necessity then be selected from all of the religions with any kind of political skill (including high explosives) at asserting their will, at their insistence (and assistance). Since this 'seed' will, of needs, be a living seed, the selected will then say goodbye and be separated for 'training', that is, a thorough reprogramming, with 'zealots' and 'fanatics' returned as unfit. Losing those sorts is a serious handicap to the group but if anything should be left alive by arrival of our seed at its target, we must cripple the group to this extent. We will have no control of how the group develops over time in a spinning 16 km by 10 km cylinder. If we can sell the religios, though, I think the sociopathic corporates will come along. Gold will flow like wine. Endless space construction contracts. The promise of bazillions of civilizations out there ripe for redemption and compound interest. A whole planet of Jerry Falwell's People? The planet Exxon? and lots of money to be had by all. Really. Might work as a concept. S:cience must begin to use more sophisticated tools if we are to be the Queen of Religions. And war is bad for us all. It seriously diminishes our future probability. And it is archaic. The lab folks are suggesting that the human brain stopped expanding about 6 to 8000 years ago (appearance of external data storage, writing). War still fuels data accretion but its human extinctive potential negates any evolutionary value it might still have for us. It has become a disease, a design flaw.<br /><br />A tougher nut will be nationalism. If the 'world', while maintaining its competing identity groups, could be subverted to a 'primary' identity of Human, the universal group inhibition on killing members of the same group might be spread over us all. I wonder how many religious or seriously nationalistic biologists there are amongst us. If S:cientists learn to proselytize seductively rather than just dialectically (expecting the mass of humans to suddenly accept truths for which they are neither ready to understand nor, very often, capable of understanding), it could be done. s:cientists are busy accreting our understanding and security but S:cientists, with their communication skills, have to take s:cience to the street. Not S:cience, the religious part. I mean, ask a general audience what is evolution and you will get many and varied responses mostly to do with monkeys. Ask what is natural selection and not so many responses. For many with the little darwinfishes on their vehicles, natural selection has yet to complicate their view of evolution. Yet, they believe. Not s:cience's data but S:cience's Power and Authority is what makes them believers. Religion. Forgive me, but what you are asserting is the Trueness of one religion over another. That our religion (S:cience) is rooted in the structure of the Universe matters not. In many ways, their's is too. You are arguing, which is simply war in its early stages. It's not the way. If we are to become the dominant religion, S:cience must study the processes that religion has developed EVOLUTIONARILY to recruit and instill belief systems, and apply them. S:cience is still on the rise but we need to provide the average human with a coherent worldview they can use in their daily lives. And, we must develop a deliverable value system that creates behaviors beneficial to the group as a whole (humanity). In that regard, we must not let these retired rabbi/priest/ethicists continue to invade our academic enclaves. They are the worst of religion in disguise. Drive them out. We must develop our own ethos that includes all Life and unrelated in its origins to anything extant today. We must derive an ethos from the Universe and not the red in fang and claw universe that humans now live in thanks to religions, and nationalisms, and not being as removed from the chimpanzee as we might wish.<br /><br />S:cience needs to start training guides like Mormonism trains missionaries. We need to develop a series of lessons for kids that build one central value into those children, we are all the same, our skin and bones and brains and emotions and group structures, except for inconsequentials like language and dress, are almost identical. It is not necessary to stress our developmental ancestry or to 'prove' the improbability of some god or to kneejerk the religios in any way at all. In the 'world', truth is held by the majority. That entire majority starts out as children and Confucious, Jesus, Hitler et al have explicitly pointed out the significance of this fact. We can prove our less inflammatory assertions in very concrete ways. Because religions regard S:cience as more or less neutral, and, without the hot buttons, necessary, religions and nationalisms allow us access to their children. We could build common identity, hence common homocidal inhibition into the children right under the noses of the religios and sociopaths. If there is an optimum carrier (individual substrate unit) capacity range that produces the strongest adherents, we must identify and concentrate on this subgroup. Only we can do it. Jihad or crusade or simple butchery of a captive population (Gaza) don't mean much to you if you really don't want to kill anyone. Gods do exist, Richard, and they have exactly the power of the group upon and within whom they live. The question you could address, instead, might be the characteristics of that which is to us as we are to an earthworm. Have you seen anything in science that would preclude such beings? I have not. Are we the best or most complicated this Universe can do? If we could be aware of them, what might we call such beings? Don't chokeon the word.<br /><br />How did you like Last and First Men? I should like to hear your opinion of Stapledon.<br /><br />William Bjornson<br />Aloha, Oregonght be spread over us all. I wonder how many religious or seriously nationalistic biologists there are amongst us.

It is not necessary to stress our developmental ancestry or to 'prove' the improbability of some god or to kneejerk the religios in any way at all. In the 'world', truth is held by the majority. That entire majority starts out as children and Confucious, Jesus, Hitler et al have explicitly pointed out the significance of this fact. We can prove our less inflammatory assertions in very concrete ways. Because religions regard S:cience as more or less neutral, and, without the hot buttons, necessary, religions and nationalisms allow us access to their children. We could build common identity, hence common homocidal inhibition into the children right under the noses of the religios and sociopaths. If there is an optimum carrier (individual substrate unit) capacity range that produces the strongest adherents, we must identify and concentrate on this subgroup. Only we can do it. Jihad or crusade or simple butchery of a captive population (Gaza) don't mean much to you if you really don't want to kill anyone. Gods do exist, Richard, and they have exactly the power of the group upon and within whom they live. The question you could address, instead, might be the characteristics of that which is to us as we are to an earthworm. Have you seen anything in science that would preclude such beings? I have not. Are we the best or most complicated this Universe can do? If we could be aware of them, what might we call such beings? Don't choke on the word.    How did you like Last and First Men? I should like tohear your opinion of Stapledon.    William Bjornson  Aloha, Oregon
0545140315|4.0|In The Lonely Hearts Club, Elizabeth Eulberg focuses on the strength of friendship, and how that will always be more important than a high school boyfriend who, more than likely, you won't remember in a few years. She's written a fun, lighthearted book that I'm sure hundreds of teenage girls will relate to. After all, who hasn't been hurt by a boy you thought was the one?    Penny Lane Bloom has her heart broken by her childhood sweetheart, and swears off boys for good. Her new outlook on life leads to the creation of The Lonely Hearts Club -- a club that soon grows in popularity and includes a good portion of McKinley High's female population. It's a genius idea and, as I mentioned above, encourages Penny and her friends to turn to each other, rather than their latest guy who's only after one thing. It's like attack of solidarity and sisterhood, and it's a fantastic message to girls everywhere. Hoes over bros, indeed.    Penny's Beatles-obsessed parents are a fantastic addition to the character list, and their tendency to be slightly embarrassing is a constant source of humour. I think I related to them the most, because I know what it's like to love something as much as they love The Beatles. A true love of music, books or a TV show, or whatever it might be, is the best feeling in the world. It can take over your life, yes, but you never get that much enjoyment from anything else. At least, I don't. (Special thanks go to Joss Whedon and Stephenie Meyer for my obsessions!)    Everything that Penny, Tracy and Diane learn about friendship, love and boys is made possible through joining The Lonely Hearts Club. Lifelong bonds are formed, and they come away with the knowledge that it's alright to do things for themselves.     The Lonely Hearts Club is a great read for fans of intelligent, realistic fiction, and Eulberg's writing is brilliant. I can't wait to read whatever she writes next, and I hope it'll be just as good as her debut offering.
B002Z4C3K4|5.0|This concert is everything it should be: Cliff & the boys are in such amazing shape, it's hard to believe they're all Old Age Pensioners!  They're on top form, and the O2 Arena is packed.  I must admit I prefer Cliff's rockers to the ballads, but he's a complete professional whatever he does.<br /><br />The picture and the editing are both excellent &mdash; as is the sound, which provides a choice of Dolby 2.0 or 5.1.<br /><br />But not only does Amazon not provide a set list &mdash; there isn't even one on or in the DVD case!

0307269981|5.0|I loved Larsson's first book, and the second one was just as fun, intriguing and interesting to read. I couldn't put it down (really) and enjoyed it to the end. I eagerly anticipate the third book this coming year.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Listening to the voice of Susan Boyle is one of life's truly magnificent experiences.  I can't believe it took the world this length of time to discover her amazing talent.  I am usually disappointed with CDs I purchase as they don't live up to my expectations but not this one.  I may need to purchase another so that I will still have one when I wear out the first from listening over and over.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|My daughter really loves LADY GAGA so she is really happy with the CD. Great songs!!
0698400852|5.0|This is a wonderful book. The drawings alone are worth the price of the book. Each drawing is beautifully done and follows along with the story. This is the unabrdged edition which I personally prefer; however, be aware that there will be an occassional paragraph with old English words and references that will be difficult to understanad unless you are an English scholar. These are infrequent and do not detract from the story - in fact, it adds charm and authenticity. Better than having some editor arbitrarily determining what you should read and what should be cut out. I believe the Amazon price for this book was $12.00 - an amazing bargain. Ingpen, the artist, has illustrated many other \\"childrens\\" books and we will be buying them. Highly recommended. Arrived quickly and in good condition.
B000MZHW40|5.0|In 1999, in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. Solomon finds a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels are attacked and Salomon is arrested by the government army. While in jail, the wounded commandant tell the prisoners that Salomon found the stone, and the mercenary smuggler Danny Archer from Zimbabwe releases Salomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Using the idealistic American journalist Maddy Bowen, Danny locates the wife and daughters of Salomon in a refugee camp, but is informed that his son has been recruited by the rebels. Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption. This movie is a work of amazingly orchestrated chaos. A visually sumptuous, bullet-train-paced thriller with a really provocative theme. A must see movie.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Castle since the first episode aired. The DVD set of the first season was fantastic to be able to watch all these episodes again. Castle shows the real acting talent of Nathan Fillion, beyond what fans saw in Firefly and Serenity. If you are afasn this is a great DVD set you will love.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|Righteous Kill was an amazing drama/action movie. The movie really made you think you know who the killer is but then you get lots of twists and turns. The acting was amazing. Al Pachino was brilliant and very entertaining. Robert Deniro did a great job as well playing a hot headed cop. The movie it ended on a great level.
1594488843|5.0|I really hope all managers and executives at companies read this book by Dan Pink. He really illustrates what motivates us at work very nicely, with clear examples, research and more. At a time when motivation is hard to come by, Drive is the missing manual for your success, as well as your companies.  After reading this book, you'll know exactly what you need to do to make a difference in your life today.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|United State's Central Intelligence Agency's Middle East Representative, Roger Ferris, is based in Amman, Jordan, and is keeping a watch on a 'safe house' and believes it to be frequented by young Muslim males. He has information that Al Saleem may be behind terrorist attacks, but lacks any evidence to apprehend him or any of his associates. His plan to implicate Dubai-based Architect, Omar Sadiki, not only fails, his Iranian girlfriend, Aisha, gets abducted, and he must decide whether to surrender himself to her abductors to negotiate her release or leave her to their mercy. Leo does it again. Great story line with some unexpected twists. This movie is worth seeing a second time. Russell Crowe is so witty in his supporting role, excellent movie.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Great recording of the who in a live performance!  How could you not be happy with this?
630460291X|5.0|I love this film, everything about it I love. The story, the humor, the intrigue, the romance and even the special cameo of Sean Connery at the end of the film. This is a awesome movie.
B000065V9Y|5.0|I was shocked and surprised to read the Editorial review by Rob Stewart.  This is one of Peter Gabriel's best albums.  Way way way better than 'Sledgehammer' or 'Big'!  This is one of my favorite albums - it has some of the most meanful, insightful and introspective songs.  I encourage you to listen to the album in its entirety - you won't regret it.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|This movie is one of the rare gems of the science fiction genre...it is sophisticated and beautifully stylized offering a complete sense of immersion into the DUNE universe. I really enjoyed this movie.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This quiet chiller should be designated as the prime model all aspiring film makers should study before attempting their own horror movie.  It's fresh, original and guaranteed to raise the hairs on the back of your neck.  Mercifully free of the anticipated cliches, the protagonists are two  pre-teen children caught up in a web of vampirism that is full of surprises for the viewer.  I have the Blu-Ray version and it is beautiful with sharp images and great sound.  You can feel the extra chill of the cold winter nights during which the action takes place.  If you want to go where no vampire flick has ever gone before, this is truly the right one to let in!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|This one has everything, starting with a knockout performance from Matt Damon in what may become his signature role. A superior action-movie sequel in every sense of the word.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I had all the Beatles albums on vynil (33 1/3 RPM) and the sound quality was wonderful.  I also had the original boxed set of the CD's of all thier albums and although they were covenient and the sound was adequate, it was not the same as the original albums.  This new set is as close as I will ever get to the sound quality of the originals.  I was carried back 30-40 years in my memory. Incredible.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|It's intense fun that never slows down or takes the easy way out, making it one of the coolest movies. A most purely enjoyable movie.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I've been a casual fan of 30STM in the past, but this CD is definitely on my Top 10 of 2009. I've listened to it over and over and have yet to tire of it. The songs evoke a vivid emotional reponse that can't help but pull you into the music. Personally, the best albums are the ones that tell a story...which this ones does flawlessly. These songs would fit perfectly in some Mad Max/Terminator-type end of the world movie. \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is one of my favorites. The change in style about a minute and a half into it (and yes, this is where the \\"whispering\\" pops up that other reviewers have complained about) and the way the song leads you up and down until it's conclusion-the imagery it provokes makes this an incredible song. \\"Night of the Hunter\\" is another stand-out entry on the album. The music and lyrics compliment each other impeccably. How can anyone not love the lyrics: \\"Honest to God I'll break your heart, Tear you to pieces and rip you apart\\"? The progression of one track to the next is a smooth one. My advice for anyone even remotely interested in this CD is to pick it up, sit back with the headphones on, close your eyes and let the music take you away......
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Movie about a real-life heist that delivers old-fashioned thrills. A masterful narrative full of odd twists and dark humor. The pleasure comes in watching one character after another get tangled up in a plot they all think they're controlling.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Some of her songs are wonderful and some are just OK.  There didn't seem to be any continuity in the selections for the album.  Religious, musicals, Christmas carol, love song, soul searching, you name it.  Personally, I could have done with out the hymns.  I would like to see a bit more of a theme in her next CD.  That being said, I am a big fan of Susan Boyle.
B000HA4WTI|5.0|This movie delivers all the races and crashes you could possibly desire, and a little more. The Drifting was really impressive. I recommend this movie to anyone who like auto racing.
0882709194|1.0|I have to agree with most of the negative things that people have said about this work. My wife brought it home from college, because she was given it by a non-campus christian groups that was handing them out. As an anthropologist, who has had to study both Darwinianism and Neo-Darwinism, as well as genetics, myth, folklore, religion, etc...(all of the things we study), I thought that it was truly laughable. It was a little too transparent. I have read intelligent design (ID)works by actual biologists, like \\"Darwin's Black Box,\\" so I know that there are much more interesting and logically consistent arguments for ID out there, yet the author of this books forward invokes none of them. There is no talk of \\"irreducible complexity,\\" for example, which is the usual linchpin of ID.   Rather the author uses very simplistic, unscientific, and rather uneducated statements to make his point. I seriously doubt that he even understood the text that he was writing the forward for. The publisher can be found here: [...]    I understand what they are doing, because on top of being an anthropologist, I am also in the U.S. Army reserve as a psychological operations operator. We're known as the \\"hearts and minds\\" guys, who do propaganda analysis and counter propaganda, among other things. We figure out what makes the enemy tick, and how to get them to do things. Integral to this process of non-violent motivation, is to frame a persuasive message in a way that is understandable, acceptable, doable, and within a credible medium. This book is a very bad example of this process, but it is probably effective enough for non-science majors on college campuses, and most Americans who might be interested in looking at a free copy of such a famous work, only to get discouraged from the intro.; probably the first introduction to Darwin or Evolutionary theory that most of the people reading it have.     It took me a solid 2 years to really understand modern evolutionary theory via formal university education, and I'm pretty good with abstract concepts. Many of my peers had a lot of problems with the nuances of how evolution proceeds, and what modern theory states and does not state. It is not simple. You have to think very critically. The author states that \\"nothing can come from nothing,\\" and, \\"with all that we know, no human being can even create a grain of sand from nothing.\\" Darwin doesn't, and no one else, posits this. This is a category mistake.   Such things lead to infinite regression. If god created everything, because nothing can come from nothing, then someone must have created god, ad infinitum. Basic flow of logic, and I'm amazed that more people don't automatically see that. Neo-Darwinism does not posit that it explains the absolute origin of life, and if someone wants to believe in a divine spirit being that cause, then they are free to do so. They can even posit a divine, or intelligent, hand in the process itself if they want. They can do the same for gravity, and call it intelligent falling if they want.     Just because many Darwinists are atheists has nothing to do with the theory. It's a lack of imagination on their part, because people view this debate not in terms of religion versus science, but of Judeo-Christian religion versus science. Chaos theory shows very well how new information is produced within dynamic systems every moment, so these people are also stuck in a single domain of knowledge. Religion comes from the Greek, meaning, \\"to bind to the truth.\\" It is the antithesis of religion,therefore, to believe in what one things over what one can see or prove; it is the quest for knowledge and truth. As a Buddhist, I personally have no conflict between Neo-Darwinism and my religion. Of course, I also have no theistic god, or creation story. If I did, then I would see these as a culmination of man's quest to understand the human condition using myth, metaphor and allegory.      The answer to all of this foolishness is the simplestatement:     I do not know, and science is not a discipline for discovering truth, but eliminating falsehood in ways that can be tested. If you want truth take philosophy or poetry, and stop bastardizing science into something that it is not intended for. We lean the what, where, when, and the how from science, not the why.
6304711891|5.0|This is a great film. This film has action everywhere and a great plot. Sean Connery and Nick Cage are fantastic in this movie. When it comes to pure action, this movie has it.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|i looved this book and couldnt put it down! but i found the ending was wayyy too predictable..otherwise i cant wait for the moive!
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|So continues the story of the war between Lycans and Vampires. And like the first instalment of this series, this movie does not skimp on action or leather clad heroines. Underworld Evolution is as good as it gets. Highly recommend this one.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|I own most of Diana's CDs and bought this one on an impulse (great pic).  However, what a disappointment!  I couldn't believe her breathy singing style that was a complete turn-off.  And, her piano playing lacked any excitement or drive.  I find her best with her small group.  She was terrific at Red Butte Garden in SLC last summer and it was clear she hadn't lost any of her earlier vibrancy.  Time to go back to the jazz roots.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Great acting, especially by Will Smith. Even better visuals, it really made it seem like you were in 2035. The city looked great and the cars were neat. The story was somewhat predictable but there are enough twists and turns to keep you very intrested in the movie. Have a open mind and you will love it!
B001OQCV60|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has been identified by the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the most frequently used fictional characters in history.  Appearing first in the 60 stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he has subsequently went on to make hundreds (if not thousands) of appearances in novels, film, television, and radio, with the part essayed by a number of very talented actors, with Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett the most notable.  Adventures on the big screen have been slim pickings for a while (the last really notable one was 1985's \\"Young Sherlock Holmes\\", obviously a bit of a break with traditional formulas) as TV adaptations have been the go-to medium.  This new entry aims to jumpstart a new cinema franchise and introduce Holmes as a living character to a new generation of fans (as opposed to just being a cultural touchstone), with the assistance of talents like Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.  This has been met with understandable wariness by longtime fans, but I would say that overall the movie succeeds admirably at its goal.  Some spoilers follow.    The bare bones of the plot (summarized in innumerable places elsewhere):  Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Law) crack the case of a series of ritualistic murders and arrest the man responsible, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong; doing a lot of villain-work this year, and looking like a British crossbreed of Andy Garcia and Stanley Tucci).  However, even after Blackwood is hung by the neck until dead, trouble continues, and it appears that he may indeed have risen from the grave thanks to the black magic he claimed to possess.  Holmes is back on the trail of the seemingly-resurrected villain, while former acquaintance Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) reenters the picture, in the employ of an anonymous stranger.  And on the domestic front, Watson is getting engaged to the nice Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly) and preparing to move out of his Baker Street bachelor flat, much to Holmes' annoyance.    I would say that this film has been somewhat poorly-represented by its trailers and promotional material (not poorly served, though, if the box office returns are any measure), which plays up the action to a point that will turn off many diehards (though one imagines they'll still see it to feel the joy of bilious outrage).  While there is certainly more physicality to this production than to your average BBC adaptation, director Guy Ritchie retains the core of Holmes as a cerebral man (and, truth be told, Doyle's original knew his way around a fight, even if the author didn't spare much prose on depicting it).  Tastes change a bit, and, so long as the core of the character isn't lost, it's fine by me to show him in a few scraps.      Downey's Holmes is a brilliant/eccentric mind with addiction issues, and rather poor hygiene (I tend to think of him as being more precise, even when troubled, but whatever).  But he's always on top of things.  Saints be praised, though, for Jude Law's Watson, who will hopefully go a long way toward rescuing the character from the bumbling ghetto created by Nigel Bruce's characterization and carried on ever since.  Law gives us a strong, confident Watson who is an indispensible part of Holmes' operation, and possessed of considerable deductive prowess of his own.  The film really hangs on the Holmes/Watson interaction, and Downey and Law hit it off marvelously.  The film opens in media res (a smart move, really; it's not like anyone is unaware of who these characters are and how they work), and you get a palpable sense of two people who've been working together for a very long time.  The ladies threatening to intrude on this male-bonding exercise, McAdams and Reilly, are both fine, though the writers sometimes seem a bit unsure of what to do with Irene (they know enough about the mythos to know that Holmes isn't the romantic type, even if this is a bit more in that direction than most depictions, so this is a fairly mild case of Catwoman).  Mark Strong glowers andgrowls sufficiently as the villain.    While heavier on the action than your typical Holmes story, and a lot grimier in its production design (true to life, one imagines; outside of the upper class, Victorian London wasn't the cleanest of places), Ritchie and his writers retain a lot of the core Holmes story aspects.  A villain with seemingly mystical powers must be confronted, and Holmes' logical mind must inevitably pierce the veil and uncover the rational explanation behind it all (outlined in a marvelous little climactic scene).  And, as we find out, Holmes has been slowly building his case through the whole movie, but rarely letting anything on.  The film also does a pretty good job of making Holmes' end-of-film explanation visually interesting, rather than just a dull monologue.      The film ends with some quite obvious sequel setup, and given the box office numbers, it's pretty likely we'll see a \\"Sherlock Holmes 2\\" in a few years; I welcome it.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood proves yet again that he is the best living director. I really enjoyed this movie. Clint Eastwood's fans won't be disapointed...neither will movie lovers. This is a home run.
B002ONC9MS|4.0|\\"An Education\\" is a compact little British drama that has been making the rounds in 2009, earning favourable reviews with a particular emphasis on the starmaking performance of its lead actress, which has already been recognized by numerous awards organizations with nominations.  Directed by Lone Scherfig, this film boasts considerably more pleasures than just the work of Carey Mulligan, though it is Mulligan's performance that will be remembered in the long-run (hopefully in what will be a lengthy career on the screen).  The film comes with a screenplay by popular British writer Nick Hornby, adapted from a memoir by journalist Lynn Barber that describes experiences approximate to the ones depicted here (standard allowances being made for dramatics).  Some plot details are discussed, so be warned.    Jenny (Mulligan) is a 16-year-old aspirant Oxfordian in early 1960s Britain (which is more or less still 50s Britain; the era we think of as the \\"60s\\" culturally didn't really start until about midway through the decade), whose parents (Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour) have been rigourously preparing her to achieve entry into the nation's top university, to the extent of mapping out her life to conform to Oxford's entrance requirements (her father informs her at one point that while she must play the cello, thus enabling her to list it as a hobby, it isn't required that she devote so much time as to actually become really good at it).  Jenny is grasping for whatever straws of sophistication she can find in this rather bland atmosphere (anything French, for example; the albums of Juliette Greco) when she encounters David (Peter Sarsgaard), an older man who soon whisks her into a much more glamourous existence alongside his friends Danny and Helen (Dominic Cooper and Rosamund Pike, the latter having costarred with Mulligan in 2005's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" film; Mulligan was Kitty, Pike Jane).  This new world eventually dazzles her parents, but ruffles the feathers of her school authorities (Emma Thompson and Olivia Williams) in different ways.  Inevitably, things will go awry.    Mulligan's performance has attracted most of the critical and awards attention, not undeservedly.  A minor presence prior to this, this is the sort of performance that opens doors for actors, and one can only hope Mulligan will take advantage of it.  That said, she's supported more than adequately by the rest of the cast, with Alfred Molina being particularly strong as her father.  Also notable is Rosamund Pike, who's clearly enjoying herself playing the marvelously dim Helen; and Peter Sarsgaard (sporting what appears to be a credible British accent; being Canadian, I will of course defer to the judgment of actual Britons who wish to disagree), who has to walk a particularly fine line.  His character is, really, a creep, but he has to simultaneously be charming enough to sell the idea that anyone else would put up with him while creepy enough that the film doesn't glamourize this sort of relationship.  He pulls it off.  Plot-wise, there are a few weak parts; I thought it was a bit excessive to have David and Danny go around randomly lifting stuff, in addition to their more important morality problems.  And, as has been noted elsewhere, the film doesn't end especially well.  It doesn't quite seem to know how to wrap things up, and Jenny's recovery after hitting nadir feels rather perfunctory (not to mention, surely it's not just Oxford or bust).  Some sort of final reckoning with David would probably have been a better way to go here.    All in all, well worth a viewing.
B00023B1LC|5.0|A fine bit of spy-thriller and skillful action movie. This action thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. It has some of the most awesome chase scenes. Matt Damon gives a believable depth to the Bourne character.

B000M341QE|5.0|This movie has energy. Keeping you somewhat off-kilter and unsure where things are headed. This twisting, turning tale blazes its exciting, funny, with a brutal path. A must see movie.
B000002G9S|3.0|The album starts beautifully with \\"Fire and Water\\", but as you keep listening to it from beginning to end, it keeps losing its momentum, with the exception of the popular \\"All Right Now\\". Approach with caution.
0790729709|5.0|The film is excellent, great for watching any night of the week. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston acted brilliantly in this movie. Even though it's a old movie, it's like a new movie everytime.
B00005OBSD|5.0|First album by the band. Most of the material is original, and their version of Albert King's \\"The Hunter\\" is awsome! The guitar sounds very distorted, probably due to the John Mayall & The Bluesbrekers With Eric Clapton album's influence on player Paul Kossoff. It's raw, simple and very passionate. They never sounded better than they did on this first album.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is the most satisfying thriller and mind-blowing action. This movie gets under way with a burst of nervous energy and extreme urgency and never lets up. The cool thing about this movie is that the real revenge is not against bad guys in the CIA, but against the high-tech world that maddens mere mortals. Terrific stunts and chases through crowded streets, buildings and rooftops.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|If you haven't seen this show, see it.  If you like vegan, metrosexual life type shows, go watch \\"Friends\\" and eat a tofu burger.  If you are a man or woman who likes drama and entertainment without the neurotic crap, this is a show.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This movie is awesome. Theres nothing like watching a good action movie.Not only is it interesting it is also funny I do not think I will be able to ever forget this movie. I mean who can forget all those awesome cars. There are very few good car action movies and this is one of them. There are also some great actors in this movie so I suggest that everyone must see this movie.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This is really fun for me to listen to. The songs are more vibrant and convey a wide range of emotions and musical styles. This is a more mature album in tone than The fame, especially the song \\"So happy I could die,\\" it's about a woman longing for another woman. Lady Gaga is fresh and hip and couldn't be more timely than right now.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I loved it!. The gun fights, the action, The effects all great!. Kate Beckensale is mesmerizingly beautiful in this role. The Werewolves were beleiveable firece. This is every Vampires/Warewolf fans dream come true.
1416572287|4.0|First, I'm not a physics trained person, nor am I a scientist.  I do have two master degrees and have taught Economics, Quantitative Analysis and Decision Making as well a Production Management among other courses in a college/university setting.  I am an amateur astronomer and have been for 30 years so I have a more than passing interest in quantum theories of several kinds and feel reasonably (for a layman) comfortable with relativity.<br /><br />In general I'm not qualified to comment on the accuracy of the science contained in the book.  In fact, I read these books with a clear assumption that I'm not qualified to accept or reject any of the scientific ideas or proofs that the book contains and that the reason I'm reading the book is to learn something.  How to Teach Physics to Your Dog by Chad Orzel certainly has a lot to teach and hopefully, even though I don't need a flea collar and can't lick certain parts of my body, I absorbed a lot of it.  This is not the first book on physics that I've read and it won't be the last (hopefully), so I appreciate Orzel's attempt at making a somewhat difficult and complicated subject understandable to the common reader.  His conversations with Emmy..... actually, it would be fairer to say \\"discourses\\", did illuminate some of the dark corners of the topic for me, but all in all, the dog thing didn't really work for me.<br /><br />How to Teach Physics to Your Dog covers all of the subjects you'd expect.  The footnotes are especially helpful as is the glossary.  Of all of the chapters the last chapter \\"Beware of Evil Squirrels: Misuses of Quantum Physics\\" is the most interesting.  How could you not enjoy readying about a squirrel with a goatee and free energy? (this is a tease)<br /><br /> I know other reviewers have praised How to Teach Physics to Your Dog, but honestly, I found the dog interaction a little distracting.  I think Physics for Dummies, or Quantum Physics for Dummies would be just as effective....not as entertaining, but it would also shed light in dark places.<br /><br />I'm still rating this book at four stars, but I can only give a lukewarm recommendation.hed light in dark places.

0061914177|5.0|I first heard of Gary Vaynerchuk a few weeks ago when Pat Flynn praised Vaynerchuk in his blog.  Since the book was cheap, I bought it and I'm that I did.     I wouldn't call this a motivational book because those tend to use the same advice (You have to follow your passion, you have to do what you love, you have to work hard, etc), but don't give any specific advice on HOW to accomplish it.  Not this book.    The book breaks down step by step what to do to make a career online doing something you love.  He tells you which tools to use, what to spend money on and what not to.  His advice in the book makes it easier to pick something to make money with, but for those who don't feel that they know enough about any one thing, Vaynerchuk goes as far as to give an email address and invite readers to contact him so they can brainstorm together.  I can't imagine how much Tony Robbins would charge for that.    On top of that, as a bonus of sorts, Vaynerchuk gives a list at the end of the book of ideas that he feels strongly will be huge money makers but that he's not going to pursue himself!  He's very honest throughout the book that it will take long, hard work.  He writes that you can expect to be glued to your computer until 3:00am every night, then back up at 6:00am the next day and it can take a year or more to succeed, so anyone looking for easy, get rich quick advice won't find it in this book.  However, if, like me, you want to try your hand at using the internet to be your own boss but you find the process intimidating (I don't fully understand what Twitter is yet), then this book can help ease you into your new career.

0895260131|5.0|I just finished reading this book and wanted to share with you one of the many gems of this book. \\"What we are fighting today is not precisely a 'war on terror.' Terror is a tactic not an opponent. To wage a 'war on terror' is like waging a 'war on bombs;' it focuses on a tool of the enemy instead of the enemy itself. A refusal to identify the enemy is extremely dangerous. It leaves those who refuse vulnerable to being blindsided.\\" This book is meticulously referenced and powerfully written. It is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the mindset on those who conduct these attacks on our freedom.

Its a little twisted but great. The idea is to make something new and different, and this is. If you like things that stray from the norm this is for you. If you don't buy it, rent it, you must see this movie ! \\"Thanks\\" to P.Jackson for knowing art when he sees it and haveing the wit to produce it.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I was a Lady Gaga skeptic but became enamored with her wildly entertaining live theatrics.  Seeing that she's a talented singer and pianist, I bought \\"The Fame\\" and was entertained, but still felt a bit disappointed.<br /><br />\\"The Fame Monser\\" has a life of its own.  It falls to none of the shortcomings of its predecessor (i.e., too much autotune) and builds on all the strengths.  It's obvious that Lady Gaga's strength is variety.  None of the songs sound alike, and you can't possibly get bored listening to the album.  Lyrical content is similar to her debut in that she keeps it playful and fun.  Even though she's still happy to offer some serious content, she does so without alienating the casual listener by sounding pretentious.<br /><br />Every track is a standout and could be its own single.  We learn something new in this album as well.  Lady Gaga cowrote every song on her debut album.  On \\"The Fame Monser,\\" Lady Gaga cowrote every song except \\"Speechless,\\" which was written entirely by her.  \\"Speechless\\" is, if not the best song on the album, then one of the top two - tied with the updated, Ace-of-Base-esque (only better) style of \\"Alejandro.\\"  It made me want to hear an album that she writes entirely on her own.  It's clear she has the talent to do so, and one wonders just how much these other \\"cowriters\\" really contribute.  :-)<br /><br />Some people are complaining that this album is censored.  I don't think an uncensored version is available.  Bit** and Fu** are both censored in the album.  I would assume this was done to avoid the dreaded \\"Parental Advisory\\" stamp that kills album sales.  To be perfectly honest, I'm not offended by profanity, but the censoring did not annoy me.  If you're singing along, as this album FORCES you to do, you won't even notice.

B001GM28HO|3.0|This debut album by Lady Gaga boasts a whopping four number one singles.  When I heard that figure, I had to pick up this album and give it a try.  Please don't let my 3-star rating fool you; I liked this album a lot.  It was not a weak debut.<br /><br />The fun dance-pop style is easy on the ears.  Although many of the songs are lyrically light, the album is peppered with the occasional societal commentary that seems to come from left field but fits in perfectly.<br /><br />The singles from the album are, of course, the strongest offerings.  On top of that, there are no songs on the album that sound anything like any of the others; a feat that not many songwriters manage to pull off.  Despite these great songs and the overall variation, I found myself growing tired of the album after a while.  This was partially due to the album's overuse of autotuning. With a great singer like Lady Gaga, auto-tune should be avoided or at least used sparingly.  Lady Gaga clearly does NOT have any pitch problems, so why ruin a potentially great song like \\"Paper Gangsta\\" by autotuning the crap out of it?<br /><br />Lady Gaga also abuses the \\"rap interlude\\" in the songs.  With such a mastery of lyrical and melodic variety, I'm surprised that she uses this same tact in so many songs.  These two drawbacks would normally not be enough for me to dock a rating so much, but with 14 tracks, these issues make it difficult to get through the entire album in one listen, which is really a shame.<br /><br />All in all, I like the album and think it's worth the money.  Lady Gaga is coming into her own with this album, and I know few debut albums that I've heard that couldn't be improved upon.  If Lady Gaga keeps up the pace and learns from the few shortcomings in this album, she'll be a force to be reckoned with.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Those that write bad reviews about this movie are ridiculous. Just trying to be like those sad overpaid movie reviewers that give everything a bad review besides trendy,abstract, euro films. They're pulling out a microscope and trying to find things that aren't there to justify thier review. If you're looking for an entertaining experience and to get your money's worth then go watch this movie. If you're looking to nit-pic a movie to pieces for your film class thesis paper or for a religious experience, stay home. Truth is, you wasted more money on bad movies than you'd like to admit.

061891868X|5.0|is that I'm not a physicist and so I could understand only partially the theoretic details of string theory, quantum gravity, etc.<br /><br />However , the points of Mr Smolin review on the status of today Physics are hard to deny:<br /><br />1 Scientific Methods needs the experimental confirmation of new predictions in order for a new theory to be accepted. String theory cannot make any testable prediction and so has the same credibility of a broccoli theory with adequate math support. This despite decades of study.<br /><br />2 Research and resources in the universities and private centers are mainly handled by people whose career depends on string theory<br />and so these people are not interested to feed any other branch of study.<br /><br />3 Advances are usually made by few unconventional scientists whose talents are not nurtured in today universities. In these days we desperately need these unconventional thinkers but we cannot offer a good environment to them.<br /><br />4 These days the number of theoretical physicists is more than the number of the scientists on every field at the beginning of the century but despite this the breakthroughs have been very limited. We have put together the LHC but we don't know what to search in the data it will provide because we still don't have a model with a solid base.<br /><br />Today physics is ill, stalled by the same men who are supposed to make it advance.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|Norah Jones's fourth studio album has one definite distinction from Jones's previous studio efforts:  it is the first not to land at the penthouse of the Billboard 200.  This trend seems commonplace for those who have previously been a lock for number one albums.  Despite Jones's misfortunes of landing a #3 bow on the Billboard 200 chart, [[ASIN:B002NWRMVS The Fall]] turns out to be one of Jones's best and most different albums.  Rather than follow the formula of the hit that made her a star ([[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]]), Jones decides to take the singer-songwriter/alternative pop route, one that hardcore Jones fans noticed on her last release, the very non-jazz oriented [[ASIN:B000KCHZK6 Not Too Late]].  While this unfortunately doesn't strengthen the singer/songwriter's commercial base, it does strengthen critics' opinions on her, making her seem more authentic. One wonders if Jones would've continued in the safer vein of her first couple of albums if she would've been come to be known as 'boring' as opposed to 'prodigiously talented.'<br /><br />The album opens up with the infectious, valedictory \\"Chasing Pirates\\".  The songwriting may be novel in quality, but it is well written and addictive.  Sure, some may not buy into Jones's sound upon this inaugural track from 'The Fall', but I personally think it is a fantastic departure for Jones.  She still possesses that 'quieting','folksy' quality that helped to establish her superstar status, but she redirects the energy more into alternative pop as opposed to the torch and cover songs that helped develop her career.  The brief duration (under 3 minutes) is perfect for this song.<br /><br />\\"Even Though\\" doesn't miss a beat; it is nearly, if not the equal of \\"Chasing Pirates\\". Jones sounds exceptional with her restrained, folksy, smoky vocals.  The production work also is appreciated, as the traditional folk element previous attributed to Jones's music fades off in favor of a slightly more soulful, overt sound.  \\"Light As A Feather\\" has a more rock/pop driven sound, in a minor key.  Again, Jones's vocals perfectly sit atop the production work. The songwriting = spot on.<br /><br />\\"Young Blood\\" proves to be wordier than previous songs, making the listener focus more on the songwriting than previous songs.  Sure, the production is worthwhile, but certainly Jones and her production team felt this song required an arrangement that accentuated the songwriting as opposed to the music.  The catchiest portion of the song is the outgoing refrain in which the singer sings \\"young ghost/go home...\\" repeatedly.  On \\"I Wouldn't Need You\\", Jones slows down the tempo and sustains the lyrics more than \\"Young Blood\\", giving another inspired, smooth, calming vocal performance. \\"I Wouldn't Need You\\" turns out to be one of the albums most soulful, bluesy tracks.<br /><br />\\"Waiting\\" is simple, yet complex in the same vein.  It starts out in a darker minor setting, but the progression leads into a major key (B-flat). Trivialization aside, \\"Waiting\\" proves instantly to be another worthwhile Norah Jones treasure.  The singer rocks it out (on a Wurlitzer I believe) on the driving \\"It's Gonna Be\\", which finds Jones channelling her jazz sensibilities into satisfactory pop/rock.  Bluesy, ethereal, and almost organic in quality, \\"It's Gonna Be\\" plays like a modern day torch song - or something like that!<br /><br />\\"You've Ruined Me\\" features the country sensibilities that made 2004's [[ASIN:B0001BFIN2 Feels Like Home]] so enjoyable.  Here, aside from traces of organ, one hears Jones playing acoustic piano, something that seems almost inexistent throughout the majority of this album.  Well produced, Jones continues on a hot streak of inspired, well thought-out material. Brief, but effective and 'affective' to the listener. \\"Back To Manhattan\\" proves to be one of the albums lengthier tracks, providing the listener with one of few true ballads. Twinkles of piano and a ubiquitous repeated guitar line help to shape the 'atmosphere' of this track, yet another exceptional cut from 'The Fall'.  The slow six-feel groove adds the backbone to this grand ditty.<br /><br />\\"Stuck\\" seems to take cues from sounds that appear off of Led Zepplin's \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" with its blues-infused sounds. Everything about \\"Stuck\\" screams retro, yet there is a freshness that permeates despite what should be a clear-cut anachronism.  \\"December\\" also reminisces back to Jones ala 'Feels Like Home'.  Stripped and simple, Jones sounds phenomenal.  While not as novelty as \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" from 'Not Too Late', \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" has a similar blues-infused sound/groove.  Closing track \\"Man of the hour\\" sounds like a mix between a cabaret song and a gospel song; the result is pure genius.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Fall' proves to be an exceptional album by all means.  No quibbles from me.  4 1/2 stars folks.of this track, yet another exceptional cut from 'The Fall'.

B002NXSRVG|5.0|I prsonally loved this movie.  It was non-stop action with the right amount of other stuff thrown in for good measure.  I can hardly wait to watch it again.  I found nothing lacking that I would consider a major issue.  Its only a movie afterall people!
0790731452|1.0|One of the few times in my life I have found nothing to like about a movie. And I have seen some crappy movies. Like a slot-machine junkie, I kept watching, figuring that it had to get better at some point. But no such luck. When it was over, I realized I had completely wasted my time, and that I'm never getting that hour and 45 minutes of my life back. Giving this movie one star is far too generous. Unfortunately, there is no zero star option. Please spend your time more wisely (and save your money). Wash your car. Organize your CD collection. Watch the Home Shopping Network. Paint your toenails. Read a romance novel. Take a nap. ANYTHING would be a better use of your time than to watch this movie.

B002C6K7N0|4.0|Although not as strong as United Abominations, Endgame stands up well against other recent Megadeth releases.  Fast paced and angry, the songs here are crisp and catchy.  Even the lead-off instrumental is aggressive enough to keep my finger off the skip button.  This Day We Fight may be the best, hardest song the group has let fly this side of the century.  I could go on, but you get the idea.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I had expected. To me, it was like a mix of 'Saw' and 'Max Payne. Gerard Butler does an awesome job as a psychotic man with nothing to lose. Ten years after a home invasion that leaves his wife and daughter dead, Clyde Shelton returns to seek true justice. I love when he dismembers the man who murdered them. When Clyde is sent to jail, people are still dying in mysterious ways, and Nick Rice tries to stop it. When Rice interrogates Clyde, he wants something in return such as his iPod, and a steak. Soon, nobody feels safe leaving their homes, because they don't know where or when Clyde will strike next. Does he have an accomplice? I highly recommend LAW ABIDING CITIZEN!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I've been vegan for a year.  I have read The Face On Your Plate by Jefferey Masson, The Kind Diet by Alicia Silverstone and various media across the internet depicting the sad state that the food industry is in.  I consider myself well educated on the subject of animal cruelty when it comes to factory farming and the effects it has on our environment.  I always heard that it was bad for the workers and people in general, but I never had any really good examples as to why.  Food Inc. showed me why.  This documentary is excellent.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone, including people who have no idea what a factory farm is and people who think they may already know it all.
0810982862|4.0|The book is beautiful, offers a fair amount of behind-the-scenes information and sketches, but feels somewhat like it was rushed to production. Case in point, page 82-83 features a large image that spans the pages with the Great Leonopteryx. Guess what? The image is upside down! After working for 12 years in prepress, this sort of thing simply is not allowed to happen unless there is a mega rush. Also several of the larger images are pixelated, which to me is also a misstep. I also agree with other reviewers that there could have been a lot more detail on the planning process of the various creatures and Na'vi. I hope something more significant comes along that is more fulfilling. That said, however, this is still a beautiful book and recommended to any Avatar fan.

If the book is to show how people handle death, relationships post death, memories, etc., it does so blandly. I had no incentive to see read what's next.

I'm sorry, my review isn't as good and deep as everyone else's, all I can say is when the movie was over I felt like I lost a friend. Even now, days after seeing the movie, I feel like someone special was lost.    I recommend buying this movie. I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible.

B00164EAC8|5.0|The Original Godzilla, I mean the original Japanese release minus Perry Mason, was about the consequences of unleashing a destructive force, the Atomic Bomb upon the world. It was moody, haunting and thought provoking in many different ways.<br /><br />This Godzilla was a victim. It was a simple species of marine iguana minding its own business when the French started their A-Bomb experiments and mutatated the egg dwelling fetus of  what would have been simply another marine creature into something that should not have existed. It wasnt a type of dinosaur like the 1954 Japanese Godzilla that was mutated into a fire breathing hurricane, but a simple species that found itself suddenly very large and having to cope with it. I kinda just went with the flow of the story that what we had here was as the worm guy played by broderick said &quot;He is not an enemy, he is just a big animal&quot; or words to that effect.  I enjoy the whimsy of the actors in the role but in the end I really felt sorry for the creature who wasnt malicious or malevolent. It just was and somehow it didnt seem fair that it met the end it did. Yea I like it alright and felt downright sad when the big guy died.
1401207529|4.0|I really enjoy Frank Miller's vision of Batman, but this isn't my favorite of his works. I feel like the he missed an excellent opportunity to emphasize the moral ambiguity of an amateur vigilante. There are some scenes to suggest this, but the medium a short work like this doesn't allow the author ample time to develop such complex ideas. What I really want is a sequal, a Batman: Year Two.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky is a wonderful novel about an odd teenage boy going through high school. The great thing about this book is that the reader gets to really imagine the characters, their images, and style. To be able to imagine their actual lives, and what they went through. Charlie does a great job with just adapting to his environment, with no discrimination towards his gay friends, or keeping control with his sisters boyfriends. Charlie grows and becomes such a great and strong person throughout this novel, it's very inspiring to see that even after all of his down's in life, he can still live and carry on. This was a great book with a rough but happy ending, because Charlie almost leaves you on a sad note, having to guess what will happen to him. Then pick's it up for one last time, letting you know he is okay, defiantly the best part of the book is knowing he will be okay. Stephen Chbosky is a great writer, and I would be glad to see a few more books from him.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Ask any self-professed \\"old school\\" Maiden fan to provide a review of Dance of Death, and they'll likely respond that while respectable, it doesn't hold a candle to the band's mid-80s work.     I'm no less a vociferous fan -- I drove 300 miles to see them in June 2008 -- and believe that Dance of Death is, to this point, the peak of Maiden's last two decades of work. In fact, the musical depth on the album is so stunningly good that it rightfully deserves its place next to Powerslave and Seventh Son at the top of the band's entire catalog. This might be heresy to the grungy, stringy-haired, chain-smoking 40-something headbangers that I encountered in the pit at Chicago's Allstate Arena, but Dance of Death is a phenomenal record.    The album opener Wildest Dreams, while high-energy, is merely ok. But the next four tracks are staggering. The hard, melodic Rainmaker -- which should have been the lead single, and not Wildest Dreams -- is the best song Dave Murray has ever written, and clears out just as quickly as it starts. No More Lies is a pseudo-ballad in the vein of Brave New World. The brutally heavy Montsegur is quite simply one of the band's most memorable tracks. It also demonstrates that Bruce Dickinson's remarkable pipes remain in fine form.     But even the undeniably excellent Montsegur is overshadowed by the title track -- the indisputable highlight of the album, and really, what is probably the best song that Maiden has released since Fear of the Dark in 1992. It begins with a slow series of acoustic, arpeggiated power chords, followed by Janick Gers' haunting lead guitar playing an eery melody. After Dickinson spins a downright evil Steve Harris-penned tale for several minutes, the band suddenly plugs in and takes off in a whirlwind. The song really has no chorus -- in fact, the addition of one probably would derail the song -- and each of Murray, Smith and Gers plays his own inspired solo. Put simply, it's one of the five best songs Maiden has ever released.    The album admittedly has a bit of filler -- Gates of Tomorrow and Age of Innocence aren't particularly noteworthy -- but the second half of this remarkable album is strong enough to listen straight through. The Nicko McBrain-penned New Frontier reminds me a bit of The Clairvoyant from Seventh Son. The sweeping Face in the Sand is excellent. But the two highlights of the second half of the record are the atmospheric World War I retrospective Paschendale -- like Dance of Death, it tells a story without the use of a chorus -- and the lush, mellow closer, Journeyman, in which the band -- seriously -- breaks out the acoustic guitars.      If you're a fan of the band's Killers/Piece of Mind era work, then perhaps this isn't the album for you. But if you enjoy listening to the band pushing the progressive elements of their music to the edge, Dance of Death is the album you've been waiting for. Even if you're not a die-hard Maiden fan, the musical virtuosity displayed on this album is stunning. It's a must-have.
1594488916|2.0|The author of this book has a wonderful story to tell: a man from humble origins tries to steal his way to an ideal existence. Fascinating!    But the author writes very stiffly Her prose is awkward, and the story never takes flight. She constantly injects herself into the narrative flow of the book, with zero payoff; she's not engaging, and the constant references to what she's thinking and doing (who cares?) just slow the story to a crawl.    I couldn't help wondering what Malcolm Gladwell would have done with the same idea.     As a compilation of research, the book is fine. As an entertaining story, though, I give it a C+.
B002T9H2L0|3.0|_Inglourious Basterds_ (2009) is perhaps Quentin Tarantino's most bizarre film.  The film effectively shows that there is no bigger industry than \\"Nazi exploitation\\".  From Godwin's law to Schindler's List, it seems that Hitler and his cronies are the perennial topic of conversation for all right-thinking people.  It is difficult to say overall whether this film is a spoof or not.  The film features a group of \\"Basterds\\" led by an Apache Indian and some Jews whose job it is to go around scalping Nazis.  The film focuses on the misadventures of the \\"detective\\" Jew hunter SS man, as he attempts to prevent a plot by the Basterds to destroy the Nazis.  Ultimately, the detective comes across as such a despicable character in the film that you are glad he deserves his ultimate fate.  The ending is exceedingly strange.  Not historically correct.  And the message seems to be that every \\"living\\" \\"Nazi\\" needs a Charles Manson type swastika engraved in their head, because a \\"Nazi is always a Nazi\\". When will we forget?  2.5 stars.

0385504225|2.0|Reading The Lost Symbol, you get the feeling that Dan Brown had a closet full of research that he really needed to clean out. Unfortunately, you also get the feeling that he took all that research, taped the pages together by whatever handfuls he happened to grab and said \\"show me the money!\\" The Lost Symbol is a stellar success on that count.    Brown has written the same book three times now. Even fans admit that Angels & Demons, The DaVinci Code and The Lost Symbol have the same basic characters, the same plot outline and the same twists. Brown only picks up his plotting framework and moves it to a different philosophical location; the Illuminati, the Catholic Church, the Masons. But he's quickly running out of steam. In The Lost Symbol, the characters are shallow, the plot outline is jagged and the twists are limp. The characters' motivations are insipid (Oedipal revenge and blackmail) and their relevance to the story is tenuous (what does Noetics have to do with anything?) If he continues writing on this downward trajectory, his next novel will be about Robert Langdon trying to decipher the inscription on a Carvel ice cream cake while pondering whether Cookie Puss represents the Maiden, the Matron or the Crone.     The story's biggest thrill comes when Robert Langdon dies at about the 2/3 mark. For a few short chapters I thought that Brown had decided to take the franchise in a boldly new direction or at least forestall his publisher's howling for the next Robert Langdon novel; The Carvel Cake Codex. But Langdon is revived.     Browns biggest error is the extended denouement. After various characters harangue Langdon about the Masonic steps and power words he's been chasing being absolutely, 100% real, it's revealed that yes, the steps are real. The words; not so much, unless you really, really believe. If you were ever disappointed that your parents insisted that Santa Claus was real as you wondered why he wore daddy's boots and pinched mommy's butt, you'll know the letdown. This long-winded windup takes place after different players have had their hand amputated and most of their blood drained by a crazed, illustrated lunatic. It would not be the time I'd decide to do some early morning sightseeing in Washington. The closest hospital might be the next logical choice. And after all the chasing, black SUVs, helicopters, explosions and paid overtime, I'm sure the CIA would want a serious debriefing with the major players too. No sightseeing for at least a week while you sign statements and fill out paperwork.    Let's not reward Dan Brown any further for this book. He's already wrung mega-millions out of a single somewhat-better-than-mediocre idea. With as many copies as are already floating around out there, it will soon find it's way into your local Goodwill or thrift store. Buy it there if you haven't already read it. Let's all help Robert Langdon retire.
076790592X|2.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" tells of author Mitch Albom's weekly meetings with a former teacher, Morrie Schwartz, who was slowly dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. Albom taped the sessions of Morrie's life advice and used them as the basis of this very slight book. Morrie, his body slowly deteriorating, is losing basic functions. His grip is weak; his voice is a whisper; he can no longer walk. This continues to the point where, humiliatingly, he needs others to help him in the bathroom. As a middle-aged with infirm elderly parents, I can relate to Morrie's struggles. He must continually adjust his self-image to match his faltering abilities. No easy task. And his courage in facing his inevitable death is marvelous. But, I have to confess, several months have gone by since I read the book. For the life of me, I can't recall a single scrap of wisdom that Morrie imparted to Albom. Not good news for a book that purports to package the wisdom of a lifetime.<br /><br />The final chapter of the audio book was a play-back of an actual session with Morrie. Don't ask me why, but listening to the man in his own words was far more interesting than listening to Albom's repackaging. I'm sad to say it, but \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is a feel-good effort that sadly does not stand the test of time.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|So where do you start, reviewing Avatar?<br />Unless you've been living in a cave, you'll have heard it's an extravaganza of amazing special effects that cost $300 million. You've probably heard that \\"professional\\" reviewers have called the storyline weak, and the acting sub par.<br />I saw it last night in 3D, which I imagine is how James Cameron envisaged having it watched. After the customary 10 minute eye adjustment the effect was incredible.<br />I understand that over 2500 individual special effects were used, along with the most sophisticated computer aided graphics and even newly invented hardware (for example a camera where Cameron could see the actors fully rendered through the lens while filming) to give a \\"real\\" feel.<br />And \\"real\\" it is, you come out of this movie thinking Pandora is a real place! And by the representation on screen Cameron has been there!<br />This isn't Mos Eisley circa 1977, every creature here looks like it belongs on this planet (itself an eye popping vision) The Na'vi don't look plastic (like they appeared in early trailers) they look, move and act real before your eyes, it sounds corny, but you feel swept away into this new World, almost like it was a real planet discovered.<br /><br />The story was solid, I didn't find it weak, although to some it may appear simple, if I had to make a negative comment, it is predictable.<br />Paraplegic Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) gets a chance to fill his recently deceased twin brothers shoes and \\"pilot\\" an Avatar (DNA home grown Na'vi human controlled) under the guidance of Scientist Sigourney Weaver and crew. Being a marine, he's also under the scrutiny (and allegiance) of Gung Ho Col. Quaritch (excellently played by Stephen Lang). A basic synopsis would be, Weaver wants to save the Na'vi and Pandora, Lang wants to help Selfridge and Co. (Giovanni Ribisi slimy as ever)  \\"kill em all\\" and mine the ore under their sacred land, Worthington soon realizes he's playing for the wrong team, like I said it's a simple plot.<br />That doesn't however make it weak.<br />People are going to talk about this movie for a long time, from the sky high production costs, to the box office records it's sure to smash.<br />People are also talking about the movies subtext, message, morality. Is it an allegory for invading foreign lands? Afghanistan? Iraq? Personally I doubt it, this movie has been mulling around in James Cameron's head since he saw George Lucas make Star Wars in the 70's, and has been itself over 10 years in production. The end result, a detailed, meticulous and believable Sci Fi like nothing you have seen before.<br />At 162 mins, it's not short, but the movie is paced very well and feels the right length.<br /><br />The bottom line for me was an excellent, unusual and thought provoking epic that will stand up for many many years. If you can see it in 3D try to, or even IMAX 3D. If not just see it, but make sure you do, you won't forget it quickly. 5 stars.doesn't however make it weak.

B000DZIGDU|2.0|In the book that gave rise to this film, one of Anthony Swofford's  Marine buddies refers to the Corps as \\"the Suck.\\" That pretty much captures the author's love-hate relationship to the Marines. And \\"suck\\" is what I think about this adaptation of Swoff's fine memoir.<br /><br />Jarhead the book is a cerebral exercise that dissects the hilarious, pointless and terrifying experience of joining, training for and being a warrior in the US Marine Corps during the first Gulf War. Jarhead the film extracts the small amount of action in the book (except, sadly, for the prodigious bouts of drinking and screwing) and plops them onto the screen, drained of humor, emotion, irony or context. No comparison to the power of the book.

0316069906|5.0|This is an easy book to read.  This is a hard book to read.  It is easy in that it is well written, not overly dense, and well researched.  It is hard in that if you have not thought about this issue or have and attempted to compartmentalize it away, some of scenes and practices depicted will not sit easy.<br /><br />I love a good steak and usually like it grilled \\"medium moo\\".  Sometimes I just have to get my KFC on.  And, boy howdy, do I my like bar-b-queue.<br /><br />But then I think back to another life time when I was a County Sanitarian for a rural state.  I did not inspect slaughter houses or meat processing plant that is a function of the federal government.  I did have occasion to go into them many times for various other reasons.  I also had many occasions to investigate complaints about commercial chicken or hog raising operations.  Small scale operations never really bothered me, but some of the larger ones really made you think about the chain of food from the farm to the grocery store.<br /><br />My personal issue is not with eating meat, but with factory farming and corporate meat processing.  Foer states that 99% of all meat eaten in this country comes from these sources.  It is almost a 100% surety then that it is the source of your meat.  As a consumer of the product you should be aware of the impact of what you are doing, and the impact of what these \\"factories\\" are doing to you.<br /><br />Foer has a definitely point of view, that we should all be eating vegetarian.  What surprised me about the book that he is not preachy about it. (Definition of a vegan:  Does not eat animal products including eggs and dairy, and tells everyone about it)  He spent 3 years researching this book.  He presents animal husbandry at its best, and then he presents the factory farming side of it.  It does this for beef, pork, chickens and turkeys. He touches on commercial fisheries and how they are depleting our seas.  He presents his arguments in a strong manner, but never with the guilt trip that is sometimes used.<br /><br />The issues explored are several.  There are definite considerations around animal health and welfare.  There are ethical considerations on how we treat our food animals.  We should be considering the healthiness of the meat when it finally reaches our dinner table.  We should be considering what excessive meat consumption is doing to our health.  There are definitely environmental concerns from all this factory farming.  By some estimates 40% of greenhouse gases come from our domesticated animals.  Meat consumption is increasing world wide.  It is not a sustainable model.  Foer also explores the workers' situation in these factory farms and large scale  slaughterhouses.  It is not a pretty picture.<br /><br />Foer does not explicitly say so, but this is definitely an argument against allowing corporations to control our food supply.  When your bottom line is quarterly profits and \\"it just business\\" with no one directly ethically/legally responsible, it is not a surprise we have ended up with the system that we have.<br /><br />Whether you choose to eat meat or not, it should be an informed decision.

1594488843|5.0|[[ASIN:1594488843 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]]I had the advantage of reading the review copy of Daniel Pink's new book, Drive. Eager to dive in and find out what motivates me, as well as, others I was not disappointed. There is a lot of touchy feely, pull up your bootstraps and get going type of stuff out there. At the end of the day they don't let you know what motivates us on a deeper level.<br /><br />The value for me was learning why certain types of motivation are fleeting at best. Where organizations fail in motivating their employees is when they apply a blanket technique to the whole and expecting the same result from everyone.<br /><br />We each have our different reasons why we show up at work each day. The guy next to me is happy for a bonus at the end of the year and free bagels on Friday. While someone else wants to know his work has value and purpose. While job security, bonuses and pensions are no longer a guarantee what will compel a person to stay motivated? If the carrot that companies offered their employees is considerably smaller what can they do to keep the organization staffed with happy people motivated to come back to work tomorrow?<br /><br />How many of you want to work for a gold watch at the end of twenty-five years? Not me. Do you want an end of the year review that gives you no opportunity to course correct for the hefty bonus at the end of the year? Not me. Do you want to work hard and get the stellar reviews only to be the first to be axed? Not me.<br /><br />As a culture we have moved out of the industrial age. The jobs that once supported us are being outsourced. We are now up to the task of defining new rules for our work lives.<br /><br />Daniel Pink's book, Drive, covers where we have come from and where we need to go in this new age of motivation. The book comes with a healthful dose of studies and scientific data and outlines the elements for the new paradigm.<br /><br />According to his book and the cocktail party summary, \\"We need an upgrade. And the science shows the way. The new approach has three essential elements: 1. Autonomy--the desire to direct our own lives. 2. Mastery--the urge to get better and better at something that matter. 3. Purpose--the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. Applying these elements you can structure a meaningful and motivated life.<br /><br />The beauty of the book is that it allows for the individual, as well as, corporations to apply this new paradigm. Consider giving yourself a monthly performance review; allowing you to self correct and work more concretely on creating a life that works much better.  Ask yourself, \\"was I better today then yesterday\\".<br /><br />The discussion should continue about how to move into a brave new world of meaning over industry. Pink provides the toolkit to dive in and wrestle with the concepts. I say read and leave it for your boss. If they don't get motivated at least you'll be up to the task of making your job, or life, a better one.. And the science shows the way. The new approach has three essential elements: 1.

0545140315|5.0|My Thoughts: I've read a few reviews on this so I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I've heard good and bad. But, since I usually like romantic books I dove into this one. From the first page I was hooked. We meet Penny who I instantly liked. We meet her friends, and we meet Ryan, her ex-best friends boyfriend. I instantly liked him from the get-go. Even when Penny was saying how once her best friend started dating him, she ditched Penny. I still liked Ryan. HA, the boy whose locker was next to mine in high school was also named Ryan! HAHA! We also meet another guy who is into Penny. She seems to be the nice girl who the guys want but don't usually make their feelings known. I totally adored this book. There were parts that were somewhat predicable but it made me want to keep reading more and more. I loved the chemistry between Penny and her mystery guy. I loved all the Beatles references. I loved Penny's friends. I loved the club. Can I join the club please? We've all been through what Penny goes through before. Feeling like guys are losers and are evvillll! Been there, done that! This book is adorable.<br /><br />Overall: Adorable! Cute! Awesome! Loved It! Loved the club. Loved Penny. Loved Ryan. Loved it all! Plain and simple: A Must Read!

B002VPE1AM|3.0|I am one of the few people that did not enjoy Avatar but admired the imagination and artistry to create the fauna and flora of the movie's planet, Pandora.  I am also one of the few people who got violenty ill watching it in Imax 3D (headache and nausea).  I found the live action 3D rather flat comared to the CGI 3D.  The sound design is also great, especially with Imax speakers.  James Horner's score is serviceable but derivative of his other scores, especially his signature four-note danger motif.  The movie is also very long and nearly three hours.    Without the visuals, I don't think the movie would have been successful.  It's Dances With Wolves-like plot is one dimensional and left me cold and detached.  I will add that those sitting behind me and pockets of others in the audience cheered the end confrontation and applauded at the end.  I did not feel that way.    Except for the headache, nausea and jumpy legs, I don't regret seeing this movie.  But I could also have lived without seeing it and I will probably never watch it again.  There just weren't those movie \\"moments\\" or bond with the characters that would make me want to return.    I do have a suggestion when watching this movie.  If watching it in an Imax theater, sit at least halfway up the rows.  There is a lot of camera movement in the movie and Imax 3D has a way of making a huge screen look like you're sitting six feet from a large projection television (I discovered that watching Avatar and an underwater documentary years back in Imax 3D).  Judging from the Alice in Wonderland trailer (which I saw in Real 3D and in Imax 3D), the 3D effect is a bit more pronounced.  However, in the live action footage that incorporated CGI effects (monitor readouts, holographic maps, headscans, etc.), it seems to strain the eyes a bit.    In closing, I don't want to disencourage anyone from seeing this film.  The effects are not revolutionary but they are very refined and highly imaginative.  But I do disagree withthe glowing 5 star reviews even though I experienced audience members who would no doubt have given this movie a top rating.

It sucked you in to it in the begingng and then threw alot of information at you fast. and there are parts of the plot that dont add up. The charecters were great very lively and intriguing. The fights were well discribed as was most of the book. I will read the other two mainly because of sheer curiousity of what happens to the charecters. But in my opion its a good book just not a great book. To me it was buffy the vampire slayer meets harry potter. I love both of them and might of enjoyed this book more if it was written at a differnt pace maybe idk it was so good in the diologe and attaction but when a charecter explaind somthing to you it had a way of lousing you then letting you understand for a minute then compleatly taking away what you thought you knew. worth reading if this is the kinda genera you are into but otherewise like i said not a great book.    oh and the love story in it is a huge let down so if you do chose to read dont get attached to the jace and clary relationship its disoappointing at best

Maggie's take of wolf and human girl falling in love was breathtaking and is now on my list of favorite books, move over Twilight vampires, Shiver's wolves are taking over! I recommend it to everyone, it definitely is a must read and also look out for the sequel, Linger in Fall 2010! I cannot wait...I need more Sam!

I have gifted this CD to 9 family members and friends, and have listened to it continually in my car since the day I bought it . How rare and refreshing it is to hear the beauty of a pure God given voice.
0545140315|4.0|The Lonely Hearts Club was a fun, fast paced novel. The writing captured the voice of teenage girls very well. Obviously we all know boys suck and sometimes we want to stay away from them. Well, Penny and her group of friends decided to do just that. They started The Lonely Hearts Club which stated you must never turn away from your girlfriends and dating boys wasn't allowed until after you graduated. Now for me I wouldn't be able to go cold turkey, having boys around is fun sometimes, their is less catty drama. Hey for others maybe it's different. Now, the rules didn't necessarily stick under certain circumstances and had to be adjusted to keep everyone happy. I'll keep the reason why to myself, I don't want to give too much away. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Penny's best friend. She was pretty funny and I found myself giggling at her remarks. Also, Penny's parents were obsessed with The Beatles which was cool, hence the book title of the book. I'm not really a fan of their music but it was nice to read something out of the ordinary. Overall, this book is definitely filled with girl power and I admire the creativity behind the storyline. It was very cute but again it didn't wow me.But I recommend this book if you're looking for a light, girly read.
B0000714BP|5.0|This film was extradinarily uplifting, positive, heartwarming and above all... a laugh riot!<br /><br />Three (3) straight men (I don't know that as a fact myself) playing magnificent, glamorus drag queens with good hearts.

B000P13RVS|4.0|This book is fantastic.  I wished I had read it many years ago; then I'd have money working for me instead of me working for money.  This book helped changed the way I think about work and money.  Please encourage everyone you know to read this book.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|[[ASIN:B002LVV3MA Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs + The Scrat Pack]]  The comedy of the various animals relationships in working to keep this unusual family together, was great through out the movie. Especially when adopting 3 dinosaur babies and how the real mother reacted to recovering them. Using the Ice Age with animated animals behaving like we humans do in various family situations was great. Highly recommend this DVD to all ages.

0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games is an awesome book, very well written, so the 2nd book, Catching Fire follows in its wake.  I really enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the third in the series which will provide a conclusion to the climatic ending in Catching Fire.  Collins is the Stephen King of youth literature.  The Hunger Games is the result of a post-war scenerio where the Capital overthrough the 12 districts.  As a consequence the 12 districts have tributes sent each year to compete in games of survival to the death.  If you survive, then you are set for life, supposely.  However, if you challenge the Capital, then all promises are forfeit.  Let the games begin...

B002SJIO4A|5.0|I am so pleased to see so many positive ratings of this film.  I think it has all been said, but I just wanted to add my 5 star rating and knock down some of the not so positive ratings.  Brilliant film, cast, directing, and special effects.  And... it has a brilliant script.  It's the cat's meow, so just eat the fooking cat food!
B002XHN776|5.0|How many times have you purchased an album and end up disappointed that you only liked one song?  30 Seconds to Mars latest album This Is War is not one of those albums.  The album's current hit Kings and Queens is the mere tip of the iceberg as compared to the rest of the powerful yet surreal songs that follow it.  Songs that drew me in were:  Night of the Hunter, Vox Populi, Stranger in a Strange Land, This is War, 100 Suns, and Hurricane.  The use of a crowd backup in some of the songs just add to this work of art.  Buy it.  You can thank me later.
B00136JS8U|5.0|When the clan released the single \\"Protect ya Neck\\" in 1992, they afterwards went on a streak of perfect albums from 36 Chambers, to Tical, to Liquid Swords , to finally Cuban Linx.  Everything they made back then were masterpieces, every song.

I had never heard of them, and stumbled upon them through XM liquid metal show. They blew me away. In a sea of sound-alikes in the metal genre they were a breath of fresh air. Catchy riffs, solid sound and melodic songs is just a perfect mix of enjoyable listening! Buy this CD. You won't be able to take it out of your cd player!!

So when I received this book for Christmas I was eager to try at least one thing within a couple of days. The potatoes gratin dauphinois - so easy and oh my gosh, so delicious!! This book is going to be used well :)
B002NXSRW0|1.0|I liked the special effects of this movie but that was all it had going for it. I didn't like the characters, the plot was as stupid as stupid can be and I felt that a lot of good actors were wasted in minor or ridiculous parts. Christopher Eccleston, my favorite Doctor Who of the recent regenerations, was wasted in this movie. Dennis Quaid was a stereotype and Brendan Fraser was in and out of the movie on the blink of an eye. The major characters were silly and I didn't care for or even like the \\"Duke\\" character wearing his self-assured, cocky smirk throughout most of the movie, with the exception of the scenes where he attempted to make doe-eyes at his lost love. In fact, this whole movie was one long action sequence interlaced with soap opera mini stories in between to make a sad and half hearted attempt at character development. I kept yelling at the screen, \\"Oh, come on!\\" It was so predictable and obvious how the movie makers were trying to manipulate the viewer. Even the end was a blatant setup for a sequel, which I hope never comes to pass. Don't bother seeing this movie unless you are addicted to CG actions scenes. The rest is a waste of time and talent (which was not evident in any performance here.) If I could give it a 1/2 start I would!!
160094048X|5.0|Seriously, Isa and Terry are simply the most amazing chefs out there, vegan or otherwise, and I impatiently await the release of each and every book either of them create. And of course this book is wonderful, it's got great pictures, it's an adorable little size (that matches their cupcakes book!!!), there are cookie recipes that mimic famous cookies, cookies with booze (mmmm, Irish Kiss Cookies), healthier cookies, and even cookies for breakfast. There are all sorts of helpful tips, including how to modify any recipe to be gluten free if needed. And best of all, almost all of the ingredients are accessible-I live in a not terribly vegan friendly south eastern state and have access to almost all ingredients within a 30 minute radius.    There really isn't anything not to love, but chances are if you've been into vegan cooking for any time at all you already expected that.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I did some research and found that UFO had another live CD. I found this seller and was pleased to see great feedback. I had super fast delivery and totally blew me away when I played this CD. Classic Rock Radio might want to check this CD out! My brother now wants this CD and once again I have to tell hime got to Amazon and do it yourself. I'm super happy with this purchase and money well spent. I like live recordings and it can be a hit or miss how well it was done. This is a great example of a very well done one. I just wish that I had known about this long ago.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I barely remember the Terminator movies, so the impact was less harmfull on<br />watching terminator salvation.

1416594787|4.0|Richard Dawkins always has something new and interesting to say about evolution, and this book is no exception. I'm certainly glad I read it. Nevertheless . . . this is far from his best work. The book seems like it has no core, no basic message or goal. Given the title, I expected an organized, point by point case for evolution, something like a lawyer going through a closing argument. But Dawkins is no lover of lawyers, so perhaps he avoided that approach on purpose.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: No matter what you are looking for in a book about evolution, Dawkins has done better elsewhere. The Ancestor's Tale provides a magnificent look at how we actually evolved, without a formal discussion of what evolution is. If you want a more direct discussion of how evolution works and why it is true, The Blind Watchmaker and The Selfish Gene are perhaps the two best books ever written on the subject. Try one of those three instead. If you still want more, Dawkin's latest offering is not bad.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game for players at all ages and levels.  Good bargaining,  marketing,  real estate mogul development and just plain rowdy fun.  Reminds us of the RISK days in college in the 70's.  No high tech skills needed just high thinking, negotiating and problem solving abilities necessary.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|i enjoyed this book but feel the book would have benefitted from some thinning. At times the flow of the story is slowed by the authors tendency to repeat himself.  Overall it is worth reading but is not as good as 'Angels and Demons.'
0756405890|5.0|Oh, hum.  Another \\"poor boy gets picked on, learns magic, yada yada\\" book.<br /><br />Except, it isn't.<br /><br />In The Name Of The Wind, Kvothe survives the urban wilds and enrolls in the university, a place with as many political intrigues as any monarch's court.  But life is very, very tough, and Kvothe must live by his wits at all times.<br /><br />The tale is told by Kvothe himself, decades later, when he is discovered hiding as an innkeeper.  Somewhere between Kvothe the desperate student, and Kvothe the innkeeper, there developed Kvothe the legend.  The next two books, presumably, will focus on his legendary exploits.  In book 1, author Patrick Rothfuss develops the character and motivations of Kvothe.  Kvothe is never a perfect \\"Harry Potter\\" boy. In the streets, he learned to \\"punch and run\\" in order to survive, so it is more of a [[ASIN:B001IDAIKK The Golden Compass]] style book, but with many, many original ideas.<br /><br />At the conclusion of this book, you WILL groan that you have to wait for the next book to be published.  Oh, the cursed unfairness of trilogies!<br /><br />Rothfuss, get a move on!
0451230620|4.0|The Running Man is an interesting glance into the development of a wonderful author. Stephen King's style here is, at times, too direct. Towards the end, the protagonist rambles off an elaborate metaphor - with a gun shot wound - that interprets all of the symbols in the book.   Clearly inspired by Fahrenheit 451 (Free Vee, a fear of \\"police dogs,\\" a government disdain for books and more), this novel might earn more stars if Bradbury hadn't told the story with greater maturity.  Nevertheless, King contributes his usual vivid writing style and I didn't put the book down until it was finished. If you're looking for a book with this plot, read Fahrenheit first. If you're looking for an introduction to Stephen King at his best, try \\"The Stand.\\" Once you've done both of those, this book will be a light diversion, and not an unpleasant one.

0385523904|5.0|This is a gripping book.  The six defectors interviewed by Demick describe North Korea as a totalitarian state in a post-apocalypse condition.  That's why the visions of Orwell and McCarthy come to mind.<br /><br />North Korea suffered two tragedies.  The first one was the split of the Korean peninsula at the end of WWII and Stalin installing a like-minded dictator at its helm, Kim Il-sung.  The latter eradicates religion and replaces it by his own cult of personality.  In achieving a God status in his country, he bests Stalin, Hitler and Fidel Castro.  Upon his death in the early nineties, many North Koreans will commit suicides.  And, North Koreans will believe (through intense political propaganda) that if they cry enough Kim Il-sung will come back from the dead.  The son of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il will succeed him as a son of God.<br /><br />North Korea's second tragedy was the collapse of the Soviet Union.  When the latter collapsed it interrupted its assistance in food and oil.  North Korea did not have enough fuel on its own to maintain its electrical grid.  On the first page of the first chapter you see a picture of the Korean peninsula at night.  South Korea is full of bright spots (urban areas lit by electricity).  But, North Korea is pitch dark!  In the post Soviet Union era, North Korea suffers shortages of electricity, running water, and food.  Millions have already died of starvation.  People are not paid.  They are compensated by food rations.  But, if you don't work you don't eat.  The ones who don't receive food attempt to survive by milling bark, grasses, shrubs, leaves.<br /><br />The majority of the country still suffers from malnutrition.  Millions more would die if not for foreign assistance.  But, the government misallocates food assistance by giving it to the ones who need it the least such as the army and the Pyongyang residents.  Meanwhile, rural areas are starving.  Within the book, a defecting doctor describes it best as she crossed the border in China and finds a full bowl of rice served to a dog and stated \\"dogs in China eat better than doctors in North Korea.\\"<br /><br />While Koreans physical attributes were reasonably homogeneous a while back, they have since diverged dramatically.  The North Koreans are half a foot shorter and tens of pounds lighter because of malnutrition.  North Koreans born in the late eighties to early nineties are recognizable as they are shorter with heads disproportionately large relative to their bodies with overly thin and frail limbs.<br /><br />In the early nineties before foreign aid rallied after the collapse of Soviet Union subsidies, society took a McCarthy's turn with many crimes, suicides, and even cannibalism (homeless orphans overtaken by starving adults in remote areas).<br /><br />Only a totalitarian State could prevent such a society to fall into chaos.  Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il have created a cult of personality supported by an obsessive self-surveillance society.  North Koreans main activity is reporting on each other.  The surveillance starts from the bottom up with \\"people's group\\" were everyone reports on everyone else.  At dinner if you expressed a mild criticism of the current regime, you could be reported by a neighbor.  Soon, after you could be abducted by the police and disappear in a camp forever.  Many surveilling police forces are very specialized.  If you sleep with your lover, a specialized police force can barge in the middle of the night and ask your lover for its travel permit.  If the adequate documents are not produced the person can end up in prison.  Another specialized police force watches that people wear the correct garments with the buttons showing support for the regime.  Another one checks in that your TV or radio (a few people have electricity for a few moments a day) is set on the proper North Korean program.  If you tweaked this equipment to listen to South Korean programs, you can incur severe punishment including death.  Another police force makes sure that the portraits of the dictators are clean.  If not you are in trouble.<br /><br />Society is categorized in three classes: 1) the core class representing the professionals and government leaders; 2) the wavering class representing some sort of middle class; and 3) the hostile class representing entertainers, artists, nonproductive elements, and everyone of foreign origins.  The hostile class is the one most intensely spied upon by others.  Thus, it is most vulnerable to be imprisoned in camps and gulags for no obvious reason.<br /><br />Propaganda is relentless.  The dictator is the benevolent father of the nation.  Without his hard work and superior intelligence you would be dying of starvation twice as fast as you are.  Everybody else is the enemy.  This includes Americans, Chinese, South Koreans, and even Russians and East-Europeans who failed at communism because of their genetic weakness.  Capitalism is rotten.  In other words, you have \\"Nothing to Envy.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, reality is stunningly bad.  Chapter 7 describes the decrepit health care system.  Hospitals lack all basic supplies and remedies.  Many operations are conducted without anesthetic by tying the patient to boards.  Children come in the hospitals and die because their weakening bodies from starvation can't fend off mild colds or flues that escalate into pneumonia.  Chapter 8 describes the conditions in school that are equally horrible.  Given that schools are broke, children are required to bring a ration of wood for heating and their own lunch.  A teacher/defector observed a tragic pattern.  At first, the children stop bringing their ration of wood.  Next, the children don't bring their own lunch (and therefore don't eat during the day).  And, soon after children do not even attend school.ortraits of the dictators are clean.  If not you are in trouble.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga's rise to success hinged not only on catchy songs like \\"Poker Face,\\" \\"Just Dance,\\" \\"Love Game,\\" and \\"Bad Romance,\\" but on the dynamic music videos and her electric personality.  The Fame Monster solidifies her position as one of the most talked about musicians of 2009.  With her tour, she'll see how much her fans love her.  The CD is but a slice of the total Gaga experience.  Clever marketing demands more.  This means fans will want visual and physical manifestations of Lady Gaga.  The exasperating editing of the word bit*h on the CD creates the need to download the songs online.  Hopefully this means that they can be found unedited.  Unless the purpose was to make the CD marketable to a tween market, this move dampened an otherwise gigantic release.
B0000027D5|5.0|On LOTUS, the then-new incarnation of Santana really got the house jumping with a hot live show that, fortunately, was captured for posterity, even if it wasn't released in the United States until 1991. New vocalist Leon Thomas was even more soulful than Gregg Rolie, and the percussion section pounded away like nobody's business, creating plenty of room for leader/guitarist Carlos Santana to soar on lead guitar. And soar he did, playing like a fired-up hybrid of B.B. King, Otis Rush, and Gabor Szabo. If you loved the three CDs by the original Santana band, you'll love LOTUS.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|The special features are a hoot, and the movie takes the Star Trek franchise to another level. No, it's not your father's Star Trek, but it honors the canon lovingly while moving into an action-packed, CG realm that today's audiences will appreciate. Not one of the greatest movies ever made, but somewhere on the next tier.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Item shipped and arrived faster than I thought it would. The disks were in brand new condition. The DVD box was still in original shrink wrap and anti-theft sticker sealed the case. The DVD sleeve however was a little bent and unglued at the spine. With that said, I am happy with the purchase and the delivery time.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Lets be honest here, the people who rated, we'll be nice and say less than 3 stars, have no taste what so ever. Sure True Blood is not the same as the books but lets think about this, the books are all in Sookie's POV therefore if the show just followed Sookie and no one else it would surely be a bore. This is a great show and it's very well done for a vampire series, especially after having seen Twilight, blech! I've read all the books and I eagerly await the new one coming out and I still find True Blood fantastic! I like the changes made and I like the books.
0679731725|5.0|What a beautifully written book.  In a quiet and understated way, Ishiguro masterfully tells a story of class, loyalty, responsibility, unfulfilled longings and what makes a good butler, which is ultimately an allegory of what makes a good man.  Due to Ishiguro's unassuming style, the book steals upon you bit by bit until its elegance overwhelms you and resonates in that special place in your heart.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Personally I love this movie and I'm not like a super fan of batman. The only problem I had with this movie compared to the first one was the chick that played Rachael, she looked like a damn dog! Great movie though, the disc arrived quickly and it was good quality, for a dvd
1400079276|3.0|All of Murakami's books, including this one, reads the same.  They all have the same plot-line, characters, monsters, dream-like sequences, isolated dwellings, etc.  Having said that, I will continue to read Murakami, because his books are better than most.  The wonder and amazement I felt after reading my very first Murakami, The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, has long since dissipated, but I still feel an old twinge of it from time to time since I intersperse them out with other books.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|watching this series has brought back so many memories, when i was young the entire family would sit down to watch this show.. I can't seem to stop watching it.
0385341008|2.0|Some of the dialogue in the early part of the book was witty, but most of the book was just predictable, pedestrian dribble.  It seemed like the book was written by two different people, but first half being much better than the second half.  Good for reading whilst recuperating from the flu, if you must.

B000ZELISO|5.0|I had read several reviews prior to watching my copy (that was pre-ordered) and was worried about the quality of the BD transfer.<br /><br />Video/Audio:<br /><br />My copy played flawlessly and the video and audio qualities were both top notch.  I did not notice any of the artifacts and such that others have commented on.<br /><br />Packaging/Contents:<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the \\"sleeves\\" that a lot of Blu-Rays (and DVD's for that matter) are packaged in, but the holographic affect on the H.P. cover is well done.  I was extremely happy and satisified that in addition to the BD and the Digital Copy, the DVD is also included.  I wish all Blu-Rays came with the DVD as this is a great thing to have for those of us with DVD in our auto's, or those that vacation to places with DVD players.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I'll leave the review of it to the HP experts out there.  I will state that I feel a lot of the books contents are changed and/or missing to make the story more streamlined and for the sake of brevity.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Set against the backdrop of Christmas is this 'valentine' of love.  While the this excellent movie IS so, because it has a truly wonderful ensemble cast, fine acting from all, and a really great script... I must say that it is NOT entirely a romantic comedy as the description makes it out to be.  Yes, most of the characters do win at love by the end of the movie, but three main characters noticibly DON'T, and if you've ever been in their similar situation [which I won't go into since I don't want to ruin your viewing pleasure!] as I have, you may feel somewhat or very 'down' by the end of movie.  The heart-breaking Jonie Mitchell song \\"I've looked at love, from BOTH sides now...\\" [emphasis added] is very aptly used in this movie.  I suppose this movie makes the point that in one's life romantic, fairy-tale love may not come, but one needs to be constantly aware of opportunities to grasp it before it disappears if it does show up.  A great movie, in many respects, best viewed not at Christmas, or not when one is 'alone'.
0691142165|4.0|Don't be fooled by the (suberb) Mad Men-style cover art -- this is essentially an academic text, descriptions of Reinhart and Rogoff's compilation of data on domestic and external debt defaults for dozens of countries over hundreds of years. The papers they have circulated and/or published based on this data have received extensive attention in the last year, and this book contains little that will be new to those who have read them. I think that Reinhart and Rogoff were, originally at least, most impressed with the data on domestic defaults but in the aftermath of the 2008/2009 \\"great contraction,\\" the work on banking crises will probably be of interest to many readers as well.<br /><br />The book is repetitive, which reflects its origin as a series of independent papers, but which can be viewed as an advantage in that it makes it easier to read (or assign to students) a single chapter, without reading all that has preceded it in the book. The book's great weakness is the terrible design of its numerous time series graphs. Many of these show multiple data series on a single set of axes, with no clear indication of which line represents which data series. I suspect that in whatever software Reinhart and Rogoff used in their original analysis, these lines had different colors, or perhaps one was dashed, but in the rush to publish these details were lost. They can be decoded through a close reading of the accompanying text but, if you can understand a graph only through a close reading of the text describing it, why have a graph at all? Perhaps this will be addressed in later editions.<br /><br />The book is copiously footnoted, as you would expect for a work of this sort. It's not fun reading but it is authoritative and important. If you're not sure whether or not it will be of interest, google for a copy of one of Reinhart and Rogoff's recent papers on the same topic; several are available freely online. If the paper is interesting to you, the book probably will be too.
0307269981|2.0|I loved Girl with the Dragon Tatoo because it read like a literary novel, with nuance and subtlety and character development, but had the interesting plot line of a mystery.  This sequel was 100% genre- all overblown plot, no artistry at all.  Larsson hammers you with his views on the social welfare system and men in general.  This book must have been therapeutic for him- he incessently goes on about evil men who victimize women for no apparent reason. When Lizbeth is all but proclaimed guilty by the justice system the instant a murder weapon is found, it's pretty clear what he thinks about the justice system. And the fact that all her doctors and therapists were willing to lock Lisbeth up forever in an asylum when she was 12 shows how inept the social welfare system is too. The problem is he handles these subjects so bluntly, with such obvious, egregious examples that his point is completely lost because everything is pushed to the extreme. Even villans should have their good points and reasons for what they do, otherwise, its impossible for the reader to accept them as actual humans. Its impossible to accept anyone in this book as a human. The bad guys are impossibly, one dimensionally bad, and the good guys- like Mikael are sanctimonious, self-righteous bores.  Most distracting of all is how this book titilates, constantly giving unecessarily depictions of rape and sexual violence against women for no purpose. I felt like I was reading really tweaked porn.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I purchased for a Xmas present...wow the price is awesome, she loves it quality great...arrived on time absolutely no complaints...yes surely will recommend it for anyone who is considering it
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Wow, I couldn't get enough of her first release and now there is this special edition where you can get them both. Excellent deal! The second release is a little softer than the first aside from bad romance. Her music really grows on you after you listen to it a few times.  I am liking the new one more and more.
B00065GX64|5.0|Oh my god, a friend of mine told me about this film and I eventually looked it up on amazon and purchased this DVD version of \\"M.\\" Now, I have never seen a foreign film before and this was quite the experience, for one thing Germany didn't have government censers like the United States did, but that said, I loved this film. Its recommended.
B002M3GPOI|5.0|Yes, I knew this was coming out and searched around for the best price, got it and have been blown away by the care and detail devoted to this.  The sound is stupendous.  I am happy to know that Fripp & company value this album so highly (honestly, this is the apex of ALL their careers) that they would put out such an extensive package.  Is it exhaustive?  Yes, and thankfully so.  As long as catalogue items are put out like this, the CD will live on for many of us.  MP3the way of the future? No way!! I live for the highest fidelity & this, coming on the heels of the care given to the Beatles & U2 reissues gives me hope for the future.  Now if only I could afford the Neil Young ARCHIVES on Blu-Ray..........   If you love this album as I do, take the plunge.  Otherwise, one of the other 2 versions will definitely suffice (both 2 disc--2 CD or 1 CD/1 DVD).    Personally, I wish Fripp would reconsider this being a limited edition---I think everyone should have a chance to get it whenever they can afford it.

B0014E9188|5.0|I came across mention of Porcupine Tree on the DGM King Crimson site a few years ago. As the band was praised and I was a long term fan of KC, I had to check PT out. Now I'm no youngster at 55, but the first album I heard, In Absentia, blew me away. It was some of the best new music I had heard in a long time. Completely unexpected, it blew me away. It was very nice finding a new band like PT and their music has given me hours of pleasure, including this dvd. These guys rock just as good live as they do on record. I enjoy everyone in the band very much, but was surprised at Gavin Harrison's abilities on the drums. And John Wesley was nice to have on hand for the tours though he is not a member of the band. So, if you haven't gotten this yet, treat yourself to some great Steven Wilson and Company.
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|We always look forward to the DVD release of Lost so we can marathon the whole year. Now that it is in Blu-ray it's even better. This was the best season ever, especially when accompanied by Nikki Stafford's \\"Finding Lost\\" the unofficial guide (also available from Amazon).
B000FP2OPY|5.0|What a great first season, for any show in its demographic area. Just when we learned that Charmed was going into its last season, the WB brought us Supernatural. Granted, I did not want to like it, to me, it was replacing Charmed, but it didn't, it is a great show in its own rights. Jensen and Jared are excellent in the roles of Dean and Sam Winchester, I can not imagine any one else portraying them with such realism. It is like the show was created with them in mind. This is only the first season, and airing now is the fifth (and I have heard possibly last) season. I know they can not run forever, but I really am not ready to say good bye to Dean and Sam, just yet. Maybe what I have heard, is really just, rumors... Buy Supernatural, if you like anything dealing with urban legends, or if you enjoy horror (as much as it can really get, in a prime time slot). Remember Dean, Sam... your fans love you guys and wish you the best... Rose[[ASIN:B000FP2OPY Supernatural - The Complete First Season]]
0385504225|3.0|The book was a fun read, it had it's moments of adventure and revelation, however I will say I would rate this my least favorite among the Da vinci code and Angels and Demons.  I was hoping for a bigger payoff towards the end of the book, it lead me to think there was something amazing that would happen and it never occurred.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Bought his at amazon due to the lower price than at electronic stores.  Has worked great so far with no problems.  We have used it for a couple of weeks now and couldn't be happier.  The wireless range is about 6 six and is awesome so you don't pull the cord our or sit to close to the tv, but it does need to be charged a little more frequently than I expected, but we play quite a bit.  I would recommend getting the charger, we plug into our laptop's USB for charging and that can get to be a hassle.  Overall it does what it is suppose to.

It's a fascinating read about a young, gifted, child named Ender who is put into military training at an early age. I love the way the author crafts the world in which his characters live. I can't say how enjoyable this novel is. Just read it!

B002RSDW80|5.0|What I can say about this movie is that it is very pleasant and that is so refreshing after some of the doozies I've seen this year. It is so well acted--I mean who can ever say anything bad about Meryl Streeps acting as she's so brilliant--and the story--which intersperces between Julia and Julie--is nearly seamless. I just couldn't decide who's story I liked better! The best part, of course, is the food, which looks exquiset and delicious. It makes me want to cook, that's for sure! If you like movies that are movies and that tell a good story, don't pass this one up. It does all those things and more.

0061537969|5.0|Move over Lad, Nop, and Ol Yeller! Enzo's story is without doubt the best dog \\"tale\\" I've ever read! This is the story of a trying time for a Seattle family as told through the voice of their dog, Enzo. And what a voice it is! Enzo's style of communicating with the humans in his life will leave you laughing out loud. He especially expresses his regret throughout the book for his lack of ability to produce \\"complicated polysyllabic sounds that can be linked together to form sentences\\" and his lack of opposable thumbs. He bounces from totally human expressions and emotions to dog like reactions to the events in his life. The one, touching, constant in his life is his absolute adoration of his master, Denny. In the end, you will both laugh, cry, and receive the gift of the hope that we are never truly parted from our loved ones. Thank you Garth Stein, for the most entertaining, uplifting book I've read in a very long time.

B002XUL85G|5.0|This movie scared the heck out of me. It's not for those who enjoy seeing movies such as \\"Saw\\" where bodies are mutilated, (not scary just very disturbing). But if less is more, this is the movie for you. It taps into fears I think we all have, without using gore. Subtle, yet more than able to send many chills up ones spine. Couldn't sleep the night I saw it, and two months later STILL can't stick my foot out from under the covers.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Unlike previous reviews, Cry Me A River for me, is a knockout!  Over orchestrated?  Of course, but that has Davis Foster written all over it.

And why not get out of the \\"box\\" once in awhile.  His voice remains rich, strong, and deeply involved in each of his pieces.  I'm not a critic or rabid fan, but I know what I like, and this CD is terrific.  Crank it up and just let go!  Crazy Love?  For sure!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Good evening New York City turned out to be everything that we all hoped it would be, and a bit more.  From the opening notes of \\"Drive my Car\\" through the very end of this complete recorded concert on the hallowed grounds of old Shea Stadium, Macca has once again proven why he is the \\"greatest concert on earth.\\"  Never one to disappoint in concert, Paul had a crack team piece together this beautiful music documentary of (once again) historic significance.<br /><br />The Beatles were the first musical group to ever play Shea Stadium back in 1965, and Paul showed up unexpectedly at the final show at Shea last year when Billy Joel was closing the stadium with its final appearance (only to give way to Sir Paul playing the last song of the last show to close it out the way it was opened - with a Beatle)!  Finally, it was only fitting that Sir Paul McCartney be the obvious choice for opening Citifield Stadium with a concert to break in the \\"New Shea Stadium\\" as it were.  Man, did he and the band deliver.<br /><br />The large screens, photography, angles, stage backgrounds, special effects, and complimentary packaging were all fantastic (a McCartney staple in live performances).  They captured it all on this DVD package - and without a ton of interruptions, narration, and headache-induced celebrity jargon.  It is a live concert and comes across that way - which reminds me a bit of \\"Rockshow\\" from Wings' 1976 \\"Wings Across America\\" classic tour and movie.  The only difference is that Rockshow had been edited and was not the complete concert, as this one was.  Nice job guys!  Bravo.<br /><br />Finally, the packaging on this 2 CD + 1 DVD Combo is high quality and in a booklet-like presentation (so much nicer than 99% of cheap DVDs that are quickly packaged at the plants and mass produced for the taking).  The price is worth every penny on this production and I give my complete endorsement to purchase and own this marvelous set!  The only downside I have to this DVD is simply that I could have done without Alec Baldwin dubbed in at the beginning and end of this historic concert - as he has no significance whatsoever on The Beatles, popular music, the old Shea Stadium, and I felt the producers could have easily (too easily) picked just about anyone else to perform that function.  I am not a fan of Baldwin's at all, and most of us have seen how privvy his family believes they can be in Hollywood and the real world (need I even mention any legalities or ridiculous headline news he's been involved in over the years)... and this is the guy to use for such a historic concert?  Wrong choice totally... and that is a bit embarassing as a huge McCartney fan!  If it were a celebrity they needed (especially one from NYC itself) the list was long, talented, earned, and right in front of you all along (starting with Billy Joel and working outwards).  Excuse my diatribe on Baldwin, but I do find it quite perplexing, disturbing on a small level, and an obvious \\"last minute\\" decision because nobody significant was around (?).  You could have given me Keifer Sutherland, Tom Hanks, Paul Stanley, Paul Simon, and about 999 thousand other notbable choices before Alec Baldwin (even Rudy Giuliani) for the LOVE of Rock 'n Roll... I digress.without Alec Baldwin dubbed in at the beginning and end of this historic concert - as he has no significance whatsoever on The Beatles, popular music, the old Shea Stadium, and I felt the producers could have easily (too easily) picked just about anyone else to perform that function.

I have had many non-vegans comment that they actually prefer these cupcakes to their dairy infused counterparts on account of taste, texture, and fluffiness - and many have asked for the recipe for the vegan frosting which is delicious - better than the \\"real\\" stuff. The recipes are uncomplicated and delicious. Many recipes for vegan cupcakes leave you with cupcakes that are too dense, too firm; these cupcakes are more cake-like than any other vegan cupcake recipe I've tried - and the variations are endless and creative. With this book never be without a party pleasing dessert. Go ahead -impress your friends - you know you want to.

0312539525|1.0|Is this a new trend? A recent blockbuster film--\\"Sherlock Holmes\\"--in which Holmes is not the prissy gentleman detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but a slovenly 1960's hippy, and Dr Watson is no longer a bumbling senior citizen, but a very dapper younger man. The two trade snarky insults with all the fervor of a friendship that cannot say its name.<br /><br />But at least Sherlock Holmes was fictional! Now along comes Jeffery Archer and recreates a revered historical figure, George Mallory of Everest, that also bares no resemblance to the personality and career of the actual figure. This artistic license might work if he had painted an interesting portrait of this complicated man and his tragic drive to conquer the world's highest peak, but the portrait that results is a complete soap opera rewrite. His detailed descriptions of Mallory's teammates, their camp site palaver, even the geography of the mountain, will make anyone cringe who has even a passing acquaintance with this famous saga.<br /><br />Mallory was an earnest Boy Scout riding the social coattails of his Alpine and literary acquaintances. He was too personally disorganized ever to be a leader of men, nor did he have the interpersonal toughness for the job. The Alpinists respected him for his astonishingly skill at rock and mountain climbing; the literati adored his physique and fey demeanor. And he was a good guy. Yet Archer has Mallory boldly taking over the Royal Geographic Society's Everest Committee selection process with the commanding forcefulness of a Sergeant Major--qualities he wholly lacked--and boldly leading two Everest expeditions once on the mountain (he was on three).  It is true that Mallory was appointed \\"climbing leader\\" in 1924, but that position was a mere pat on the back and tightly supervised by Colonel Norton, who was a true leader of men.<br /><br />While he has Mallory issuing ultimatums to the august governing board left and right, Archer completely leaves out one of Mallory's greatest achievements-- discovering the primary route to the top from the Tibetan side and then being the first human to set foot on Everest's mighty flanks. This first expedition to Mt. Everest--the Reconnaissance Expedition of 1921--is not on Archer's path to glory. This was when Mallory and Guy Bullock almost circumnavigated Everest seeking the best approach to its steep slopes. After five months of the most arduous exploration, Mallory and Bullock finally discovered the hidden eastern side of the North Col at the head of the East Rongbuk Glacier. And it was at the beginning of this expedition, when absolutely nothing was known about the mountain's geography, that Mallory wrote to his wife that \\"we are about to walk off the map.\\" Of course that phrase is far too evocative to leave out, so Archer merely lifts it to plug into another made-up expedition.<br /><br />Archer is so enamored with the politically correct Tibetan name for Mt. Everest--\\"Chomolungma\\"--that he stuffs it into all the climbers' mouths. But the term was never used by them, and first appeared on Wheeler's 1925 map entitled \\"Mount Everest and the Chomo-lungma Group.\\" His tin ear is on loudest display when he repeatedly has the taciturn Noel Odell call leader Mallory \\"skipper.\\"<br /><br />Probably the most egregious display of political correctness (Does that help sell books nowadays?) is Archer's assertion that his Mallory had actually planned to select as his summit partner not one of the proven RGS climbers, but one of their Sherpa porters with amazing natural climbing abilities! This decision taken when even Australian RGS member George Finch was denied a place on the expedition because he was not English enough. Of course the historical realities were that while Sherpas are genetically endowed with the ability to work hard at high altitude, none of them had climbed mountains before the arrival of the English explorers and their \\"English air\\" (oxygen), and they were later taught the skill as ever more expeditions required their services.<br /><br />The final description of the Mallory and Irvine's climb into history lacks even the faintest patina of reality. They leave their high camp (given as at 27,300-ft--it was actually at 26,800ft) at 5AM carrying eight hours of oxygen. 10-1/2 hours later, they are still breathing the precious gas with presumably some still remaining for their descent. The description of the summit pyramid--available in scores of Everest chronicles, is also a hash. There is no knife-edged ridge after the Second Step, and there is no \\"vertical rock covered with ice that never melts from year to year\\" with \\"112-ft left to climb.\\"  And, of course, both men make it to the top before perishing on the descent.<br /><br />What is the point of this? It is called a novel, but uses actual names, places, and events all twisted into a Disneyesque cartoon. There is no other suggestion that this entire tale is desperately false. To further the deception, Archer prominently credits Audrey Salkeld, a real Everest historian, with \\"special thanks.\\" Oh how Mrs. Salkeld must feel used!<br /><br />Finally, a prominent blurb on the jacket of \\"Paths of Glory\\" reads \\"`A storyteller in the class of Alexander Dumas'--The Washington Post.\\" A Google search and a search of the Washington Post's archives could find no such quotation.their services.

I then received Spanglish on our Netflix account and again was surprised by the lack of silliness; in fact I thought it had great depth if a bit slow. I just purchased the DVD at Fry's Electronics to add to our collection of our favorite movies.<br /><br />To me the best thing about this movie was how it held to good moral standards in the face of temptation. There were a few really good lines as well and I found the entire movie quite plausible. Even my 15 year old son thought it was good.

B0001GMIOE|1.0|I chose Caveat Emptor, Latin for 'let the buyer beware', as the title of this review because it best describes how to approach a deal with this vendor for a Canon BP511A Lithium Ion battery.  At the same time I purchased this battery from Vortex Cable (VC) I purchased one from Amazon.com.  They both arrived within a couple of days of each other which allowed me the opportunity to compare them.  Upon performing a visual inspection, side-by-side, I noticed subtle differences between the two, previously pointed out by various reviewers, which leads me to believe the VC version is a knock-off.  I wouldn't have minded so much if the battery was advertised as a Canon and an obvious non-Canon replacement was sent, because you could easily discern that fact and ask for a replacement or your money back.  In this case though someone went to great lengths to make this battery appear as a Canon...right down to the packaging.  My recommendation is to avoid purchasing your battery here and pay a little more to ensure you are in fact receiving a true Canon replacement battery.
0385504225|5.0|As with other notable Dan Brown novels, The Lost Symbol has a very imaginative story line, is well researched (although literary license is employed), keeps you guessing and coming back.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|I can see how a movie like this can become popular in today's (American) society, where a high percentage of movie-paying teens have the mental compacity of an eight-year-old (anyone who takes even a little time to read about the current state of education in this country and how mentally stumped teenagers are today compared to teens from only twenty years ago will back me up). Eight-year-olds are easy to scare, so, by extension, today's teens would be, too. As for the rest of us who sat through this dreck, it was an insult to our intelligence. I found myself laughing at things that weren't intentionally funny. But what made me laugh even more was knowing that so many teenagers and young adults (at least the ones who actually stopped long enough from texting to watch the movie) were actually scared by this superficial tripe. That was the real entertainment.
B002VECM40|5.0|I get the sense that \\"Precious\\" is the type of film, and type of story, written and made to be almost like a documentary, to provide insight into what the key people have experienced in their lives. All of the creative people behind the pen and the camera clearly identify with the characters and the situations. I suspect they have had personal experience with similar situations; don't know this for a fact, but the film is so moving, so well-made, so interesting, I feel this has to be the situation here.<br /><br />I can't comment on how accurate the depiction of life for Precious, played by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe and her mother, played by Mo'Nique is, I have no reference point. But I can tell you the performances seem real.<br /><br />I was talking with someone about this film and told her she had to see it. Their response? \\"I think I can probably guess everything that happens in the film\\". I thought about this for a moment and replied that she was probably right. But the real reason to see this film is because everybody involved seems to be so passionate about the story and the characters, leading them to take both to depths you wouldn't expect.<br /><br />It is 1985 and Precious is an overweight, illiterate sixteen year old pregnant with her second child. She lives with her mom (Mo'Nique) in a shabby apartment in Harlem. Mom basically spends her days at home, watching television, eating and waiting for the welfare checks to arrive. When the weight of her life becomes too much, she takes her frustrations out on her daughter. Precious is good in one subject, math, and fantasizes about her math teacher, among many other things. One of these fantasies is interrupted by a call from the principal's office who confronts Precious and asks if she is pregnant again. Later, the principal shows up at their door step and her mom wants Precious to make her go away, she doesn't want anything or anyone to jeopardize her welfare checks. The principal recommends Precious attend a special school to help her get up to speed with her writing and work towards earning her GED. As soon as she arrives, Precious meets Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) who knows how to handle the group of rowdy girls in her class. Soon, everyone gets to know a bit about each other and Precious finds a refuge away from the horrors of her home. Along the way, she starts to tell the truth to a welfare worker (Mariah Carey). And a male nurse (Lenny Kravitz) also befriends her at the hospital when she gives birth to her second child. But she still has one wicked mother to contend with and won't ever be free until she is able to live her life without the influence of her mother.<br /><br />Directed by Lee Daniels (\\"Shadowboxer\\") and based on the book \\"Push\\" by Sapphire, the project was in development for a long time because Sapphire wanted the right people to make the film. Finally, Daniels, a relative unknown with one film to his credit, convinced her he had the right vision for the film and found newcomer Gabourey Sidibe to play the role of Precious. Everything seems to have fallen into place because \\"Precious\\" is the type of film that sears itself into your conscience. You won't forget this film for many, many years.<br /><br />It strikes me as odd that people always judge a newcomer's performance by how true and real it is, how lifelike. Wouldn't you expect a newcomer to be able to portray a more real person? Yes and no. Often, an inexperienced or novice actor feels they have to 'act' and try to make the role seem showy or worthy. Or the actor is often too conscious of the camera and begins to play to it, directing all of their emotion and attention to the camera rather than the other actors. So when you find a newcomer who appears completely natural, completely at ease, it is something to announce, to herald, because the actor has done something that helps us get lost in the story. Gabby Sidibe does this as \\"Precious\\". It isn't a role filled with a lot of dialogue, but this seems right for this character. You get the sense she is quiet because she is afraid to speak to certain people and afraid to reveal her lack of knowledge. Also, her mother frequently yells at her and gets mad at her if she says the wrong thing. And she can't tell the truth to certain people, for fear of jeopardizing some sort of assistance, so she remains quiet to prevent the truth slipping out.<br /><br />As we learn how truly bad this young ladies life is, we watch as she fantasizes about the things she wants in life. These moments are brief visual respites from the bleakness of her life, but because they happen whenever something bad is happening to Precious, they also take on a more ominous feeling. As some terrible events happen (some street kids throw something at Precious and knock her to the ground) she escapes by retreating to her fantasy life, imagining herself on the red carpet at an awards show with her light skinned boyfriend who has 'good hair'. These daydreams give us as much hope as they seem to give Precious.<br /><br />It is nice to see that there is some hope in Precious. Even though she lives in an extremely abusive environment, she does fairly well at school and finds some refuge there. I think this is why she is so upset when called into the principal's office. If she gets kicked out of school, what does she have then? Where can she go to escape? So the alternative school is not really a choice for her and when she finds she likes it, it becomes more of a new home for her.<br /><br />Gabby Sidoube hides a lot of her performance, letting it leak out through her eyes, her facial expressions, her body language. And this fits perfectly for a teenaged girl. We can see when the rage becomes too much and she acts out against her mother, when her exasperation at the living conditions becomes too much for her to bare and when the world weighs too heavily on her, there are moments, brief and fleeting, that give us all of the information we need. Sidoube doesn't say a lot in her portrayal of Precious, but she conveys a lot.<br /><br />Mo'Nique does a mesmerizing job of bringing Precious' mother, Mary to life. We have all seen abusive parents portrayed on the screen before, but Mo'Nique digs deep and makes this character truly frightening. Mary doesn't want to work and prefers to sit in their dingy apartment, surrounded by too many cats, eating and waiting for her daughter to return from school. She would clearly rather not have Precious go to school and would keep her home to provide constant companionship and attention. But she needs Precious to go to school to continue to get Welfare. She also pretends to love Precious' first child, who was born with birth defects, in order to get Welfare. But as soon as the Welfare worker is gone, she hands the child to her mother who is caring for the little girl.<br /><br />Bored and finding herself with way too much time on her hands, she watches television, naps, tries to fill the time. When Precious comes home, she take her frustrations out on her daughter.<br /><br />Mo'Nique doesn't seem to have any inhibition in her portrayal of one of the most unpleasant people you are likely to ever experience. Slow dancing with her self, she undulates next to their little television, some sitcom playing mindlessly in the background. Most actresses would try to inject some redeeming qualities into this character, but Mo'Nique doesn't. She seems to realize that would be wrong for Mary, Mary has been beaten down by life and will now do her best to beat down everyone else in her life. If she can't have something, why should anyone else? She is truly abusive and should be locked up. The performance is very good and deserves some recognition when Awards season begins.<br /><br />As the story progresses, there are little glimmers of hope in Precious' life. Ms. Rain (Patton) seems to realize what is going on in her newest student's life and tries to help her, befriending her at one point. WhenPrecious begins telling the truth to the Social Worker (Carey), we can see a weight lifted from her shoulders. And the social worker begins to help Precious. People show her some kindness when they begin to get the whole picture.

B002PMV9K6|2.0|Half Blood Prince was one of my favorite books in the series so I was looking forward to finally watching the film which I just did.  Sadly, even the 3 cups of coffee I had today could barely keep me awake for this dreadful, dull  and horribly depicted film.  How it is possible that a franchise with as much going for it as Harry Potter could allow this to happen?    My own two cents:   1.  There was way too much time spent on and with Horace Slugworth.  He had no fire and to watch all his onscreen time was an exercise in patience.   2.  One of my favorite story lines in the book was Tom Riddle's family.  They were so well written and interesting, they could have taken 15 minutes of time from Sluggy and that unfunny running gag of Ron's stalking admirer and invested us in getting to know Tom's people.  3.  I understand the books/films get darker as they progress.  I get this however one of the things I have always loved was the whimsical and magical objects and beings such as Nearly Headless Nick, Moaning Myrtle, moving staircases, howlers and talking paintings.  It's like this was no longer Hogwarts, a school of wizardry but a broken down castle with no element of anything magical.  4.  There are always going to be people who complain about what the film didn't cover and what was in the film but not the book but if you're going to tamper with a book such as HP, MAKE IT INTERESTING.      Let's do this one over.  Can we please?  I'd rather sit through a half hour with Dolores Umbridge, incessently meowing cats while she sips tea from her dainty teacup as her magic pen writes (painfully) on my hand one thousand time, \\"I must not write unkind reviews\\" (true as they may be).

B002PMV9FG|5.0|I will admit-the first time I saw this movie--in the theater--I was disappointed.  The second time, in IMAX, I liked it much better.  Since buying the movie, I have seen it three more times and now I love the movie.  It is definitely a \\"bridge\\" movie, making the bridge to the final episode.  It is also Rowling's way of giving Harry a break before the exciting climax to the series.
0307266303|5.0|The author is a writer for breezy, hip magazines and follows a similar style in this engaging tale.  The result is a very quick, page-turning read for a story that actually has limited action.  While nominally the story of a 50-mile race between a leading ultra-distance runner and members of the Tarahumara tribe of the forbidding Copper Canyons in Mexico, the race only occupies the very final portion of the book and amounts to a celebration of what has come before more than a climax.  The bulk of the book is centered on the author's journey of discovery about the nature and importance of running for homo sapiens, the relevance of the contemporary relevance of this evolutionary biology, the path to a happy and healthful life, and the sneaker-industrial complex.  The journey brings him into contact with an extraordinary group of characters, each with his/her own entertaining back story.  It got me enough that I went out the next day, got some FiveFingers, took them for a run, and felt great.  At whatever level this best-seller inspires you, fans of sports stories, fitness/health writing, and breezy storytelling will all enjoy this book.  Lives up to the hype.
B002VT6C0K|1.0|I'm completely baffled by all of the great reviews. This entire collection of short stories feel like the twilight zone! Too Much Happiness? Feels more like too much agony to finish this book!
0061719544|3.0|If you really want to know the story of Craig Ferguson, this book is for you and you should buy it right now.  Otherwise wait to read this book until you can borrow it from a friend, or don't bother reading it at all.      For its genre, I can imagine how this book might shine through.  However, I didn't find Ferguson's personal story to be very unique or more than somewhat compelling.  Nor did I think that his humor, which I enjoy on television in the rare occurrences when I'm able to watch, really carried over to the book.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|***SOME SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />When I heard all of the buzz about this movie, I couldn't wait to rent it. Alls I heard is that this is the scariest movie ever made, and how I'd be scared out of my wits watching it.  This wasn't even close.  I had a lot of problems with it.<br /><br />The first problem that I had was the sound quality. I understand they wanted to film it as if it was being filmed on a handheld (although it was a good sized one) camera.  Unfortunately, that's how it sounded too.  At times, the sound was low and not very clear. Again, I understand why it was filmed that way, but for me it didn't work. Actually, it took away from the movie.<br /><br />The characters of Katie and MIcha were very shallow, and after a while, really grated on my nerves.  They were so flat and didn't have  any depth to them. There was glimmers of depth do Katie, and at times I felt sorry for her, but other times, she was kind of annoying. There wasn't really and progression of any kind to them. Micha was so boring there was nothing to him. At times, Katie grew mad at Micha, and launched a few f-bombs, but then went back to her normal self. I'd have liked to see her get a bit madder as the movie went on. If Katie went from calm to getting angry, then flat out P*issed, would have been interesting to see.  This only happened when the demon possessed her at the end. I felt that was when she was most interesting to watch.<br /><br />This is  very boring movie. Nothing really happens until the last two minutes. That's why I gave it one star instead of zero stars. I actually liked the last couple of minutes. Up until then, **nothing** happens.  Sure, you get a growl, a door will move a bit, a chandelier will shake, keys will be moved, other small things happen, but that's it.  We're talking about a demon here. A demon. Why not push one of them down the steps? Throw one across the room? Have chairs being thrown about? Anything would have been good. I was just waiting for something to happen, and alls we see for a while, a door will move. That's it folks. As the movies goes on, we do seem some interesting things. A door slams, and then knocking, the girl is dragged out of bed and across the floor and then out of the room down the hall, and it possessed Katie. I actually liked that part, and that was at the end. I loved that! The movie should have started off like that, or have that happen sooner.<br /><br />The movie had a Medium, who was very annoying. He said there was a demon in the house.....and this was based on feelings. Not solid evidence, no investigation, nothing, Just a feeling. They could have used the medium and have him do an overnight investigation and have him find something..... anything. But no, he said there was a demon in the house, just on his feelings. The producers and writers missed a golden chance to have fear interjected in the movie.<br /><br />The attic scene bothered me. Again, they could have had something happen when Micha went to the attic. Have something fall, have Micha hear something, or have him see just a pair of eyes looking back at him, but the only thing he finds is a picture. That's it. Again, this was a fantastic scene if they movie makers wanted something scary to happen, but nothing was done, just a pic was found.<br /><br />I did like the very end. When we see Katie stumble out of the room, and go into the downstairs, then we hear blood curdling screams, them Micha wakes up and runs to her and he started screaming (we don't see why, and that really worked for me, loved the scene) then silence..... then we hear heavy footsteps, Micha is thrown into the bedroom, then Kaite stomps slowly in the room covered with blood. Katie then stomps to Micha's body....crawls.... sniffs it, then grins in the camera, and growls, has a horrible demonic grin, and attacks the camera, then it ends. I loved that part!!  That was spooky, eerie, and uncomfortable to watch. I love it! Why couldn't the entire movie be like that?  I would have loved it if the entire movie was as good as that once scene. It's just to bad, that it took sitting through a boring movie to get to that last scene. I also liked how we saw the footprints in the flour, very nice.<br /><br />I understand why the movie makers never showed us the demon. They figure the unseen is worse then the seen, and I agree with that. I loved the Blair Witch Project.  For some reason, in Paranormal Activity, it didn't work. Maybe if they made it more suspenseful by having the demon do more demonic things, it would have worked better than it did.<br /><br />If you want to see it, I'd say go for it. Just don't expect much to happen until the last two minutes.  This movie was way overhyped.s good as that once scene.

B00000DRE1|5.0|If you think the following 5 are classical MUST albums, then run and get \\"The Crimson Idol\\", you will be a proud owner!    You know these albums right..?     1. Slayer - South of heaven  2. The Cult - Sonic Temple  3. Metallica - Master of puppets  4. G & R - appetite for distraction  5. Megadeth  - Rust I peace    The crimson idol is right up there with rest. It manages to be 2 things at the same time: a concept album that tells the story of a young boy who becomes a rock & roll star and faces his shattered dream - and - strong accurate exploding songs, standing each by itself as individuals.    The rhythms, the story evolving from track to track, the guitar solos, the sounds of running drums, and the heartbreaking ballad towards the inevitable end \\"hold on to my heart\\" which makes you sink deep into the pain in this young man heart ,who tries to find salvation in love.    Listen to the album, read the lyrics, feel the work of art, and you will take a deep  journey through the soul of a young boy's soul who is raised in the sensation of \\"I'm the boy only the mirror sees\\".
B0019IB26I|5.0|It starts with the nice, mellow, acoustic set that sets the mood for a promising GREAT show! Great choice of songs to start off, ESPECIALLY \\"Stop This Train!\\" Kicks in, BLOWING MY MIND with the Trio... Oh man these guys can play! The second CD goes off with the full band set! You can hear EVERYTHING you want to hear on one of his shows! What else can I say??? The man speaks though a guitar with such an easy tone for the ear... I am a musician myself and I just don't get tired of hearing him. I can pick out ANY of his CDs, any day and just listen to the art of guitar playing gone RIGHT! A great buy for whoever is buying this CD!
B001KVZ6F2|2.0|Being a huge Clint Eastwood fan, I expected a lot more action than this film had. I knew basically what it was about, but again, not enough action, and truthfully, half the time I was waiting for something to happen, but it didn't. There was far too much sitting around staring at the neighbors to suit me, and the film was much too long to say what it had to say.  I might have liked the film better if the ending would have been a bit more upbeat, at least. But, I guess, I should have expected it after it became obvious that Eastwood's character had health problems and something had to be done to bring the bad guys to a closure.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I was introduced to John Mayer by a band mate which lives in Maryland. The fist thing I liked from John was his tone and choice of notes, aside from his great lyrics... Oh boy! I watched his \\"Any Given Thursday\\" DVD and was blow away! Then I saw his Trio set... But watching this DVD really gave me some goosebumps in \\"Bold As Love,\\" Jimmy Hendrix Cover, and Gravity... This is an AMAZING concert and has definitely made my DVD collection! The mood is set from the start with the acoustic set... then my favorite part which is the Trio (I love the Blues raw Guitar/Bass/Drum sound), then finishing up with the complete band which is GREAT! This is the third time I buy this DVD, I have recommended this DVD to some friends that loved it and just let them have it. I am not going to support piracy, especially because I know how hard it is for this type of talent to \\"make it!\\" This is a MUST BUY!!!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|Finally, something to make up for the fiasco of T3.  This was a great film! I almost didn't want to see this movie, but I'm glad I did now, and I wasn't disappointed. Lots of story and action going on here, kept me interested in it from start to finish. Christian Bale has become the go-to actor for franchise films, and this one continues in the tradition of the original, with lots more. And even better, the ending was much better than I would have expected, certainly, with the direction it seemed to be going after it was revealed that one of the heroes of the movie was a Terminator, they worked it out into a satisfying, if poignant, ending. And to top it all off, we even got a little bit of \\"Arnold\\" in the movie. Brilliant!
B0007PALSE|5.0|There is no substitute for working your way through the Asimov robot and foundation novels. The scope is just too large for a movie, or even a trilogy. However, this movie was a treat for this fan.    Sure, it is a new story, but the feel of the movie is right for the Asimov's future world. And Will Smith does a great job the smart and gutsy futuristic policeman that hates robots, but learns to see another side of things...    It has a lot of action, but thankfully avoids the gruesome blood and guts that some sci-fi has degenerated into.    If you like sci-fi, you'll probably enjoy this one!

0142414999|3.0|It pains me to give this a three, but the book doesn't warrant higher because of the deep inequality of the three stories.  John Green's story is great.  It's witty, quirky, and his voice shines through.  I was unfamiliar with the author two authors, but their stories failed to resonate with me.  I especially disliked the third story.  The girl came across as whiny, and I was disappointed in the author's execution.  The first story is fine, but rather unremarkable.<br /><br />Bottom line.  Buy this for the John Green story. He really is a fantastic writer.  I urge you to pick up Looking for Alaska, also written by him.

B000OMF3K6|5.0|A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!  If you have never read Dean Koontz, make this your first.  It is a must for all animal lovers, humanitarians, anyone interested in science, the supernatural, or love.  If you are already a fan, why haven't you read it yet?     This was the first Dean Koontz book I ever read (20+ years ago) and I was hooked!  I have read almost every one of his books since but this one remains my most favorite by far!  I found myself wondering what was going to happen next and could hardly wait to get home from work to take up where I left off the night before.     WATCHERS is throughly engrossing from the moment you begin.  You immediately identify with the characters and become immersed in thier world.  What made it even more enjoyable is that it could be VERY possible.  A dog with super intelligence?  Those of us that have the smartest dog in the world KNOW it is possible!     DON'T WAIT ANY LONGER!  YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON THE MOST TOUCHING, SATISFYING, FEEL GOOD STORY EVER WRITTEN!

0385340540|3.0|Reading John Grisham is kind of a hit or miss experience.  This book is more of a \\"miss\\" than a \\"hit.\\"<br /><br />I'll not go into the plot, what there is of it, or character development, what there is of it, and just say that it reads as if Grisham spent an extended holiday in Tuscany and knocked out this book so he could write it off as a tax deduction.<br /><br />As a fan of Tuscany, and the charming city of Bologna in particular, I enjoyed his description of the area and its history.  But the story lacked drive, a credible plot and a logical conclusion.<br /><br />Example: Part of the storyline is about satelites secretly launched into space by some nebulous organization (never really described credibly).  How were they launched secretly?  Well, a giant forest fire was intentionally started so that the smoke and flames would \\"hide\\" the rocket launch.  Uh, excuse me, but doesn't our military have \\"spy in the sky\\" satelites with the capability of seeing a jihadist light up a cigarette?  Am I suppose to suspend my belief so much that I would believe a forest fire covering up rocket launches?<br /><br />Example: You really never get a good explanation of why everyone is after Backman, why he was put in jail, why he was released, or why he is put into a sort of Witness Protection Plan with the end goal of having him killed.<br /><br />Example:  Backman isn't a nice person at the beginning of the book.  His character reminded me of Gordon Gecko from Wall Street.  So you would expect some enlightenment and redemption as the book draws to a conclusion.  But it never really happens.  I was left thinking that he only learned a little from his experience and would likely return to his former narcissistic, bullying, quasi-criminal, insensitive self. Not a very attractive protagonist.<br /><br />Example:  Backman's brother is introduced as a character who helps him escape and return to the U.S. (through a conveniently ignorant and inept Swiss banker).  Then the character, whose life is put in danger, is just left hanging.  No follow-up at all.<br /><br />Example:  Backman's love interest and his involvement with her is sketchy at best.  First, she is married to a dying husband---not a good dynamic for a love relationship.  They never really interact (sexually or otherwise).  The character development is so thin that you can only surmise that Backman is only interested in her because he has been in solitary confinement for several years.  So, his implied return to be with her at the end of the book seems farfetched.<br /><br />Example:  If you have to read the ending several times to figure it out, something isn't working.  I'm a voracious reader and a writer and an educated person---and I couldn't figure out the ending after reading it three times.  For me it was just a throwaway ending.  Its as if Grisham couldn't figure out a good ending---but he wanted to get the damn thing in print---so he just wrote something confusing and let it go at that, hoping no one would care all that much.  Well, I do.  Endings are important.  Many authors start a book with the ending already in place.<br /><br />What I don't understand is why a writer of Grisham's stature can't see (and correct) flaws in the book's structure like these---or why his editors can't suggest changes and corrections (isn't that what they are paid to do?). Why can't he give the manuscript to a few friends who will give honest feedback.  Do something to avoid three-star reviews when you're supposed to be a five-star author.<br /><br />Grisham could have corrected these flaws.  And with a few dozen more pages he could have developed real, believable characters.  Most readers are more than willing to read a longer, but better, book.

0142407380|4.0|Ark Angel does not compare to the awesomeness that the 5 previous Alex Rider installments have. While the idea--an evil Russian multibillionaire planning to send thousands of tons of steel hurtling down to earth by exploding his own space hotel--was grand, the rest just wasn't very good. Mr. Horowitz didn't do his miraculous plot a whole lot of good. I do, however, highly recommend the other books. Here are their ratings:  STORMBREAKER: 4 1/2 STARS  POINT BLANK: 4 1/2 STARS  SKELETON KEY: 5 STARS  EAGLE STRIKE: 5 STARS  SCORPIA: 4 1/2 STARS  ARK ANGEL: 4 STARS  SNAKEHEAD: 4 1/2 STARS  CROCODILE TEARS: N/A
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I am old enough to have seen TOS when it ran on NBC in the late 60's.  I have followed all the subsequent TV series and the movies.  This is another excellent chapter in the saga, and allows a new story line to develop with new actors, and personally I cannot wait for the next movie.  This gets two thumbs up from me.

B001US29I2|4.0|First Lego set we ever had a problem with (and my son has dozens of sets.)  The directions have you fitting two angled pieces together to make the base of a column (several times for several columns or pillars), but they don't fit tight enough to snap on to the base next to each other.  We had to modify the design slightly.  Frustrating!  The rest of the set is fine, and the walls blow out with the push of a button as shown, which is cool.
0307269981|4.0|The leads from TGWTDT return in a sequel that's an equally page-turning offering.  Things are slow going at first - even those who find the main characters fascinating may balk at spending page after page shopping with them at IKEA.<br /><br />However, things really get going at the midway point.  Lisabeth is so super-capable you never really fear for her safely as she is so resourceful and seems indestructible, so the author neatly shifts the perspective to other characters to allow the suspense and tension to ramp past the earlier book.<br /><br />At times the books tone borders on the strident and it's a little hypocritical to be lectured about misogogny when the main character here seems like a bit of a bi-curious male fantasy - she's even had breast enhancement this go around.  Meanwhile, our male lead's love life is as sexually indulgent as a rock star if more debonair.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What can be said about Susan Boyle's lovely alto singing voice?  May I suggest a few adjectives to describe her?  Rich tonal quality, magnificent control even on the higher notes, and also on the low notes, gentle and soft expression on meaningful songs, power and dynamics on the louder songs.  Her pitch is perfect, there is no wavering as she sings.  She has a dynamic range, even as an alto, for she can reach relatively high notes, and easily sing much lower.  I love her album. I could not wait for it to come out.  I have one of her CD's in my car, and bought an identical one for our home stereo set.  God has blessed Susan Boyle with one lovely gift, talent, voice.
0395389496|5.0|I absolutely love the Polar Express movie and my husband bought me the DVD for Christmas. Now that I have a baby of my own, I love the Polar Express story even more. It highlights the innocence in children and the love for Christmas time, the North Pole and Santa Claus! I bought the book for my daughter and I read it to her. The pictures are beautiful and makes the appreciation for the movie even greater. If you are a Polar Express fan, you would definitely love the book as a keepsake. It comes with its own little Polar Express keepsake, as well as a CD audio recording narrated by Liam Neeson. The atwork is indeed realistic and reading through each page, makes you think you are really on the Polar Express bound for the North Pole. A great book for children and even more beautiful for those who double Santa's existence!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I first heard Gaga on Dec 3rd 2008 when I was searching for songs to make a poppy mix CD for winter driving. This was way before she cracked top 40 radio. I took a shine instantly to the beats in Just Dance, and then the rest of the original Fame album just flowed and I couldn't stop listening. Having said all that, I think Gaga's next album will be a complete flame-out failure. Normally young artists can't possibly put out a sequel to a mega smash that will be anywhere remotely as good as its predecessor.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Once in a while, a film emerges as an instant classic that cannot be disputed. Pixar's \\"Up\\" (2009) is such a masterwork - a gloriously imaginative adventure for viewers old and young. Colorful yet unpretentious, this animated feature puts Hollywood's brain-dead commercialism to shame. Senior traveler Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) remains an unforgettable creation. The finest Pixar production to date and a textbook example of great filmmaking.

B00030DEQE|5.0|I bought this because my Striker II integrated NIC on my Vista 64 would continually (a couple of times a day) bug out with \\"losing its default gateway\\".  I also noticed that opening a large set of tabs in Mozilla was pretty slow.    The Intel card installed simply and didn't even require an additional driver (in Vista 64).  I have had no further problems and can tell a difference on page load time with ~8 tabs opening concurrently.    The Intel had a great price, easy install, and performs flawlessly on my 100 Mbps network.
0393327655|3.0|Although a very insightful and exceedingly well research book, to me, this is just another take, albeit from an interesting angle, on the \\"shooting fish in a barrel\\" dismantling of religion.  Veritable shelves have been written on this topic, but what is it exactly that Harris is adding to the conversation?<br /><br />Clearly his greatest concern is that we should stop giving religion a free pass to say whatever it may please.  As he writes, and I paraphrase, if a baseless idea is introduced, we should feel free to baselessly dismiss it.  Fair enough.<br /><br />What Harris doesn't address in this book is why people feel compelled to follow religion.  I am very curious where his career in neuroscience will take him as I feel he may offer some insight on the matter.  But as it goes, there is still something primordial about human consciousness that compels us.  In my opinion, a purely secular worldview is an incomplete one at best.  How can we account for our primal energies?  How can we deal with the fact that we are both independent and distinct yet mortal?  I am in by no means advocating blind adherence to metaphysics here, but the fact of the matter is that we create the idea of our self.  I'm just not sure that creating a satisfactory secular identity of personhood that is completely free from neurosis is even possible.<br /><br />Ultimately my point is that Harris himself acknowledges that there exists a vastly more efficient form of consciousness that functions without an \\"I.\\"  How do we get there?  How can we talk about this?  How do we get our society and culture to give this more attention?  These are the questions that Harris alludes to yet makes no effort to address.  He seems content explaining what we shouldn't do.  Without offering any solutions to these problems (which religion pragmatically pacifies... poorly), Harris seems to be doing little more than complaining about religion.  If not religion, then what?  Where to?  What's next?<br /><br />This book reminds me of the presidential election of 2008.  In this book, Harris is making theism out to be G.W.  His entire argument can then be thought of as \\"not G.W.\\" much like the \\"change\\" anthem of Obama.  The problem with Harris' argument then is that there is no \\"Obama;\\" he is offering no alternative whatsoever.  For me, Harris's book just does not make for a very effective or useful argument as it is constructed entirely in the negative with only periodic and mild allusions to the positive.<br /><br />Ah, it looks like the seemingly ubiquitous anti-non-theism troll responded to my review.  First of all, why would anyone attack -ideas- on amazon book reviews?  Seems a bit odd.  Are there not more appropriate forums for such discussion?  I was a bit shocked to read the SUANTT's comments as he seems to be deliberately misrepresenting Harris, forcing him into categories that Harris would never be comfortable with, such as forcing him into an anti-first amendment position which is simply ridiculous.  I do not think that the SUANTT has a very clear understanding of what Harris' intention even is.  The first amendment protects people, not ideas.  People can believe whatever they choose and vote as their heart guides them.  Harris' point is that, for example, if engaged in an argument about gay rights, and someone sites some venomous garbage from the bible or Qur'an, that we are not obligated to take them seriously.  Instead of hiding behind a social taboo of not confronting others' religious beliefs, Harris finds it time to call such ethical poisons out for what they are and hold them to a higher standard.  Next, the parallel to Nazism was just inappropriate on too many levels to list.  The \\"solution\\" I had in mind was an alternative to geographically and historically specific modes of faith faith as it seems pretty self evident that the current form of our religions are nearing the end of their usefulness.  What's next in line for humanity's mental evolution?  Apparently \\"Nazism\\" for the SUANTT.  How depressing.  Also, I'm just not sure where the SUANTT gets his overtly political grounding, as if Harris' book is a call to arms to write laws that prohibit religious expression.  This is just nonsense.  Harris' message goes beyond the trite confines of government asking humanity to wake up so that we can stop being confined by mythology.  The world is just too small for such pathetically limited yet absolute dogmas.<br /><br />So, if another comment comes up by the SUANTT, that means he's patrolling/trolling amazon, just waiting for someone to write a book review on something that he's morally opposed to.  In this case, it will be because he is double checking and re-reading reviews that he disagrees with.  I'm curious if he'll reply.  I suspect that he will.  I'm also getting the impression that the SUANTT continually and deliberately takes what other people say entirely out of context and applies it to his own strange system of logic.  I think the point that he is missing is that the vast majority of reasonable human beings do not take his apriori assumptions to be self-evident in the least.  This is a very fruitless form of argument.  If the topic of discussion is such antiquated apriori assumptions, its a little odd to use these assumptions to argue for them.depressing.

B001RTP3YQ|3.0|This is a nice CD for Cohen fans, but this is not the White Album II.<br />Aside from his few \\"hits\\" of the 1960s from his first album or two, there's<br />only a few new songs here that are worth much.  Cohen is adept at vague poetic imagery, but not a master poet or songwriter.  Most of his albums were full of bunk.  Besides, this man is not some saint, he's as guilty of sin and waywardness as anyone.  I found this album the same as his first; with an intriguing luster, but largely vapid, tinged with self-righteousness.  Cohen excels at concealing himself and meaning in his lyrics, which in the end defies high craftsmanship.<br />Strictly average.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I purchased a blu-ray DVD player and this Blu-Ray DVD (Full Metal Jacket) for my husband for Christmas. Realizing that this movie is older, I was concerned about the picture quality. I was also concerned because he is really into picture quality and this movie is one of his all-time favorites.  The picture quality was great. We enjoyed the movie and seeing it with such vivid colors and clarity. I would recommend this to anyone.

B002T9H2LA|2.0|It's not often that I see a film of my own choosing that completely frustrates and annoys me, then as Inglourious Basterds made it's DVD debut, I punched it into my Netflix queue and waited. When I got it in the mail I watched it and was amazed at how brilliant the shot composition was but how it lacked characters. This was a major disappointment as we get very little character development, and too much gaudy violence. This is a film that clocks in at about 2hr 30min and as usual is very dialogue heavy, and unfortunately we must read through an endless amount of subtitles. Essentially Quentin has taken a black sheep film and made it his own, and quite honestly it comes off as fancy nonsense. I'm not sure what anybody is supposed to gain from watching this film, except that when movies are made without a worthwhile story and characters that we can actually care about than we are missing the point of films entirely. I have always enjoyed the way that films have made people think over the years and this seems like a step in a backward direction and doesn't really give audiences anything to think about.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|One difficulty about any Harry Potter film is that the books are far richer,  So it is with the latest in the saga.  The film follows the basic storyline of the book, but some details are perhaps necessarily sidestepped.  Harry's growing attraction toward Ginny Weasley is minimized, as is Harry's struggle with the fact that she's his best friend's sister and how Harry is troubled as to how any budding romance might affect his friendship is mostly missing.  Likewise, the setup for Harry using the beozar is effectively absent, where in the book, it's prominent.  The film does carry the fundamental story along, but some of the things that were in the original are minimized or missing.<br />The film carries the basic storyline along, but it sheds some important details.  The whole subplot about Mrs. Weasley, Bill Weasley, and Fleur is missing, and that Fleur and Bill's impending weddingis an important element for the final story.  I have read that the final book, \\"Deathly Hallows,\\" will take more than one film.  With all that's missing in this film, it will have to tske more than one, just to make sense of things.
B000BT97AO|3.0|The images in this are stunning:  surreal, fluid, and ominously vivid.  However, at least for me, it did not quite hang together as  a story:  I was not taken in and able to forget that I was watching something that someone made up.  Moreover, the acting is uneven:  while Helena is quite good if somewhat raw as a talent, the mother appeared stiff to me and unable to conjure up either environment or mood.  This is a very personal, of course, so I do not mean to imply that the film would be as flat and incomprehensible to others.<br /><br />I got this for my kids, and they refused to watch it out of disinterest.
B002VKE0XA|3.0|I'm not going to be able to review the film Paranormal Activity any better than it has already been done a million times all over the net, so I'm not going to try.  I will say however, that seeing this in a packed pre-wide release theater with a bunch of like minded individuals was one of my most memorable movie going experiences of all time.  I really doubt that someone seeing it at home for the first time could feel the same way, but with a good surround sound setup and the right group of friends, it might just work.    I'm here to review the extras that are available on the home release.  Which is to say, I'm here to review nothing.  The only extra that you're getting if you've already seen this flick is an alternate ending.  Don't get me wrong it's an AWESOME alternate ending, and since it wasn't completely ruined in the films trailer/tv commercials like the theatrical ending was, I suggest watching the version with the new ending if this is your first time.  But that's it.  There is no commentary, no deleted scenes, no featurettes, no trailers, no discussion of the winding road to release that this film took (it had Spielberg bringing it back to Dreamworks in a plastic garbage bag because he thought it was possesed), nada.    There's a collectors version of the film that you can get on DVD (not blu-ray for some reason) but the only change from the other version is that you get a TV shirt and a movie cell.      So in conclusion, I LOVE this movie, but it might make sense to wait for the inevitable re-release with all of the bells and whistles, or at least wait until it hits Amazon Deal of the Day status for 9 bucks or something.[[ASIN:B002VKE0XA Paranormal Activity (2-Disc Digital Copy Edition) [Blu-ray]]]

B002L6I9Z4|4.0|This was a birthday present for a three year old and they love it.  We tried an old \\"regular\\" digital camera before this, and it was too complicated and led to a lot of frustration.  This one is very simple to use, with only the essential buttons and functions.      Despite having a higher resolution sensor than other \\"kids cameras\\", this one doesn't take very good pictures.  If image quality matters, you will be disappointed.      Pros:  - Simple to use  - Fun design  - Seems very durable  - Battery life  - Rechargeable battery    Cons:  - Bad picture quality (think first gen cell phone camera)    I'd highly recommend it for 2-4 year olds.  Older than that and I'd look for something with better image quality.

B002QGUFWE|1.0|like hey. i am lady gaga. and i present you my new album...monster. I am super proud of my first album...but this one shall cover serious topics. yes my first album was great for what it was..but this one i decided to really hone my art. the first single is called feeling on my booty (up in this club). I wrote it all by myself and like many songs on my album, it is about a monster. the monster of pretensiousness and maybe about the art of grandiose posturing.     Gaga has it good. her fame is a sign of the times. the tracks are even more formulatic pop....sometimes gaga is up in the club or maybe she is yelping about a hot boy...but if you can bare to hear her talk about the album in a interview youd imagine this album being another hounds of love.     in your dreams, honey. it takes more than squeezing into an outdated grace jones outfit and regurgitating madonnas erotica shtick to become a pop icon. lady gaga does take a sad stab at it with speechless...and the result is less than pleasing. shall we say...grating? ear splitting?    my advice to gaga: stick to what you are good at.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|What do we want in life?  Do we want the happy ending?  Do we want to live the safe life?  Do we want to always search for adventure?    These are the questions that Woody Allen and this film ask of its viewers.  Cristina is the classic lost youth of generation X/Y, looking for a meaning in the worlds, knowing only what she does not like.  Vicki, on the other hand, is the career oriented woman who knows exactly what she wants, and has the husband to match.  She is leading a safe life.  When posed with the question by the dashing Javier Bardem as the mysterious and sensitive painter Juan Antonio, these two woman are forced to confront their own philosophies of life.  Infused with the ever vivacious Penelope Cruz and the muse and femme fatale, Maria Elena, this film is another Allen masterpiece of existential angst played in his late comic style.  Set against the beautiful backdrop of Catalonia, the film has all the classic Allen tricks, the fun voice overs and the wacky Allen mid movie alter ego.  A must watch.  In the end, you may not like this film, but in the very least you will no what you do not like...much like the characters in this film.

B001HUZYKI|5.0|I read this book shortly after it was published because as a climber myself I knew about this event before Joe Simpson even started writing it. Hope this review will be useful to those who haven't read it yet although it was published many years ago.    The story is very compelling because it shows:  - A moral controversy that created lots of discussions within the climbing community, either in favor or against Simon cutting the rope (with Joe himself being in favor. And I as a climber am also convinced that Simon made the right decision).  - The successful climb in itself and the struggle to get out of the mountain was already worth writing about it.  - Joe's decision making and determination are nothing short of admirable, and a great lesson for all to learn in life.  - Joe's journey psycological and physical went beyond what most of us would've considered humanly possible.    This book is a must to all kinds of people.

1417829621|3.0|John Steinbeck's last work of fiction, 'The Winter of Our Discontent', examines the 'moral flabbiness' of post-war America, particularly that of the late 1950's.  Its stated question, posed by the main character Ethan Allen Hawley in a first person monologue, is whether an ethical man can set aside his principles, do what is required to advance himself in the world, and then, objective reached, reclaim those principles without suffering moral damage.  That Hawley does eventually convince himself to attempt such a 'moral holiday', to prove for himself that it's possible, and the results he obtains is the crux of the book - but from its melodramatic set-up to its engineered ending, it seems as though Steinbeck were shouting out his subject's terrible relevance on every page.<br /><br />I nearly put this book down before I finished the first chapter.  It begins with several pages of dialog that sounds artificial and too special, followed by a character sketch of Hawley as he interacts with the same townspeople he'll have to deal with during his 'holiday'.  This blatant foundation seems amateurish, and I can't help but think of the last Steinbeck book I read, 'To a God Unknown', which, while it had its faults, had an intrinsic vitality to its spare prose and a calm, evocative pace that is lacking in this much later work.<br /><br />In the book's third chapter, Steinbeck changes his point of view, and Hawley begins to address the reader in the first person.  At this point, I did get somewhat drawn into the story, and once his machinations come clearer, there is a bit of tension to their resolution.  Unfortunately, the necessity of having the story impart a lesson trumps a realistic, though probably ambiguous, ending, and instead concludes with Hawley frantically out of character.<br /><br />'Winter of Our Discontent' isn't as terrible as I've probably made it out to sound, but it is disappointing in relation to other Steinbeck novels that I've read.  In this Penguin Classics Edition, Susan Shillinglaw writes a perceptive, and positive, introduction that contextualizes 'Winter' with Steinbeck's life, and also catalogs some of the references to the outside world that gives this novel an extra layer of texture and nuance; however this still fails to overcome its melodramatic air.  In that sense, 'Winter' is reminiscent of 'East of Eden', and readers who enjoyed that Steinbeck work may also find 'The Winter of Our Discontent' to their liking.Shillinglaw writes a perceptive, and positive, introduction that contextualizes 'Winter' with Steinbeck's life, and also catalogs some of the references to the outside world that gives this novel an extra layer of texture and nuance; however this still fails to overcome its melodramatic air.

1594488843|5.0|Just as with free agency and bi-modal brain development, Dan Pink once again stops old thinking in its tracks.  In \\"Drive,\\" Dan takes all the carrots and sticks that have supported the slowly dying habits of ineffective management and beats them back into the past where they belong.  The research and stories that he tells underpin a critical truth of working life: The best work is done for so many more good reasons than money, and the organizations that figure that out and act in concert will prosper. Don't agree? Do you genuinely equate people with horses? If you do, \\"Drive\\" is going to make you increasingly uncomfortable in what it reveals.  But try to ignore it; insist that your methods of motivation have legitimate value.  Ultimately, your venture will suffer in this world that, every single day,  has less and less understanding and patience for mediocrity.  Or you could choose to Drive.

Yeah, that's the last 3 seconds of the film...the rest of the film is a snore.<br /><br />Has anyone ever sent you one of those pictures where they tell you to look closely for something in the background or follow a maze, then suddenly the creepy face pops up and it screams at you?  Yeah, that's pretty much the summary of Paranormal Activity.  Save your money and just Google \\"scary maze game\\".

I'm not saying it is not a good read, or that I regret the time spent reading it... but it fell short of my expectations - expectations that I think were realistic and fair.<br /><br />If you picture a common bell curve, with DaVinci Code at the apex, then it gives you a visual indication that The Lost Symbol begins the turn downward for Dan Brown's books. Let's hope that this is not a traditional bell curve, and this book is just a depresion in what will be an otherwise good writing career. I use the bell curve analogy because I have read each of his novels, and I felt that DaVinci Code was the product of a stedily progressive writing skill. Unfortunately, Lost Symbol takes a turn for the worse. At times I almost felt I was reading a book on par with Deception Point again.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT:<br />  From the early stages of plot development, this book seemed a little weak. I found myself not really caring that much what the big mystery was, how Professor Langdon was going to solve it, and what obstacles would confront him along the way. Not that I didn't want to - Mr. Brown just made it very difficult. His descriptions of the mundane events and actions in this book are far too wordy and detailed, yet he cuts away sharply at times when further detail and color would be nice.<br />  Professor Langdon is reduced to a drooling idiot in this book (the reason for my reference to an earlier novel \\"Deception Point\\"). The good professor is bewildered and befuddled through the entire story - never once taking charge and having purpose. Seems odd that his character is involved in the story because \\"only he\\" can solve the mystery, and \\"he alone\\" is the subject matter expert... meanwhile, he has to have everything explained to him for the entire book. If Tom Hanks has read this book, he is surely telling his agent to get him out of any obligation to play the role in the inevitable film, unless he is in the mood for a Forrest Gump reprise (\\"Momma always said that life was like a ancient symbol\\"...).<br />  The character of Katherine in this story is stupider yet, even though she is a brillian scientist. She makes all the typical \\"dumb woman\\" moves and decisions that one would expect from a 1950's horror movie. What a step backwards for women in this character.<br />  And finally - what I liked the least - was the letdown. Hard to describe without spoiling the story, but the payoff just isn't there at the end of this book.<br /><br />I'm not saying it has NO value, but next time Mr. Brown writes a book, I might just wait for the movie to come out (on cable) - because it seems that he is less concerned with writing a good book and more concerned with following a mediocre Hollywood formula.any obligation to play the role in the inevitable film, unless he is in the mood for a Forrest Gump reprise (\\"Momma always said that life was like a ancient symbol\\"...).

B002VPE1AM|4.0|First and foremost, let me state this up front : 'Avatar' is probably, visually speaking, the most amazing movie that I have ever seen. Big words, yes, but an even bigger movie. I chose to see this film in 3-D (and if you have the option for either 3-D or IMAX, I highly recommend it), and it was almost overwhelming. I don't mean that in a negative sense, but it was just so visually vibrant, that it's almost impossible to take it all in. In fact, the thought of \\"this will be the biggest selling blu-ray movie of all time\\" actually popped into my head at one point.<br /><br />All that said, I spotted this movie an extra star because of the visuals. In terms of a story, it's largely unoriginal. This isn't to say that this is a bad movie, but it mirrors to many extents 'Dances With Wolves' (a sentiment I've read and heard repeatedly, and can now verify).<br /><br />The story is told through three very distinct acts. The first act, while setting up the story and establishing the character of Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), trods along at a snail's pace. In some ways, the visuals overlap the dull pace of the first act. The second act is told in classic fashion, and for fear of spoilers, I will not reveal more than that. The third act, also, is told in classic fashion.<br /><br />While there was no bad acting in this movie, there was also no noteworthy acting in it, either. Therefore, I will not comment on the acting performances other than to say that nobody was bad, nobody was amazing. This is not the kind of movie that needs to rely on master thespians to carry it.<br /><br />James Cameron found himself in a somewhat enviable predicament : he'd created one of the most popular and highest-grossing films of all time in 'Titanic', garnered every possible award, and was (yes, I'm going to say it) the king of the world. As a movie maker, where does one go from there? He was in near-obscurity for the better part of a decade, which might have been the right career move. In that time, 'Avatar' was born. He could have possibly needed 10 years to put together the visual seen in this movie. This film is very, very well-directed. In the hands of a lesser director, this movie could have easily been D.O.A. upon release.<br /><br />Overall, 'Avatar' is a very entertaining movie, but I wouldn't call it a \\"great\\" movie. I sincerely believe it should win most (if not all) of the technical awards this season, but I do not feel it is deserving of the Oscar for Best Picture (thus far, my vote would be for 'Up In The Air', given the dynamic of the way the awards are given out). Given the gargantuan presentation of the movie, if you're at all inclined to see 'Avatar', I cannot recommend seeing it in 3-D or IMAX enough. For the visuals in this movie, it will be money well spent.. He could have possibly needed 10 years to put together the visual seen in this movie. This film is very, very well-directed.

0735201684|4.0|\\"Change your thoughts and you change your destiny.\\" ~ Joseph Murphy<br /><br />If you loved reading [[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]] you will find \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" to be equally exciting. I liked this book even though I disagreed with the main premise. I don't think the subconscious mind is infinite intelligence nor do I think it is wise to pray to yourself. Beyond these two ideas there are a lot of helpful affirmations that you can use as suggestions that will change your life in measurable ways. You can test out the affirmations and see if they work for you.<br /><br />The real-life stories of how these affirmations worked in the lives of people the author describes are truly amazing. People were healed and also seemed to have the ability to heal others just by praying. I'd suggest that every time you read about praying to your subconscious you direct the exact same prayer to God. This book is somewhat religious in that it has many pertinent Bible verses off which the main points of this book are founded. Overall this is a very positive book that can help you with issues like marital problems and difficult people.<br /><br />This book promises you that your destiny is in your hands. It is very appealing because you can change your thinking and therefore change your entire life. I could fully agree with one of the main points in this book. I think it is truly a fact that fear, worry, anxiety, jealousy and hatred destroys the body and can make you ill. This book will be especially helpful to people who are trying to defeat diseases. I think I mainly liked this book because it gives hope and that is much needed in our society today.<br /><br />Even if you have not read the original book, you will be able to tell where Ian McMahan changed the book. He has basically made some of the examples appeal to the modern reader.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

0525421033|5.0|Yes, another book it has taken way too long to get around to. Everyone's reviews about this book are right- this is an amazing book. Forman does an excellent job writing about how Mia deals with her death and having to choose between staying or moving on. It's a powerful story that pulls you along and keeps you turning pages. I really enjoyed how Forman went back and forth between the present day and flashbacks where we learn about Mia's family, boyfriend, and friends and of course more about Mia herself. One of the things that bugged me about the book had more to do with a real-life policy than anything Forman did. I got so PO'd reading about how only immediate family are let in to see the patient; that has got to be the stupidest policy in the world. Is your immediate family the only people in the world who love you? Certainly not- you've got friends, a partner, etc. and they should be allowed to see you as well. It makes no sense to keep them out. Anyway, rant over, lol. This is a highly recommended book that deserves all the praise it gets.    From Gayle Forman: \\"About hospital policy...it's an ICU thing. Many hospitals--not all, but definitely the ones I've visited-- restrict who can visit the ICU, in particular. And obviously, for the sake of this narrative, Mia's hospital had to be one of the hardass hospitals. It sort of makes sense. ICUs are pretty intense places and they don't want crowds in there. Of course, in MIa's case, it doesn't make sense at all.\\"

0545140315|5.0|I went through this book so quickly, I amazed myself, especially since I've been working late this week. I absolutely adored this book and would probably put it on a Best of '09 Books list if I were making such a list. I loved the emphasis put on friendships between girls, which can be lacking in many YA novels, even though many YA novels focus on girls. The concept was very original and I loved how the Lonely Hearts Club went from a lonely one member to a huge club and all that came along with that new-found popularity. Eulberg's characterization is spot-on as well and many of the characters were really well-written and fleshed out. Penny's voice was amazing and I loved how she felt like a real person, flaws and all. The romance was handled very well and it was interesting reading the journey between those two characters. This is such a wonderful, funny, and empowering book for really anybody, though especially girls. But the message of it is for anybody- don't lose sight of yourself or your friends when dating someone, just to make that one person happy; you need to do what's right for you and what makes you happy, not anyone else. So seriously, use your gift cards to buy this book- you won't be disappointed!
1401323820|3.0|This book was very good and very faithful to the show Castle.  However, when it arrived I was shocked at how short it was, this is about half the size of a regular mystery book.   If you want a good (short) read I recommend it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|It is wonderful to see that this 'diamond in the rough' has finally been recognized for her talent.  I would recommend this highly.    I would also like to see a few more 'lively' tunes on her next album, which I will definitely purchase when it comes out.
B00005M1CO|3.0|Listening to the preview clips from this album, it sounds beautiful, catchy, and competent.  And indeed, the bits of music in the previews are all of those things.  However, the previews very poorly represent the full songs.    This album exemplifies what may be Elvenking's greatest weaknesses.  With the notable exceptions of Pagan Purity, the Regality Dance and Seasonspeech, each song sounds like it was cobbled together from a mix of half-formed ideas, spare melodies, and clips swept up off the cutting room floor.  Beautiful songs are interspersed with pieces of what sound like completely different songs.  Worse songs.  Random segments of growls - both low and high - abound, turning what might be a great blend of folk and metal into something ridiculous.  Some songs seem to have no unifying theme at all and are instead just a medley of undercooked ideas.  Worst of all, some of these short clips are breathtakingly good, and it is heartbreaking that they now will never develop into full songs of their own.    There is some good music to be found here but only if you're willing to work - or wait - for it.  If not, I'd recommend any of Elvenking's other albums instead.

B002VLNB1Q|5.0|John Mayer is a bright, creative guitar-slinger and artist. I, too, fell in love with life with John during the \\"Continuum\\" years, and I'm going to continue to grow with him during the \\"Battle Studies\\" years. Here, in his 30's, we see his music reflect thoughts on the playboy lifestyle, being a single young man, and the positives of smoking cannabis.<br /><br />I only hope that John continues to grow with me. I'm going to hit my 40's at some point, and I hope that his music continues to reflect the emotional complexity of life. Hearing about the positives of leaving women he loves is going to get old a decade from now, so I wish for him a rich, rewarding emotional life at home, when he's vacationing from his beloved guitar. I, personally, hope he finds love, one that lasts longer than a night or two. I say this because I want to hear the musical resolution of \\"now, I get to stay and fulfill my dreams.\\"<br /><br />That said, \\"Crossroads\\" is going to be FANTASTIC in concert. I cannot WAIT to hear this blues-y track live. Also, \\"Assassin\\" is one to listen to again and again. His production on this album  is fantastic, and the different aspects of the song - vocal quality, guitar, background vocals, and the \\"corners\\" into which you can just HEAR a live John Mayer exploring - are complex, balanced, rich, and kind to the ear that hears this man evolving into a legend.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|I hesitated for awhile. I had already bought the stereo and mono box sets and what did I need this for? I mean, could it really sound that much better? Limited edition? Where had I heard that before? But there was a little money left over after all the Christmas shopping so I jumped. Initially very disapointed; the stem was broke off. A flaw in the design. Dang! Instead of going through the hassle of returning it and maybe not getting a replacement I used a small drop of Krazy Glue and stood the stem up and now it's as good as new.     Sound qaulity has always been paramount to me. I got back into vinyl this year and regularly buy MFSL and Audio Fidelity Gold cds but these FLAC files...they are the bomb. I have been listening to these over and over and I am blown away by the sound. As others have said I am hearing so much that I never picked up on before such as \\"The Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members\\" and other snippets of dialog on Let It Be that I didn't know were there. I can not say enough good things about the sound.      I'm not that good with a computer so it is a hassle to put the FLAC files on my Ipod. I gave up on that. The mp3's on here sound pretty good too. The Winamp software plays the files sufficiently and tries to take over duties from Itunes at the same time.     I hope they release the mono versions in FLAC files and other artists follow The Beatles lead and put their catalogs out in similiar fashion. This is a great purchase.
B001OQCV60|3.0|This was not a film I was really looking forward to; I thought the trailer looked absolutely horrible, like a dumbed-down buddy-cop movie transplanted into the Victorian age - and I'm not at all a fan of director Guy Ritchie.  So despite my appreciation for both Robert Downey Jr (Holmes) and Mark Strong (Lord Blackwood, the villain of the piece), I wasn't really sure until a week ago that I'd bother seeing it theatrically at all.  But what the heck, I love Holmes, even at his worst, so I went anyway.<br /><br />So....going in with absolutely the lowest expectations possible, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  No, it wasn't a great movie, but I actually enjoyed myself for a good bit of the running time (which felt longer than it was, never a good sign at all but particularly in an action movie).  This Holmes and Watson are an action-movie buddy duo, get that straight right away.  You have to take it as a given that this won't bear too much relationship to Conan Doyle, and that the action is going to take precedence over any pretense of a meticulous or carefully worked-out plot.  The film begins with our heroes busting up an occult ritual, saving a half-naked girl from villain Blackwood's sacrifice, and it rarely pauses for reflection in it's more than two hours.<br /><br />The plot's not bad - though some of the dialogue is, and the joking references and bits lifted from the stories are usually poorly placed and awkward - I guess they're supposed to be manna for the serious fans, but they seem like cynical moves often.  Essentially Holmes and Watson are about to break their partnership as Watson is about to get married, but Watson keeps getting drawn back to help Holmes in defeating the hanged but apparently still living Blackwood's plots which involve both ancient occult ceremonies and modern (too modern - the film verges on steampunk) weaponry.  Some have complained about these basic plot elements, but Holmes confronted religion and the occult and dealt with plots against the government many times in the stories.  It's the fast-action gloss on it all and the poor editing and crashing sound and overbearing music that really take one out of the 19th century, I think.<br /><br />BUT...Downey and Jude Law (Dr. Watson) have an undeniable charisma, and there actually is a fair amount of deduction and detective work inserted in between the fighting and explosions.  And sometimes within the action sequences, as we see Holmes more than once analyze how best to take down an opponent, scientifically and in slow motion - and then do it exactly as planned, in trademark Ritchie fast-mo.  In fact it's the action sequences that are problematic, at least if you don't like Ritchie's fast-mo, fast-cutting style (thankfully not always in place and not as overdone here as in the other films I've seen).  The moments of conversation, the humor, and the character interactions between the two Baker Street roommates, and between Holmes and ladyfriend Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) worked pretty well.<br /><br />As to Downey in particular, as he is really the reason this project got off the ground and got a significant budget and marketing, well he's great.  He's clearly doing his own thing - a physical, somewhat disreputable and ragged Holmes, which I think a case can be made for.  Holmes famously knew and cared nothing for most things in the world that didn't impact his work, and I think that an unshaven, dishevelled and unwashed Holmes works ok.  He's a man of action, but Downey always shows a penetrating, if somewhat tossed-off intellect.  He speaks very rapidly, it's as if his speech is trying to keep up with his mind and sometimes he's quite hard to understand - though the excessively loud and FX-heavy sound mix is probably as much to blame as he is.  The accent's OK I guess, but I'm not sure that matters a whole lot; as the film doesn't feel particularly Victorian why should it feel particularly British either?<br /><br />So very much a mixed bag.  Certainly if you're looking for a faithful \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", you won't get it (though truth be told, most previous incarnations aren't all that close to Conan Doyle either); Ritchie's direction is as uninteresting and hamfisted as ever to me - he can't even compose an interesting shot as Michael Bay at least manages once in a while.  But the cast was for the most part solid and seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I had fun as long as I allowed my brain to idle.  If it's far from the best of all cinematic Holmes, it's probably not the worst either, and watching one of the greatest English-language actors under 50 today do his thing was always a pleasure.or a faithful \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", you won't get it (though truth be told, most previous incarnations aren't all that close to Conan Doyle either); Ritchie's direction is as uninteresting and hamfisted as ever to me - he can't even compose an interesting shot as Michael Bay at least manages once in a while.

B002K0WBXW|3.0|The Proposal is a \\"chick flick,\\" that follows many of the genre's conventions. Tough publishing executive Sandra Bullock faces deportation from the U.S. So, she forces her assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to become engaged to her because the marriage will help keep her in the country. The evil immigration authorities are suspicious of Bullock's motives for the marriage.    If you can overcome the unbelievable premise, this movie is a lot of fun. Bullock and Reynolds go to Alaska to meet his family. Bullock and Reynolds grate on each other's nerves. But then... well, you can probably guess what happens next.    This film is sort like an extended version of a sitcom. The cast is excellent; the duo of Bullock and Reynolds works well as an on-screen couple. The movie also includes some gorgeous scenery from Alaska.    The script involves the typical, ridiculous twists and turns that one finds in romantic comedies. There are some very silly moments in the film, particularly in a scene in which Bullock lets the family dog out of the house. Viewers will have to enjoy the film in spite of the obvious facts that none of this stuff could ever happen and no one behaves in a way that is very realistic.     The Proposal is good for viewers who want a few laughs and simple escapism.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|The title says it all. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" was definitely Tarantino's best film since \\"Reservoir Dogs.\\" Some of the other reviewers may chalk my enthusiasm about this film to my being a \\"Tarantino Fanboy\\", let me make one thing clear, I am definitely NOT a Tarantino Fanboy. I absolutely hated his last three films. The \\"Kill Bill\\" franchise was a comic throwback to director Takashi Miike, and \\"Death Proof\\" acted as a far-too-lengthy outlet for Tarantino to display gratuitous scenes revolving around his foot fetish. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" makes up for any wrongdoings Tarantino has ever made in film. Overall, it's brilliant.<br />  The story revolves around a group of renegade American (mostly Jewish) soldiers, who infiltrate Nazi occupied France during the second World War solely for one purpose, they are all in the \\"killing Nazi business\\" and for the Basterds, \\"business is a'boomin!\\"<br />  Tarantino has essentially re-written the outcome of the war, with style, action, and (surprisingly) a hell of a lot of class. The characters are engaging from Pitt's comical Lt. Aldo Raine to Christoph Waltz, a newcomer to American Cinema, who portrays Col. Hans Landa, the spookiest Nazi to grace the screen since Ralph Fiennes in \\"Shindler's List.\\" Waltz has raised the bar for both writers and actors and has quite possibly re-invented the onscreen villain. I'm sure we will see a lot more of Waltz considering he is also playing Chudnofsky in the upcoming \\"Green Hornet\\" movie.<br />  I've noticed that a few of the reviews have talked about \\"needless dialogue\\" or \\"too much reading.\\" The movie takes place in France, which, at the time was fully occupied by German military personnel, of course they will speak French and German. There is a good portion of the movie that is also in English and, very little (if any) of the dialogue is \\"needless.\\" Everything happens for a reason. While there are some signature stylistic flares present in the movie, those need to be expected. It's Tarantino... come on. The subtitles, while overbearing at first, really aren't noticeable about 20 minutes in. By that point the movie has begun to move along so swimmingly that they become second nature.<br />  Long story short, this movie is awesome. If you aren't a fan of Tarantino, see the movie just to experience Christoph Waltz, he alone is well worth the time and money you may spend to see this film. He stole the show hands down, and put Brad Pitt in his place (at least as far as this movie is concerned). The story is epic, a brilliant retelling of WWII, with action, romance (sort of), cunning, a healthy dose of comedy, a few cameos, and with acting that is definitely Oscar-worthy. I gave this film 5 stars for a reason, you will not be disappointed.ome on. The subtitles, while overbearing at first, really aren't noticeable about 20 minutes in.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|This is a great boxed set of the complete series of DQMW. I loved that each season is in its own box, and yet the discs are numbered consecutively (1-42) and clearly labeled... sometimes a \\"complete series\\" will use double-sided DVDs, to save space, but these are easy to read and handle. YES--the movies are also included (though not my favorite part, by any means... but that's another review).<br /><br />The series itself is great family entertainment, and wonderfully romantic. For once, a series managed to show a \\"realistic\\" (TV Realistic, anyway) relationship, from attraction through courting through marriage, without losing the dramatic elements. Viewers start to feel like they know all the unique townspeople, from Hank the saloon owner to Dorothy the journalist to Horace, the sweet but bumbling telegraph operator, who are lovable at least as often as they are less than intelligent. If you've never seen the series, you should be forewarned that almost every episode is a Very Special Episiode--Dr. Mike (our heroine) goes head to head with issues as varied as corporal punishment, teaching evolution, and gun violence. The character of Colleen is played by a different actress starting midway through (ala Becky from Roseanne or Darren from Bewitched). And the sixth season bogs down in more depressing episodes and less Sully (our hero). Still, it's great to see the characters and the town grow. And it's *really* great to get the entire series for the price of two seasons worth!
9113020730|5.0|About the only thing wrong with this third and final chapter of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is knowing that there's no book four, this owing to Mr. Larsson's untimely and early death.  Supposedly, the author had an early draft of a fourth book and had sketched out a ten-book series.  The movies will have to do for now.<br /><br />Larsson's Lisbeth Salander is a singular creation.  His creation of her world - as well as that of Mikael Blomkvist's - is laden with rich, fascinating detail that smells of the stuff of real-life.  Of particular note is Larsson's fine-grained take on hacking - Lisbeth's hidden talent.  The Trilogy's appeal lies to a great extent in Larsson's pitch-perfect take on the hacker life, both in his capturing of the details of the work as well as his ear for the culture and his depiction of its denizens.<br /><br />Part 3 of the Trilogy - Hornets' Nest - distinguishes itself from the other two volumes by its strong indictment of the Swedish Secret Service, aka the S&auml;po.  Yes, this is a work of fiction, but I imagine that the tale Larsson spins here would make a small number of people uncomfortable.<br /><br />In the US, we now have to wait for subtitled versions of the movies to make it here to these shores.  The filmmakers made the excellent decision to go full-out Lord of the Rings-style and produce film adaptations of all the volumes in one go.  Thumbs up for the selection of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth.  From the trailers, she seems an inspired choice.
B001C08RHA|4.0|This product was received within the time I figured I would get it. Overall, my son was satisified with the movie.
B002TIWQNK|5.0|A great EP, but almost worth it just for Viva La Vida/Domino Dancing.  If you saw their last tour, it brought everybody screaming to their feet.  Just excellent.  It Doesn't Often Snow at Christmas is also lots of fun.  Another fine PSB release.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|This is NOT a review of the film. This is NOT a review of the film. This is NOT a review of the film. This is NOT a review of the film. This is NOT a review of the film. Good. We got that out of the way. This is a review of the \\"Blu-ray 4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD\\" of the film.    There are so many dealbreaker flaws in this release I cannot begin to list them, nor can I begin to list how livid I am.    As we know, times are tough. For Christmas we saved and scraped to get a Blu-Ray player SPECIFICALLY to watch this film at home. So, imagine the letdown when we can't hear anything because the English audio on the Blu-Ray disc is only in DTS. (DTS? What is this a laserdisc from 1995????) So, if I want to hear this, I now have to pop $$ we can ill-afford on a DTS decoder. Those of you who raved about the DTS sound quality....I don't doubt it, but I can't verify that either, because Disney hasn't allowed me that option for reasons I can't imagine.    If DTS really is \\"all that\\" then why aren't the Spanish & French tracks also in DTS?    Instead, we can hear it in French or Spanish because that's on Dolby Digital.     Never mind the fact we had to buy a DVD disc and a \\"digital copy\\" disc we didn't want in order for us to GET the Blu-Ray disc.    Did I mention there are no subtitles? No 3D version in any of the 4 discs?    Is it ANY wonder Amazon has it at $18, down from a list price of $46? I'm returning this useless copy tomorrow, and getting Harry Potter 6 instead. It may not be quite as wonderful a film as UP, but at least the home release was put together by people who have a rough idea of what their customers want and need.
1594488878|4.0|Nick Hornby can write about two topics, regret and music, like few of his contemporaries.  He returns to those two topics, which he last brought together in \\"[[ASIN:1594481784 High Fidelity]]\\", in this novel about three middle-aged people who all have their regrets.    Duncan is a Fan (not just a fan, he definitely deserves a capital letter) of the rather obscure musician Tucker Crowe.  Everyone knows one of those Fans, the ones who know everything the artist has ever done, read every article out there about them, and can talk ad nauseam about them.  Uncomfortably, some of us can recognise a bit of ourselves in Duncan, and hope that we're not quite that dreary when on the topic of our musician of choice.      Tucker has gone underground since the release of his seminal album \\"Juliet\\".  Without the internet, he would have faded into obscurity.  With the internet, his remaining fans can get together and discuss him to death.  He avoids this at all costs, and is aware that he's a washed-up musician with no music left in him and a string of failed relationships (not to mention a string of children from these failed relationships).      Annie is Duncan's girlfriend, a relationship of convenience for both of them.  She likes Tucker well enough, although not with the unending devotion that Duncan has.  And this is really her novel.  The main regret is hers, in staying in a relationship that's okay but isn't really satisfying, a relationship that will never go anywhere.  Biology has started to remind her that she's middle-aged and her biological clock is ticking, but Duncan is singularly uninterested.      What finally drives them apart is Tucker.  Tucker releases his demos of his seminal album.  Duncan loves it, Annie doesn't; Duncan is appalled at her unimaginable lack of taste.  Tucker, reading Annie's review online, writes to her to say that he appreciated her review.  They strike up a correspondence as her relationship with Duncan continues to fall apart.      The ending is ambiguous, there's no obvious happily-ever-after (nor an unhappily-ever-after).  Annie has grown through the course of the novel, although I wouldn't say that the men in her life have.  I appreciate that Hornby didn't try to wrap everything up into a neat package and put a bow on top.      All in all, it was a great book that I completely devoured in a couple of days.

B002P5XXR0|4.0|I love James Horner's [[ASIN:B00005BJJX Aliens: The Deluxe Edition]] and [[ASIN:B002IAPHK8 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]. [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] ranks up there as a great soundtrack. It has some haunting themes that really evoke an alien world. However, it isn't particularly memorable. After listening to it all day, I can't recall any of the main [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] themes. By contrast, when I first heard [[ASIN:B00005BJJX Aliens]], I couldn't get the battle song out of my head for days. Even more annoying, some of the later songs on [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] feature alien voices, so it's certainly not something you can listen to with company around (I had [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] on in my room while doing work, and my wife asked me what those odd voices were). Still, if you like movie soundtracks, I can definitely recommend Horner's [[ASIN:B002P5XXR0 Avatar]] for your soundtrack collection.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|For months this album kept coming up under my recommendations.  The first time I watched one of Florence's videos, I wasn't impressed.  The second time, I closed it after about 30 seconds and chocked her up to internet indie hype.  The third time, I decided to just minimize the window and listen.  I have never fallen in love with an artist's work so quickly.  I went back and listened to all of her other songs and couldn't believe I'd almost passed them up.  Her lyrics are unique and evocative and her voice is passionate without being overwhelming.  I've tried many times to classify this music and I can only ever think of one word: cathartic.  You will almost definitely feel some sort of emotional release while listening to her.<br /><br />If you've never heard Florence before, I would recommend listening to the music before watching the videos.  You'll appreciate the visuals more if you're already familiar with her sound.  I will say that I'm still not a huge fan of the first song I heard, \\"Kiss with a Fist,\\" but \\"Rabbit Heart,\\" \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" \\"I'm Not Calling You a Liar,\\" and \\"Blinding\\" more than make up for it.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about her music, then the whole album might not be for you, but you should definitely purchase the songs you do like, because otherwise you'll find yourself singing pieces of them weeks later with no idea where they came from.
B001PO53IO|2.0|Been an avid Star Wars fan since I saw A New Hope as a seven year old in 1977.  Was very enthused to check this out based on all the positive reviews.  Don't believe the hype.  This is a mixed bag at best.  There are a handful of episodes that I would watch again -- the first one featuring Yoda dispensing classic Jedi wisdom; one with clones working well as a team; and one of the series in the middle.  Several feature Jar-Jar Binks as the \\"hero\\" and are complete garbage.  One implausible series puts Obi-Wan and Anakin face-to-face with Count Dooku.  This at least presents intriguing dialogue opportunities, but they are totally wasted.  The worst of all comes near the end, where the biotoxin-manufacturing villain is a poor caricature of Joseph Goebbels, complete with German accent and jack boots.  Not only was this boring and trite, it scared my kids out of their wits.<br /><br />Probably the best overall feature of this series is the music:  there are some really nice, novel instrumentational flourishes interspersed among the episodes.  Too bad the plot/dialogue isn't comparably compelling.<br /><br />They really need to recruit someone with a better appreciation of the Star Wars ethos for the next seasons.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|This is a showcase for Legend Films colorization process. So many companies have gotten colorization wrong, but here Legend Films gets it right.<br /><br />Backed by extensive research, and drawing on one of Edith Head's sketch artists, this is a frame-by-frame restoration and colorization. Example: having originally chosen sparkling red for an evening gown, they subsequently discovered a notation that \\"every gold bead in Hollywood was used for that gown,\\" they corrected the choice to a glittering gold.<br /><br />This film is now truly beautiful. It should have been in color the first time. Valentine's Day Hearts just don't look right in gray! If Legend Films erred at all, it was on the side of somewhat subdued color, which is a lot better than something that appears to have been garishly painted.<br /><br />The three disc set includes the colorized version, the original restored B&W, several documentaries and comments by Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. There is also a CD of all the songs from the movie also carefully restored; the sound is amazingly good, considering the recording process in 1942. This is the edition to buy! A Classic Movie Beautifully Restored.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This CD set is outstanding. Paul McCartney brings back the old Beatle tunes and Wings songs as well. I love it so much. Many wonderful memories came rolling back to my mind as I listened.   I would highly recommend it to any fan of The Beatles of just Paul himself.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|I liked the movie, from beginning to the end I loved the dialogues.  Acting is top notch. It's as if you can feel how tense people are when they are talking to the SS.  Everything was so good untill I saw the comic relief Hitler and Goebbels.  I mean, they are depicted, on purpose I presume, too light for a movie of this gravity. A more sinister characterization could have been more suitable. Then again, what sets this movie apart from any other is, it's a Tarantino flick.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Excellent CD. recieved my product in a couple of days, exactly what I expected. Great service, great CD.

B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Alicia's new ablum \\" Element of  Freedom \\" is very diffrent from her pervious ablum. It dosen't have the typical AK style that we are so use to hearing.  I 1st heard \\" dosen't mean anything \\" and I have to say  I was bored. I didn't like anything about this song.  All and all I still decided to buy her new cd.  Alicia shows more of her poetic side on this ablum and also goes back to an 1980's sound.  It's a good cd . I reccomend it to any AK fan.  It's not  best work but is a good cd overall. I am in love with \\"  This bed \\"  and   \\"  That's how strong my love is\\".   Other stand out songs to me were \\" Put it in a love song \\"  and also \\" Empire state of mind ,PART II. \\"
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I made the mistake of watching Star Trek as the first Blu Ray movie ever on my new LG BD390.  That set the bar pretty high for all proceeding movies, because Star Trek looks incredible in Blu Ray.  It's a visually stunning film filled with action, comedy and some of the greatest characters ever created.  If you're not sure whether to buy this Blu Ray, don't think about it, just do it.
B000001FS6|5.0|I first purchased a copy of this album at a \\"hole-in-the-wall\\" type bookstore on a cold, late fall evening back in October of 2003. Accompanied by the purchase of a warming mug of mulled, spiced cider (which was drank at the store before I left and took my cassette home), I had no regrets about purchasing it. To this date, my favorite song of all on this album is \\"Angel of Harlem.\\" Regrettably, I had since misplaced the cassette that I bought back in 2003 - which is why I purchased this album on CD recently. And I'm still TOTALLY ROCKING OUT to \\"Angel of Harlem\\" - and the other tunes aren't bad, either!

B002VPE1AM|2.0|OK, fine, the demographic Cameron was ordered to shoot for was 12 - 18 year olds and, geez, for the mutton heads who bury their minds in digital toys this kind of fare surely has its appeal.<br /><br />Any ADULT raving about this film needs to get out a little more often, though.<br /><br />For Gawd's sake, couldn't Cameron have hired a decent writer to blather about the pretty pictures on his tiresome slide show?  How about some nuance, character development (other than pubescence to early adolescence), or even a little plot twist (to reduce squirming)?  Naw - can't take ANY chances on a $300 million budget.  Nope - here we get the standard Hollywood line, from stem to stern.<br /><br />Is there anyone, anyone, who gave a tiny rat's rear end about any of the neato cartoon action figures or, for that matter, any aspect of the inane plot?  Wow, what a stunner, the mercenary (former, of course, so as not to offend) marines are the bad guys who are out to exploit the goony aliens (ten feet tall, COOOOOLLLL!!!) who are as morally pure as the driven snow (YAWN) and as innocent as Forrest, uh, Forrest Gump.<br /><br />Imagine Hollywood depicting white male military types as bad guys.  Haven't seen that in a while (well, since the last time I turned on my TV).<br /><br />What really galls is all that utterly wasted technology.  It's outrageous, really, that one of the most visually arresting films of the past decade is so utterly devoid of meaning.  I've had epiphanies in the toilet more enduring than anything I learned from this shiny, noisome trip to the land of the purple ferret people.  And, just imagine, that some nincompoop actually got paid to \\"invent\\" the language of the Nervies.  Boy, that effort sure helped suspend disbelief, in between efforts to look at my watch.<br /><br />It must be nice to wallow in one's adolescent wet dreams and get paid boatloads for your trouble.  It's just too bad, though, that Cameron's legacy here won't have anything to do with worthwhile cinema.  Maybe, just maybe, next time he'll try creating something for the 20-somethings that's a tad more worthwhile.'ll try creating something for the 20-somethings that's a tad more worthwhile.

B001OQCV60|4.0|Holmes a martial artist?  That is one of the new directions the director took in the updated version that has Robert Downey Jr. as our favorite detective and Jude Law as a very tough Dr. Watson.  Sprinkle in a little Rachel McAdams as Irene, the one woman who intrigues Holmes.  Throw in CG graphics that bring 1890's London to life and we have a whole new Holmes.    A dark religious cult headed by Lord Blackstone is afoot that uses female sacrifice as one of their rituals.  Holmes bursts in on one of these attempted sacrifices and thwart Blackstone and LeStrad takes him into custody.  Three months later Blackstone is executed through hanging.  Just before he is hanged, he is visited by Holmes in prison and he tells Holmes that this is not over and three murders that Holmes will be powerless to stop will occur.    After Blackstone is pronounced dead he appears to have risen from the grave.  It is now up to Holmes and Watson to stop the three murders.  The first involves Blackstone's own father.    I generally liked this movie as I usually any adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.  The director shows Holmes at times using deduction to decide what he will do in a fight and how his opponent will react and then Holmes follows through on his deductions.  I really liked these parts of the film.  Downy is ok in the role though at times I had difficulty understanding things he said.  It is sometimes the bad thing about having a non-British person doing a British accent.    Jude Law does an excellent job in his role and he easily makes one not miss Nigel Bruce's bumbling interpretation.  If the viewer liked Johnny Depp's Sweeny Todd, you would definately like this film.
B0027REDN4|5.0|Thrash is my favorite sub-genre of metal. I own several Artillery cds, but they never reached the standards of this new cd. I don't know if it is just the production like another reviewer suggested, but this sounds awesome. VERY high quality thrash with a singer that can sing (not just yell), killer riffs, and songs that get stuck in your head. FYI -- this is a new singer not heard on their other releases.
1594488843|5.0|Full disclosure upfront. Dan Pink is a Never Stop Marketing (my company) client.<br /><br />Ok, now that that is out of the way, I can tell you that I LOVED Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us<br /><br />What Dan did in A Whole New Mind (a previous book) was explain the skills that would be needed to thrive and prosper in a post-industrial age.<br /><br />He builds on that in Drive by taking the science of motivation (you know the ol' `Carrot and Stick') and totally flipping it on its head given the fact that the nature of work is changing so dramatically.<br /><br />The FACT is (and his narrative ties together a ton of substantive research to back this up) that when we are faced with a task that requires creative and the proverbial \\"out of the box\\" thinking, we are going perform less remarkably and inefficiently when there is a specific reward laid out in front of us.<br /><br />Instead, he introduces us to the underlying principles of Motivation 3.0, as he calls it (1.0 is the basic survival motivation, 2.0 is the carrot and stick that is the hallmark of most of management science and was appropriate for an era that is leaving us.)<br /><br />Motivation 3.0 assumes that our base level of needs are addressed (i.e. you need a fair wage), but that once you get to that point, what brings out breakthrough performance and results are three key components that emanate from a person's Intrinsic Motivation.<br /><br />  1. Autonomy-do we have the control to make our own decisions?<br />  2. Mastery-do we possess the desire to continually improve in our chosen area?<br />  3. Purpose-does it all make sense to us a in cosmic sense? Do we believe that what we are doing makes sense and has meaning?<br /><br />If you are asking yourself how you motivate your employees, your students, your community or your partners, you need to take Dan's work into account.<br /><br />There's a huge disconnect between how we think we should motivate others and how we all area actually motivated.<br /><br />Drive helps you understand what that is and, equally importantly, tells you what you can do about it.ortantly, tells you what you can do about it.
1416562605|4.0|I like this book more the farther I get away from it. Anyhow, there seems to be more I like about it as I look back. I was less enchanted as I read. Some of that may have been the weight of the Man Booker. Some of it is that the book may not be exactly what it seems. I don't know.<br /><br />One of the nice things about The White Tiger is its simplicity. Given the story, it is kind of refreshing not to see Adiga working in bejeweled sentences full of intricate and exotic description. Sometimes it feels *too* simple-- as though he lets caricature stand in for characters. Perhaps as though he's made too simple of a parable out of something more complex?<br /><br />But then again, I'm not sure that characters would be doing his story much of a service.<br /><br />I can't decide. Too simple? Just right? Heck, I'll even own to the possibility that 90% of the thing is going over my head and the real answer is actually \\"too complex.\\" Adiga may well be one of those writers where I need to read his second novel before I decide how to read this one. Is that awful of me?<br /><br />The story of a man who escapes the Darkness, or is become Darkness, or serves the Darkness. Written as a letter to the Chinese Premier. (Many people seem to have problems with this choice of addressee, but I liked it. It is another sign of a changing world; the face of the poor turning away from the West when it comes to imagining future prosperity.)<br /><br />I'd recommend it, even though I'm not sure about it. I *do* find it an odd choice for the Man Booker Prize. But maybe I'll feel differently later.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater with Imax visual. This movie is a movie that everyone should see like the \\"Wizard of OZ\\". This movie made me laugh and cry. This movie is a classic and anyone who sees it will fall in love with it.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|I guess I am biased since I'm old enough to know the actors from the original as well as all the spin offs, but it was hard for me to like the characters because I'm comparing them to the originals. I felt the same about TNG when it was first on TV but they grew on me after the first 2 seasons. I'm not sure if that can happen here since they are not likely to do more then 2 more movies. Other than that the plot, acting and special effects (especially in stunning blu-ray format) are all good. So if you're new to Star Trek you'll enjoy it more then if you are a long time fan.
B000EHRA48|2.0|It'd be churlish to blame this adapter itself, but there is one niggling issue which I wish to comment upon:    Whomever decided to create such a \\"swappable\\" design for the MiniDisplay Port itself should be shot.    If this thing is used to attach a cord of any decent length, which may or may not be subject to gravitational forces; or, the computer itself gets moved; then you will have to constantly check to ensure it is still attached.    Apple, get your head out your butt and just start using HDMI.  Why do you have to create another ADC-type port to divide the marketplace?
1878424319|1.0|This is a very simplistic and disjointed philosophy.  It just doesn't make the leap to the normal person.  It might be helpful for someone with very low self esteem, but most individuals today have way more education and life experiences then this book addresses.  I found it boring and pales in comparison to something like Eckart Tollie's New Earth.  I don't know how faithful it is to true Toltec wisdom, but it just isn't applicable to the halfway educated individual of today.

0312330537|4.0|Shantaram is a roller coaster ride. There are parts of the book that are so well written and interesting that it made me slow down to relish the writing and admire the author's eye for details and his ability for artistic expression; and there are parts of the book that are so boring that I was tempted to skip a few pages and even stop reading the book altogather. I am glad I ploughed through the boring parts of the book, because there are enough diamonds in the book, which make this book a must read.    The most interesting parts of the book are the description of the slum and slum life, the workings of the Bombay underworld and crime, the culture of Bombay and its people, the culture of the village people in west India, Prison and prison life in Bombay and Australia, drug use and recovery from addiction, Description of the horrors of war etc. The author has an amazing eye for details and ability to describe situations and people very well. The attitude of people who are poor and are involved in crime and war were also quite enlightening. People who visit India for a short duration are often shocked by the Indian culture, people and ambiance; and the initial impressions are usually quite bad; but the author having spent a long time in India manages to get to the heart of Indian culture and writes about India and its people with a very equivocal, even loving tone.     The boring parts of the book are the plot of the story itself, over-description of some events, inclusion of some really annoying characters etc. The story got so slow at times that I was tempted to stop reading the book, but the memory of some great chapters in the book told me that I need to be patient and keep reading, In the end I was not disappointed.     With good editing the book could have been a little over 650 pages instead of the 950 pages it currently is. I think one could overlook this considering that the author had to re-write the book thrice as the he lost the original drafts for the book in Australian prison.    Overall I would give this book 4 stars, although some parts of it deserve more than 5 stars and some parts of it deserve just 3 stars. Highly recommended!
B00003CXCD|3.0|`Roman Holiday' is certainly entertaining and enjoyable and, thanks to Audrey Hepburn, very charming, but to say that it is a good film is not something I would be quick to do.  The fact remains that, while it is a likable film, `Roman Holiday' is a rather vacant effort.  Sure, the backdrop is pretty, and Audrey is pretty, and the whole premise has that familiar tinge of delightfulness (I mean, who doesn't get wrapped up in this kind of a fairytale), but in the end `Roman Holiday' lacks any real meat to satisfy this film fanatic.<br /><br />The story is simple and familiar.  A young princess, tired of her boring and detached existence, runs away from her duty's to embark on a day of unrestrained frolicking.  She meets a reporter named Joe who sees the princess as his big ticket and so he accompanies her in order to write the ultimate insider story.<br /><br />Yes, they fall in love.<br /><br />I told my father shortly after seeing this movie that, had I seen it in 1953, I probably would have a different opinion of it now.  I'm sure that at the time this type of story was fresh and exciting (thus all the baffling Oscar nominations, and wins), but this story has been so overdone today that watching this movie felt rather boring to me.  Add to that the fact that there is nothing really profound here and you have a seemingly halfhearted attempt at cinema.  A big issue I have with this movie is that we never really get to know Princess Ann.  She remains an enigma to us, even though the whole purpose of Joe's following her around is supposedly to write this detailed piece on the `real Ann'.  She never lets us (or Joe for that matter) in enough to give us any idea of who she is as a person.<br /><br />This film is not concerned with giving us a deeply moving character portrait.  It is more concerned with becoming another empty romantic comedy.<br /><br />That is another issue I have.  The film is not really that romantic.  Because we never get to know her, we never really understand why these two fall in love so quickly.  Yes, I know that there are far too many films where `boy meets girl and loves her instantly', but most of them (at least the good ones) give us some sort of common ground between the characters to justify the mutual attraction (even if it is just a shared respect for an obscure band).  Here, there are no meaningful conversations or shared interests to back up the spontaneous attraction.  And Gregory Peck is sorely miscast here, even if it is his performance that carries the second half (the most important half) of the film.  His final scene (walking away from the press interview) is the most powerful scene, and he sells it gloriously, but he is far too serious and brooding for a film this light and jovial.  If this film had taken a deeper tone then his performance would have been just right.<br /><br />Truth be told, he is the best part of the film, but sadly the film makes him appear almost awkward and out of place.<br /><br />I'll never understand Hepburn's Oscar win.  The performance is hollow.  Sure, she is her usual charming self (I love her in everything), but there is no meat to this performance, at all.  I blame the script, because Hepburn certainly had the demeanor and presence to sell this part, but the part was just so amateur.<br /><br />Alas, this is a beloved film and I'm sure many will hate me to discrediting it like I have, but I must speak my truth.  I liked it, and I'd probably watch it again, but I cannot praise this film, for it is far from praiseworthy.so quickly.  Yes, I know that there are far too many films where `boy meets girl and loves her instantly', but most of them (at least the good ones) give us some sort of common ground between the characters to justify the mutual attraction (even if it is just a shared respect for an obscure band).  Here, there are no meaningful conversations or shared interests to back up the spontaneous attraction.  And Gregory Peck is sorely miscast here, even if it is his performance that carries the second half (the most important half) of the film.  His final scene (walking away from the press interview) is the most powerful scene, and he sells it gloriously, but he is far too serious and brooding for a film this light and jovial.  If this film had taken a deeper tone then his performance would have been just right.    Truth be told, he is the best part of the film, but sadly the film makes him appear almost awkward and out of place.    I'll never understand Hepburn's Oscar win.  The performance is hollow.  Sure, she is her usual charming self (I love her in everything), but there is no meat to this performance, at all.  I blame the script, because Hepburn certainly had the demeanor and presence to sell this part, but the part was just so amateur.    Alas, this is a beloved film and I'm sure many will hate me to discrediting it like I have, but I must speak my truth.  I liked it, and I'd probably watch it again, but I cannot praise this film, for it is far from praiseworthy.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|There is nothing you CAN say about his Dudeness! Just shut the %$#@ up and watch the movie.
B0001NBMEE|3.0|I have not seen this flick in over forty years, it was a buzz to watch and see the progress movies have made and casting of stars has taken. Certaily all the male leads in this movie were not the barbarian or hero stachure we have come to know today. the sets were quite good for its day . All in all a fun viewing and fun to talk about.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I love this CD and DVD combination.  My favorite songs from Taylor Swift are the selections chosen for the DVD  and the behind the scene comments made it perfect.  Would greatly recommend this to everyone.
031606792X|4.0|I have read all 4 of the Twilight Books and I loved them all.  This book starts out a little slow but wow it makes up for it.  I think these are great book for ages 13 and up.  Trust me I am a long ways from being 13 but I like the moral values the author incorporated in all the books.  I would let my Granddaughters read them.
159562015X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it was extremely accurate. Some of my strengths were ones I knew all along but never really tapped into. But what really impressed me about the book was that it not only told you your strengths but various ways to maximize them. It gave you an indepth analysis of your strength, ways you can maximize it, how your strength relates to people, real-life examples, and other great benefits. If you need guidance in discovering the natural you, READ THIS BOOK!     By sharing your natural born talents with you, this book only empowers and propells you to another level.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|If there ever was a director that had impact with me it's James Cameron he's 1 of my favorite directors. Now with Avatar Sam Worthington as Jake Sully it also stars Michell Rodriguz Sigourney Weaver & Wes Studi. The casting was great that's what I've been saying a good cast & characters you care about has been a problem with a lot of movies in the decade 99% of the remakes lacked the charm of the original. AVP & AVPR were awful but the main problem   was it had s****y characters Street Fighter TLC had the same problem too you didn't give a s**t if they lived or died. Anyway Avatar had a good plot for what it was the action was great this planet has a dream like atmosphere I'm not spoiling anything I'll just say it's Cameron's best film since T2.
B002LMV7TS|1.0|Regardless of how you feel about this movie (yes, I like it a lot), the upconverting of the standard DVD is not sufficient for me.  In my search for information regarding the blu-ray release, I've found that the blu-ray is does the picture quality no justice.  I use Blu-ray.com as a source of information and based on their review, I won't be buying the BD until someone improves it.  [...].
B002SQ3664|4.0|I saw this in the theater and thought it was quite enjoyable and fun.  It was well made, directed, and acted, with many funny moments.  It was also endearing as the Elliot character really learns who he is.  The best thing about this movie...they stuck to the story of how Woodstock ended up in this town.  No actors dressed up to look like the musicians who played Woodstock.  I was concerned it would turn into a what musician can we throw in and such, but it wasn't thankfully.    Definitely worth watching.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|My husband and I could not wait to see this movie.  Too bad it was terrible.  We had high hopes, someone was a genius with the advertising.  Not so much with the film itself.  What a waste!  The only excitement was the anticipation and thinking \\"somethings going to happen....\\"  but nothing ever did.  What a let down.  The worst part was the ending.  LAME!   Bottom line, if your an adult with good taste for classic horror flicks that scare the total crap out of you, dont waste your time.  If you're a teenage girl having a sleep over, this might be fun.  The only reason it's rated R is because the F-bomb is dropped a bunch of times.  So other than a 4 letter word every teenager has heard, there is no reason to not let them watch based on the rating.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I was extremely excited to be able to buy this complete series in one box.  It was for a gift and it turned out to be perfect.  The service was very fast, and the product was in excellent condition.  It was perfect!!!!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This is the first book that I have felt compelled to review on Amazon. I hope that other people find this review helpful and pick up the book.<br /><br />At first I was skeptical of the 5 out of 5 star rating on Amazon. After reading the book, I understand. I also joined the ranks and gave a five star review.<br /><br />This book grabbed me right away. Every second I could spare, I spent reading. I could not wait to find out what William was up to. More than a good story, I learned a lot about Malawi culture and the politics. I studied African History in college, so I cannot say that I was very surprised by the actions of the government. However, the vampires threw me threw a loop. For a few days, I felt a part of the village. I could sense the frustration in the building process. I rooted for William's success as if it were my own.<br /><br />As a teacher, I will certainly share this heartwarming story with my students.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Loreena McKinnett has done it again, what a wonderful voice. I loved this CD and will continie to listen to it well after the holidays are over. I have shared this with many of my friends and we all agree shw is a very gifted artist.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I saw this film in the theaters and loved it then, so purchased once released on DVD.  This is a romatic comedy, but unique.  Like it says in the beginning it is not a love story, but a story about love.  It has a role reversal where the male character is the romantic and the female stays emotinally distant.  I feel these days that romantic comedies for the most part stick to a certain formaula and this one doesn't which is quite refreshing.
B001KVZ6F2|2.0|Seriously, can you believe this insipid film?  At best, it's a good episode of \\"CHiPS\\" -- at worst, a bad episode of \\"CHiPS\\".  And what horrid acting, all around!  Hard to actually see Clint's heart growing bigger, but you know it did. Well, you assume as much.  Don't you?
0953104907|3.0|This book was decent, but I thought that \\"Build Your Own Electric Guitar\\"  by Martin Oakham was a little better.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this CD mainly to support Susan. I fell under her charming spell from day one.  Just can't help routing for the underdogs.    All the songs on the CD are beautifully done. Her voice is clear and lovely. She handles the rather eclectic selections wonderfully. I thought I would listen once, put it away and feel smug in my support...but I have played it many times since.    I wish her all the best and hope she makes enough income to live well, safe and happy.
B002MW50KY|1.0|I think Dylan is a great musical and poetic genius. I have an extensive collection of his work. My first, and continuing impression of this Christmas CD is that it's awful. It truly sucks! However, after watching one video (where Bob puts on different hats/wigs and a fight breaks out), I'm convinced this is a grand put-on. Just listening curdles my innards. I hope he comes out with a complete video. That I'll buy.
1400034779|5.0|This is the first book in a series. They are mysteries, but very \\"soft\\". Love the characters and interaction between them. Some say that the style is alittle \\"preachy\\" but it was refreshing to have a story with morals.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid when it was shown on TV. But is there really a credible ending? Or is the ending just a farce? I never could decide if there was someone behind the murder(s).....We see Nancy Walker's character pull off the fake pinkies which we learned were one of Lionel Twain's physical traits. (he had no pinkies) So is she really Lionel Twain??? HELP!!!!!
1433502410|5.0|This Bible is awesome! In terms of a good study bible, this is one of the best I've owned! I like the English Standard Version translation as well, it has a few subtle word changes over the NIV that I feel like adds a lot more meaning to a particular passage. From a study perspective, there's just a ton of really good commentary. Each page is pretty much half commentary and half Bible passage. I've definitely learned a lot through the commentaries in my Bible studies and highly recommend everyone to own this study Bible! You will get blessed!
0307454541|1.0|The only reason I finished this book is because it was a book club selection.  After a couple hundred pages, I started to just skim it to extract the story and skip over all the bad writing and stupid details like how he went into a store to buy contact lens solution, hung his clothes in the closet and put his toiletries in the bathroom (duh!).  The story wasn't even that original or worth the digging.<br /><br />I'd like to think my one star could bring the rating down enough to save even one person from wasting their time on this book - but mysteriously the majority of reviewers have given 4-5 stars.  I'm with the other reviewers who just can't fathom how anyone can say this is great writing.  I won't be reading any of the sequels.
B001EUK35C|5.0|This is not a review. The previous reviews have already told you how stunning and powerful some of the music is on this album. I wanted to share an experience with this music, which I hope those of you already familiar with it will appreciate. I first heard selections from this album as part of the in-flight music programming on a flight from London to Charlotte in 1988. (I had never heard of Philip Glass before, nor minimalist music, nor the movie)  Business class. Over Scotland on a sunny day passing though some puffy clouds. Anthem 3 is playing. The pilot has probably just been given permission to climb to a higher altitude and turn towards the Atlantic. Imagine now, just as one of those crescendos is building, the engines rev up, the nose rises, and you feel some extra Gs in your back. You feel the power of the plane and the power of the musical/choral crescendo at the exact same time. The timing couldn't have been better. An experience I have never forgotten.  I bought the album as soon as I got home and this music has been dear to me for over 20 years. My review? Two words: BUY IT.
B001UV4XUQ|4.0|Love stories have been a staple of film since their beginning. Some are good, some bad and some memorable. But few take an objective look at love seeing both the positive and negative, the fun and the sad. That changes with 500 DAYS OF SUMMER.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen, a wanna be architect now working as a greeting card writer for a small company who finds life for the most part unfulfilling. Early in life, he dreamed of meeting the perfect girl, the right one and discovering true love that would last forever.<br /><br />Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) is a free spirited young woman who's just begun working at the same company Tom works at. Summer is the sort who doesn't believe in true love but in living for the moment.<br /><br />During a meeting at work, Tom sees Summer for the first time. For Tom, its love at first sight. For Summer, it's just another day.<br /><br />The film doesn't follow a linear path, instead jumping from one day to another, for instance day 3 and then to day 344. What we see is the ups and downs of a romance between two young people. But what we get is a look at love, romance and the search for the perfect match.<br /><br />In the early days we are privy to the courtship of Summer by Tom, how he finally gets the nerve to ask her out, how he gets to know her and her getting to know him as well. And as with most romances, the two enjoy each other's company and all of the details that become second nature to them both.<br /><br />But as time progresses, or in this case moves back and forth, we see the change in their relationship. Gone are the small enjoyments in a look, a laugh, a whisper, replaced with finding these same things that were once treasures now annoyances. And yet, they remain together. Until the fateful day when Summer announces she wants to be friends, those killing words to any hope of being a couple.<br /><br />Knowing full well what the result of this relationship will be fairly early on in the film (thus knowing now is not actually a spoiler), what you get rather than the usual beginning to end romance is an offbeat style of film that entertains from start to finish. The movie covers all bases that revolve around being in love and losing love. It's filled with humor and sadness, just like real life.<br /><br />This movie is about dreams of romance. Not just those of the couple we witness on screen but in the dream of romance that everyone searches for in their lifetime. And while some never find it, others do. While some hope for the one to walk into their lives, others find that special someone over time. And this film captures that in its combination of vignettes that come together to form one thoroughly enjoyable movie.<br />What is also a joy is watching the actors in this film. Gordon-Levitt gives a remarkable performance showing a depth he's not had the chance to since he starred in BRICK. Last seen in G.I.JOE as Cobra Commander, he offers a completely different performance here that show his versatility. So much so that after watching I wondered what he would choose to do next?<br /><br />Deschanel has always stood out as an attractive young woman who opts for characters that are a bit out of the norm. She does so once again in this film, offering a free spirit who isn't quite as free as she might think. She conveys the charm of a young woman in love who eventually finds herself in a position of hurting someone she cares for.<br /><br />500 DAYS OF SUMMER was a film that took me by surprise. There were so many different directions it could have gone. Surprisingly enough, it takes them all but not in direct order. And while that might discombobulate some viewers, for those willing to take a chance you will find a movie that entertains and touches your heart.u get rather than the usual beginning to end romance is an offbeat style of film that entertains from start to finish.

B000YABYLA|3.0|Juno is a cute movie, with some offbeat comedic hooks, maybe that's what drew the Academy and critics alike to it. But for all its' uniqueness and for the hour and a half of harmless entertainment that it provided, I didn't really see anything that was worthy of a nomination. Was it an off year for movies in 2007 or what ? Juno is an interesting look at teenage pregnancy through the lens of Juno Mcguff (Ellen Page) who has just been impregnated by her friend Pauley Bleaker (Michael Cera) and now has to figure out what to do with the baby. This movie doesn't appear to take a stand on abortion even though Juno's character makes certain statements at an abortion clinic.     The story turns when Juno finds the perfect couple Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.) only to discover that their no more perfect than anyone else on the planet as Mark confesses the impending divorce to Juno before talking to Vanessa. My feeling is that Mark's relationship with Juno is an underplayed phenomenon. As Juno navigates the turbulent waters of pregnancy, she also confronts the permanently altered though not destroyed relationship with Pauley and being hated by Pauley's family. I felt disconnected to the movie because I was never allowed to get invested in any one of the characters. It was just kind of a story that moved from a to b with any real emotion or feeling.     The bottom line is that Juno is high on story, but low on characterization because other than Vanessa, the characters don't really lose anything. At end of the movie, Juno and Pauley ride off past the track team as though nothing has changed, even though Juno had his baby and made the difficult decision to give the baby up for adoption. These rather wooden characters and a lack of basic human emotion detract from what could've been an otherwise engaging premise.
0684857219|5.0|I wish I could provide a video review of this volume, but putting Schwarzenegger's advice into practice takes time. I consider this a prime candidate for the \\"definitive\\" work on modern bodybuilding, with advice on exercises, equipment, nutrition, and competition that show both depth and perspective. No matter where I land when I open this book, my fitness plan changes and improves. It's no substitute for a personal trainer, of course, but almost.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I knew this movie would be a hit with my kids which is why I purchased it.  It was purchased \\"used\\" and had been a rental box item so I was hoping it was still in the promised condition, which it was!  I was pleased with that.  The movie itself is entertaining and a great choice for a family who enjoys Dr. Seuss. The voices of the characters are so much fun, even for adults!
B002XHN776|5.0|Alot like the first album. Many fans who became fans from a beautiful lie have strayed away from this album because they were expecting the same 'type' of music. It's softer in a sense but also more powerfull. Catchy but not annoying. All in all it was phenomenal. Everyone of their songs has its own voice in a way. The songs were put in wonderful order so that they all flowed nicley.   I dont have a favorite on this album though because they are all good. Some, yes, I like more than others. Not a favorite out of the bunch though.    ***Going into the song review portion now.    Escape- Amazing start to the album. Gives you a sense for what to expect. Very soft but very punctual. With the echelon in the background singing/yelling 'This is War' you can really start to get into the album.    Night of the Hunter- This is the song that really pulls you in. You get a powerful bonus if you actually listen to the lyrics too. 'Hung from a tree made of tongues of the weak. The branches; the bones of liars and thievs.' 'Honest to god I'll break your heart,  tear you to pieces and rip you apart.' This song is also based off of a french movie 'La Nuit du chasseur' (Night of the Hunter)    Kings and Queens- This has been on the air and on the charts and its just one of those songs you can listen to again and again without wanting to...ya'know... kill the radio dj. Or Van gogh your ears. Saying that, this song is undescribable.    ***Skipping to my personal likes while touching on all***    This is War-'Its the moment of truth and the moment to lie and the moment to live and the moment to die the moment to fight.' This a song where you REALLY need to listen to the lyrics. This song speaks volums and is just incredible. 'Its a brave new world.'    100 Suns- A song of contradictions but of complete truth for most. What do you believe in? ' I believe in nothing but the beating of our hearts.' With the soft chanting of the echelon in the background of 'Oh O Oh' 'I believe in nothing but the truth in who we are.'    Hurricane (ft. Kanye West)- Personally, Im not much a fan of the whole 'Hip-hop, Rap' Scene. So, yea, I really didnt think I would like this song being that it had Kanye in it. I was pleasently suprised though. He adds to the songs whole. There are two versions (To my knowledge) One with and one without Kanye. Its just not the same without him. The band defiinatley made a smart choice having him feature in the song.    Closer to the Edge- 'It was a thousand to one and a million to two.' Aren't all wars? This song along with the next (Vox Populi are together like a good punchline to a joke.) 'No no no! I will never forget. No no! I will never regret. No no! I will live my life.'  Clear message?     Vox Populi ( A call to arms)- A song for the people. This is our call. Our song. Everyones song. 'This a call to arms, gather soldiers, time to go to war. This is a battle song, brothers and sisters, time to go to war.'The song with the most prominant voice of the fans. Who says 30STM aren't team players?    Search and Destroy- The LONGEST song on the album. Not by much. It just barely beats out Hurricane. It seems like it drags on forever though. A good tune none-the-less. Just need alot of patiance for the song.     Alibi- This is my sleep song. When I listen to this album no matter what time of day if this song is playing and Im laying down I fall asleep. It is very soft and very slow. Its like Mr. Leto is singing you a lullaby of sorts.    Stranger In A Strange Land- This song is kinda of bipolar. Its soft and slow sometimes and then not so soft and fast. But wait, then it gets soft and fast. Hello Alice in wonderland acid trip. Especially with the 'technoish' backdrop. Overall, good song. I like the last couple of minutes of the song.    L490 (Equinox)- Uhm... No lyrics... tibetan monks chanting. Good listen still. It has some siginificant meaning.    Night of the Hunter (Flood remix)- REWIND! Didnt I just review this song? I think so.Though, I must say. If your a get up and dance person like me (Even if it means no one is looking) then this song is great. I just kinda frolic with my hairbrush though. Anywho, good song.(again)
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|I would first like to say that I love the Star Trek movies for some of their stories,as they did a remarkable job at returning most of the original crew back to the big screen. I would like to say to all you fellow trekies be prepared for a disappointment in this blu ray dvd box set release. The first two movies Star Trek The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan,are Theatrical versions and not the Directors versions. You won't be able to view the additional footage that was cut out, such as the view of Vejur from outer space as the cloud disappears over earth, or the additional footage of Scotty and his first mate as the ship is under attack. One movie which I totally was disappointed with was William Shatner's directorial debut of The Final Frontier movie. I found it had a weak story,lacked adventure,excitement,and could have had some more big stars and enemies from the original series to create a better story. I found the movie to be very cheesie.    As for the quality of the movie transfers there good as could be expected for the age of the material. I do feel that Paramount could have spent a little more time on improving the product before putting it out on shelves. Like any movie company they push the product out there, and next thing they put another box set out there in a year or too with an even better picture, sound quality and extras. Nothing like double dipping.    Paramount has a web site dedicated to Blu Rays. This is where you would register for BD LIVE in order to have access through your Blu Ray player for the added features. After doing some investigating into this site it states that Paramount BD LIVE is only available to US RESIDENTS. Needless to say I contacted my Blu Ray manufacturer they told me to insert an SD CARD into my player. After following my manufactures instructions BD LIVE is working now...!    So for those who have bought Paramount movies, and a warning comes up that you have no internet connection is it's because the SD card is required. BD LIVE will work only after you insert an SD CARD, and is available to us Canadians...!

B000002KBU|5.0|Been listening to this chestnut just now. From the last fifty years...there is only one artist that could really challenge the artistry of Bob Dylan. That is Joni Mitchell. This album plus the next four she recorded set a standard in the singer song writer genre that is only eclipsed by Dylan. The music here is so original and beautiful. When you see the best albums of the whatever period, they often leave  her off. But back in the sixties early seventies...she was up there with the best. When it comes to great Christmas songs....\\"Wish I had a river to fly away on.\\"...  is a modern classic. Take that and stuff it in yer fishnet stocking.....
1932100660|5.0|Oddly enough after reading this book, highly recommended by a few fellow office environmental engineers, who immediately changed their diets, fully towards vegan, I was given a copy of Methland.  Hey, connect the same dots !!  The wizard of Oz turns out to be a lobbyist for Big Food & Big Pharma. I realized that the ultimate subversive satisfaction occurs when we become vegans. My dear wife and I switched to a mostly vegan diet right after reading this book and we feel a lot better and cleaner already. Solid science here, influence peddling nimrods to the contrary. What can you say to a vegan who drop his blood pressure meds & gets lowered cholesterol (< 140 from 160 mg/l) within 45 days ? You can say zero, you practisers of the dark arts.  Money talks, and depth of conscience balks.  Tune out, turn off, and drop in to your own health management program !

B002VPE1AM|4.0|My g/f dragged me along to this, I had no intention to ever see it due to the trailer not taking my interest because to me it looked like to sort of movie that only die-hard animie fans could enjoy. However, my pre-thoughts where way off as we began watching this movie.     The film is set in the future where humans have apparently destroyed there own planet and are invading other planets now to mine for something or other. On this planet the tall blue people inhabit the land with the animals and a form of mother nature as there god. Along come the humans to invade and want to mine the planet and the blue guys home that is a gigantic tree is sitting on top of the biggest area of whatever metal it is they want to mine.     A marine is brought in under the guidance of a few scientists and they have the ability to transfer themselves from there own human body into a genetically engineered body of the tall blue guys so they can communicate. However negotiations haven't gone too good so the army invading just blow the crap out of everything while a small select group know the planet inhabitants are not hostile and should not be forcebly removed from there own homes just to please share holders.     A few reviewers raved on about it being a political plot of anti-Americanism from Hollyweed, but for god sakes guys, there is about 5 of you and 100's saying the movie is good, so stop over analising things and looking for deeper meanings and just sit back and enjoy a movie for once. You will be dead by the time you are middle aged and all alone if you wanna believe the world is just one big conspiracy theory after the next and we should all start wearing foil around our heads to stop the government controlling our thoughts.    The visual of this movie was awesome. It was like when Fantasia awed audiences back when it released by Disney, now this movie is showing what can be done with today's CGI and special effects, and I don't normally praise anything for visual effects, anddo agree that CGI is used way too much these days, but this movie's was pretty breathtaking.    This definitely has been the big surprise of 2009.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|I found this movie to have a solid storyline which keeps you guessing who's the guilty person turns out to be until the end.
0316017922|5.0|If you like other Gladwell's reads (Blink/ Tipping Point) you'll love this too. The style is very similar, present facts in a story like fashion to keep the reader captivated. (SPOILER ALERT!!) There is a part where he throws his own life story into the mix, which is  a bit of a surprises, but, blends right in!

B000002P5W|5.0|People always talk about the importance of Are You Experienced? and the masterful guitar work found on Electric Ladyland, but the sheer brilliance of Axis: Bold as Love is sadly overlooked. Noel Redding (the bass player) called this his favorite album the band ever made. What makes Axis: Bold as Love so special is the sheer perfection of the sequencing of the songs. From the silly sci-fi excursions of \\"EXP\\" to the tender, emotional \\"Bold as Love\\", there is not one song that is out of place. I have read reviews of people saying that Revolver or Abbey Road is perfect or Who's Next is perfect and, who knows(?), maybe they're right. I would put Axis: Bold as Love in this elite company with those classic albums and I think this was the best the band could do. It fully lived up to the band's potential. I mean seriously, there is not one note that I would take out of the album...even the feedback to finish off the album is masterfully done. With the exception of \\"If 6 Was 9\\", the band doesn't really go for epic songs and that is part of the charm. Hendrix went for the opposite effect on the band's following album Electric Ladyland, with almost all of the songs being long and Hendrix should indeed be applauded for experimenting with different song structures instead of trying to please the record company (or manager for that matter) at the time. Axis: Bold as Love pretty much showcases everything the band excelled at; whether it's ballads, psychedelia, or hard rock, the band mixes up styles and moods seamlessly. Say what you want about The Doors or Led Zeppelin but Jimi Hendrix and The Experience were the masters of the classic rock ballad and this album is probably Hendrix at his most emotional. The four ballads \\"Little Wing\\", \\"Castles Made of Sand\\", \\"One Rainy Wish\\", and \\"Bold as Love\\" rank with the best ballads classic rock has ever produced. \\"Little Wing\\" and \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" in particular contain some of Hendrix's most poignant vocals. What I love about Hendrix's ballads is that they're never boring and do a great job of captivating the listener. You can't help but admit that many bands suck at ballads, but this band had ballads down cold. Of course, the rockers on the album are just as good, if not better, than the ballads. \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" is Hendrix at his heaviest, \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" and \\"Ain't No Telling\\" are as catchy and musical as late-60's rock gets, \\"Little Miss Lover\\" is almost as funky as \\"Fire\\", and \\"She's So Fine\\" has some of classic rock's greatest drumming (in my top five drumming ever). The best word I can use to describe Mitch Mitchell's drumming throughout the album is \\"textbook\\". The late comedian Bill Hicks said that music should be played from the heart. On Axis: Bold as Love, Hendrix and company demonstrate what this concept is all about to the fullest.ballads is that they're never boring and do a great job of captivating the listener.

B001QOGY9K|5.0|My rating?  This was the most enjoyable movie of 2009 and - make no mistake - it was an excellent year in film.  First of all I totally enjoyed the soundtrack.  It has exciting tunes such as \\"Friends on the Other Side\\" but also dreamy music such as \\"My Belle Evangaline\\" and lots of good ol' time music influenced by Cajun folksongs, New Orleans jazz, and even gospel.  Then again, the animation is very creative. Even the main characters are more charming in their frog form than as adults.    Last but not least, the message of the film is so positive.  Others have talked about the importance of an African American heroine. But more than that, we have someone who does more than \\"Snow White\\" and merely prays for her dream to come true.  Tiana has to work hard for it.  That's a lot more realistic.    Adults who are used to the classic Disney films should be entranced by the film. And children need to experience the old Disney magic without CG enhancement.  There was hardly a moment I was not delighted in the theatre.  Since other reviewers have talked about the plot,  I will not repeat their comments here.  But who could resist the  strange voodoo magic of Mr. Facilier? Indeed.
0812973992|5.0|I read probably a book or two a week, and here it is 12/29/09, and this is the best book I've read this year!  As I was reading this book, savoring the language, I felt deeply satisfied in the sense of something filling my soul.  I am not gifted at literary review; I am not an editor.  I can only say that the writing of this book seems extraordinary, a rare thing.  I just now watched the clip of Colum McCann on this site, and he speaks of \\"channeling\\" the voices of the characters and of acting as a ventriliquist.  He succeeds expertly at channeling disparate voices--and so many of them--from different races, socio-economic standing, and from different places--Ireland, Guatemala, and the United States (he seems to have New York City down pat and then there was Gloria with her Missouri roots).  He made me love these people, these very different people.  He helped me understand and also care about hookers in the Bronx, about a struggling single mother from Guatemala, and a judge in NYC who's life was not all it seemed to be once McCann helped us see beneath the veneer.  These people are believable, both in the way they talk and the way they think, their interior lives.  This is an outstanding book.  I am not the first to say so; I just wanted to add my thoughts and thanks to so many others'.  Congratulations to Mr. McCann for this amazing work of art!

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|I saw this film on PBS for the first time last week (December 2009). In reading the reviews here, I find it amazing that there are some negative ones. Yes, the lip-synching was sometimes slightly noticeable, but so what? The rapid pacing enhanced it for me: not a single boring moment. The most important things, the performances and quality of the audio, were right on. At first I thought this film version could not hold the emotional impact of a live performance, but I think I was wrong. It's different, but just as effective. I hope the negative reviews do not discourage folks from getting this DVD. I'm definitely buying it.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|If you are looking for something unique, here it is. \\"Out of Rosenheim\\" (also known as \\"Bagdad Cafe) may not be the most famous film in the world, but the visuals and the music (with the amazing melody of \\"Calling You\\") will stay with you forever.    The story follows Jasmin Münchgstettner (Marianne Sägebrecht), a traveler from Rosenheim, Germany. Jasmin has just left her husband on the desert road, and as if led by fate, she decides to stay at the seedy motel (next to a gas station and a café) in the middle of nowhere, which a bossy, always angry and yelling owner Brenda (CCH Pounder) runs. With the arrival of this unexpected guest, however, the sleepy place and the life of the people there change forever.    German-born director Percy Adlon has an oddball sense of humor that is endearing to some, but perplexing to others. Jasmin's husband drops in the café and drinks a cup of coffee. He praises the taste, but the coffee is actually made by his wife he has just left. Or listen to what Jasmin says at the very end of the film. Percy Adlon cleverly subverts our expectations as he did in \\"Sugarbaby\\" (starring Marianne Sägebrecht).    The film is not to everybody's taste, admittedly. It depends on which version you see (I saw the longer German version), but some part of the film is slow-moving, and some part is a bit too self-conscious (one character leaves the café behind, saying \\"Too much harmony\\" as if directed at audiences). Still \\"Out of Rosenheim\\" is a very charming film and the theme song \\"Calling You\\" is unforgettable.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this album expecting it to be good. I even thought it might be very good. I was not expecting in a million years to be completely blown away as I was. Not a turkey track in sight, this album is stunning. Boyle's voice is fabulous and the selection could not be better. From the soulful gospel flavor of \\"Up to the Mountain\\" to the torchy \\"Cry Me a River\\", she really brings it hard, far surpassing any expectations. Bravo, Ms. Boyle, an instant classic!
0684830485|5.0|This book gathers momentum slowly, but I guarantee that if you stick with it to the end you will be very well rewarded.  I enjoyed this book for insight into history as well as military tactics.  It's almost like you are behind enemy lines, eavesdropping on what is happening.  But the last 40 to 50 pages swiftly gathers momentum both in action and emotional impact. But intertwined is this heart-wrenching love story, at least at the end it's heart-wrenching.  I've read four of Hemingway's books, but this one ranks easily at the top.  There is so much emotion and character in this book, the stuff that makes us human and heroic, and that makes Hemingway so great.  The last 40 pages or so builds so much emotion, suspense, and excitement you cannot put it down--the mission climaxes, the love story climaxes, what a ride!!!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I had to write something about this product.  I received my USB apple yesterday, Plugged it into my MAC and played Abbey road, it sounded amazing.  I felt as if I were listening to the album for the first time.  I heard little things that I had never heard before.  When they released the beatles remastered stereo box set I immediately put it on my wish list.  Never having owned the 1987 original Cd's (mine were copies), I thought this is going to be the definitive collection to own.  While I was saving my pennies for my box set, I learned about the USB.  I started doing my research, reading the other reviews to make my decision to get it.  I then crossed my fingers waiting on pin's & needles until I got my hands on my apple.<br />I checked the tracking info every day, which by the way never changed.  It still says its in Kentucky, when at this minute its in my home in California.<br />Anyway everything you've read on the other positive reviews is true.<br />The apple is a smaller than I expected, my wife describes it as \\"cute\\".  However somethimes great things come in small packages.  The menu's are easy to navigate, and to me it's the best of both worlds.  The stero box set & it's already to down load to your favorite MP3 player or Ipod.  So if you are thinking about purchasing this don't hesitate you won't regret it.  Hopefully you can get one for a decent price. I think Amazon's stock of these has been depleted.  I feel fortunate to get mine when I did.  Good Luck!!<br /><br />BEATLES RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400082773|4.0|Very insightful with respect to race/class issues in the world. The second half of the book details Obama's first trip to Kenya to meet relatives on his father's side. I learned a lot about Kenyan people and culture. Also, Obama was called Barry growing up with for some reason I think is hilarious - President Barry. Heh.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar is wonderful. Modern day Disney may not know the value they have put into this film but it is wonderful.<br /><br />Highly recommended for young and old.  Wonderfully woven story and easy to understand for those who grasp the woe of the modern family disintegration.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I went out on a limb and decided to buy \\"Julie & Julia\\".  I do like Meryl Streep and Amy Adams so I figured that if nothing else I could enjoy the performances.  I definately enjoyed the performances but I also enjoyed the movie as a whole.  It's not typically my favorite type of movie but it is so well-executed that I couldn't help but be entertained by it.  I hadn't heard of the book or the blog by the based-on-real-life Julie but I did know that there were two story arcs going on throughout the movie simultaneously.  I had no idea how that could work but I did.  The lives of Julia Child and Julie worked in such a wonderful parallel.  Once again, the acting was superb.  Amy Adams is a delight and Meryl Streep gave it all as Julia Child.  At times she was bordering on more of an impression than an interpretation of Julia but it didn't deter from my movie experience.  I actually think it added to the movie since Julia really was one of those \\"out there\\" individuals.

B000GW8VTO|5.0|Mel Gibson can act more with his eyes than most with their whole being.  I know several who were particpants in this struggle in the Nam and the story is basically true with a few name changes here and there.<br /><br />Sam Elliott as the CSM clearly shows what honor and courage is.  Mel Gibson listened to Hal Moore which makes this film so compelling.  An accurate portrayel of courage before the weak began to loose the war that could have been won.  Peace does not come by compromise, it comes when one defeats the other.  Viet Nam today is said to be at peace but it is still a breath taking and heart wrenching land of many seeking freedom somewhere else.<br /><br />The sacrifice of the nation during that time of trial and tribulation is depicted extremly well and deserves more than two thumbs up--it is a both arms up true story.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I have really enjoyed season one of The Clone Wars.  I thought it was a good idea for a show when I first heard the idea.  To be honest, at first I thought the execution was kind of poor.  Some of the characters don't emote well and the animation can be kind of stiff.  However, after diving in head first I came to appreciate it for what it is: mindless enjoyment.  I guess I don't know else to expect going in to a Star Wars animated television series.  I enjoyed many of the episodes better than a lot of the prequel movies themselves.  There are episodes that show sides of the Star Wars universe that isn't seen that often.  There is one particular episode dedicated entirely to rookie clone troopers stationed on a remote planet and we get to see how they deal with a desperate situation.  The show looks amazing on Blu-Ray.  The worlds and landscapes are vivid and are very well designed.  The bonus features such as commentaries by the makers of the show are interesting and the packaging is even neat becuase it is a booklet of concept art for the show.  I, at 25 years old (and still a kid at heart) enjoy the show and so does my six year old nephew.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I am a big 30STM fan, but this is my favorite album so far.<br /><br />Listening from start to finish, the album has a pulse; each song flows to the beat. I will probably get some terrible comments to this, but it reminded me of Pink Floyd's The Wall in that respect.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, as it's one of the best albums I've heard in 2009.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|Though it doesn't quite live up to the spectacular degree of hype that was built around it, Paranormal Activity is regardless a truly frightening film that delivers the goods.  Created and directed by newcomer Oren Peli, Paranormal Activity gives viewers the bird's eye view (or in this case that of a handheld camera) into the supernatural happenings in the home of a young couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) who are being terrorized by a destructive, demonic spirit.  At first, the only activity is a moving door or moved car keys, but it isn't long before things escalate on a very dangerous scale.  There are definite \\"jump\\" moments to be had, but as the film reaches its closing stretch, the events become truly terrifying, and it's made all the more so thanks to Peli's POV-style presentation.  True, the whole POV thing has been done to death since The Blair Witch Project and everything to come after it, but here, it actually feels kind of fresh to a degree.  The fact that so many fans demanded the release of the film become more widespread (so much so that it even toppled the latest installment of the Saw franchise) is a testament as to how one can do a lot with a little, and the film as a whole is also a testament that one does not need to rely on buckets of blood, guts, and torture to truly get under an audience's skin.  All in all, Paranormal Activity is one of the most truly frightening horror films to hit mainstream America in a long time, and while the best environment for viewing it is in a movie theater, catching it on home video will give you the same effect regardless.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This very true story of Oskar Schindler is compelling and necessary to remind many of what happens when government chooses to eliminate those they do not believe that all men are endowed by the creator, with certain unalienable rights.<br /><br />This is a very tough film to watch, but it should be required watching for those in our day who think that National Socialism is a better way of life than a free man.  The agony of the truth behind this film, and the history of the Schindler Jews who eventually went back to Palastine to carve out a national Israel is compelling.  The horrible truth is that the remnant of Jews who did carve out National Israel are doing so with enemies all around and yet reveal that a hand greater than the politicians and historians is at work even in our day.<br /><br />A revelation to modern man that Yahweh does indeed intervene into the lives of the children of men.  Strongly recommended for the strong at heart--whiners need not disturb their self made utopia.
B002QH2NUA|3.0|When watching the DVD of the show, one is caught up in the overall presentation.  If you listen to the musical CDs while in the quiet of your home or in your car, and really concentrate on the vocals, some of the band members singing with Paul do not sound that great.  Paul's voice is okay for the age that he is.  I understand the event was an outdoor venue, but on some tracks, those folks singing with Paul are downright terrible. There was obviously only a chance for one take on these songs, but some of the musical cuts stink.  If you are buying it for the historical value of the event or want to make sure you own every product that the Beatles (or a Beatle) makes, then go for it.  If you are a purist of sound, you might think twice before making a purchase. No doubt, it was a commercial enterprise and it will sell well because Paul's name is on it. In addition, like most middle-of-the-road Beatles/music fans, I would have preferred to hear a few more Beatle's songs and not so many \\"non-mainstream\\" tunes.  Amazon's price for the product was good.  Caveat Emptor, and good luck.

0385504225|2.0|A was aghast to read that quite a bit of Dan Brown's geographical information is incorrect.  Brown's books are supposed to be based in a little fact.  However, his credibility in this book is dashed with his inability to use Google maps or visit the city prior to releasing this book.  The amount of geographical inaccuracies in the first three chapters alone was exhausting.    When flying from Boston to Dulles International Airpot, it is highly unlikely that Langdon would have flown by the Washington Monument.  It is not thirty minutes from Dulles to the Capitol building.  The trip is closer to an hour and a half.      Yes, while Langdon would have felt a change on the road has he went over the Memorial Bridge, looking left would not have let him see the Tidal Basin or Foggy Bottom.  Looking left, he would have seen the Roosevelt Bridge, Roosevelt Island, Georgetown just across the Key Bridge, and the National Cathedral up on the hill.  Langdon would have had to look right to see the Tidal Basin, and the Jefferson Memorial, however, NEITHER the Tidal Basin nor the Jefferson Memorial are viewable from the bridge as a result of the trees in the way.      On that note, coming from Dulles International Airport, Langdon's driver would have taken them down Route 66, which automatically takes cars over a bridge and directly into the city.  Memorial Bridge would have been out of the way for no reason.    This was just in the first three chapters of the book.  If you know your way around the DC region, this will be an aggravating read.

0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind is an amazing debut for Rothfuss, and while it does at times borrow a bit thematically from Harry Potter (the story is very different),it's a far more adult novel than any in Rowling's series. Rothfuss' writing is so good that it's easy to forget that this is literally his first stab at writing a novel, and the reader is quickly drawn into an immersive world with likeable characters. Well worth your time and money.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|After seeing Twilight and New Moon, I decided to read the series! I am soo happy I did. There are a lot more details in the books and Stephanie Meyer truly makes you feel connected to the characters! Breaking Dawn is probably the best book out of the four...maybe a hard contender with the first one, Twilight. It is a very long book, but it reads so fast and easy, I seriously never wanted to put it down ever. There was so much suspense and she gave so much more insight into who the characters are. The details and skill in her writing are amazing! I truly love these books!!     I recently bought a Kindle, so I read this book on Kindle and loved it! Aside from a few grammatical and spelling errors on the Kindle version it was amazing!! I am truly hooked... in the last week I have read all four books and LOVED them!! This book is NOT just for young readers, I am a 23 year old grad student and I loved them!!!    I can't wait for them to make this one into a movie too!!
0061537969|5.0|This is a fantastic look into the life of one ordinary person. Yet the ordinary person does not tell us about his life - his dog does. Enzo fills the pages with simple rhetoric. He is fond of the real form of racing which is endurance racing. He is also steadfastly a part of Denny's life and protects those that he trusts.    His simple rhetoric gives us overlooked insight that we have taken for granted. His mantra in one paragraph stated to \\"just listen\\" when interacting with others. Because he is so frustrated by his inabilities to converse, he listens. Perhaps that is why so many people love dogs - their ability to listen. He is also envious of the human opposable thumb. He tells us excitedly what he will do when, according to a tv show, he is reincarnated as a person. His advice is simple but we are reminded of what we take for granted. Enzo is a great companion for Denny but he is also a sage canine for the rest of the world.    Enzo and Denny's involvement in motor sports is essential. It could be any sport, really, but endurance will be the attribute Denny has to tap into throughout his many ordeals. Enzo and Denny are inspired by the late, great Ayrton Senna who showed the world for a brief moment in time how a race care should be driven. It would not work out for Denny to be a NASCAR driver who drives around a circle in painfully boring manner only in daylight (not to mention the overreaching rock star status and instant fame). Instead, Denny is a struggling endurance driver who takes special interest in the specifics of his surroundings, yet another attribute he gains from being in a race car. We must realize that, despite hardships which every human will go through, a race car or something else needs to be there to set us free and keep us sane. Enzo is there at moments when Denny is released from his stressors and can be himself for a short while.    Enzo protects those without fear, so long as the zebra keeps its distance. People tell him throughout the story to help and he obliges without any objection. He interacts with people when they are struggling possibly in much the same way we would like people to interact with us when we are struggling yet they do not. His loyalty is unwavering and his judgment of character is undeniable. Perhaps Enzo was closer to being a human than he realized.    The Art of Racing in the Rain is quite a touching look into, as stated before, an ordinary person. We all have busy lives that will get derailed by difficulty. However, if you watch the 1993 European Grand Prix where Ayrton Senna showed Alan Prost and the rest of the world how to race in the rain, perhaps we can all be inspired to greatness in difficult times.
B001P06GX4|4.0|My sister and I played this game with her granddaughter, who is 6.  We had a great time.  The granddaughter had played the game at school and was great at moving into areas and blocking our future moves.  The end of the game was more challenging for her as her strategy was to pick a piece and find a legal place to play it, rather than thinking a move or two ahead.  One time she and I tied, beating my sister.    The one problem was the box only came with 17 red pieces, instead of the 21 there should have been. I called Mattel and they asked for the barcode and the manufacturer date and are sending out a new set of red pieces.  They should arrive in 10 to 14 days, according to their representative.  This precludes having four of us play for now and cost a star on the overall rating.

B002DKF47O|5.0|I know Behemoth just from 'Satanica' and 'Thelema.6' and since this very day also from their newest album 'Evangelion'. Initially I had my focus on the live 'at the Arena' album but a short look on metal-archives brought me into buying this one first. After listening to the samples I was fully convinced this is metal as I want it to be; Brutal Like Hell Either Way !!!   Evangelion has been done the right way. I sense an impious 666 spirit through every track on the list. If you will, add the full package of modern recording techniques to the album and imagine what brutal death metal sounds like. No need for picking out any song in particular, just go f..cking buy this one.   Big chance you'll keep pushing the repeat button. BEHEMOTH RULES!!!!!!

B001P9EQH8|4.0|I'm a bit torn on my rating of the Fiio E5 headphone amp, only because it performs as advertised, is economically packaged and priced, and provides some amplification - although therein lies my rating dilemma - just not that *much* amplification.  But who would expect it to, given its diminutive size and power output?  For that reason, I'd give the E5 four out of five stars - competent and amazingly affordable, but perhaps not entirely compelling.      For clarification, I'm using the E5 in conjunction with my Zune 120GB and Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones.  These headphones are easily driven by the Zune alone, given their 38 ohm impedance rating, but the Zune's lack of equalizer leaves some sound customization to be desired, hence my desire to find a compact, affordable headphone amp.  After researching the E5's frequency response, I decided to give it a try, primarily for the bass boost feature.  I'm obviously not an audio 'purist', but I'm not a bass freak either - I just wanted to fill out the sound of my ATH-M50's beyond the output of my Zune alone.      And to that end, the E5 performs admirably.  The bass-boost feature is mild, to say the least, and does not push the lower frequencies into sounding artificial or distorted, nor does make the mids muddy or noticeably attenuate the highs.  The added fullness from the bass boost is highly noticeable over the unamped output of the Zune, and for that reason alone, for me, it's a keeper.  Like others have mentioned, the volume increase is somewhat minimal, but that's not what I wanted it for.  There is some hiss toward the highest volume settings on the amp, but with the headphones I use it's almost inaudible except between tracks or in extremely quiet passages within a song, so this is a non-issue for me.      The built in rechargeable battery is handy and the overall design and build quality are great for the price.  My only reason for docking the E5 one star is that it probably just isn't a compelling purchasefor most enthusiasts considering it is marketed toward a somewhat niche group with high expectations.  The performance and expectations of a device such as this are based both on perception and the audio equipment being used, but at this price, most mild enthusiasts should give it a shot if they feel that their portable audio player doesn't provide enough output for their headphones.

0307269760|5.0|Alice Munro is one of my favorite authors of short stories, and this collection does not disappoint.  She has a gift for saying just barely enough, leaving the resolution of the story to her readers to fill in.  This applies to characters as well.  I have noticed that in her last few collections, Ms. Munro seems to have a darker view of life, as if someone close to her has bitterly disappointed.  So I prefer some of her earlier collections.  Even with that acknowledgement, however, I still think Alice Munro is a genius in this art form, and her stories are perfect constructions.  The first thing I do when I get my weekly issue of The New Yorker, where many of her stories first appear, is to check to see if she has a story in it.  There is no other author I wait for with greater anticipation.
B0027ZEHGO|5.0|Sicko is Michael Moore's best documentary yet. He speaks to real people who have been victimized, some tragically, at the hands of America's amazingly horrible health care system. Moore shows that the real villains in the health care mess here, are the greedy insurance companies, HMOs, and politicians, who are bought-off by both the insurance, and pharmaceutical behemoths.<br /><br />It's bad enough, that there are millions of Americans that can't afford health insurance of any kind. Moore shows that those who DO have health insurance in this country, are still subject to substandard treatment, IF their insurance companies even cover their health care costs at all. Michael Moore travels to France, the UK, and Cuba. He showcases the wonders of totally free health care, in those countries. Moore discovered (not surprisingly) that citizens in those countries that he visited, are healthier, and live longer than most Americans.<br /><br />I hope that Michael Moore decides to do a documentary, on homelessness in America. Just like the health care debacle, homelessness is another glaring symptom of how inhumane this country has become, towards its most vulnerable citizens. And, like the American health care crisis in this country, the homelessness problem here desperately needs to be solved.<br /><br />We need more people like Micheal Moore, who are willing to expose the many injustices in our country today. I recommend that every American see Sicko, to find out just how unfair our health care system is these days. Those who see this film, many become outraged enough to demand free health care here, which other industrialized countries now take for granted.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Santa brought this gift that my son had asked for, for the last 6 months. Though he is below the age range, he has been progressing with it nicely. He was upset that he could not find the lego \\"guys\\" capes, so I helped him look through all the clear bags twice and AHAH they were in a small (about the size that would fit a silver dollar) white box.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The Reader is a deep, emotionally wrenching drama. Kate Winslet gives a superb performance, as Hannah Schmitz. Hannah had participated in heinous crimes against Jews, during World War II. Hannah is lonely, and leads an isolated life. She has no family, friends, or companions. After the war ends, Hannah is living alone and working in Berlin, Germany.     One miserably rainy day in 1958 Berlin, 15-year-old Michael Berg becomes sick, while coming home from school. Hannah happens to spot Michael vomiting, outside of her apartment building. She helps Micheal clean-up, and then sends him home. Michael is later diagnosed with Scarlet Fever, and has to stay in bed for weeks, to fully recover.    Michael returns to see Hannah after his convalescence, bringing her flowers to thank her. He spots Hannah putting a stocking on her bare leg, as he's leaving. Hannah sees him ogling her. Hannah is in her 30s. And she's seen as being wise and worldly, by the naive Micheal.    Next time that Micheal returns to Hannah's, she asks him to do some chores. When working, Michael gets filthy, and Hannah insists that he bathe, before he leaves. While Micheal is in the tub, Hannah slips quietly into the bathroom. She strips naked, and slyly seduces Micheal, right then and there. It's the start of a summer affair between them.     During their time together, Hannah insists the Michael read a variety of literature, poems, and prose to her. Hannah cannot read herself. And she comes to rely on Michael's readings, to expand her understanding of the world, as well as for own pleasure. By the end of the summer of '58, the affair between Hannah and Michael ends. Michael then attends law school, to pursue a law career.     As fate would have it, Hannah is caught and tried for her participation in Nazi war crimes. Michael is a part of the trial, as a budding lawyer. He had no idea that Hannah could be capable of such vicious acts. It's all a devastating revelation for Micheal, and he tries to figure outhow to handle it.    As the years pass, Michael continues to be entwined in Hannah's life, even after she's sentenced to prison, and he grows up and marries someone else. Micheal just can't abandon Hannah, and this leads to his realization, of how deep his feelings are for her. For Micheal, this leads ultimately to tragic heartbreak.    This film belongs to Kate Winslet, who should win an Oscar. Ralph Fiennes as the adult Micheal Berg, is good, but not great. He seems to be trying too hard, to convey sorrowful angst. David Kross plays the young Micheal Berg, and his performance shows an incredible emotional fluency. He too, should win an Oscar.    The bleak, murky city streets of Berlin, set the emotional tone for the movie. There's always a feeling of heavy gloom, running throughout the course of this film. The racy sex scenes between Hannah and young Michael, manage to temporarily jolt the viewer out of the somber mood that cloaks the film. The full-frontal nude scenes of young Micheal, are alarming though, especially since he's a minor. The producers probably thought that explicit male nudity is hip. It just winds up being tasteless and seedy, in this film.    The main reason to view this film, is Kate Winslet. This has got to be the best performance, of her already stellar career. The movie is depressing overall. But Kate's performance alone, makes seeing this film worthwhile.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This add-on flash is compact and works flawlessly on Nikon camera with iTTl systems. Using the built-in camera flash will consume your cameras' battery life a lot faster this possible causing you to lose that perfect moment. There are huge benefits of bounce over compared to the direct flash on the Nikon model and body you own, maybe overwhelming. This unit gets great reviews for its size and its multi angel bounce, this unit will bounce off high ceilings and distant walls but it's great for many occasions and engagements.   Overall by using this unit instead of the built-in flash of one's camera, you will get more shots from the camera since its power source is two independent AA batteries and not the camera. It's compact it's great for its size ability and price.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Taxi Driver stars Robert Di Nero as Travis Bickell, an isolated, alienated Viet Nam vet living in NYC, during the mid-70s. Travis inhabits a world of violence, crime, and sleaze, as he makes his way through NY as a nighttime taxi driver. His personal life is empty, and he has no intimate friends, family, or romantic attachments.    Travis negotiates his life in the Big Apple as best he can, without much morale support at all. When Travis becomes acquainted with a teen-age prostitute named Iris, he's determined to save her from her low-life pimp, and get her off the streets. And Travis is willing and able to use deadly means, to accomplish this mission.    There couldn't have been a better actor to play Travis, than Di Nero. It's as if he was born to play Travis. He does a superb job, of conveying Travis's acute sense of anguish, rage, and steely determination, to rescue Iris from her sordid existence. An excellent supporting cast graces this film too; especially Jody Foster as Iris, Harvey Keitel as the vile pimp, and Peter Boyle as a fellow taxi driver, and confidante to Travis.    Taxi Driver is a magnificent, hard-hitting urban drama. The genius involved in crafting this utterly compelling film, makes it among the best movies of all time. Highly recommended, for those that like a film with deep, meaningful emotional impact.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|(500) DAYS OF SUMMER is a refreshing bit of fluff about the dance of contemporary courting - with a twist.  Writers Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber demonstrate a keen understanding of the bumpy road of romance and have been able to make a film that balances humor and tenderness very well.  Director Marc Webb encourages his two fine lead actors to give performances that could just be career boosts for both.<br /><br />Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a completely different role than his usual stereotype) is an architect whose line in the job seeking market landed him in the greeting card business, writing inane messages for silly cards.  Feeling as though he will never meet the girls of his dreams, he encounters Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a pretty if somewhat evasive and odd girl with her own concept of 'relationships'. Egged on by his friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) as well as his very bright 'therapist' little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), Tom approaches Summer in a courtship that lasts for 500 days - only some of which are rewarding.  It is a back and forth game of ping pong, with Tom the obsessed pursuer and Summer the feather in the wind.  There really is no particular linear story here, but instead a series of wonderful vignettes that allow Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel to shine as actors.  Webb interweaves drawings with photography in an especially winning way and allows the ping pong ball to bounce to and fro between periods of time in this thwarted courtship.  This is not a deep movie, but it is a well designed and acted look at love among the young today. The performances by the lead actors justify visiting this little treasure. Grady Harp, December 09
B002L1BJHY|4.0|Jet is often considered as a band that is wanna-be classic rock, to which I say that Jet is \\"Beer Rock,\\" and nothing more. AC/DC and other bands of this type don't often fit the feel of the modern beer commercial, but Jet thrives and lives off the cold beverage. When they try to strive further, they often falter, but at least they didn't draw up anything truly annoying this time around. And while it's true contribution to originality is very debatable, one thing's for sure, they've got a Monopoly on beer ads for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />K.I.A.<br />Black Hearts (On Fire)<br />She's A Genius<br />Goodbye Hollywood<br /><br />In Fact, the only time where I see them directly imitating classic rock, is the AC/DC impression that is 'Start The Show.' Other times, especially on 'Black Hearts,' the band is just in kick-a** beer ad mode, which the beer companies have smartly taken advantage of to great success. This along with 'She's A Genius' may not be the greatest rock songs in rock, of the decade, or even the year, but they do the job perfectly. The album also toys with some interesting ideas (Goodbye Hollywood, Walk), to varying degrees of success, but again, nothing is unlistenable the way 'Look What You've Done' was.<br /><br />Overall, the best album by the band in the overall sense. You can take that statement how you will, but it's major strength is its ease of listenability, and its use of 'Beer Rock.' Again, it might not be original, but it does the job.<br /><br />Note: Amazingly, the best quality songs are relegated to bonus track status. 'Everything Will Be Alright' sounds like a Beatles cover song, but they pull it off rather well, taking the slow approach and vocals to good success. 'Don't Break me Down' is one of those concert closers where the whole crowd sings along as the band plays off the stage. Again, not the most original, but the band pulls it off in great fashion, especially towards the end. Put together, these songs make for a better closer than 'She Holds A Grudge,' although that song has its moments.rudge,' although that song has its moments.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn was spoiled for me before I read it. Being sixteen in a school full of fanatics, I heard the entire story. However, this did not detract from my interest. I had none at first ,and I thought that the entire series would be cheesy or gory. I learned quickly that I had been completely wrong. This book is definitely my favorite out of the series. It kept me enthralled so much so that I lost track of time completely and found myself awake at 2:00 am trying to finish. There was never a dull moment in the story line. There was always something going on ,and it created perfect closure to the saga. I would recommend this book and the other three to anyone because I never thought that I would enjoy a book like this and now I love them all. They have a little something for everyone.
0061231401|5.0|I love James Rollins for his unique style of writing, mixing fiction with truth and using historical facts to back them up.  This is one of his best novels yet!!
B002VPE1AM|3.0|Here's a 2 hour 30 minute film which would have been a great two hour film. The central characters act well the two of them but beside them I thought the star-cast was particularly \\"poultry\\" and I didn't think they did justice to the film. But that's not my major complain.  I felt the film was a bit far drawn out with the whole 2154 scenario and men still chasing rocks and minerals. I mean, come on, let's be a little original here. Not a lot of backdrop on the Pandora before actually jumping into it made the film seem 2-sided which didn't do good.<br /><br />The graphics, the acting of the central actors was commendable, of course. I absolutely loved those dragons that flew, easily the best part of the film. But what I didn't quite appreciate was the whole story of the villains being sold to me. That made the film lose it's impact and made it look rather predictable. Someone said this is the best film they've seen in a long time. I'm 25, a harsh critic, cause I give every single film half-worthy of being watched a go and I thought this film was good but not great.<br /><br />This film will go on to break record and it's good to see movie goers actually give film like \\"Avatar\\" with true artistic intent credit rather than going for films like Twilight and making them blockbuster biggest hits. Out of all the blockbusters I watched in 2009, I thought District 9 was hands down the most original, the most thought provoking film.<br /><br />I must give the film crew credit for making such an astounding piece of art but I felt it's a little far fetched calling this the best film they've seen in the last decade. The best film of this decade has to \\"there will be blood\\" in my humble opinion.
B000UR9T82|4.0|I just ordered the trilogy and viewed Spiderman 1 for the 100th time, but first on blu ray. To be honest I was somewhat disappointed with the transfer although it looks obviously better than the DVD. The PQ is not as sharp as, say, T2 Judgement Day (1991) given that this is a recent (2002) movie. Once of the very noticeable thing watching this movie on blu ray is how crappy the CG for goblin on his glider was. I was unpleasently surprised certain goblin scenes look very cartoony - particularly the Times Square scenes. The blu ray is in fullscreen.    The boxset came with damaged corners thanks to the casual packing in a box but item arrived very fast (to Singapore).    That being said, all else was good with this first movie. This IS the one that started it all. I mean the barrage of Marvel movies.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my father, who loves Star Trek. He even went to see this in Imax when it was in theatres. when the movie was finished, I asked him how it looked compared to the I-Max. he said, \\"I have been waiting 20 years for home movies to look this good. it has finally happened.\\"    and it really does look good. the colours are nice, there are no artifacts, and there are very few specks of interferance or noise. hell, you can see the damn stubble on Spock & Kirk's face! you can also see the film grain, when you get up close. that kind of bothered me, but I supposed that's something that I must live with. oh, and there's also special features. a lot of them.    as far as the movie goes, it's okay. it's all great, but the story really grinds on me- some parts just seem out of place.
0684833395|2.0|I just finished reading this book, and it was definitely a chore. I was very disappointed with it because it's widely hailed as a great and 'hilarious' work of classic fiction and I saw it as exactly the opposite.    Once again, as with many books I've read, the foreword wasn't really worth reading. It should have been an afterword because it basically described the process of getting the book published along with all the successes and obstacles therein. As with almost every foreword, it contained some amount of spoilers which dismayed me because I prefer to find such things out myself. Those curious about the history behind the book or folks who have read the book before and bought the new copy would find it useful.  After reading the first three chapters, I was wondering when the book would begin to be funny and enthralling. I was constantly confused about what was happening and most of the \\"Jokes\\" fell flat. The book is intentionally written in a manner that makes the reader dig deep to link events together, which I personally didn't care for. I felt like I was watching \\"Lost\\" by the way everything was spread out and the beginning of the book in particular offers tiny pieces of the plot through seemingly incongruous events.  As I tried to get into the book, I developed a strong distaste for the writing style and I had to force myself through this book most of the time. There were only a few parts that I found funny, but I was mostly disappointed by the real lack of any climactic action whatsoever. The reviews I had read about this book had me expecting a hilarious thrill ride but it's almost half dialogue apart from tons of unnecessary descriptions and a smattering of fistfights and actual combat.    I think that Heller's sense of humor was lost on me. This book is a riot if you love reading the same thing over and over again. When the reader isn't trying to figure out which character is terrified about which or waiting to find the significance of an event, the dialogue drones on and the paradoxes and contradictions that make the heart of the book pop up incessantly and contribute absolutely nothing to the story. I did find some parts funny, but those parts were far too few to be redeeming. I do not consider this book to be especially funny, and I do not think that the humor of the book should be mentioned in most of the quotes and synopses on the back cover or in the Amazon.com description. I could see it being a bit better in movie format because of how important the tone and delivery of the dialogue is, but I have not seen the film nor do I intend to. If you disagree with my sentiment, then take into consideration that I found the Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger to be the funniest novel I've ever read and blame my sense of humor for that.    The characters were pretty well developed, and with all the description the reader knows about every freckle or wart on their faces. Some of them were funny or surprising at first, but the way every person is involved in nearly every event makes juggling all the names and facts exhausting at first. As the story goes on and the plotline jumps wildly around, I think that some readers would have to have a pen and paper ready to take notes as things progress tiny bits at a time while the focus is on a different subject. Luckily, everything is restated several times and if you missed anything the first time, you're sure to see it pop up again and again.   I think that the main reason why I didn't like this book was the fact that in reading through it I had effectively read the same thing twice, if not several times with all the repetition. The secondary reason is that my expectations of this book were simply too high and I didn't appreciate the way life and death were so inconsequential, and insignificant events and errors were blown out of proportion. I understand that the book is meant to be partly satirical about the military and about that very portrayal of such skewed priorities,but such a piece of writing is simply not for me. I don't feel that this book is deserved at all of its reputation and I would never consider buying the sequel or recommending it to a friend.  I saw fit to rate it two stars because it is not entirely without good qualities, but I couldn't help but wonder why the book couldn't have been written in chronological order. I suppose that that quality is part of the charm, but I would have preferred a less repetitive book.
0545128285|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 13 yr. old granddaughter.  She was thrilled to receive it.
0156030306|5.0|I read this book while on vacation several years ago, and just recently re-read it. I think that this book is a must-read and I thoroughly enjoyed this work.  This book is a wonderful mix of poetry, misery, and joy. I loved the way Keyes portrayed the story through the journal entries Charlie makes while undergoing this amazing scientific experiment. The imagery in this novel is so powerful that I will probably always remember most of the scenes in this book.  The story is quite the emotional roller coaster. The only other book that impacted me as powerfully as Flowers for Algernon was Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls. I'm not an emotional person but both these books had me on the edge of tears.    My favorite part about this book is not so much Charlie himself, but rather the reaction other characters have toward him. Before the experiment poor simple Charlie was a doormat and object of ridicule for his friends, but he didn't know. Even before he discovers how his friends truly see him, I was mortified by the situation and I felt so sad for him. There are quite a few good underlying messages in the book about scientific morality and the social conventions of the time. I feel that this book definitely earned all the rewards it won and I applaud Daniel Keyes for his literary prowess.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been a fan of Susan Boyle since the first time I heard her beautiful voice on Britian's Got Talent. Her stunning rendition of \\"Wild Horses\\" at the finale of America's Got Talent was the highlight of the whole season, let alone that night. Normaly when a CD is released the title song and maybe 1 or 2 more songs are good. In the case of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" every single song was breathtaking. Susan doesn't 'overwork' a song. The musical background is very complimentary to her voice and you can tell by just listening that she puts her whole heart into each selection. One thing is for sure... I will never grow tired of Susan Boyle or her God given talent... that glorious voice and her shining sweet spirit.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I went to see Avatar today with my 10 year old grandson, I am 65.  We both came out of the theater absolutely blown away.  I am not a big moviegoer, but was fascinated by what I had heard and seen about the movie before Avatar came out.  My grandson is a big Sci'Fi fan and had been bugging my daughter to let him go to see it.  She happily let Pop take him to the movies.  Neither of us was disappointed.  As far as I am concerned, this is GRAND Hollywood Spectacle in the best sense of the word.  The created world of Pandora is lush, beautiful, and dangerous.  I think the plot is very believable; sadly it is a very realistic critique of the worst parts of Western civilization.  The characters are well drawn although they could always be more developed.  While their is profanity, I didn't think it was overdone.  There was one sex scene, but it was so gently done that I did not find it objectionable to have a 10 year old boy next to me.  The creatures of Pandora are amazing and believable and the natives are graceful and sympathetic.  Some have criticized Avatar for having borrowed from other sources and for me that is what made it so great.  It stretched my horizons, while still giving me a known foundation from which to enjoy all the movie has to offer.  The only thing I want to do when I see it again is to see it in IMAX 3D.  10/10 in my book.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|The special effects are amazing. The 3-D is incredible. The color is terrific. I liked the message. You are completely immersed in the world of the story. DON'T EVEN THINK OF SEEING IT WITHOUT THE 3-D OR OF WAITING TO SEE IT ON DVD. It won't be the same! My only caveat is that they could have shortened the climactic battle scene. Overall, a movie that changes the future of movies.

0316001821|2.0|After seeing the movie review, I was more than excited to read this book that I was positive would become a new favorite.  Wrong.  The beginning was great, it caught my attention, and I wanted to see what happened.  The climax though occurred in the *middle* of the book.  With nowhere to go from there, the author just drug out the story, filling it with pointless trivia about the victim's family and friends.  I kept going though, wanting to know how it ended.  Then I got to the end and had to ask myself - what was this author thinking!      If you're looking for a murder mystery as told by the victim, this unfortunately is not your book.  If you're looking to read about the mundane lives of a family and their friends that you don't particularly care about, happy reading!

A vital read for anyone managing complexity.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I was never a big fan of the Termintor franchise after the first film. I thought T2 had great special effects (and a knockout performance by Linda Hamilton) and T3 was an amusing send-up but they both lacked the freshness of the original. Thankfully Terminator Salvation takes the series in a completely different direction while still keeping in theme with the first movie.<br /><br />What really makes T4 a thrill for me is that the actors make the most of their somewhat typical screenplay. Christian Bale is good as usual but Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin rise above their flatter dialogue and give us characters you want to root for.<br /><br />The special effects in this film are also great, but unfortunatly loose alot of their impact on DVD. The transfer tears a bit and like most things on the small screen it's easier to pickout where the green-screen begins and the real actors end (some of the cooler stunts look laughable on DVD).<br /><br />So like I said, if you liked the movie Terminator Salvation is still a must buy. It you are bothered by an unperfect copy then best to test out the Blu-Ray.
B00005N6KG|5.0|i bought 2 pairs of these headphones from amazon for my use with my sansa clip plus mp3 players. these headphone sound pretty decent for the price. the big advantage this headphone has over the other headphones i have owned in the past are:<br />1. they stay in my ears while i mow the lawn and trim the trees.<br />2. they sound good and comfortable to wear for extended period.<br />3. you can still be aware of the environment while wearing these headphones.<br />since these headphones have no moving part, they should last a long time. i don't know why some of you here complain about it being short lived.<br />i guess i have to keep them a few more months before i can attest to the reliability issue.<br />in my experience i find sony product to be pretty reliable. i still have a sony walkman cassete player that i bought in the 80'.<br />customers should be aware that all new mp3 players use li-ion battery which have expected life of about 2 years. this is one BIG disadvantage for me as far as modern electronics are concerned.
0061174793|4.0|I bought this for my 2 year old as I heard so many good things about it.  I think it's a really cute story, but he doesn't seem to be into it yet.  Maybe he will grow into it later?  I liked it.  Good service and fast shipping.
0545123267|5.0|I hate it when people constantly compare every single book, with either a werewolf or a vampire in it, with Twilight.    Anyways, I loved loved loved this book! It is now my favorite and I cant stop thinking about it.     I would recommed Shiver to any one who loves an exciting love story.
B000P21WR8|5.0|This is one of the very very best books I have ever read. It takes a little time to get into his way of writing, but it is worth the trouble. He takes his time, as his characters run repeatedly over almost the same mental tracks, over and over, as they obsess about the women they love. Put like that, it sounds boring and repetitive, but not a bit. He works endless variety into it, and one of the most striking features (and strikingly true-to-life) is the way in which essentially the same line of thought can lead on successive days, or even successive hours, to contradictory conclusions.  Besides, a great many passages are just plain beautiful.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Watched the whole first season on Netflix. Liked it so much I had to buy it.
1401323820|3.0|For those who watch \\"Castle\\" on ABC, this is the book that the lead character, Richard Castle released in one of the episodes. For those who do not watch \\"Castle\\", the premise is that of an author who shadows a female detective of the NYPD, so that he can create a new character for his novel. \\"Heat Wave\\" is that story based on that detective. So it's a fictional character writing a book based on his experiences with the NYPD only real in the world of television. An entertaining premise, gimmick, tie-in, whatever you may want to call it. Fans of the show will enjoy it; those looking for a complex mystery may not.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The DVD's came quick! and they were in great shape!! I cant wait to order season 2 and wait for season 3 to come out. Very happy with the service.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Excellent movie.  I like how this movie explained some of the old Star Treks, but I was disappointed that it changed the history.  I hope the next one is good.  Overall, special effects, story, and acting get 5/5.
B001FB55I0|4.0|Good movie and good details story link with old part. Nice Feature behind the screen in Bluray
B002VKE1K2|5.0|We had heard that this movie was not very good.  So I did not buy it, instead we rented it.  I will buy this movie.  It is not a special effects movie, but it does have some chilling parts with some great \\"jump factor\\" parts.  Watch the theatrical ending for a better end to the movie.  The acting is not bad, at times we found ourselves yelling at Micah for not listening to Katie.  If you like chilling paranormal movies but you read some of the negative opinions on Amazon or from friends, rent it first and then judge it.  Enjoy!
B002RVZV9U|3.0|I like Jimmy Page and am a fan of the Edge. I really do enjoy Jack White's music. A lot of the documentary was fun to watch, however there seemed to be a lack of chemistry between the guitarists except for the last acoustic piece played.     Am a big fan of music dockumentaries, and this aint no The Clash: Westway to The World (which for me is the gold standard in rockumentaries.    Just wish this documentary had more of the three guitarists playing together, and some more chemisry.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|The special effects are really good.  Some of the story is good.  But overall, it seemed inconsistant with the other Terminators.  The ending was corny.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Love this movie.  The cast was great and the script actually matched their talents.  Bill Murray is a highlight here and fans of him will really like it.  At the time, the special effects were mind blowing, but even without them, this is one great movie.  A good mix of hilarious, stupid, and fun.  A good time for sure and a great deal!!
