B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 5 year old loves this game.  He watched the movie and thinks the game is so funny with all the minions.
0930289234|2.0|I read many superlative reviews of this, and I see it pop up at the top of great comic books.  I'm just not feeling it.  I find it to be relatively disjointed; I don't think the plot or characters are particularly engaging.  It's got a mood to it, I'll give it that.<br /><br />When I hear people say that this subverted comic books into something more adult, and that it explored aspects of superhero comics deeply, I don't get it.  At its best this reminds me of the better work that Steve Gerber did for Marvel in 1970's - The Defenders and Howard the Duck. I think that Gerber did this type of thing better - he could write real, strong characters (particularly the Duck) and could tell a story well.  I think that Moore's pacing is not so good.  I'm pretty sure that this has its reputation because it stood out in and of its time.  I don't think that it stacks up so well compared to the great comic runs of all time.<br /><br />For better or worse, the film follows this comic pretty closely; it exactly duplicates it in large chunks.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I have not been able to use this app as there are no instructions on how to make it work.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This  story was a journey we all must or will take- the hurt, the loss, the hope, the ache for the finale. So, as you read...allow the story to seep into your heart and take the time to reflect and question your own journey.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love hidden object games!  This one would be great if I had a Large screen!  print and pictures are so tiny I cant see them without a magnifying glass.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a great book that has taught me and caused me to think deeper but shallower. I highly recommend this book.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|if you love a beautiful woman's voice, she is an angel. you don't need to speak French to feel the love in this music
B007P7UF0G|5.0|This is one of my favorite romances.  It is also a show that I went to see with my mother and it brings back memories of her.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Nothing too disturbing about this movie. After you get through the violence it is a decent family movie for older kids.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Quartet ( HD ) I enjoyed it was a very much good story of old friends and how they look after one another.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|This is a very fun game that quickly unlocks additional puzzles once you have solved the first few.  The premise is simple; you look for the numbers 1 - 25 hidden in the picture that fills your screen (tip - brighten your screen if you don't normally keep it super bright for reading).  I got stumped a couple times and ran out of time before I found the last number, but the app allows you to repeat the puzzle from the beginning (based on the puzzles I've completed at this point, as far as I can determine there is no penalty for a repeat try).  The only penalty I can see during puzzle solving is that wrong guesses cost you ten seconds of time on the clock.  Occasionally, I could barely see the final one or two numbers, so that's why I suggest you brighten your screen a little if you're having trouble completing puzzles.  Each puzzle just takes a couple minutes; I did at least 15 puzzles before I returned to my chores for the evening.  Enjoy!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This movie provided many laughs along with entertaining action.  Not suitable for children, this is definitely a good adult movie.  I would definitely recommend it to others to see.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Not too proud to say I have read hundreds (maybe thousands) of books and can think of only a few that stand out.  This is one of them.  To make this even more clear, this is the first time I have spent the time even writing a review but I know when I am looking for something to read, a strong review (bad or good) goes a long way.  I honestly cannot believe this is a debut novel as it kept my attention the whole time.  Emma Chase had the man's POV dead on with incredible character development and seriously funny content.  Went from steamy sex to hold your stomach laughter to cringe-worthy to well, you get the idea.  Main character never loses his edge even as he's completely blind to what's happening. Total man whore with no apologies. References to The Notebook being freaking HILARIOUS!  The female lead is strong and sensitive, I actually liked her which seldom happens as they usually end up spineless, sappy or just plain dumb. I won't review by rehashing what could be read in others or by the back but trust me- you will not be disappointed- Emma Chase is an exceptional writer and I absolutely will be purchasing (even full priced) her upcoming novels.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great seeing all my old heros in action again. Make #3 please with more action stars from them 80s. I went to see this 3 times and it never gets old.
B000FC12SM|4.0|I wasn't too excited at first but I'm surprised at some of the things that I've read so far. Very interesting.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I keep getting a message about an internal error.  It's been horrible. What a shame- it seemed like a fun game.  Totally frustrating!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Pretty good. The cd is amazing and in perfect conditions. Cant complain. Thank you very much. Awesome awesome. Thanks lol.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I never expected a book about a girl with cancer to be funny. But John Green did just that. I laughed and cried and cried some more. Hazel was very real and I fell in love with her and Augustus. Moving. Encouraging. Realistic.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|There's no fjording rivers and no dysentery. It's more like Frontiersville, only better. I really would have preferred the old school game from way back when.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This book has touched my soul. It reminds one of Borges' The Aleph, of Castaneda' s The teachings of Don Juan, and transcends one's basic materialistic needs and wants, while opening your mind's eye to spirituality, and to real love.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Although this movie is freighted with obscene language, it's brilliantly acted, extremely touching and provides a fascinating and believable view into the lives of a family and its friends doing their best to function with mental illness, infidelity, grief, job loss and societal change. Don't expect rational behavior but do expect hope and love to keep things going.
1410458792|5.0|She loved it and couldn't put it down - what more can I say!<br />I just don't know if they abridged this or not.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am much more efficient at typing, and I have saved a lot of time using swift key. After it starts to learn your personal way of talking, it adapts and helps you become even quicker
B004SDEP38|5.0|Items seems to work just as advertised very pleased couldn't be much happier I would remodeled this well worth it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very interactive and easy for my kids to play and good graphics also...I would recommend to all horse lovers as well...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Honestly one of the most grabbing novels I've read in a very long time.  I finished it in about a week and am looking forwards to purchasing the next part of the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This a fun and great thinking game. I love it to keep my mind thinking without stressing myself out on other things.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I had so much fun when I played this game and it lags the first time you play it but later on its not laging it's fun and I'm not leaving until you play it
B0094ZJ7HO|4.0|Very laid back and even groovy in spots, but this will hold me over nicely until their next original release.  My only regret is that they didn't include their cover of Independent Woman, which always puts a smile on my face (especially when I watch the video on rathergood.com with the Northern Kittens).
098478280X|5.0|I haven't not started working on the list of questions yet but I already love this book. I have been on the other side of the interview before and I know a lot of the things mentioned in this book to be true, but this book clearly states them in an organized manner. Also, it give you a list of topics to study for. It won't get you a job necessarily, but it gives you a direction to study, which is exactly what I expected this book to do.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Had to scan a document in at work to send to somebody this morning, and remembered I had downloaded this app as a FAOTD, so I performed an experiment, scanning the doc in with this app, and with our Savin super whamadyne scanner/fax/copier thing.  The interface on Genius Scan was intuitive, cropping was easy, and while the file was larger than the copier's, it also looked a heck of a lot better.  Which is surprising since the copier got the file through a document feeder, and Genius got it through me, vainly attempting to hold the phone straight and not block the light.  I gotta say, I'm impressed.  I would definitely pay for this app.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I bought this a while ago when they were still in stores because I knew Lucas would never stop changing his movies and I was right. There are good things and bad things about this release.<br /><br />The GOOD<br />-The good thing is obviously seeing the Theatrical unchanged versions of SW which are becoming harder and harder to find these days.<br />-Preservation of the original content on a newer medium.<br /><br />The BAD<br />-Lucas seems intent on making his new version the ONLY version (however he keeps changing his only version so we now have 3 separate movies with changes in them through the years) therefore the only way to get this release passed they had to package it with the 04 releases and say that the original movies are just a Bonus. -They should be cheaper especially since the 2nd disc is all we care about.<br /><br />The So So<br />-Quality of the Originals were not up to date. On one hand they look pathetic compared to the 04 remastered version but on the other hand I felt they looked better than VHS and were perfectly passable. I would have liked the original movies remastered but then again last time Lucas tried to do this we ended up with the Special Editions. I'll take the lower quality over them not existing at all on DVD and risking them being messed with again. But again settling since we know Lucas hates his movies isn't really something you should have to do.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Good interface, nice layouts, easy to play.  It's not that there aren't tons of Mahjong games out there, but the price was right on this one (FAOTD) and it's a good time waster.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I was looking forward to it because of the original story but we both thought it lacked everything - drama, humor, pathos, etc.
B006S080DK|5.0|Who wouldn't love an intriguing and romantic period costume drama set in glorious Venice?  Helena Bonham Carter and the young Linus Roache were very well cast.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I have seen the original and the 2nd, going to watch the third soon and honestly didn't care one way or another about this movie. If you were like me then you just felt this movie would either be a shameful ripoff or a serious letdown or just over hyped. I can honestly say this movie delivers and it delivers big. I can't get enough of it which says something. So here is all you need to know,<br /><br />I wont give details but it still takes place in a cabin in the woods. Dead are released and the movie runs its course. I believe this is what Sam Raimi wanted the original to do but couldn't manage it. That is not a shot at him but I am glad this movie was made now. I am honestly not much of a fan of the original, I though it was a great movie but the 2nd is where it picks up. But I honestly believe if you haven't seen the original you should watch it first to see why a lot of fans are upset over this but I am glad a new generation can be brought in and at the same time make a movie that goes off on its own path.<br /><br />Overall if you haven't seen the original you can watch this no problems but you would really be better off watching the original first. This one does more than enough on its own however and I think its one of the better horror movies in recent memory. Its simple horror fun and a few creepy parts, not scary but creepy. Do yourself a favor and watch this. You will not regret it.
B00D2BHO44|5.0|Still in the middle of playing it, but the story is terrific. The starting chapter is heartrending, bring your tissues.
B001UG56ES|5.0|Interesting story line, plenty of action and good acting kept my interest. Those who like movies with some suspense, developed characters, good forces vs those with evil intentions and history would enjoy this movie. This is a movie I would watch a second time.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|The movie itself was not as good as 1, but it was a great download and play. Definitely worth not getting off of the couch and renting a video, if that is even an option anymore.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It is a great game that amazon ruined by charging \\"real money\\" while every other android version uses coins \\"unreal\\". It is dangerous and we will see stories of parents getting charged thousands on their credit cards because they gave their kindles to their kids so they could play...they wont be playing they will be paying
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You will fall in love with each character from the first page, and then you will want more when you reach the last page.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game, no other horse game featured on the kindle can compare to this game! I really love the realistic movement of the horse, it can be hard to replicate.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games and a great mystery novel..this game is both ! I agree with other viewers, this is a stunning game and it is worth a play...did I mention that it's kind of creepy :)It'll make you feel like your inside of a thriller...happy solving y'all!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I like the Downton Abby series and this book is written in the same era and is very much like it.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|What can go wrong? Joss Whedon and Jonny Depp haven't made a horrible movie in their entire carreer together.... while I wouldn't call it horrible, It isn't Stellar, either. I expected better than mediocre. Apparently, trying for the laugh cost them both dearly.
B006ZNRD06|3.0|Plays .flv and .mkv files with no problems, however, it keeps taking snapshots while I'm trying to watch clips on it. Otherwise it would have been a great app.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|subway surffer is a good game play but it would be interesting to change the scenery a bit it wont be the same. but all in all it is a good game. thank you
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Just what it's supposed to do. Has the same view as my mobile app, which makes it easy to navigate through.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|I watch it as soon as it came in, and the CD was in a Great condition so thank you so that!
B009MJU9SI|5.0|I love Schleich toys because they are so realistic and well made. This one is really cute. If you are planning to buy an adult hippo to go with the baby i recommend buying the more recent model so that the baby and adult match.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The best thing about this movie is the multiple layers of depth. They skillfully deal with paradoxes of life. For example, captain Kirk was confronted with  the question  of saving his friend's life or disobeying  his superior's order. In another instance, he had to decide if he's going to co-operate with one of his enemies to defeat another enemy. Whatever action he took, he would pay dearly. Those situations struck a chord with me. It's because in my daily activities, I also had  the same problems.<br /><br />There are some scenes with gripping suspense. For example, the scene where the Enterprise space ship was so badly damaged that it could not flee or fight. Then the enemy ship locked their laser guns on it. Its crew's  lives were hung on a thread. How could they escape? What happened next took me completely by surprise.<br /><br />The acting of most of the actors is believable.<br /><br />It's more like an interesting drama and thriller than an action film. It has some action scenes but they're not its focus.<br /><br />Of course, it has some logical holes as any other movies but they don't affect its entertaining value.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture:<br /><br />Production Budget: $190 million<br />Domestic:  $224,459,201<br />+ Foreign:  $222,500,000<br />= Worldwide:  $446,959,201<br /><br />That's a huge amount.<br /><br />In short, it's absolutely worth watching. It deservers 4 stars.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|My kids and I enjoy this film.  It has a good message &#34;a person's a person no matter how small&#34;.  And it's comical.  Good voices.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I haven't used it that much but from the brief times I do use it, it's just okay.  I'm sure it will get better if I get on it more.  I would recommend it though.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|He really loved this T-Rex especially since the jaw is movable. He had a lot of fun with it, but be careful of sharp edges.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|Two songs are great masterpieces \\"Vocal\\" and \\"Inside a Dream\\" sure 5 stars.  Most reviews have underrated \\"Inside a Dream\\" but if you walk into a Club and if the song is playing, you will be on the dance floor. \\"Axis\\", \\"Fluorescent\\", \\"Love is a Bourgeois Construct\\" and \\"Bolshy\\" are 4.5 stars. The \\"Last to Die\\" is getting a lot of write up in reviews, however, it is the hype of Bruce Springsteen's name. \\"Shouting in the Evening\\" and \\"Last to Die\\" are 4 stars.  Do not know why they had to add a rap guy for \\"Thursday\\" the song is great till that guy shows up. I would have given it a 5 if not for the rap, its a 4.9 in my opinion. A CD worth investing in if you like British Electronic Music.  If you have never heard of Pet Shop Boys, start by buying this CD, you wont regret and probably become their fans. I have 3 favourite songs from their past \\"Was That What It Was\\", \\"Being Boring\\" and \\"This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave\\". PSB are geniuses in electronic music and Neil Tennant has a voice suited to match the beats. I hope they make it big in USA with this CD. From Plano, Texas good luck to PSB.
B0055S348W|5.0|Got this for free on the productivity bundle amazon were giving away. It is so good I would consider even making a donation to the developers. Handy for printing at having stuff when I get into the office or back at home.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|i am new a t this game but its too fast for me i like it alot but i keep losing it
B000BT97AO|5.0|Awesome, weird, love the music, day-dreamy movie. Teen girl has to find herself, she's talented. Love the silly cats. Everything is metaphoric and symbolic. Deep and entertaining.
1439196834|5.0|This book is great it is exactly like the playbook Barney uses in the show except that it is soft cover.
1881273377|5.0|This is a must Book/CD for all people. Very simple and informative on the simple basics of how to treat other people. Easy to read/understand.
143911000X|5.0|This book is awesome and great to read with your friends.It is exactly like the bro code in the show.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I wanted to watch this one before the new one came out, and this one was great, and i am just waiting for Red2 to come out.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun and entertaining game that you can play over and over again. Would recommend the game, got it for free.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Big Bang is by far the best sit com ever made, I was a huge friends fan and this is the new friends. I hope they continue to develop the supporting roles. Looking forward to season 7
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game it is addictive and hard to put down but yet not to difficult i am so glad i down loaded it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game so far. Very entertaining.<br />I would recommended  for everyone in my family and my friends too. I love it.
074401493X|5.0|Guide is informative and streamlined, with bold points for artifacts, emblems and, the like. The hardcover design is aesthetically appealing, and the firefly keychain is a fun little knick-knack.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is an awesome game. But for some reason it doesn't work on my phone. The game won't load. But besides that I love it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love this series. Can't put it down, it really is addictive and has a great plot with exciting scenarios
098478280X|3.0|I got this book with great hope. Overall content is good but the no of questions are very limited. But this book gives you a overview of questions you might face during technical interviews. So, its upto the reader to extend their knowledge further after reading it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Fun movie, good music, great voice talent.  Mandy Moore is always good, and Zachary Levi should be doing more of this type of work - he was great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've played all the other temple run remake s but this one just blew them away I would recommend this game to all ages
030758836X|4.0|This is a fun book that switches different characters being first person.  I've read this type before and always enjoy getting the perspective of multiple people.  The ending on this is odd to say the least but it's not so strange that I would say never read the book.  The ending dropped the book down from 5 stars to 4.  A few things were a little off throughout but overall a good book.
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  If you like the fantasy genre you will love this movie.  Its inspired by Neil Gaimans amazing novel and if you love this movie you should check it out too.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Dr Alexander wrote of his difficulty in conveying his experiences while in coma into laymen term. Maybe that was my problem in fully grasping his feelings. I fully believe Heaven and God exist, I just had trouble connecting with Dr Alexander's relations of his experience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the 0.7.0 update on MCPE and I would say heck with bad comments they do not no what they are saying.  Get that app if you don't have it. It is not stupid it's AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B00B5AIB14|4.0|I enjoyed most of the tracks. Only draw back was when they attempted to modernize the sound by making it clubish.  Didn't care for that  part of the remixing.  Overall its really good effort....bob marley is timeless and lives!!
B004ZQBP3Q|4.0|This is a definite party album, so if you're thinking bout cutting rugs, tearing the house down, or just having a good time, this is for you. I had a dream that I bought this, so I went out and got this, not the greatest album, good though for letting loose. With &#34;Party Rock&#34; I'm sexy and I know it&#34; and &#34;With You&#34; aren't bad. Check it out if you want something to party to.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Fun to play and you build your tree house as an added bonus.  But I would like more levels.<br /><br />Just ok for me
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Roberto Benigni is a delight.  Sad and inspiring and hopeful movie.  I can see where it got its Academy award
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I bought this book because the thought of walking the Pacific Crest Trail sounded so exciting and romantic to me although I'm too old and out of shape to even attempt such a thing.  I was not disappointed.  Cheryl's courage and determination are an inspiration.  Her actions and language at times are a little spicy, but she tells it like it was and you have to admire her for it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I would watch Maggie Smith real cereal boxes and she didn't disappoint in this film. Overall, the film was a bit slow but, I enjoyed it. It definitely had a great cast.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|Good dance moves, good charactors.  A little out-dated now, but a good try.Nice to see a few older performers in this one.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|Let's face it, we didn't enjoy the \\"Evil Dead\\" but it was scary, but because it was silly, badly acted, and way, way, way over-the-top. And then there's Bruce Campbell who would go on to cult status and record the only commentary tracks in history to make buy a DVD worth it all on it's own, even if you hated the film.<br /><br />So the new Evil Dead takes the idea if the first film, 5 friends (two a brother/sister)in a cabin, read the book of the dead and evil spirits possess them, wreak havoc and leave all but one dead. But, where the original had massive wide-angle POV, outrageous site gags and the forth stooge (Bruce, baby!) this one has Hostel-Saw vibes and almost buries itself in how serious it is. But we can't take it seriously. No matter how much the characters vocally state everything the do is a bad idea.<br /><br />The glue here is Mia, a heroin junkie they have brought to the cabin to detox. It's supposed to add a depth beyond the illogical five friends (anyone see a girl-boy ratio screw up there) go off to a cabin to do, uh, nothing. In the first film they had no reason for being there. So, we'll give it a star for actually thinking up a plot and putting a purpose behind the journey.<br /><br />But, this one's no fun. Seeing so much so familiar to the original two films and yet feeling no tension, no suspense to fill the void left by the dejected humor it just felt a bit hollow. It's a solid piece of splatter gore, but it's not a great piece and certainly no the uber-cheap, 3 year journey film Sam Rami made. So Army of Darkness II (aka Evil Dead IV with Bruce Campbell) is in the works.... hmmm. And certainly this will have a sequel as well.<br /><br />But can we take it seriously? Well, just a little, but the attention to gore doesn't compensate for the lack of originality.
B00846REIS|5.0|I could not put this book down .. Read the book in one day! I love this series. LOVE LOVE

1936850028|5.0|This is a must read! It holds a myriad of fun and adventure capturing the essence of cross country skiing around the country. Walter Rhein offers a wide array of caricature and truth to the cross country racing world. Rhein,takes the reader into a Northern Wisconsin winter inspiring a passion for XC skiing and accomplishing the 'Birkie'. A must read!!!
B008JFUNYG|3.0|The original \\"The Evil Dead\\" is one of my favorite horror movies...with that being said, this re-boot did an okay job of re-telling the story.  This new version takes the original story and expands upon it by having the main character, Mia, brought to the cabin for the weekend by her brother and three friends in hopes to detox her of her drug addiction.  The book of the dead is found, one of the friends starts reciting passages from the book, Mia gets attacked by the trees in the woods and then all hell breaks loose! Much of the movie sticks close to the original, with some changes here and there, and some back story involving the brother and sister thrown in.  The biggest changes occur at the end of the film, and this is where I think the movie becomes flawed...where the movie should have ended it tended to drag on and get silly(I won't give anything away, but the brother making a 'home-made' defibrillator was ridiculous.)  Another flaw in the film was the use of quick cut editing.  On the upside, the gore effects in the movie are well done, and there are some good jump scares.  As far as modern re-boots go \\"Evil Dead\\" is one of the better ones, and definitely one of the better horror movies to come out in a long time, but compared to the original it wasn't as much fun.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|It is great to be able to have access to my Word and Excel documents in my Android device. Getting the program from Amazon was very easy. Amazon is a great  place to shop.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You would think when you first look at the gAme that it would be boring and pointless.  But once you download the game and try it out its a lot of fun.  I just started playing yesterday and its so addictive because you just want to keep playing and get to the next level.  If you enjoy solving puzzles and playing games with clues, than this is the gAme for you.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I OWN THE WHOLE SERIES THUS FAR AND TILL THIS DAY IT CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SERIES ON TV! TRULY GOOD STORIES & A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. THE BEST PART IS THE CONSTANT VARIETY IN EACH EPISODE SAM & DEAN ARE THE BEST IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD!
B007SGM084|5.0|Found myself reading all the time and it was such a great read which made it hard to put down.
0738212415|3.0|So a while ago I received this book expecting something that would teach me how to legitimately draw in 30 days.  It certainly helped me draw, but not really improve.  All of the things in this book I know how to do.  One other complaint is that there is almost no realistic drawing tutorials.  It is most all cartoony lessons on how to create things using geometric shapes. This is useful to an extent, but when you want to become a realistic artist like myself, learning how to be a cartoonist just doesn't help.  Overall, this is a good book, but pretty much only if you have just started out.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Very easy to use and very useful as well specially with the pdf files...highly recommended, got it for free but even tho i would've paid for it
B000W93CHC|5.0|Any person having a passion for historical fiction will fall in love with this novel. Passion for greatness among loathing and hatred are blended and gathered here. A must read, gets a full five stars for keeping my interest all 1000 plus pages!
B004M3H17Q|5.0|I just love his music. I own almost all of his albums. He's a awesome singer. I give this a 5 star just because I love his music.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|What a truly intriguing book. I was reluctant to read it as it isn't my favoured genre, but wow, so glad I did.
B005OUDDK0|5.0|I just love his music. I own almost all of his albums. He's a awesome singer. I give this a 5 star just because I love his music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game and is different. than anything else I've played. I am looking forward to more levels.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie was very good. Played instantly. Its not one of my normal picks but it was interesting to watch. Good pick.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am mesmerized with this program and all the characters. I cried when Sybil died and am holding my breath regarding Matthew. Anxiously waiting for the next Season....hurry!
B0097S0TM0|5.0|When I hear an unfamiliar song on the radio and immediately love it, more often than not Pink is somehow involved.  Great voice, real stories, amazing artist.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This books was laugh out loud funny the whole way through. I couldn't put it down unit I was done. Clive the cat was enough to keep you going.
1451638450|5.0|Bujold's characterization, storytelling, and world building give Ivan the story he deserves.  Her Vorkosigan Saga stories fit together into a wonderful whole that remind me of everything I love best about science fiction.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is one of the best stories of the decade.  I highly recommend this and the movie. Ang Lee is awesome in his ability to tell any story.<br /><br />This is definitely worth the read and view.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Pretty good book. I'm not quite sure what he means with the dates on each chapter, tho... did. Pete sleep for a few years then wake up?
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Understated lines and great chemistry among the lead players makes for a great escape from reality... yet having some touches of compassion too.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Entertaining show, good acting and good variety of stories. Lead character is not always likeable. She's almost too perfect. Good ensemble cast.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play while listening to the news, a boring movie or to pass the time whilst I waite for the love of my life to call me. Burt Reynolds is the only man that can save me from &quot;solitary solitaire&quot;.  Doors unlocked!
B004NSURT4|1.0|This is a review of the book as a digital product and probably doesn't even deserve one star. Firstly this edition has no active table of contents. Secondly the spacing between paragraphs and sentences is very unusual which is visually distracting. But the most annoying thing is the constant typographical errors page after page that really interfer with reading. Here's a small taste of what you can expect:<br /><br />\\"Like apostates who feared to bum the Cross..\\"<br /><br />\\"Peter went over tQ it....<br /><br />\\"Kiever saw that he was stifi very angry.\\"<br /><br />\\"You'd better see a doctor too. AbOUt that fever.\\"<br /><br />\\"He put on the hail (hall) light\\"<br /><br />\\"Then he looked up at Leaxnas..\\" (Leamus)<br /><br />These typos are very frequent and very distracting. How much effort does it take to proof read a book when you are charging customers $10.00 to buy your product? Be careful about the edition you buy; definitely download a sample first.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|An oldie, but goodie.  Though it was pretty predictable, it was probably ahead of its time.  Great cast, great action.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is really a great time passer. My grand kids love it. I have gotten my CO workers playing it as well.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I must say that I am tremendously disappointed in the lazy and pathetic ending to a much beloved series.<br /><br />Ms. Harris disappoints on so many levels in this last book.  She should almost be held captive, ala Stephen King's Misery, and forced to do a rewrite of the ending.  At very least, she should offer her loyal fans their money back for the garbage of an ending that she handed out.  (Though book 11 and 12 were pretty weak, too)<br /><br />Ms. Harris writes this book in a POV that none of the other books have been written in.  It makes one feel as if this was written by someone completely different.<br /><br />She hastely gathers each of Sookies former flames for a quick and unfilling cameo appearance.  I guess this is her way hurrying us through for a quick goodbye to them.<br /><br />Eric, the character that she has made the bulk of her fans grow to love and have an invested interest in, gets hardly any time in this novel.  The time he does get is devoted to debasing the  very character that she has developed him into.  Instead of the strong and fierce love interest of Sookie, he fizzles into the thin air like a balloon that has had its air let out.  He has become a spineless, pathetic jerk with NO redeaming qualities.  I do not know why Ms. Harris has spent so much time developing the Sookie and Eric storyline only to mutilate the very relationship that has earned her the faithful following and her fortune.  I am truly SHOCKED that she is shocked at the reaction of her fans!  Could she be that obtuse?<br /><br />The Sookie / Sam love relationship is extremely underdeveloped and seems to be whipped together in the midnight hour just to tie the series up in a bow (but NONE of her fan base is happy with the packaging)!  The only logical explaination for Sookie and Sam being thrown together so hastily is to give us the notion the Sookie can eventually complete herself in our minds future by being able to have children which she couldn't have done with a vamp.<br /><br />Yes, Ms. Harris, it is your books to write as you please but, you have led your fans on, building a storyline, and expectations, only to do an abrupt about face at the midnight hour with no real development of your desired end relationship for your protagonist.  Shame on you for you sloppy ending and for the highway robbery of you fan following.  I wish I chose a different author to waste my money on.
0618680004|1.0|I was very interested on reading this book BUT, on reading I soon discovered it said to much about God as in existence. If I were writing this book I would do in 3 pages.<br />Page 1 `Is there a God?`<br />Page 2 `NO!`<br />Page 3 `The End`
B00DHNBY02|1.0|This movie is Evil Dead in name only.  There are no scary scenes, no comedy, no originality.  Bruce Campbell is still the King.  This movie didnt even get close. Im normally pretty accepting of remakes and reimaginings, but theres nothing of merit here.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|I've read and have had to create many a 'Gallup action plan' for increasing engagement with staff. Pink does a great job of breaking down the evolution of motivational theory taught by social scientists and economists. The business place and management have been slow to understand intrinsic value. This book will help readers understand what they need to know about their employees in order to help them find the 'right seat on the bus'.
0061122416|3.0|was a pretty good book with nice features and amazing plot a real journey novel for all ages young to old
B006O6F932|5.0|the quality of these toys is always good, my daughters are fanatical in this collection and the price is very affordable
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. It really makes you think. I wish there was a hint or clue for when you get stuck.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Continued intrigue with characters and storyline, the fifth season doesn't disappoint.  Love the entire series, exciting to see this angle of story of King Arthur and Merlin.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|One of my favorite 80's films, full of teenage drama. A classic film for anyone who enjoys John Hughes films.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Barbara and Seth do a great job I this movie.....So funny....I could imagine what it would be like to do on a road trip with my son....
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love this game. It is one of my favorites. I can play it over and over again. You should really try this game out.
B005LAII1C|5.0|My husband and I love this movie, we laugh the entire way through, but this is definitely and adult movie.
B009Y6231U|5.0|Kurt Russell, the best tough guy around.  Not Arnold, Sylvester, or Bruce.  Kurt has that menaceing look that shows you he means business every time he shows up for work.  Every part of this movie is crucial and exciting so no spoilers.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|It's not Citizen Kane but I was entertained. The actors were cast well and it gave fans of the original Wizard of Oz some meat and potatoes in regards to the characters from the 1939 classic.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game has some rough challenges in it. The game earns a five star rating overall. The reason why this game deserves a five star rating is because The game play is good,you can name give a funny name for your disease, last you have to work hard to evolve your disease.
B004GXL2J0|4.0|My friend retired last month. He fell out of a tree while trimming a couple years ago, so I found a nice little branch (tree) to place the chainsaw guy in, placing him to look as if he was sawing off the branch he was sittings on.  Embarrassed my retired friend very well.  Great product!
0446672653|4.0|Not as good as Many Lives, Many Masters but worthwhile.  Definitely would read the other book first.  Not totally a requirement, but I think it makes it more understandable.  Doctor Weiss makes his books easy to read and understand.  I will probably get another one to read.  The whole concept is fascinating.
B00BP4X3W2|1.0|This movie is actually great.  I wanted to share this with my older boys who have some interest in the Nazi's.  I feel everyone should see this film.  Unfortunaely there was something wrong with streaming from Amazon that day apparently and we weren't able to complete more than an hour of the film.  Even then it dealt us long periods of buffering every minute or so that wasn't improved by switching my WII connection from wireless to hardwired.  Will be asking for a refund when I get around to it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I think this is even better than Follett's Fall of Giants or Pillars of the Earth (both were very good).
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Jane Austen's stories are timeless in their portrayal of personalities and relationships.  Emma is great book and this video does a superb job of staying true to the story.  Loved it.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I enjoyed reading every word in this book. I was so glued to the story that  I missed my train stop and a good night sleep a couple of times.<br />You are a literal genius.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Take my word for this.. this book was amazing! I would tell you about the book but I would rather not because I erm will give spoilers.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|This is a great game with great visuals and smooth gameplay on my Kindle Fire. I got  Chimpact for my nephew  but got hooked myself!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This case is good protection for the Kindle Fire, and I like the way it can be propped up to make it easier to view.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My 4 month old's feet can't touch the floor yet, even at the lowest height setting, but she loves the Jumperoo! She's jumping, smiling, and squealing whenever I put her in the Jumperoo. For one week now, the batteries are still running well and baby is still happy. Great activity to keep baby entertained, especially when you have things to do around the house!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Really fun way to pass the time. Galaga type game with cool power-ups and good sound effects. Plus it is free
B004HWYTP4|5.0|RED is a great combination of a CIA spy movie and a comedic flick.  Ex-CIA agents fighting for their lives in this movie as they come back together and awaken their friendships provides a great, funny, and decently action-packed movie to entertain a wide variety of tastes.  I personally greatly enjoy this movie and plan on seeing RED 2 when it comes out if only for the characters...but I hope the plot is good too.  I would highly recommend this movie to all audiences that it is rated for.  The violence is not overbearing by any means and the language is minimal.<br /><br />Excellent movie.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Easy to see on my Axiom. Controls work as they should. I would recommend this to a friend. ok great.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Must have. I i have enjoyed it several times and my grand daughter has used it for her thor, captain america, ironman marathon movie nights with her friends.<br /><br />Great movie. Highly recommend
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Very cute and fun side scrolling platformer. Not really my type of game but I can see the quality work the makers put into it
1579128149|5.0|This book is bursting with facts and information that I never got in chemistry classes. This and the book Elements Vault have many insights into the elements that are totally overlooked in most chemistry curriculums. Highly recommend for anyone with a curiosity about our world and what we are made of
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I really liked the follow the prompt type of play, it makes me think I can actually play a bit
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is the Ultimate collection of Hideo Kojima's masterpieces. Love this series and recommend it to everybody. Five stars all the way.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|My favorite album since &#34;Odin on our side&#34;. If your a fan of Amon Amarth do not pass this album up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I BEGGED my dad for this game. ITS MORE FUN THAN IT LOOKS.  If you need to know the cart gun does not kill you, it just makes it hard to see for 2 seconds.
B004X75RK4|4.0|It's a pretty clean movie overall, and Reynolds and Bullock do a good job in their roles.  A pretty fun, romantic movie when you're in the mood for that sort of thing.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Orphan Black is by far one of the best shows of this year. The concept of it was so creative and amazing, and the way they show it makes it even better. The actors, or actor as the main character plays all the other clones, is the full package. I wish the second season would come sooner and not in Spring 2014, but hey, if the second season will be as good as the first, take your time. There are twists on every turn of the show, and there is always something, but the solution to the problem is always great. I highly suggest watching this show, especially to all Sci-Fi/Drama lovers.
B008Y73940|4.0|Matthew's performance was very earthy...I kept seeing Paul Newman. The story was excellent--not too gory--suspenseful. I liked this lawyer, character defects and all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book kept me gripped, even with the bouncing around that Mark did. I felt that he did a great service to the SEALS by keeping it exciting without giving away any details of their tactics.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is great to play!  It is easy and will keep you entertained for a short or a long while.  Glad I got it.  Found out about from a guy I was sitting next to on the plane.  Great time killer.
B001GXF2YY|1.0|Plot shifts, and exciting, interesting prose. The locales are Los Angeles , and the characters are all interesting. Connelly just keeps on going.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Great thinking by Orson Scott, love the story and the characters too !<br />A must read book , I'm glad I had the chance of reading it and will recommend to my friends to do so too.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I found  in this writing an insight into WWII that was totally new to me. This insight was especially interesting from the German's side. My father was a bombardier/navigator in a B-17 with the 384th Bombardment Group. He few 17 missions up the Rhein before he was wounded. From a History Channel program I learned that 75% of the men who flew these missions would eventually not come home. Dad did make it home more or less in one piece both physically and mentally. He never talked about it much. Dad would stretch out in his recliner every night after his closed our small grocery store and sometimes when he would nod off and grunt and groan in his sleep. My guess he was flying those missions all over again. Once when a service member friend of his who also had survived these missions came to visit I got a little insight into what they had endured but it was nothing like the insight from this writing. I did learn that the condition of Dad's plane on that last mission was apparently not unlike that of the B-17 in the story.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I wanted someway to send as well as receive emails on my Kindle Fire. This has worked flawlessly for me. I recommend it .
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I just finished this book.  Really unique way of telling the story.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read something that isn't cookie-cutter in it's presentation.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app does exactly what I need, different timers that don't require a lot of setup to change.  Works great when grilling different food at the same time.
0425266060|5.0|I haven't started reading these yet.  This weekend.  My daughter got them and said it is just as good as 50 shades, so I ordered it also as I LOVED those books.  I was surprised they said it would be here in a week and I got it two days later :-)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is awesome.Love all the sharks. but my favorite one is the biggest flesh eating shark to ever live. the megalodon.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I chose this rating because of the story line, quality of actors/actresses, and I love the way the lives of the servants appear separate from the family but actually they are all connected in some way. I have actually learned a great deal! I would highly recommend it to all!
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Purchased for girlfriend. She loved it! Great gift in addition to NASA merchandise. No complaints, all pieces accounted for, visually appealing product packaging as well as finished lego model.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|II loved the cast, decent plot, just the right amount of humor, nice action.  Bruce still has it and I just don't see him losing it any time soon!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|What another great book. Every time I read another book, I can't wait to get to the next one! Good, great, stupendous!
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I'm a Trek fan, from the initial series with Shatner to Enterprise and Deep Space Nine and all of the movies.  It was kind of fun to have a prequel and see the younger versions of some of my favorite characters.  I'm looking forward to more!
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app I get to listen to my favorite stations and get to explore the Internet and use my apps and I get to listen to music while doing that yay I love it!! I recommend everyone who has a kindle!! :)
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It did not help me at all, not user friendly. I do not recommend this.<br />Not sure what is helps with.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It rocks but I wish I was like minecraft on Xbox or on the computer I love it make a another game like it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|cant get enough! I never thought i would be so into zombies.  who would of thought.  Super awesome show! I love it
B0012GMVVW|5.0|Like David Bowie in so many ways, this CD is a combination of iconoclastic, masterful musicianship, ambient sounds, and what I suspect is a heavy dose of introspection. Even<br />though this was a work put out in 2002, the similarities in terms of feeling and the production light and shade which Bowie produced in his 2013 release are, in my opinion,<br />very evident. This is not in any way to say that the two albums are derivative, or even that the amazingly thoughtful work, in both heathen and the later release, are<br />musically connected, simply that the path and the force behind what has been done in the heathen is extremely evident. The opening track Sunday and the final track heathen,<br />have an ambient element that is woven with a powerful rock work in the 12 songs. Whilst, as usual, I enjoy the light as well as the shade in the construction of the vocals,<br />the guitar, the keyboards, and other elements in the compositions. I was slightly surprised to see that track six was a Neil Young composition, but Bowie's treatment of Neil<br />Young's work is as usual, masterful. The original CD release still has the CD extra bonus content, and since it is a multi session CD, at this time I cannot get to what I<br />think is a video. Looking at the CD front cover and the booklet, as well as the back slip, with credits, I can only suppose, and this is guessing on my part, that an element<br />of deconstruction is implied: however, this kind of meaning is in the eye of the beholder, and so I think is more appropriate to say that this is got some great packaging and<br />some extremely thoughtful design. All in all, for the price I paid for this, it is more than a bargain, and David Bowie fan or not, if you appreciate music, as well as fine<br />musicianship, then I think this CD will be an excellent buy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Best app EVER!! My absolute favorite!! I play to relax my body and stimulate my mind!! I'm glad I found it!!
1619695006|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I loved the Harry Potter books. I have read and re-read them many times. My wife cried when Dumbledore died. The Seven Harry books are filled with the things that make books great: character, plot, story, etc.. I wish that JK would keep writing them, I would buy them. That being said, I had high hopes for this book. (I never felt that Harry Potter was a \\"children's\\" book. There are many adult themes and topics, not the least of which is the death of a beloved central character, Dumbledore, and the death of many secondary beloved characters in the final book.) Sadly, this book is awful. It has no redeeming qualties. Don't waste your money. What makes this especially sad is that this is an author who has given me hours and hours of joy. I wish I had liked this book. I wanted to like this book. I hated this book! Re-read any of the HP books instead. I have not given up on JK tho. I intend to buy her latest detective novel. I hope I like it, I want to like it.<br />Regarding folks comparing this book to \\"1984\\" and \\"Great Expectations,\\" my first response is \\"are you kidding?\\" Those are great literature, this doesn't come close. Those books are classics which means you read them again and again and each time get something more from them... How many of those who \\"love\\" CV plan to re-read it?
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's nice to be able to revisit MTG so many years after I gave up the cards. Enjoying the game fully!
B00CFYD682|1.0|I was looking forward to this due to the reviews I have seen so far. Epic fail. The album only comes slightly alive on the upbeat tracks...the ballads are like funereal marches. Alison is in great vocal form as usual, but it's really been a downward spiral since the first two albums songs wise. And it's not because she records \\"uncommercial\\" material. She just chooses a lot of songs that sound flat and have the life sucked out of them. Time to put on \\"The Singles\\" and the two recorded with Vince to remind myself why I loved her so much in the first place.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read a ton of negative reviews and I agree it was cheesy at times, it lacked character development and a few other annoyances (clear fact: in the US, we &#34;take&#34; a shower or a bath we do not &#34;have&#34; them). But all of that mostly forgiven with the story being told. It was sweet and shocking yet only pushes the envelope a little. I will re-read this one before I advance to book 2 as my first read was in the wee hours if the morning when I should have been asleep, but I could not put the thing down. So much so I only got 2 hours of sleep and then snuck as much of it at work as I could the next day.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best escaping game ever! Little kids would love it and it is so addicting it is AWESOME! I love
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I ordered this DVD after going to the theatre to watch Judi Dench.  I then ordered a copy to be sent to my mother.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Loved it from beginning to end!  Hurry up and write another novel.  His books seem so true to life in everyway
0544002318|5.0|I like this book because he really lets you feel like you share something in common with him, a man that runs over 100 miles in one race, even if you can only run 3 miles. Nice read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game. You want to hit the play button over and over!<br />I recommend it and I suggest you don't buy extra coins. You'll earn them fast enough. Great game enjoy!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It's ok but nothing outstanding.  The kids all  seemed to find it too easy and used Zombies and Bad Piggies more.  The six year old liked the harder games and the three year old followed his brother.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana Krall has made another terrific record.  She jsut gets better and better.  Here are seven more words, to satisfy your requirment.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Animation fabulous...  Funny Charecters, great storyline.... My Kids and their parents loved it..  Fun for the whole family...Id watch it again tomorrow.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game... Bingo and slots plus trading with friends... So fun!!! Only problem - I have become addicted to it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a nice little game. The rooms aren't so hard to figure out that you just quit in frustration, but you need to be able to piece clues together as well. Overall, a really nice effort.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Definitley one of the best games to get on your Kindle Fire and its ADDICTIVE!:) Download Now!!!! Its really fun and easy yet challenging. Its like Temple Run but 2xs better!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Like other seasons, every episode makes you yell at the TV but keeps you guessing. Overall good but season two probably best thus far.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I think this is a great rendition of Dr. Suess' story of The Lorax.  It has a great message behind it, and is just a great movie overall.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|The story is very well written.  The dialog is very ordinary like daily conversations.  However, the movie keeps me interested and anticipating what will happen.
6305508550|5.0|Office space is a great comedy.  I find it very funny, and it is one of my husband's favorite movies.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Yea you have to pay for some stuff but it's easier to pay for it all so you can have lots if deathly fun :D
B000683VI4|5.0|I don't watch a lot of sappy love stories, but I really love the The Notebook.  I think it was well written and the actors bring the story to life.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This set does a good job of presentation of all four original Batman films<br />Putting the actual films to the side<br />the presentation is all overall a 10/10<br />Enjoyable commentaries<br />all of the bonus disc and features Were enjoyable and entertainment<br />there was no problems<br /><br />PS you are my ratings of actual movies<br /><br />Batman(1989): 7.6/10<br />Batman returns: 8.1/10<br />Batman forever: 6.2/10<br />Batman & robin: 3.4/10
B005EHQGTS|4.0|Works just how i need it. the product doesnt fit on my phone Droid Razr max but i am still able to keep all functionality.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have stayed away from puzzle games in the past but this one had me hooked. I took a chance on it due to the great reviews and I couldn't of been happier. The puzzles are very clever. None of them are too hard or too easy. The graphics are top notch and the audio is great too.<br /><br />I played this game on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it ran flawlessly. Great game and worth the two dollar's. As other reviews have noted there is a hint button when you get stuck but I would also recommend that you don't use it unless absolutely necessary.<br /><br />If you like puzzle games give this one a try. You will be glad you did.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is good for those you like to figure out puzzles and search for items.  Looking may take some patience, but items are fairly easy to manipulate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! It is one of the best apps ever! If you love pictures and all types of different categories of pictures, then this is the app for you. And it's one of the safest. You can make different boards, pins, profile picture, and make a description. And if you don't want it anymore, then just go to settings and press deactivate account. It's that simple. I love it and check it everyday! Please get Pinterest!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I recommend this to those that like to solve those mental puzzles, figure out what objects go where, and search high and low for those items you can't find :)
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like this one because it has so many different options of the layout.  Obviously, changing the layout changes the level of difficulty.  I do wish that you could choose whether or not you want to use the auto reshuffle.  Of course, you can always opt to just quit the game instead of continuing on with the reshuffle.  I don't mind losing, as I think challenging games make the win that much more enjoyable!  It's also a bit odd that the back button faces forward.  Overall though, I do recommend this game.
1476733953|5.0|I don't even remember how I came across this book, but I'm SO glad I did! Now I've read the entire silo-series, starting with Wool, and all of them have been glued to my fingers! The writing is superb, characters dynamic, action exciting, and there's a dark depth that sinks below the apocalyptic surface where the human spirit endures. And I don't mean hope, I mean tribulation. The core of our being that continuously leads us to conflict, war, division, and self-destruction. If you're looking for a fluffy, happy, sweet little Disney-twinkie-story, move along. This is the razor-blade hidden in the cupcake of doom kinda story.<br /><br />Who knows what the last installment, Dust, might bring, but hopefully not TOO much hope. So if you think humanity needs a good slap upside the head, then you'll love these dystopian apocalyptic novels ;)
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I really liked this game!  Couldn't stop playing it once I started.  I like that you could choose having a timed mode or not.  I'm not really into timed games, although I do play them sometimes.  I thought this one was worth the money.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Hi,  I never have read the book about Sempe Fido,  I have not had it on my Kindle.  I hesitate to add a book because I had a bunch of books appear as though I purchased them and I didn't.  (They did credit them.)  I requested information about the Kindle as to how to properly add books and requested a free book list to try it at first, but no luck so far.  I prefer nonfiction and/or books on military dogs, etc.<br />Thank you,  Marge
B00006CXSS|4.0|The listing is inaccurate.  It is CC for Spanish subtitles but not for the hearing impaired unless they are Spanish speaking.  I wasted my money
1935670913|4.0|Very informative. John Locke presents tactics for e-publishing I never knew existed. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to better their e-book sales. Thumbs up, John!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever!  Beautifully done.  Entertaining.  Glorious music.  Funny.  Poignant.  What more could you want?<br />I want to live there!

B00CFA225Y|4.0|Story line was fine, etc.  The 3d effects were good in the previews, but not in the movey.  Hansel and Grettle were the best I have seen.

0312117337|5.0|for years I have wanted to learn how to read tarot but ALL of that memorizing of aspects that I found hard to connect with would quickly kill my attempts. NOW THIS DECK has changed that. it all makes sense with the way this is delivered. I am new to Osho so perhaps it is his sensibility that frames it in a way that I can relate to, so if you like getting feedback from cards THIS is definitely worth buying
B0064X7FVE|4.0|My Samsung Galaxy S4 is a great platform for TWC app. I get the best features of the TV shows without any repeated information. The app is easy to use. It gives me timely information and does not crowd the screen with useless data.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I really enjoyed his first two book so that after reading a praiseworthy review in the NY Times I bought the book.  This is one that I couldn't finish something usual for me.  I did like the title.

B003WE9TU8|5.0|The actual book almost has nothing to do with the film version (except perhaps for one and a half points). Takes a broader scope than most zombie books, and if such a thing existed, would be core reading in the study of zombies
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The minute I picked up this book, I had a hard time putting it down! Clary is becoming much more confident as a Shadowhunter, and Jace is even more charming and infuriating! The story dips and twists with the precision of a finely tuned ballet. The characters are so perfectly woven together, they care for each other and yet argue like young siblings. I highly recommend reading this after City of Bones, and read them close together because the stories contain so much important information, it would be difficult to remember everything if there is a large gap between books, these are wonderful and exciting stories!
B005NACYQU|5.0|heard the concept in passing and my interest was piqued. One of those books that you just consume in as little time as possible
B007R21JJK|4.0|The UD3H model has all the reliability you would hope for from Gigabyte with a price to fit your budget. The BIOS is understandable and easy to use, and the software included can actually come in handy, though I wouldn't rely on the on-disc drivers any longer than needed (I believe the VIA USB3.0 one wasn't working properly). Performance is great when combined with i5-3570k chip I bought this board to host, and it supports SLI/XFire, has 4 memory slots, and plenty of PCIe expansion slots. Comes with a few SATA cables to boot, more on that below. I haven't bothered with overclocking, but the included utilities seem to make it manageable should I choose to. Also, the board advertises itself as being ultra-durable, a feature which I have obviously been unwilling to test. But it certainly feels sturdy and I do think I let a screwdriver slip out of my hand while working on it once without inflicting any noticeable damage, so I'm satisfied thus far.<br /><br />Where the board falls short is in a few of the design choices made. For example, the SATA slots face orthogonal to the board, meaning that in some less-than-huge cases you might have difficulty attaching your SATA components to the board (the cables will get pinched between the case's front compartments and the slots). Two of the included SATA cables do feature a corner-shaped end, which would be great in this scenario... except the end is facing the wrong way, meaning you'd have to plug it in from below the board to take advantage of that feature.<br /><br />Another example of poor design concerns the fan headers. There are a total of four, three of which can be controlled by the board and one (I believe) always runs at full speed (but you can read the RPM from it, an advantage over plugging it into the power supply). However, only the first header is capable of controlling fans with voltage, while the other two require PWM fans (which aren't nearly as common). This was disappointing in itself, though I'm not sureif there was a legitimate technical reason or if this was just poor design. However, the single header which does support voltage fans is located on the side of the board facing the front of the case, near the bottom edge. As a consequence, the fan on the rear-top part of my case (which for many people is the most important fan) could not reach the header without an extension cord. I don't know why they couldn't place this fan header in a more convenient location - for example, the second fan header is placed closer to the middle of the front edge. (Oh, and just to be clear, the CPU fan header supports both PWM and 3-pin voltage-controlled fans).<br /><br />Finally, the board features absolutely no USB2.0 sockets - it does feature headers which you can use for, say, your case's sockets, but the rear panel has 6 USB3.0 sockets only (4 from the Z77 chipset, 2 VIA sockets). This can be an issue if you're running an operating system or liveCD/USB utility that doesn't have USB3.0 support, so make sure your case has a 2.0 socket or two on the front.<br /><br />Overall, I wish I could give it a 3.5 but I'll go ahead and round up for good measure. To be fair, most of the issues (minus the facing of the SATA sockets) are really specific to my preferences. I'd recommend this above all others in the $100-$150 range, with the possible exception of cooling fanatics who want better fan support.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|very good...great acting and plot; I also enjoyed the book.  Loved the shots of Philadelphia and its suburbs. Helped to understand mental illness.
B00018TI5E|5.0|This album was created with intent to be crisp, clear and as perfect as possible because of criticism revolving around his first three releases, mainly To Record Water. You will feel some RHCP in this album - Chad Smith on Drums, Flea on base for one song, and Josh Klinghoffer plays rhythm guitar but it is 100% John's sound. A few listens and this should be one of your favorite albums to listen to on a nice summer evening laying out on your lawn and staring at the stars. The album is also a nice lead up to the next five solo albums: The Will To Death, Inside of Emptiness, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence, DC EP and Curtains. You are not going to find many long drawn out solos listening to John's solo career. Its more about how the sound shapes your thoughts and alters your preception and the feeling the music gives you. You want solos then buy RHCP Live in Hyde Park, otherwise if you are trying for more of the RHCP style, then you may want to stay away from John's solo stuff.....no forget that, try it. If you can understand where he is coming from with his sounds then you are sure to love it. Again, this album is a great way to start if you are first picking up on John's solo music.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is better than Temple Run, with fun missions, cool gadgets, and challenges that never get boring. If you like Minions, then you will love this game!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The show was interesting but did not have a real plot.  To many unrealistic stunts.  Show looked like it was put together with make believe stunts then added script to fill in between stunt.  And people that should die stay alive with out any real problems.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Mercifully, this movie has more wonderfully entertaining lines than the aforementioned false note.  As a demonstration of clever English actors, writers, filmmakers, etc. they've managed to make the 70s and a very We, English type of story interesting to a nonBrit (me!).  The casting is great and the movie is much prettier than the 70s while never deviating from pounding the era home in every scene.  I've enjoyed watching this film repeatedly on cable as I realize that this isn't mole vs. mole but Allies vs. traitor.  You will have to decide what this movie is REALLY about.  Do you believe all that stuff about Karla given Smiley's contradictory behavior.  And what's up with the relationship between Prideaux and Young Roach?<br /><br />Hint:  Smiley's lighter vs.  Noomi Rapace's father's cross in [[ASIN:B009AJD5E0 Prometheus]]
B000FC146C|5.0|I have read this book four or five times over the years because each time I find it hauntingly beautiful. It is a truly enjoyable read and one of my favorite books of all time.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|As I was reading this I kept thinking about the game Fallout and the people left behind in the bunker. In a way this is that untold story.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Perhaps being the target audience of &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; already made the soundtrack score an easy sell for me, but that doesn't change how exceptional this music is. The main theme has a hard rock vibe that will keep your foot tapping or fuel a good workout! One can channel the monster-fighting heroics of the film with a simple toggle of the iPod, which you can be sure I will be doing again and again. Ramin Djawadi's score is unique and refreshing but overall compliments the film with it's BIGNESS. But this should be no surprise coming from the same talent responsible for scoring &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;, which brilliantly describes several different lands and character themes. Djawadi's &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; score is a natural progression from series to film, bringing together many flavors into one big robot and monster filled pot!

0140557741|5.0|This book is fascinating!  It's great to see a picture book grab your attention and tell the story from one page to another.  Zoom's pictures tell the story from a small story turned into a larger one.  This book really showed me how you can go into fine detail of a story without any words.  My college English teacher took the pictures out of this book and had us put them back in order just by looking at the pictures.  It was a great way to introduce the power of a Picture book and showed the many things they can teach.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This movie rocked my world.  It was hilarious yet moving.  The acting was phenomenal.  I couldn't recommend this movie more. I will watch it over and over again.

0870703781|3.0|I got this book to see if I could understand why Eggleston gets such high praise.  I can't really say that I do - yet.  Put this down as me not being smart enough if you will, but I'm more than happy with many other current and past photographers.  Many of Eggleston's pictures look like he is trying out a wide angle lens for the first time, or had nothing to do that day – how else to explain a straight picture of the oven with the door open?  Or somebody standing in the middle of the road?  Perhaps he may be one of those photographers whose work only makes sense when you see full sized prints; the picture on the cover 'Memphis Tricycle' has sold in various forms for hundreds of thousands of dollars a print.  So I'll try to hold an open mind for now.

B00DYEN6XC|5.0|This is my first review so I will keep it short and try not to give a long winded review that gives you vertigo...<br /><br />First off, I am a fan of Zach Snyder, at least I have been since 300 and Watchmen, so I was happy to hear he would helm this movie, which from the point of its conception would forever be linked and compared to all previous Superman movies including the classic Reeve era Superman Movies and the quite frankly disappointing Superman Returns. Now Christopher Nolan produced and co-wrote this movie with David S Goyer, who wrote The Dark Knight Trilogy which was directed by Nolan, if your a fan of The Dark Knight trilogy you wouldn't have passed up a chance to see this then would you? However even if Christian Bale seems to scrawny in your eyes compared to the conventional Batman physique or his take on how Batman should sound (less Kevin Conroy deepness and more dog getting sick), it shouldn't deter you from enjoying this movie which seems a little Dark Knight esque(realistic) but has heavy fantasy elements woven in<br /><br />To The Movie:<br /><br />The plot itself is fairly straight in terms of Superman vs Bad guy, in this iteration General Zod. The opening scenes of the movie are very heavy on the special effects which these days make you think ''that scene, was it filmed on Krypton'', you know if your gullable and/or an idiot or crazy. In my opinion the Krypton scenes give you a taste of the scale of the movies which prepares you for later on when the scale is shoved down your throat, in a good way sort of. We get to experience Krypton's end, Kal-El's(Superman) birth, Jor-El and Lara-El's (Supermans Birth Parents) race to save their son. Not from Krypton's end as you would think but from Zod and his hunt for 'The Codex' which serves as a plot device for the opening scenes and ultimately the movie. The emotional essence of these scenes allow the viewer to get invested in the characters and gives you a sense of the sacrifice some make for others and for what is morally right.<br />  At several points in this movie, it strays back and forth to the past, and present time to tell the story of Kal El on Earth, as a child, as a man trying to find his place and his struggle with his heritage as The Last Son of Krypton, although sometimes this format may slow the movie or confuse some, I think it was handled well and doesn't cause discomfort or kill the pace. Kal-El is forced from exile and the shadows when Zod, after being trapped in The Phantom Zone (Kryptonion prison) escapes and sets out to retrieve the codex from Kal-El's transport ship which brought him to Earth. Introducing himself to the conscious of his Father aboard a scout ship Kal-El transforms into Superman by donning his iconic Suit/Armor which has been kept on a scout ship in the arctic (plot-hole anyone?), setting out to save the day and become, at his father's request Earth's savior and Kryptons last hope. However Zod the ever present obstacle of the House of El stands in his way, ever a formidable enemy to superman who is played by very talented actor(Michael Shannon 'Premium Rush','The Iceman',Boardwalk Empire'). While Lois Lane and Martha/Johnathan Kent(Kal-Els adoptive parents), serves as a grounding for Superman to his Earth/Human heritage, not all of Humanity is accepting of Superman and so after many run-ins with the Military and the scared defensive nature of human kind there is room for Superman to earn his place among Humans and become Earths Mightiest hero(yes I went there), by rising to protect all that Superman stands for, Freedom, Justice and Hope to which he wears proudly on his chest.<br /><br />Soon after the movies intro and the characters are established and the plot is fleshed out with heavy reliance on comic book heritage and fresh takes on Supermans mythology. The movies explodes with action and consequences that satisfy your lust for explosions, carnage, carnage and lots more carnage and once the dust settles will leave you feeling shaken and disorientated, soon after it will shake,shock and throw you in the air again right until the end credits.<br />  The ending of the movies, rest assured does give a degree of closure and will also leave you wanting more, but that's for you to decide. I found an enjoyable movie in 'Man of Steel' as I am a long time Superman Fan and was not disappointed with what I saw. Regardless I recommend you see it if you have not already.<br /><br />The Actors/Acting<br /><br />Henry Cavill: SUPERMAN/KAL-EL: A very convincing Superman. Superb acting with really intense emotion displayed by someone who clearly has the acting chops to reign in this kind of role with poise and if I may say perfection. I'm not going to say better/worse that reeve because this isn't a comparison but a damn good Superman.<br /><br />Amy Adams: LOIS LANE: Not my first choice for Lois, but a terrific actress with enough heavy duty roles under her belt to command enough respect in this role and who plays it a little loose if not relaxed and therefore never really fits into the role but manages to pull it all together where it counts.<br /><br />Michael Shannon: GENERAL ZOD: Just a great actor who really brings the heat to a psychotic villain that while doesn't so much terrify you but gets the movie racing and provides some darkness and quite a large obstacle for our hero to overcome, an antagonist if there ever was one<br /><br />Antje Traue: FOARA-UL: Our secondary antagonist and Zod's right hand man(so to speak, all right fine 'right hand woman') who is played by someone who is unknown to most but so very clearly talented. A truly badass chick who really shines in this movie. Very intense<br /><br />Russell Crowe: JOR EL: Played very well by Crowe and the right choice for this role in my opinion, Shows true compassion and intense emotions, exempt when he's a machine/mind interface, then it weird<br /><br />Kevin Costner: JOHNATHAN KENT: A great role for Costner who delivers greatness to this role, his acting breathes life into a very important part of Supermans life and journey as well as the overall emotional tone of the movie<br /><br />Diane Lane: MARTHA KENT: A woman who needs no praise and deserves no less in my book, plays her character well who acts as Supermans anchor to is Human side<br /><br />Many other cast members in this movie deserve praise for their acting ability and their character portrayal's who under Snyder's direction shine in their respective roles.<br /><br />With Snyder's Direction and Nolan's Influence and writing this movie sticks to a proven method of Superhero Entertainment on par with Batman and Marvels iterations,  it raises the bar in scale and storytelling that gives comic book fans hope for future movies from the DC lineup like Wonder Woman and Flash, while sticking to proven methods for bringing the genre to a wider audience. A good fun movie that's enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining  9.5/10<br /><br />Buy from Amazon: [[ASIN:B008JFUPFI Man of Steel (Two-Disc Special Edition DVD + UltraViolet)]][[ASIN:B008JFUPK8 Man of Steel (Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet Combo Pack)]][[ASIN:B00DYEN6XC Man of Steel Collectible Figurines Gift Set (Blu-ray + DVD + Ultra Violet Combo)]]<br /><br />That was short right? :)

Another INCREDIBLE Album YES ALBUM not just a few songs every single song is BAD A** I GUARANTEED you AGREE 110%! Balls to the Wall amazingly awesome Metal / Rock with a PUNCH to the Face!!
030758836X|2.0|I have to agree with other reviewers.  I couldn't wait to get to the end to see how this whole situation would be resolved.  No spoilers here -- just save your time and money.  The ending is a total disappointment.  I felt the author didn't know how to end the novel and it just --ended.  I cannot recommend this work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|YES & Very AWESOME Challenging Game HOURS of Fun! I would recommend this to ANYONE! Hours of fun to the point I go cross eyed!!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Connelly is one of those writers that hook you with the characters. I am more fo a Bosch fan then a Haller, but all the books I have read by Connelly are a great read.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Having heard so much about the series on television I was excited to begin the book.  I was not disappointed and have been intrigued by the many levels of characterisation and involved plots that make up this book. I am looking forward to having time to get to the next one.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Connelly is one of those writers that hook you with the characters. I am more of a Bosch fan then a Haller fan but all the books I have read by Connelly are a great read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this was the 3rd in a 3 book series, and was a little disappointed that I have to wait for another one to be published. I wanted the story to end with this book. I love the series.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Connelly is one of those writers that hook you with the characters. I am more fo a Bosch fan then a Haller, but all the books I have read by Connelly are a great read.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is one of the most realistic gun apps out there and for only 99 cents I'd recommend it to anyone who would be interested in getting a gun app or World war 2 weaponry
B004P8JPS6|5.0|What can I say. I got hooked on the Reacher books and have read them all. I now wait every year for the new one to come out. Have yet to be disappointed
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Okay so I got this game like 2 or 3 weeks ago. One afternoon my brother was playing the game he was right in the middle of a run with the baby minion costume I. The outside scenery and the game just stopped and froze and it was stuck making that annoying beeping and horns of the cars sound and whenever I turned on my kindle it wouldn't turn on or anything it was shut down and I tried everything including charging it and a lot of other things for about a week. Now I'm sooo mad!! Though now my kindle works.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|What can I say. I got hooked on the Reacher books and have read them all. I now wait every year for the new one to come out. While not one of the best Reacher Books it keeps your attention. Have yet to be disappointed
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I've been playing this game for 5 hours straight. It's a fun game, but it also freezes at points. Over all, you'll get addicted...like me...Help me pls.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I got hooked on the Flynn series and have read all his books. He is one of those authors that I anxiously await his new book every year.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I recently discovered the TV show &#34;Castle&#34; and am absolutely hooked on it. Every episode is creative and keeps you guessing &#34;who dunnit&#34; till the end of the show. I love that! It's worth it to pay for streaming rather than waiting for the reruns on TNT. You can download it in HD and stream it on your computer or, if you have a Blu-Ray player, you can stream it to your TV using Google TV. I love the technology and I especially love &#34;Castle&#34;!

B002RI9PKO|4.0|The books starts great very intersting, but as you go through the book you start missing interest. It could have been a great book if it where shorter
B00932A4XE|4.0|Good cast. Decent plot. Better than I expected. I think it's better if you are a parent especially with young children.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Just give it about 20 to 30 years and if there is no correction in morality we will see this day.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I rated it this because it is a stargate series and it links to SG-1 and it is independent of SG-1. What i loved about the show was that it did not copy SG-1 but if fact made it more difficult for them to deal with their situation, where as SG-1 was still on Earth. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who is a SciFi fan and enjoyed Stargate SG-1.
0803729227|5.0|Another one of my absolute favorite.  I love a good rhyming book with great content.  A story about true heroism and friendship and such cute illustrations!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|A truly great introduction to a complicated but unforgettable character who the reader will feel a bond as Harry solves not only a murder but his own inner demon. Harry Hole is the modern day Sherlock Holmes.
0385340990|5.0|The subject matter is intense but the way it's written makes it light enough to make it a great summer read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I found the game fun yet pretty simple. Worth trying. Wish the game play went faster. Graphics look good and you can choose from different horses and tack.
B00CO8TBR4|5.0|On around star one you get the flashy, shiny kind of thing, and you know how bad that can get. All but then there is number 2 and three coming just back to back and then a back and forth. That fourth star you know you are going to love it because you can see that little light in the bottom of the fifth star, when it knows it is going to light up but is thinking it is hiding it just then.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Did you like the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo? Then you'll love this book as well! With twists and turns through tout the book, that takes place in chilly Oslo, this is a great summer read!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Sons of anarchy is an addicting show after just watching one epesiod you just have to keep going with the rest of them. You can't just stop with one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game. It is really addicting. The games are Fun and the competitions are very easy and cool. Really get this game and play it. I really love it!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is fun and funny if you like breaking your neck and having your car flip in the air and bounce all over the road never knowing how it is going to land on the ground. I think I have set a record for the most broken necks!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was wonderful! It had me hooked from the first chapter.  We read the book for book club and we all really liked it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book<br />I loved how the narrators in the story kept changing<br />I will definitely read it again sometime!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being a fellow pinner now. If I need something fixed, an an workout, craft ideas, or even ways to save money I can use this app. There are dozens of other cute things just to look at but Pinterest is an addicting app of everything with so many helpful links.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Michael Giacchino hits another home run with this soundtrack!<br /><br />While his choice of titles are sometimes eye-rolling (Brigadoom, Buying The Space Farm), it doesn't take away from the awesome music!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is so nice to have the 5ft cable so I can sit in a chair and use my Kindle while it is charging.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I am a self professed Mahjong addict and All-in-One Mahjong has already provided me with hours of entertainment at varying levels of difficulty. This is a great game!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|My child knows not to select apps when she is on my Kindle but she did not know or realize that clicking something in the PRETEND STORE in her Littlest Pet Shop game app would actually charge my credit cart. She is 6 years old and since she knows not to select apps I do not have the Kindle set up for a password to 1-click purchases. I am just so mad that they would target young children (b/c this is the age group to play this game) to make purchases on their parents accounts. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HER $5 IN GAME PURCHASE WAS FOR!!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I expected to like this new CD.......I love it ! Darius Rucker just keeps getting better! Buy it, share it and recommend it !
B000001ESF|5.0|2 thumbs up!  very good sound quality. and one of my favorate alblums of all time. Amust have for any Rush fan
193700788X|3.0|I was waiting for this book with great curiosity, anxious to see how this wonderful story would have been evolved and ended. The end was pretty obvious from the end of the twelfth book, but I really enjoyed reading it. I'be been hoping until the end to read a different end but that was the only possible solution at the very end.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Great for the serious Rush fan. This laid the pavement for alot of bands that proceeded them. my favorate when it came out when  I was a teen.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Have really enjoyed reading the book. It was a little hard to stay with at first. I did enjoy the movie.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|It's hard to pick a favorite track on this album, it's all so great.  \\"All the time in the world\\" is def one of them.  But hey, I'm not going to go on disecting each song...you may have another favorite:)  But I will say this: if you are a Deep Purple fan...I really think you'd give this album 5 stars.  It's kind of turned into my \\"summer soundtrack\\"  Some days, I'll actually listen to it twice.  I'm working outside this summer, so I have the ipod in the ol' noggin' most of the time.  I got the deluxe version for the interview dvd.  it's not 5.1 or anything like that, but if you're interested in the band...and what they have to say about the making of the album, I would certainly recommend it.  I know some couldn't care less about that type of thing...but for bands that I am a true fan of, I totally enjoy it.  It's like a \\"behind the music\\" type of thing...hey, I've gone on like a vander-drone long enough! If you like Deep Purple...buy it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is totally hilarious. I love it. And I like how you don't have to tilt your device to move your minion. Everyone should have it.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I love this thing. It was so inexpensive and yet goes perfectly with my City Mini. Holds even larger bottles of water with room to spare. Has a mesh pocket with zipper on the inside too for keys or anything important you don't want to fall out which is well thought out and a great feature. I usually have a sippy cup on one side, a water bottle on the opposite side and have plenty of space in the middle for keys, wallet and my iPhone. Because it's soft, it also folds up with no problem when you put your stroller away.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This book was exciting. It was cool. I love Robert Louis Stevenson's books. When you start reading you can never stop.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great game by G5. It was worth the download. I can't wait to see what they come out with next.
B000683VI4|5.0|I always heard about this movie and when I recently saw it on cable tv I knew I had to order it to have in my dvd library. This is a great love story movie and the chemistry between Gosling and McAdams is intoxicating. You will love it
B002L5GQGY|5.0|What can I say - this is JOE BONAMASSA!<br />What an incredible talent - just amazing.<br />Cannot get enough - he brings new meaning to<br />Whitman's, &#34;I sing the body electric&#34;!<br />Would love to see  him perform in Vermont!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I am not a country western fan but this CD has really turned my thoughts around.  &#34;Lost in You&#34; won't get out of my head.  I have played this over and over
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Great game. Easy to control and it works fine on my kindle fire. Can highly recommend it. Graphics are good, too.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love this game. It is so addicting. I can't wait for more levels to be unlocked so I can continue.
0062073486|2.0|I do not understand what the hype surrounding this book is about. I did not find the \\"plot twist\\" at the end surprising in any way. The characters were very flat and I was not attached to any of them.  However, the book was pretty well paced but did drag in several places.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|The best part of the movie was the gorgeous girl who plays the main character. Otherwise it was a poor attempt to do what John Carpenter already did, which was make the best horror film EVER made. No creature had more potential to do massive damage then the thing. Could the Alien or Chuck y or Michael  or Friday the 13th dude wipe out mankind in a few months? I do not think so, and the special effects were unbelievable even considering today. That was the most underrated movie, possibly of all time.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is a perspective changer. It truly helped me to let things go that I needed to let go and to open up to new possibilities. These are four excellent agreements to live by.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun but repetitive. You have to keep repeating the same thing over each time you die. I wish when you complete one level that is it
1878424114|5.0|This is an excellent book to help one gain perspective. I enjoyed the practical ways the author provides at the end of each chapter to put the principals into action.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This book was a fast read full of mystery and lots of twists and turns.<br />I will be reading the complete Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.
0060899220|4.0|I am a huge fan of AB and religiously watch his TV shows. He has such a fresh perspective on food and is not afraid to be himself. This book gave the whole back story of how his career got started. He is a good writer and maintains the tone he uses on the TV shows. This was a quick and fun read.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Product was good, but probably too easy for my 10 yr kid. He did it very quickly. It was my bad decision. Should have gone for some more complicated one.
B003MUOUI8|4.0|Great movie for the sake of history. Not an &#34;edge of the seat&#34; movie. It gives good insight into Nelson Mandela and what he did for South Africa.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I have had my Kindle since June 19 (one month ago) and am still unable to load email app. Instructions for \\"other provider\\" are not explained fully and, yes, I am connected to WiFi. BGR
B008B7OQHM|5.0|I mean it's slipknot, what's not to love. they make great music and this is a great album for any fan.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A great movie! Lots of action and great humor. These actors click so well that it makes it a true pleasure to view!<br />Reds 2 is even better. I saw a special promotion of it and am telling everyone -- It's a must see. I plan to see it again myself!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is by far the best free app on the market. very challenging and I recommend to people of all ages.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game. It's great for everyone. Amazing. You should get it. If you like temple run and subway suffer you should get it.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|The first two acts of this movie are...well, I don't want to say ordinary, it's too well-made for that, but although I was enjoying the film at that point, I also felt that it was a little overrated. I kept thinking, &#34;This got a Best Picture nomination? How did that happen?&#34;<br />But the third act, when they're actually putting on the ballet in front of an audience, along with everything that's going on backstage and everything that's going on inside of Nina's head, might possibly be the most beautiful thing I've seen on film in the past decade. It literally took my breath away; as the credits rolled, I suddenly realized that I had stopped breathing. I'm not sure that's ever happened to me before.<br />So it's a good movie, elevated to greatness by a tremendous final act, and that's good enough to place it at #7 on my personal list of the Best Films of the 21st Century. Definitely, definitely worth owning.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead is one of the most fun and enjoyable books I've read in a long time.<br />If I had had the time to read it in one sitting, I would have.  When I had to put it down, I found myself looking forward to picking it up again, anticipation for a special treat.<br /><br />The plot focuses on three well-heeled ladies who live in an exclusive neighborhood in Savannah, Georgia, and who regularly meet each afternoon in the neighborhood park for the purpose of letting their dogs play.  In reality the ladies meet to sip their favorite cocktails concealed in plastic cups while they gossip about their neighbors.<br /><br />Duncan Whitehead has distilled the worst attributes associated with southerners into his characters so accurately that I found myself laughing out loud when so-called best friends became worst enemies while still maintaining total social decorum.  I am not going to go into any of the plot because I do not want to reveal any of the twists and turns that make this novel so entertaining.  Suffice it to say that if you like duplicitous, backstabbing, self-indulgent, prejudice, and cowardly people who outwardly attempt to appear perfectly kind and good to the world, you'll love this book.<br /><br />Mr. Whitehead's writing style is fluid and descriptive.  His use of the third person omniscient point of view fits perfectly with his characters and their reactions to the people around them.  I especially like his technique of establishing a scene and then revisiting it later after the reader has gleaned additional information about the characters.<br /><br />If you like mystery, murder, intrigue, and dogs, buy this book right now.  It is a five star read.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Nice to have since there isn't a good alternative to have a youtube app on the kindle. Thanks a bunch!
B004LPLU4K|5.0|Clean, family, friendly and entertaining movie for the whole family. You won't be disappointed even if it is a bit older.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|The best android media/video player out. Plays many different formats and keeps a small footprint on your memory. Thanks a bunch
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  It is much darker than many stories and I found the characters to be more interesting because of this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it and I cant wait until its like Pc. I have broke my Pc and I'm stuck playing this :( but its still awesome.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook gives you the freedom to view the current news on what is happening to people and places all over the world! It even helps you interact with friends from any distance (as long as you have internet of course)
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I enjoy reading books by this author.  They are funny, entertaining and light reading.  It keeps my attention and is difficult to put down.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Although this is a fun game there is only 10 levels. Says that they are working on more levels but I'm sure that will not happen. Almost all the free games with limited levels ll the same thing and I have not seen any come through with more levels.
B0055SWM08|5.0|From 5 years to 60 years, my family wants to play Quell!  Great job on this fabulous game! Thanks from all of us.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I really like this book as it makes understanding the Bible easier.  I liked that I got it at a special price.  I see it is at $14.99 now...too high for me.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Great app to help clean up file & folders on my tablet. Clean, easy to navigate browser interface.<br />One thing to note - if you rename a file, you must put in the file extension. ( Rename 123.jpg to ABC.jpg make sure you type the &#34;.jpg&#34;)<br />Again, simple, easy to use, useful tool.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game! wish it had a 360 view of the room &amp; that I could move around without having to press the back button. so basically I wish it were a little more realistic because the concept is wonderful!
B003AMAOW4|3.0|had a very hard time getting English translation to operate<br />disliked the production<br />thought the performances were awkward and distracting
0440214041|1.0|Why is it that almost all of Grisham's bad-guy characters are either law enforcement or Republicans? Seriously, enough of the propaganda. When I want political opinion, then I'll watch cable news. I couldn't finish the book. Good writing is not enough to keep the pages turning when one is continuously insulted by political bias.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is the first wi-fi analyzer I downloaded, but being curious, I downloaded a few more, but this is the best of the bunch. It has the most features and the easiest to understand features. I even paid for one of the other ones that I downloaded because it had pretty pictures, and it was the most worthless. This wi-fi analyzer is now my most useful app. It continues to amaze me how wildly a signal will vary, especially if it is a so-so signal to begin with.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Buy this...now....like stop what you're doing and enjoy this 007-goodness...In addition pick up casino royale...pass on quantum of solace like it was the plague....
B0064MGU98|3.0|Structure seems repetitive and predictable but it's still holding my attention enough to keep watching. I like the kids in the show and their loyalty toward their mom and ambivalence toward their father. Not sure the father deserves a second chance but we'll see what happens next.
0307476073|3.0|I chose this for my book club.  I had been wanting to read it for ages....waited until the paperback was issued.<br /><br />Non-fiction is my favorite and I especially enjoy autobiographical works.....so I was enticed with the premise.<br /><br />I found the story less compelling than expected.  To be fair, my book club members all enjoyed more than I did.  They read less of this genre.  The book did make for a great discussion.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Like a soft rain falling on the roof...Norah Jones soothes the &#34;savage beast&#34; with her lilting, yet powerful voice.  She is the perfect background for a quiet gathering of friends, a dinner party, an opening night at the art gallery or when one finds themselves stuck in traffic.  The lyrics of her songs leave much to be desired, but Norah's soulful renditions move the focus from the words to the music, and oh my, how her voice touches the heart!
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|My husband has wanted his own minions since the first Despicable Me move came out.  I ordered these two figures for him, and he was absolutely delighted!
0062255657|5.0|It's a great book. I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan, and he never disappoints. It's a very exciting and unique story.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|These two are amazing. Once again they change direction a bit from they're last outting together. But it is fantastic. The only minor disapointment is on Nuttbush. The music on that track is a little lacking in energy. But every other track is outstanding. Beth's vocals on strange fruit are awsomely haunting. They pushed more into a 70's R&B vibe on this outting with horn sections and the whole nine yards. In short if you love these two the way I do you will want to pick this one up.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I wish all the seasons were available to watch free of charge.  Other than that reminds me of being a teen.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a really good show and the quality of the downloads from amazon were great! I've been able to find most of the shows for rent, but I came here for the ones I couldn't find and I am glad I did.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Funny movie. Dustin hoffman and Tom cruise make a great pair in this movie. That is why it is so well know.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Matthew Mcconaughey can do anything and everything good, Don't get this if you get creeped out easily. I loved it but it is an acquired taste.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Good read with a bit of a twist. Recommend as a good holiday read while lying by the pool, at the beach or by a warm fire at the snow.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie has great graphics and a wonderful story line. It will be a classic. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's just like temple run! But it's like one billion times better because Despicable me is amazing! :D &amp; there's lots of other add-ons
B000FZETIO|5.0|This movie has been a classic since it come out originally. It has a good story and can really take you back. Jon Cryer is so young. But he makes the movie.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is a great deal and an awesome game. I AM A BIG FAN. IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF SOLITARY GAMES THEN YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE.
B00CKR63F2|4.0|Beyond Bridalveill Fall (Dwelle by Sheryl Seal<br /><br />What I loved most about this book is the fact that the author managed to create a sense of community via world building and the creating of sub characters with real substance.  The Golden Queen, strong as she might be is stronger as part of a whole instead of the usual leader of parts.<br /><br />The story is detailed and still reads relatively fast.  The plot is well thought out and the reader is leaded to one scene after the other making the pacing interesting and ensuring that the pages will keep being turned.<br /><br />A good read in this genre and one I think most will love.<br /><br />WaAr
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. this and &quot;my countery&quot; are the only things I play. so much fun! both of them
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I wanted to see it when it came out to the movie theater but didn't put it on my &#34; to buy list &#34; now I am rewatch it anytime I want the action was neat to watch.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Perhaps I'm too fixated on the quality if an ending, but I've never cared for unsatisfying endings, and I found this about as unsatisfying as they come.<br /><br />To be fair, I was enthralled by most of the story (~90%), but I'm not terribly interested in a meaningful ending, perhaps something a touch allegorical. I just want something fun, maybe a bit exciting, that wraps up the loose ends, explains any mysterious bits, and has a mostly happy ending.  Yep, there are a lot of folks out there that disagree. And I'm sure they'll love this book.  Just not me.<br /><br />But wow... So close to awesome.
1451695195|1.0|I read the book not long after it was published and being fairly well-read myself and a touch cautious by nature, I thought it was quite credible but only enough so to tell what I thought of it only to very close friends and relations.<br /><br />Well, along comes a July 2013 Esquire magazine investigative report that casts serious doubts over the truthfulness of a key account: that Dr. Alexander's coma was not entirely caused by bacterial meningitis (according to the attending ER physican the ER (had also?) induced the coma and that her definition, Dr. Alexander was concious at times).  The report having to seemingly established the above, I am left feeling quite disappointed and especially since that as of this very moment, there has not been a point-by-point refution of the Esquire report from the book's publisher or from Dr. Alexander himself.<br /><br />In all fairness  to Dr. Alexander, I do wonder what was left out of the reporter's story.  Maybe the way to resolve this is by having a medical peer review of Dr. Alexander's evidence and go from there.
0761158820|5.0|Fairly quick to make, very good quality paper, and witty descriptions of the monsters. This makes for a great rainy day or boredom buster!
B00CJ32S74|5.0|This soundtrack is stand alone. Amazing by itself, and incredible as a backdrop to the film. I've listened to it nonstop since i purchaced it.
1936850028|5.0|First of all, I have never skied a Birkie. I have heard of the American Birkebeiner race, but just barely. So, I'm neither an acolyte nor practitioner of long-distance cross country skiing.<br /><br />And, while I do cross-country ski, it's not my first choice when it comes to putting boards on my feet. Just wanted to get that out of the way? Why? Because I found this book so appealing, and if I like it, it clearly has potential for a wider audience!<br /><br />Here's why I recommend Beyond Birkie Fever:<br /><br />1. It's Real. Walter Rhein grew up in a cross-country skiing family, but for a long time had no passion for the sport. When circumstances in his life brought him to a low point, he needed something to boost his confidence. Apparently a 50 km xc race was just the ticket.<br /><br />2. It's Fun. Walter shares his exploits as a child on skis, a young adult and later as an adult with wanderlust. Birkie Fever takes him around the world and convinces him that he can do anything -- even when he's out of shape.<br /><br />3. It's Inspirational. As I said, I've never xc skied in a race. But after reading this book, I just might have to try.<br /><br />4. It's well-written. Never a dull moment, never an awkward, confusing phrase. The book flows. It's an enjoyable memoir. At one point, I heard myself describe the book as \\"sweet\\" and it is. But never cloying.<br /><br />I recommend it whole-heartedly! But beware, like me, you find yourself thinking about roller skis and long hours on the winter trail!<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging! The game kept me busy for hours! I could not put the<br />game down!  I loved to finding the clues! Great cognitive exercise for memory!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's awesome but the tricks are easy. However you can change the name of your horse to a name of your own. I would give the app 5 stars if the objects were cheaper and the tricks were a bit harder
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|It kills me to say this (because I am a diehard Batman fan and loved the Dark Knight Trilogy) but this is not worth owning. I was hoping to have something comparable to The Ultimate Matrix Collection with a crap load of special features, documentaries, and commentaries for the Dark Knight Trilogy. But this \\"new\\" collection just does not deliver. I already own the movies and refuse to buy this \\"Ultimate Collection\\" (if it can be called that) for $100 when there is nothing really new included. I want to own the idea of this so bad, but this repackaged collection just isn't worth the money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A very interesting and well designed box. I hope the inventors make more of these games and soon.<br />It is an enjoyable way to spend hour time.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Long time fan. The wife and I have watched every season and think this one is the best so far.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very fascinating book!  Truly, I couldn't put it down!<br />He tells his story of lingering on the brink of death while in a coma.  He describes what he experiences with precise vision.  This may not be what everyone experiences while in a coma or while on their deathbed.  But, this is what he experienced.  Good to know is that he is a scientist and only believes that which is tangible.  This experienced changed all that he had previously believed.  Excellent reading.  I highly recommend this book.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Lady Antebellum is amazing I love this new CD as much as all of their others - they ROCK Country!<br />Excellent - love it!  Thanks!
030746363X|4.0|Not sure where they got the title.  Takes a long time to read and assimilate the information.  I did not find the diet effective for females.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker is awesome I love this new CD I'm so glad he's &#34;gone country&#34;<br />Excellent - love it!  Thanks!
B001DJLD1M|5.0|Great movies at a great price.  Arrived safe & sound without delay. Nice to have the entire 'story'.  A fabulous addition to our collection! Thanks much.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|You will not want to put this book down once you start reading it.  Jeffery Archer is one of the best authors I have read in my 75 years of life (not that I could read all of those years).<br /><br />I liked the story because it was long, and continued to twist the plot to keep you guessing.  Plus, I enjoy the history that is included in the story, especially since at my age, I read or heard about the specifics of the events.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Great movie at a great price.  Arrived safe & sound without delay.  A fabulous addition to our collection! Thanks much.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This Movie Came As The Seller Said It Would New And Unopened, I Had Seen It Before But I Did Enjoy Watching It Again..
B00CL8D83U|3.0|It's so nice having the PSB's back. Well, not that they were away that long, but after their last disappointing release it's seemed like a long time. I originally gave this 3.5 stars but after a few more listens I downgraded it to just 3 stars.<br /><br />The album: While I *somewhat* like this, I don't love it like so many here do(it's all subjective, right?). For me I tend to agree with the reviewer who says this release sounds too clubby, electronic. One or two songs like that in a PSB's album were/are always a good thing but not a whole album.<br /><br />I wonder: Where is the orchestral, anthematic Pet Shop Boys that I love? Where are the hooks? With the exception of one, maybe two songs, the anthematic atmosphere and wit and emotion that I love from this duo is missing in this release. Those 3 things are the key ingredients to a great PSB's album, and that is the big thing missing here. This album sounds more like one of their remix dance albums. I never really got into their the remixed stuff. Those releases always felt like straight club albums(as this one does to me). And while this doesn't figure in on my 3 star rating I miss hearing at least one sappy, dripping-with-emotions ballad!<br /><br />Having stated my lack of love for this, I have to say that I do find this new release fairly good(if not mostly forgettable). I enjoy it..kind of. I'm not sure how long I'll be listening to it as there are only a few tracks that I find are truly great, but I am into it for now. Overall, I'd rank this somewhere in the lower part of the middle of their album catalogue. Not their worst, and nowhere near their best.<br /><br />I hope they get back on track for their next album.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This Movie Came As The Seller Said It Would New And Unopened, I Had Seen It Before But Loved Watching It All Over Again..
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This keeps me busy when I travel for work. It's fun and passes the time. I like competing with my friends.
1608871827|5.0|Go see this movie!!!  I want them to make PR-2, so GO SEE IT TONIGHT.  This book lists for 45$ and sold here for 30$, and is a GREAT DEAL.  Absolutely gorgeous and very high quality.  Has dozens of add-ins like ID cards , Posters and pictures/diagrams.  Tells much more about both the story and the making of the movie.  This is so beautiful, that I am not letting my friend OR family TOUCH it.  Yes, THAT GOOD.  Delivered FAST, Packed very well, and arrived in mint condition.  First book that I have ever owned that I wear surgical gloves to read and take care to NOT fold or bend excessively.  I liked this movie better than Avatar!.  I only wish that they made a book like this for every SF/Monster film!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was awesome I couldn't put it down. I feel like she may have taken some of the names from popular tv shows but all.around awesome.book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun! I'm addicted! I can't seem to put the game down whatsoever!! I recommend it for everyone, all ages!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie is a great interpretation of the play.  The actors and actresses all did a very good job of singing and acting.
B008JFUR10|4.0|This was a real surprise -- a big, loud, summer popcorn movie populated with flesh and blood characters.  It's a diverting action spectacle possessing that one ingredient missing from so many like-minded blockbusters of the modern era: heart.  PACIFIC RIM is slick entertainment that thankfully feels like a movie, not a video game, and director del Toro is to be commended for assembling the picture in a way that doesn't numb the senses with ADD-style editing and protracted battle scenes that wear out their welcome (attention, Zack Snyder!).<br /><br />Question for del Toro fans: are shoes something of a signature for this director?  The only other del Toro picture I have seen is MIMIC, and it and PACIFIC RIM both make a point of drawing attention to shoes numerous times...
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I use it on my PC as well. Great to be able to use it on my mobile device. Please keep improving a great app.
B00DU73T08|3.0|I read the book and enjoyed it. The movie follows the storyline pretty much. I thought William Hurt did a good job. The other actors were good. In the book I don't recall the main characters being so young and wish they'd not made it another young love movie like Twilight, which of course was also written by Meyers. The movie seemed lacking in depth.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun. I enjoy city builders and this one is really fun. I'm only typing this because it's a quest.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|If you like this type of game you should love this one and spooky too<br />...Great graphics and color. Enjoy!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A great summer movie that shows the 'older' set still has it! I am really looking forward to the sequel!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I'm very upset that every time I try to open my app it force closes or will go to my most resent book but closes when I try to go home. Please fix soon. I've always enjoyed reading on the kindle app but recently I've been highly disappointed. I would normally give an easy four and a half stars but today I'm mad.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|Love this band. They are constantly evolving and really have a sound all their own. I recommend this to anyone.
B00CDCLL1A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I did have to watch it in two parts bc it was such a long movie for my schedule, but if you can make it through I highly recommend it. Tom Hanks in all his different roles was brilliant, truly showed off how gifted he is. Plus if you like to discuss movies this one can keep you going and wondering who or what you will be or who you have been. Or you can just take it for a what it is: another mind mending wachowski brothers film.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD GAME I MUST SAY. HOWEVER IT FREEZES A LITTLE AT CERTAIN PARTS WHICH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY THE REST OF THE GAME. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG BECAUSE ITS AN AWESOME GAME :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Best game ever I play it all day every day. Is so much fun especially when you get to the larger map sizes (Review courtesy of my 14 year old son with a new Kindle Fire HD 7\\")
B006S009IY|5.0|I loved this story.  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are a good pair.  Great story and good acting.  Even worth watching twice.
B008EEZ64Y|1.0|I'm surprised this book is so famous. I was severely disappointed. Anticlimactic and very slow until the last few pages--then terribly sped up with no real conclusion. Ugh!
B004R0WKNE|4.0|Rachel McAdams is funny and entertaining.  I liked Harrison Ford also.  Simple story, cute and light hearted.  Worth the time and money for the entertainment.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My daughter - Age 7 love this.... its hysterical.  The only problem is there are burps and farting noises and you know how kids get with those!!!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Great story.  Superb acting.  Well done on many levels. Worth watching twice.  Not a surprise it won so many awards.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It's witty, funny, and cute. Has great character meshing and amazing script. Can't stop watching.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I think this is Brad Pitts best work.  I loved the movie.  Great story and great acting. Well worth watching
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love it.  works good. The pen works when my fingers don't work the screen, due to circulation in my fingers.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This is a beautiful short story of how a mother's love lives on and on and on. It touched my heart. I am going to start reading this book to all the babies in my life. I will be purchasing several copies to just give away :)
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I have to say this is a great game for everyone. I had it on my iPad and was waiting for it to come out on my kindle fire. I was really excited when it came out but I realized you need sign into facebook in order to save your progress. I had hoped there was way we could share game data from apple to amazon. Otherwise now I have to start over again. :(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games is very awesome and amusing<br />Also fun to play you can get addicted really quick in a game like this..
B005POK858|3.0|The game is well put together and ran well on my Kindle Fire. I enjoyed the gameplay and graphics and that old school feel. However it was way to quick and easy, and there isn't really any way to customize your characters. Recommended for a quick 10 hours of monster slaying fun.
B00127RAJY|4.0|After the first day I was beat and pretty sore for a couple days. But I definitely feel that my stomach especially is more toned. I do have to say that after two weeks it can get a little boring...but I do believe that this is a great work out and I don't think that I would had been able to push myself as hard without this DVD.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I love it because it is free.<br />It is simple and informative.<br />Serve as a guide or tutorial for beginners in ebook publishing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty fun and it is colorful hip hop like and very fun sometimes it can get you a little bored but it's still cool to play :)
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie has what I like in a movie--good acting and and interesting story. The fact that this is a true story makes it even more interesting for me. The movie does a good job of illustrating what is different about the way Temple Grandin processes information, showing the disadvantages and advantages. Ms Grandin's efforts and her mother's efforts on her behalf are inspiring, especially considering the time frame of Ms G's childhood. Most children with autism were institutionalized at that time.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the acting was very good, and the movie would be worth watching if only for that reason. Tie the acting with such an interesting, true story and you get a 5-star movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pretty good u can build anything u want no violence or no bad stuff. Very good and awesome 4+ and up
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|It's an nice and entretaining book, it's got a non stop, fast pacing action that makes it a real page turner. Even though, I feel it lacks some deeper elements, like the characters lacking development, or the story sometimes moving so fast that it's simply illogical. I think it's a really nice book to read, in fact all six books from this series are, but people looking for some deeper meaning or more serious literature aren't gooing to be huge fans.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I cannot rerevue this item,  because I did not buy or order this movie, I hope I did not get charged for it.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I thought it was a pretty enjoyable movie. Not great, but a lot a actors were in it that I liked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was the best I've ever read in my entire life it's very action packed and very detailed i highly recommend this book
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to play with my kids. Lots of problem solving and memory exercises. Fun for all ages! I would recommend this game to friends.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Realy cool and realistic and it has realy good graphics and its better in Android<br />But on pistols you shou pull out the clip othor than that its realy a good name
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great game for planes or playing with friends. based on the old atari game asteroids. maybe not worth a dollar I got it for free.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Reminds me of going to laser light show in seattle when I was in high school. would recommend to anyone into Pink Floyd.
0312330855|5.0|Read all the Herriot books long ago and I'm still in love with them. Probably read them again in 5 years. Great for anyone who appreciates animals and pastoral living.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I was very happy with the content of the book. I read it on my Kindle and while you are able to highlight items, it is hard to go back and quickly reference items unlike a paperback book. Hence I went and bought a second copy just to highlight some of the Golden Nuggets and make sure I take the right actions for me.<br /><br />This book helped me to clarify some of the things I was thinking myself and expanded on ideas and thoughts. It also helped me to look at things differently.<br /><br />In the end, this was a good read. I know some have said that you can find the information on his blog but the book is better as you dont have to go hunt and search for the information.<br /><br />I will start to read and mark up my paperback copy next.
B00005JMCW|5.0|We love this movie. It is very funny and a movie the entire family can watch and enjoy. It was well worth the money.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fast and furious fun.  Recommend to those who like a game that puts you on edge.  I do not do this just before bed!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I had never read this book before in school, but with its reputation I figured I should give it a try.  It's a great tale of adventure and piracy! :)  There's a ton of cultural references embedded in this book and so it's fun to read, and it's a compelling story. Content-wise, it seems like it's good for pre-teens to adults.
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|If you want an original movie that has twists and turns you don't expect, get this!  You need to pay attention.  You can't be gazing at the TV while playing video games.  But, you will be well rewarded.  Great acting.  This movie really says a lot about how society has become a pill popping world.
0345528581|4.0|A very complete book on training with your own body. You don't have to agree with all the advice, but it is useful if you at least have fitness goals.
B006WXHJOO|4.0|Very fun movie which is great for the whole family.  It has your standard storyline as far as family goes, but it is still fun.
B005PK56TA|5.0|My eyes were glued. It's a thrill a minute. All of the intertwined plot lines really come together in the end and Evan Peters performance as Tate is incredible. Watch it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I'm very glad that Mr. Rollins did this one on his own. There's a certain, indescribable and understated flair to his writing that has always kept me engaged with his works, and The Eye of God has that; not that his team-ups were bad. &#34;Blood Gospel,&#34; team-written with Rebecca Cantrell, though not a Sigma novel was excellent, but it just didn't have the &#34;feel&#34; of a James Rollins story. So it's definitely a great thing that Mr. Rollins continues to own the Sigma series! But admittedly, each Sigma novel makes me hate the guy more... simply because in Rollins' usual style, he writes a book that is very difficult to put down.<br /><br />I read this book in three sittings a couple of weeks ago during vacation, and only had to stop because my wife and kids wanted to do things. :) Otherwise, I would've sat and read this book in a single sitting. And that brings me to the only complaint that I have with this book in that it's almost too quick of a read. After my first sitting, I couldn't believe how far I had gotten through the book. Yes, the storytelling is engaging as expected, but it's frankly a pretty short book.<br /><br />Admittedly, I'm not sure what I'd add to the book to lengthen it. Far be it from me to make that kind of suggestion. But perhaps developing the Seichan character and her relationships (don't want to give anything away) would've been nice. But despite that, this is a great book, no matter my misgivings on its length.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great game to pass the time!  Ready for more levels.<br />It was challenging but not too hard.  I would recommend this for anyone.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|My only hope is that they don't feel that they have to follow the comic book religiously. I've never read the comic. The chemistry in the show between Oliver and Felicity is amazing. Between Oliver and Laurel--not there. Her character seems shallow and self-absorbed. Love Oliver, Diggle and Felicity.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I guess he will have to write one more so we really know if  Sabastian is really dead and what happened to his friend and the father.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Season Seven brought in new evil to fight. The mythology continues to grow and expand. New characters are adding some more depth to the characters of Dean and Sam.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I bought this game after playing the free version on my phone. This game is addictive, compelling, and had my attention for hours. It was worth every penny I spent!
B0017YDPI2|4.0|This is a good season. Dean has contracted to go to Hell and they're try to find a way to keep him out. Only thing I don't like is that the shows don't play the lead-in without you having to go some work to get to see it. I enjoy the lead-ins to each episode. As far as I know this is the only season that doesn't automatically play them. Still a great show and well worth watching.
0066620996|5.0|One of the best books of its kind. To achieve greatness as a leader, you have to build a good character based on traditional values like humility and endurance.
006224454X|5.0|I read a lot of thrillers, well, at least a couple per month, and this was the best I've read for a couple of years ;)  Incredibly good plot.  I didn't expect much, thought this would be a cliche like the comedy film that was made about the girl that forgot her past each night. But this one got more and more exiting by each page, and I was totally engulfed in the end, a wonderful book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish so many of these games would not only have one board!!! Loved this room escape but want more!! Not too hard, nor to hard
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Works vefry smoothly, reading and writing. Haven't tried the spreadsheet yet, but I'm sure it's good. Thanks for the offer.
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|This book provides exactly what it promises: lots of very practical and interesting ideas for families like ours that juggle several languages on a daily basis. I was very pleasantly surprised given the low price and compared to other books I've read on the subject.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|For one thing, it was interesting to see Johnny Depp in a role that was not a caricature of some kind.  Angelina Jolie plays the beautiful but mysterious woman.  There's enough action and intrigue to keep it interesting, and I liked the ending.  I even watched it a couple more times later on.  This is not, however, one of those iconic films that you will never forget and can't stop watching.  For one thing, Jolie's woman of mystery persona wears thin after awhile, and you get the feeling she is simply meant to be eye candy.  For another, there is no compelling character or love story in the film.  Even after it ends, you only care a little bit.  I would recommend it as a once-view or maybe a few views but not as a memorable, gotta-watch-it-or-I'll-die kind of movie.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I enjoy games but did not have a clue about this game. Cute graphics though. I liked shooting the cauldron bubbles.
1926778537|5.0|Another great book to add to any collection. The designs and descriptions are great. Gives more detail about what the creators were thinking when making the game.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I have been a star trek fans since the orginal series was on tv. The effects on the blu-ray give the series a whole new effect. In a world of ever changing technology it seems I am always buying an updated version of the classics
1926778103|5.0|Most people think video game art is nothing more but computer graphics now days. But books like these show you just what the ppl behind the game actually went through stage by stage. A great book to add.
B00DYEN6XC|4.0|Let me start by saying this that I'm a HUGE DC/Superman fan. I have every seen single animated or regular superman movie that has ever been made. Justice league, Superman vs Doomsday, All Star Superman, Superman/Batman apocalypse etc and all Reeves movies. I was really excited for this movie and watched it in Imax 3d with my gf and some friends. First of all Henry Cavill is so far the BEST Superman. Although I didn't like who they picked for Lois Lane. Seriously Lois is suppose to be hot not mild. Zod was good, so was Russell crowe. What I didn't like about this movie is that it just didn't have the depth it needed.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />Some of the things that really bothered me.<br />- Superman values Human life but beats Zod through buildings filled with people without any concern of people getting killed? I counted at least 8 buildings<br />- Kryptonians captura Martha Kent and simply just let her go? Really the evil geniuses didn't know they could use her to get to Kal el?<br />- Clark revealed himself to Lois way to soon.<br /><br />Over all its a decent movie except for some plot holes. I hope they use less CGI in the next one and make it more realistic and give the story more depth.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a really good book until the ending, It felt rushed and unbelievable. I should have listened to the other reviews, they were correct.  It would be a great book if the writer re wrote the ending. Too bad.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Hungry Shark Evolution is awesome. I really think you should get this game. I asked all my friends do you like this game and they said &quot;I love it is so much fun&quot;.I really hope you get this game
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|right as I started playing it would not let me out of the app. then it started token my kindle on and off. all in all don't even consider the app.
B008Y6W910|5.0|Every woman in this country who is having an affair can identify w/the story.  Your believe you can get away  with the deception until one day fate steps in and ultimately destroys the players and their family.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|This program is easy to use. Extremely userfriendly to those who have trouble with word. I have been using it to open pdf files.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is simply amazing. It really can stretch your imagination! It doesn't matter what age you are either! My GRANDMOTHER will play this with me.<br />The actual game itself began as a ds game and has now evolved onto 3ds,Wii,Wii U, and now Android and Apple tablets and devices. And let me tell you I've been following the series the whole way! The game is a almost a cross between a physics and puzzle game. You create items help the main character which you can choose, get starites which complete the level. You can also add adjectives before the item. For example, rainbow Pegasus. A rainbow Pegasus would appear which you can you to help you in the level.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some floors are tricky but if you think it thru, it will make sense. I want more floors! Keep them coming....SOON!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It is a really good game if you like runing collecting  coins and costumes and challenges this is the game
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is incredibly easy to use! Love it! It is wonderful to see the numbers previously typed in! I use it daily.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Go die in a hole if you do not  like it you under stand person<br />Just kidding but do get it is awesome
B00DHS8MYI|4.0|Excellent entertainment, outstanding visuals, and it really deserves a 3D treatment.  Hopefully as the movie studios begin 3Ding their older titles, they will seriously consider this one.
0345529057|5.0|This series is a great read. Although I did have trouble getting started on the first book because the prologue is kind of weird.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could not put it down. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Would recommend it to my family and friends.
0618918248|4.0|I am a big fan of Christopher Hitchens, and after reading his excellent book, 'God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything,' I was in need of another page turner.  I am 37 years old, and was raised in a wonderful Christian household.  I never felt oppressed and my parents did a good job at challenging me to appreciate and value the perspectives of others.  This was taught to me as an outright Christian thing to do.  Over the years I have been running away from all toxic aspects of religion, and my Christianity has continued to evolve to where I am now.  I can see the story of Jesus and redemption and the notion of a loving God with whom no evil should be attributed.  Anyway, every thinking person should read this book.  I will admit that at the time of this writing I have not finished it, but I am anticipating the rest of it to be as good as what I have read thus far.<br /><br />I made it 4 stars instead of 5 because there seems to be an overuse of sarcasm and it comes across to me as seeing people who are religion as inferior and adolescent name-calling.  I understand why Richard would come across this way, and I don't blame him, however I think it is uncalled for...
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I'm not thrilled with the redesign.  It's cumbersome and not easy to find what you're looking for.  Overall it seems to be less feature rich.
1878424319|5.0|This book is one therapists tell their clients to read and for good reason. The concepts are simple yet profound in changing how we interrelate with each other.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful words, Beautiful story. It might break your heart but read it anyway. Great for teens, parents and people who like excellent books.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My three and five year old nephews loved this movie.  Held their attention until the very end of the movie.

B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have read every book John Grisham has written and this is another great hit.  Even as an adult, i love all the Theo Boone books.
B0097BY3KG|3.0|I felt so proud of myself purchasing the British version of Ellie Goulding's Lights and how I had it way before anyone else over here in the states ever had it, I knew my anticipation would be high for her following album, Halcyon and sadly I let myself down.<br /><br />While this album does contain the song we all heard on Gods of War trailer, a couple of the songs blend into one.  There’s' maybe 5-7 songs on this deluxe version I actually really enjoy and I feel like that's a letdown.  I noticed her style of clothing in Halcyon's album sleeve is very different from all the music videos I've seen her do on her last album, Lights, so I understand artist growing/changing stuff, but I feel like the risqué/skin tight clothing in the sleeve is just a distraction from her music.  I'd rather the songs have more power and individuality than Ellie playing with clothes and giving me an okay album.

B009KYXEY6|5.0|I remember watching this girl, Lana Del Rey on SNL way back whenever she was on and the sound was horrible.  I normally don't laugh at people when stuff goes wrong like the mic cuts off or the lights aren't working right, but it was just painful to watch and easy to tease her that's why I was surprised when I heard such positive reviews of her cd.<br /><br />After watching The Great Gatsby, the 2013 version, I was surprised one of my favorite songs was sung by this artist. I immediately went to iTunes and listened to her songs and new I had to purchase her albums.  Buying the Paradise Edition of Born to Die allows you to get roughly 8 songs more than just buying Born to Die.  If you're looking for the song on The Great Gatsby soundtrack, it is not included in any of these cds since they all came out before the movie.  Either way if you're like me, these albums will convert you and make you fall in love with Lana Del Rey.  I have yet to take her albums out of my car and I bought this special edition two months ago.

0345529057|4.0|I heard a lot of things about HBO's Game of Thrones before I even bothered watching the series and quickly became addicted.  I'm a fan of Lord of the Rings if that explains anything.  GoT is very different from LOTR, though.  There is sex in it, but so far nothing as graphic or numerous as the tv show.<br /><br />While I'm not done yet with the first book, it's an easy read.  The chapters are divided by characters, so there's no set number of chapters in a table of contents if you expected anything like that.  I tried to originally purchase this on a nook I share with my mother and aunt, but my aunt did not like how the book changed from character to character, so if you're into just one type of narrative this might annoy you.  I find this type of storytelling refreshing.  It gives you insight into what the other characters are thinking while everything is occurring around them.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars, but the print when I first opened the book appeared too small for my vision/taste.  I can read it well, but this book is about the size of something that could fit in your purse, so they had to increase the width and decrease the font size to get everything to fit.  If I would have known this I would have just bought the individual books in hardback or something.<br /><br />If you want all four books at once with a nice cover of Sean Bean on one side and Emilia Clarke on the other, go for it.  The books themselves do not have pictures of the actors on the cover, so you can remain undercover in public reading these-my LOTR books unfortunately had pictures of the stars on them, which can come off as cheesy.  I know there's at least one more book published in this series, which is not included in this set and I'm not sure if there will be enough published to have a complementing book set as well.
0802473156|5.0|I was very impressed with this read. I am not married yet but I believe it is important to understand prior to marriage as well. I look forward to reading more of Gary Chapman's books in our future.

140006922X|5.0|Bestselling author, Reza Aslan chronicles a fascinating narrative on one of history's most influential characters, as he sheds new light on Jesus of Nazareth. The author delivers an incredible, colorful portrait through extensive research as he takes the reader back in time, two-thousand years ago to the movement that was launched by one extraordinary man, who gathered followers to establish 'the kingdom of God.' Aslan describes Jesus as a man of courage, a preacher, a miracle worker, and a revolutionary. 'The king of the Jews' had a mission, a promise of liberation, but his dream died on the day of his execution. This provocative biography of Jesus reveals the walk across the Galilee to gather followers, when Jesus was captured and tortured to his death, how the people honored him as God decades later, and the era in which he lived. In addition, the author portrays a vivid description on the Holy Land, the age of zealotry and nationalism, and messages from God. Aslan includes information on Jewish prophets, messiahs, preachers, and the imperial authorities. The Galilean is defined, along with the beliefs that Jesus taught his disciples as he urged them to keep his idenity a secret, why Jesus was described as a spiritual teacher, and how Jesus looked at himself. The author highlights a new perspective in a remarkable account on the life of Jesus and his mission. This insightful, interesting story of one passionate Jew, who became the Christ of faith, will have you thinking long after this book is closed. Elegant, engaging, beautifully written, and powerfully moving. Highly recommended!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Parents and adult son have different tastes but we all agree on &#34;Game of Thrones.&#34;  Good production value, good acting, romance, suspense, and action.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Love the fact that the selection of music by<br />the groups I like is available.  Hope more videos<br />are added.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This is one of those books that should be read more than once. The first time, it's enjoyable. The second time, it's amazing. Each time after, it just gets better and better as you notice small details and subtle foreshadowing that you missed before.
B00DU73T08|1.0|This could have been a good film. It could have appealed to an audience spanning generations, and it could have been an enthralling science fiction thriller...<br /><br />Instead, it falls flat. It seems that the director decided that the best way to adapt the original text to a visual medium was to try to make it as much like Twilight as possible. There are entire swaths of film that could have been left out of the final cut, and doing so would have improved the film drastically. It is supposed to be a thrilling experience, yet I never once felt thrilled thanks to annoying and all too common flashbacks of the protagonist and her (sort of) boyfriend.<br /><br />And when the flashbacks aren't slowing down the plot and boring the audience to death, the dialogue is doing the same. Some movies can survive without fantastic writing, but this is not one of them. In a movie where one of the two main characters is basically a disembodied voice that can only be heard by the antagonist (and the audience), good dialogue is a MUST. I could have put up with the obvious, annoying, and intrusive flashbacks that served no other purpose than to justify the phrase \\"romantic thriller\\" in the film's description, but only if the dialogue didn't appear to be written by someone who has never actually watched a movie before. As an example... \\"You should go to sleep.\\" And then... \\"You should sleep with me.\\" Really?? Not even in real life is dialogue this terrible.<br /><br />There are some redeeming factors... The story itself is interesting. Though I haven't read the book, I'm told that Meyer's writing is dramatically improved in The Host as compared to previous titles. It is easy enough to see from the film that the story itself holds a lot of appeal. I also think it is quite creative in some ways. Though portions of the story seem somewhat archetypal (like the body snatching aliens...) other parts are thoroughly intriguing and have not been explored nearly as often in film (some aliens have a conscience and would rather not enslave humanity...). On top of this, the acting is, though not spectacular, solid, and I can't help but feel that the actors involved were hurt by the creative direction of the film.<br /><br />I feel that I actually can't do this film justice in reviewing it because I'm not bland and uninteresting enough to truly understand it, much less effectively communicate the film's bland, uninteresting execution. This story had a ton of potential for the silver screen, but the movie fails to meet that potential, much less even make a decent attempt at doing so. Unless you have money to throw away or you're a very young, very naive teenage girl who is too busy obsessing over makeup and boys to care, save yourself and don't waste 2 hours on this film.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love period movies and this one was such a pleasant surprise. I went into it not expecting much and was blown away. The setting, the production, the acting was nothing short of superb! Richard Armitage (I now know his name) and Daniela Denby-Ashe were amazing. Why aren't these people in more movies?
B0076NAVNA|5.0|First of all I love the music..Steve Morse and David LaRue are two of my favorite musicians..got their autographs and talked with both of them at the NAMM show a few years ago...i received my purchase in about 2 days after placing my order..was in perfect shape...Thanks!!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|A thrilling ride re-visited with new special effects replacing the older model shots and grainy planet scapes. Or if you absolutely have to have the original version they're cleaned up nicely!
0785814531|5.0|This was one of the most wonderful reads I have had in a long , long time. I find myself hanging on each page. I think this is the best book I have bought in a long time !! I really think if you love Edgar Allen Poe, as do I. You really need to add this to your collection. I did and love it !!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was very riveting, suspenseful and exciting. Could not put it down. I can't wait to read the final book.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Jamie McCloone the protagonist of this novel has questionable personal hygiene and slovenly living habits, but you learn to overlook that as his past and his heart are revealed bit by bit. I loved the ending, it was perfect.
B008Y73940|3.0|Started out so so then it gets kinda slow. the end has a twist to it but nothing that aint been done before. I had time to kill it was ok for that. Glad I didn't pay theater prices for it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We became addicted to Downton Abbey after downloading the first season, thanks to our Prime membership, upon the urging of our son and daughter-in-law who are fans of the series. We can't wait for season 4.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love strategic puzzle games, and this one is no exception.  Can't wait for more floors.  Very addictive and definitely will keep you coming back for more!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It's very accurate, shows all pertinent information needed for daily weather &amp; can give a weekly forecast as well. I use it daily for the humidity %, cuz I have a serious lung disease, live in Missouri, which has horrible humidity &amp; that is very hard on me. I have Weatherbug on my pc &amp; tried it on my Kindle Fire HD, but it didn't work, even after deleting &amp; reinstalled it. I highly recommend Weather Live &amp; it's worth so much more than the tiny $1.99 I paid for it!!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|The basic plot was impossible!  Acting-- high school level! Camera angles-- great: Sound track --above average: Most of the actors did not get into character -- role presence was  at college level! wardrobe good: cinematic techniques above average regarding todays production values!  this is what I would have expected from an independent production house!<br />Giving three stars is a real gift!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|i read this based on a friends recommendation.  absolutely different than what i expected... social and political commentary hidden inside a post-apocalyptic earth... very well executed... a fun read... a good book.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I love evry ingle story in this book, it make want to read it or look for everything she found on her trip..
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I could not imagine how they could make a movie about the stars of The Original Series as youngsters.  How could they find young people that would be believable as a young Kirk, a young Bones, a young Spock ?!  Well, they did !  I was THRILLED with this movie.  It is a delight !  It is totally believable that these are the people who grow up to become the members of The Original Series.  LOVE it !!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I love Lord of the Rings, so knew I was going to see The Hobbit at some point.  I wasn't expecting something quite as good as LOTR - and in some ways it isn't since the plot isn't quite as large/complex.  But from an action/adventure movie perspective, with all the special effects, humor, etc. I think this was a really good movie.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|An ancient Celtic story of a Princess who doesn't want the role of a traditional wife & mother.  This is a fairytale brought to life.  Beautifully animated & well-played.  The heroine is a tomboy who refuses to follow the rules of the time and her station in life.  She wants what she wants & to heck with everyone else.  It has something for everyone.  Ancient Celts, magic, and the story of a Brave young woman who chooses her own path.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This game is amazing . I also wasn't sure about purchasing because of the reviews about an additional charge to finish the game but soooooo  glad I took the chance. I was not charged  so I guess alawar did right by its customers and waived additional charges. The game is incredible graphics are amazing. Puzzles were just challenging enough to entertain without frustrating the hell out of you lol. Okkk bring on the next one!!!!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Cannot figure out how to play, looks fun but after tapping on the screen for awhile and finding one picture clue I gave up and downloaded anothe hidden object game.  Instructions would be a very good thing for this game.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Quite the inside look at a big law firm (not!). But, the fact that it is not at all realistic is what makes it entertaining to watch.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|While the addition of the son in this movie was intriguing, the movie was a typical Die Hard movie full of action, action and more action.  I didn't find it super exciting but it was good.  If you are looking for a typical Die Hard action movie, you will like this one.
B009LDMJBU|5.0|Listen to this album every day, Eros always outdoes himself. I like how the album is called Noi, there are lots of duets in there. Excellent music!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, especially after seeing so many cheesy TV sci-fi shows.  Would the effects be poor, would the acting be unbelievable, would the story be any good?  No, no, and yes.<br /><br />I also really like the fact that, although there are a few story lines going on simultaneously, when they take a commercial break (which you don't have to watch here on Amazon) they usually come right back to that cliffhanger moment they left you with...instead of moving on with the show and getting back to it when they feel like it.<br /><br />5 stars because I do love this show, I've now voraciously watched all the episodes to date, and am probably addicted.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book provided great entertainment with the right balanc between reflective moments on life and humor. I read on holidays and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005QYKE2Y|3.0|i enjoyed the previous two versions better.  Dark of The Moon lacked a credible plot and the acting was flat relying on the special effects to make it through the movie.  I miss Magan Fox.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The book was well written, engaging and provided a realistic insight into the challenges of Aspergers where the main character struggles with managing social encounters, making sense of these relationships  and his anxiety related to these encounters.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I couldn't put down the first two books, I was obsessed with them!<br />This one wasn't as exciting or fast paced. It's kind of boring..too much plotting and politics and not as much edge of your seat action. Still a good read and the characters still continue to develop and I love seeing that! Of course the love story is still there. I haven't been able to finish it yet, I'm about halfway done but it has taken me twice as long to get here then to finish both the others!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Purchased this DVD as a replacement for a missing DVD in our library.  This is a poplar DVD and is checked out often from our library.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Just as I remember him! Everyone always tells me, \\"He just sounds like old Justin...\\" ...GOOD! The entire album is great from start to finish to the point where I bought the MP3 version, kicked myself for not having a physical disc for the car and then proceeded to Target to buy it lol. Forever a fan (if I have to listen to pop, that is.)!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very entertaining. Classic Stephen King. Loved the time travel back to the last 50s and early 60s. Really was a simpler time.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book is great for mystery lovers!  If you can get past three graphic scenes (all three rape scenes), you'll love it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Only one word is necessary to describe this book .... profound. Truly one of the greatest (probably the greatest) book of the 21st century.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Eighteen is the magic number:  After 18 albums and 18 years since their last album, these iconic<br />  legends of metal return in style.  There's a lot of history and a lot of expectation with a new Black<br />  Sabbath album, so I tried to hear this as though it was a new band--and it sounded like one of<br />  very best metal albums this year!  \\"13\\" is megalithic, mastodonian (I'm not sure those are really<br />  words, but that's how it feels).  It's a powerhouse weightlifter on steroids, busting through<br />  machines & barbells like an unstoppable, muscle-music flexing two-ton behemoth.  The album<br />  has a tremendous amount of character couched in its rumbling power-thrust, at times even<br />  taking on a haunting feel.  Ozzy's voice is perfectly paced, potent, riveting; Iommi's guitar licks<br />  are classic, burning, devil-eyed coals ready for the flames.  Black Sabbath have created another<br />  surprisingly strong album of expertly crafted, heavyweight blues/stoner/doom metal that exceeds<br />  anything we could expect after so long a time.  All hail the bat-eater and his band!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|So entertaining,  there is not a dull moment. I can't wait to keep on with the series. Must get whole series
B00BNPWBOO|4.0|11th studio album since 1987 from these legends of British rock--catchy & hypnotic Brit-poppy<br />  space rock with mesmerizing, psychedelic rhythmic beats and experimental forays into head-<br />  sparkle, atmospheric strangeness.  There's an aggressive sense of innovative risk that<br />  encompasses noisy, dissonant elements in a diverse array of approaches--always with a<br />  balance of melody and head music.  Sensual, low-key vocals are sometimes set against a funky-<br />  psych backbeat to create a visceral flow of captivating dance, Krautrock and expansive rock `n'<br />  roll energy with a touch of glam.  Bluesy tribal songs haunt some corners of the album with a<br />  primitive theatricality, evolving into hand-clapping, horn-blowing finales.  Members & guest<br />  musicians have played in Jesus & Mary Chain, The Wake, Revolving Paint Dream, Little Barrie,<br />  Felt, Led Zeppelin, My Bloody Valentine, the Pop Group, Headless Heroes, more.  Influences<br />  come from bands as diverse as Spiritualized, the Rolling Stones, the Verve, Metro, Moon Duo,<br />  Love & Rockets, David Bowie, the Strokes.  Overall, it's a strong and diverse effort from Bobby<br />  Gillespie & band.
0143034901|4.0|The book was in good condition.<br /><br />The story was intresting. It doesn`t matter to me if the story is long, but in this case I felt it too long.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. I have spent many hours playing it. i would recommend this to anyone that loves playing Card games!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The story kept my interest until the very end. The characters were well defined and the major theme was emotionally as well as intellectually thought provoking.  I loved the book and will read other books by this author
B006LA6IW2|5.0|What a great story about a true American hero. This book made me laugh, cry and want to go back into the military as if I wasn't finished. I felt I should pick up where Chief Kyle left off.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves our country as much as I do.
1885167776|5.0|\\"Then Jesus said to them, 'I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy?'\\" -- Luke 6:9 (NKJV)<br /><br />The title tells the book's key message: concentrate, concentrate, concentrate!<br /><br />Yet most people probably find doing so to be harder now than ever before, as they fend off interruptions, multiple responsibilities, and being more easily bored. This book is a timely reminder that we do better by focusing our minds and efforts to do just what is most important until it's accomplished. That's because we are limited ... as well as the way that the right results accomplish far more than achieving lots more of other results.<br /><br />Reminded of this lesson, I resolved to focus my students more in what they learn at one time. I am so glad that I did. Their rate of learning zoomed!<br /><br />I had learned this teaching concept as \\"chunking down,\\" an expression I have never liked and that doesn't clarify my thinking very much as a teacher.<br /><br />The metaphors in the book's early chapters moved me. I especially liked the one about how a falling domino can tip over a much larger one, such that the effects of pushing the first one over quickly multiply to creating enormous results.<br /><br />Once past these exciting, powerful lessons, I was disappointed to find that the detailed advice for choosing what to concentrate on is far more pedestrian. I also felt that not enough was done to explain how to pick the most valuable improvements, nor the methods to use for accomplishing them. The advice is pretty much same-old, same-old linear thinking that doesn't fulfill the potential of the domino metaphor.<br /><br />But if you have never read anything about the importance of concentration and what to apply your concentration to, you will find this to be an excellent book to get you started. If you think you know what to do, I believe you will at least gain some new encouragement to follow more often what you know.t you know.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Works better than expected on the kindle tablet. No glitches crashing just fun for a great price, you won't be disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|best season ever, looking forward to season four maggie smith was great, also was surprised with shirley mcclaines apperance perfect casting
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it and the series!!! I can't wait for the next book to see what happens next!!! I read 50 Shades and it was very similar.<br /><3
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|Vacuous, unoriginal.  Filled with unlikeable characters you won't give a damn about.  Skip this and watch the original, which this generation of filmmakers can not even imitate.  And yes, I actually did suffer through the entire movie.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I had never seen the original movie. But after watching this movie, I had to watch the original.  The original was even worse.  Then I had to follow it up with watching Wicked. The disappointment continued.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|i love it for fishing its the best I have two  buy  now  its the best ever great great great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Such an amazing book, would recommend to anyone. Loved the courage that she had to strip herself down emotionally and see  herself for what she was at the beginning and at the end.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I have been listening to Phil Collins for a long time on the radio.  And decided to buy this c.d. so I could listen anytime!  Great c.d.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a really great game. Not only is it fun, but the graphics are pretty and bright. Good game for when you have free time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|For my money, the best version of Angry Birds out there.  The Star Wars theme is merely frosting on the cake.  Great fun!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I thought the 1st SVZ was a good game until all the glitches made it so I couldn't even load it.  If you where the same way try this one it is even better.  the addition of extra characters and abilities put this version over the top.  This is my favorite game right now it is all I play at the moment.  The only down side is that it can be very expensive.  But you don't have to spend a lot of money to enjoy it.  I am at level 43 and have only spent $10. So be patient and don't worry about powering your characters up quickly if you do take your time and use the collections you can win a lot of the items you need instead of buying them. Would be a five star if it was cheaper.
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|Great cast! Intriguing developments! True story! This film is both entertaining and well executed! Even though the events of this film happened way before my time, it made me feel like I was right in the thick of the suspense as it all unfolded.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I live the trilogy but at the end the Pisce on how Cristian was thinking on the beginning was great !!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A parents worst nightmare.  We never believe these types of people actually have parents, but they do.  The was a well written book on a topic most of us never really imagine.  Highly recommend!
014312093X|1.0|I had heard a lot about this book and in general, like to read thrillers about Cold War espionage.........however, in this case after reading the first 55-60 pages, I just could not make sense of the events and was disturbed that maybe i am growing old for spy thrillers! So logged onto Amazon and was glad to learn that it wasn't just me who found it a chore! Will be going back to Ton Clancy again!
0802473156|5.0|Love this book and subsequent spin-offs!  Very well written and easy to read.  Highly recommend this for pre-marital counseling or for couples who are just starting their journey!  Dr. Chapman has these languages very well pegged and explains each one as if he is telling a friend trying to understand a love language that is not their own.  This book is a great starter for communication issues too.  Knowing a love language can help anyone understand how to talk with someone and how to make up for not filling their \\"Love Tank\\".  May God bless you as you seek to strengthen your marriage or relationship with this wonderful tool!
B0084RSZKI|5.0|This is such a funny and crazy yet touching and good-feeling movie. You will laugh, you will cry (or at least I did), you may even Cry FROM laughing!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is fun. I would recommend it. Great for killing time as well and its free so why not.
B0041D843M|5.0|From examining studies of other cultures, to experiments done in the US, the Campbells highlight the common thread- eating plant based foods can reverse, cure, and prevent the feared, &#34;mysterious&#34; diseases of our culture. So glad I read this book!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have all cut the rope games and I love them all its defenitly fun and in a low price!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like the game but seems a little hard to move. will keep trying though and hopefully will be little easier with time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can it be anything less than 5 stars?  It's the best place to put together ideas for new homes, photographs, baking recipes and anything else under the sun!  It's a constant source of entertainment and new ideas and I think I click on this app daily!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Hard to find a movie that parents, kids, and 20 year olds all like.  We all enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it.  Good family fun.  Good fun period.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Im so glad i have bought this apu. It can even run the latest games on medium. It can even planetside 2 at a decent frame rate on medium settings and planetside 2 is known for the most cpu intensive game. I recommend this apu for gaming.
0307950654|4.0|It has been stated that being an optimist is going to the bookstore expecting to find a new Jane Austin novel. Now the optimist can turn to P. D. James to fulfill that expectation.  It was entertaining to continue the story of Darcy and Elizabeth and, of course, Pemberly.  P. D. James owes the reader no apology for her efforts.  Her language rings true to the period as if it flowed from Austin's pen.  It is a light story populated with familiar characters.  The real star is the language that evokes vivid descriptions of country life in the early 1800s.  Read it for fun and hope that the BBC options the book.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book was so great! It kept twisting and turning, it tore me apart piece by piece. The drama really swoops in takes root in your heart as you cheer on the characters! What an interesting topic, it's so different, and it really kept my attention.
0670026638|5.0|How do a century-old modern-thinking Buddhist nun, a WW II kamikaze pilot, a bullied 16-year-old Japanese schoolgirl on the verge of suicide, her suicidal father, a struggling memoirist on a remote island of British Columbia, Time, Being, Proust, language, philosophy, global warming, and the 2011 Japanese tsunami connect?<br /><br />In this brilliantly plotted and absorbing, layered novel, one can find the theme in a quote from Proust, quoted by Ozeki:<br /><br />\\"In reality, every reader, while he is reading, is the reader of his own self.\\"<br /><br />Remember these poignant and piercing words, as it underpins all that this book is about. You can catch on immediately that it is self-referential, at least to some degree. The memoirist's name is Ruth (like the author)--both Ruths have a husband name Oliver and live on a remote island in British Colombia. And both are writers. The Ruth of the novel suffers from writer's block. She has been trying to write a book of her mother's last years living with Alzheimer's, and to illustrate her own feelings about her experience as daughter and caretaker.<br /><br />One day, Ruth finds some barnacle-encrusted belongings washed up ashore, possibly from the 2011 Japan tsunami and the tidal drifts that deposited debris in their direction. Inside is a Hello Kitty lunchbox, a wristwatch circa WWII, letters in Japanese, a French composition book, and a diary of a 16-year-old Japanese girl named Nao (pronounced \\"Now\\") written in English. The diary itself is set inside a hacked copy of Proust's &Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time). Proust's novel is removed, leaving the shell as a cover protecting Nao's secret journal.<br /><br />In the meantime, a native Japanese crow has inhabited the island where Ruth and Oliver live with their moody cat, eerily haunting the island with its ke ke ke song.<br /><br />According to the narrative, the ancient Zen master, Shōbōgenzō, stated, \\"Time itself is being...and all being is time...In essence, everything in the entire universe is intimately linked with each other as moments in time, continuous and separate.\\"<br /><br />I was hooked by that time, and for the time...being.<br /><br />I know that, thus far, I have only quoted great historical thinkers and writers, whose words are enfolded in this shimmering tapestry of a book. However, be assured that Ozeki's contemporary narrative will both exhilarate and touch you.<br /><br />\\"I am reaching through time to touch you,\\" writes Nao with her purple gel pen.<br /><br />Ruth decides to hunker down with Nao's diary, a few pages at a time, each night reading to Oliver and herself. She learns early on that Nao is planning on killing herself after she writes down the life story of her great-grandmother Jiko, the Buddhist nun. As the diary unfolds, it is evident that Nao is also recording the story of her own life. Moreover, she shares the events, as she knows it, of her dead great-uncle, the WW II pilot who was also a philosopher and lover of French literature.<br /><br />The opening of the book is abstract, unformed, and philosophical, but that only lasts for a few pages. Once the chapters begin, the narrative alternates between Ruth and Nao. I admit to an early concern, that the novel may be a YA-adult crossover, due to the chipper tone of Nao and her indelibly teenage style. But, eventually, as the story penetrates and cross-cuts through characters, the storylines become a piercing symphony. I am confident that you will be moved by not just its warmth, but its luminous beauty.<br /><br />\\"In the interstices between sleeping and waking, she floated in a dark liminal state that was not quite a dream, but was perpetually on the edge of becoming one. There she hung, submerged and tumbling slowly, like a particle of flotsam just below the crest of a wave that was always just about to break.\\"<br /><br />Along the way, you will learn numerous Japanese words, which are footnoted, and Buddhist concepts, which are woven in seamlessly. I have had too many experiences of overweening narratives exerting Buddhist credo that discharge as shallow power point presentations or pedantic coffee table ideas. Ozeki doesn't disappoint. With a little magic realism (just a little!), a pinch of Murakami, and a lot of heart, she pulls the threads all together into a radiant tapestry. This book is a gift of love.which are woven in seamlessly.

B00B780TAK|5.0|This is my Favorite all time series, as many other fans have said about the Downton Abby series.from the writing, directing, acting,the cinematography. and of course the use of Highclere Castle in Hampshire. which is a Castle that's still lived in today by the 8th Earl and Countess of Carnarvon. I just finished watching the ending of this season and it is heart wrenchingly sad. can't wait for season 4 to begin.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I don't always get the logic of the clues right away; so I have to spend some time thinking. and that`s the part that really pulls me in. The version for Kindle Fire HD only has 10 levels, so I'm waiting waiting waiting for them to come out with more!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Fast, fun, and entertaining. I really like this game for times when I do not have time to think and figure ,etc.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Christmas and I started watching the special features on the DVD and got interested in the series. I am now a huge fan of Jane Austen and this miniseries. Great characters and actors.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I cannot get this app to do anything. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.  Five more words are required, so I guess what I'm saying is that it isn't a good purchase.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|If you are a racing fan, especially of Formula 1 and road coarse racing, this film is a must to see. Great camera work makes you feel like you are in the car with the driver. Good story, great acting and killer action sequences!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This is a great story of love, life and surviving the best way you can. The author did amazing job of describing falling in love for the first time.  This book made me laugh, cry and have hope.  Great read
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|Any racing fan should love this film about the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Done in some what of a docudrama style it is quite different. Not much of a plot but it just doesn't seem to need one. I felt like I was an invisible voyeur during the greatest 24 hour race in the world. Good effects and direction! Steve McQueen is perfect in this movie.
0316017930|5.0|excellent book ! Very educational and insightful about what we may have always taken for granted.<br />a great read that I recommend highly !
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The best superhero movie ever made. Engaging at all times. And the score should have won an oscar...mark ruffalo excellent as dr.banner.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The first trailer I watched about this movie, I thought, oh its good ol' superman back on the screen again..boo hoo lol. But I later realized that it got me hooked!! I couldn't wait till I went to go watch this movie!! I had so many expectations, and ofcourse, Henry Cavill is super HOT! Not to mention he's British.. But anyways, the movie, the graphics, the acting, and the story line was beyond amazing! Alot of people here are complaining about the movie having too much CGI, or too much action, and blah blah blah. To me this movie was awesome! Henry Cavill,was such an amazing actor playing Superman. And getting to see his sensitive and more \\"human\\" side. In my opinion, He's the best one who has portrayed Clark Kent/Superman ever! Movie is amazing, and I'm definatley buying this!! So much worth it! I'm am now such a Superman fan because of this movie!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|My son is hooked on this series. What a great gift. Easy to shop and ship from my seat, not my feet. Thanks Amazon
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I have seen the play  4 times and really enjoyed the stage production.  I thought I would not like the film as much, but I thought it was very well done, although the actors' voices were not as powerful as those on the stage.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Fairly entertaining, though with numerous typos (even after \\"professional editing\\").<br /><br />An example of the poor editing: \\"Do I like it here?\\" she. (I'm guessing it's supposed to say \\"she said\\" rather than just \\"she.\\"<br /><br />I liked the dialogue, but the ending kinda sucked. And, though I'm too lazy to check, I could swear the author wrote that Thor had his first drink TWICE. Once early in the book, and then again later, as if she forgot he already had his first drink earlier in the book. It's mistakes like the ones mentioned that make me wary of shelling $3 for the other books. I've published books on here too, but I'm only charging $1 for each (and some for free), and I read through each a dozen times to make sure the mistakes are minimum.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because it makes your dream come true and also helps you know how to take care of a hores
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This game is funny and very nostalgic. The writing is hilarious and the graphics are old school but crisp on Kindle Fire. I cannotnrecommend this game enough!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|...Addictive so far. Simple yet good puzzles.  T only negative so far is that sometimes you have to use guesswork and not logic
0446580848|2.0|I got 200 pages into this 600-page book, and now I am officially giving up and calling it quits. The only reason I didn't give up on it at least 50 pages ago is that I paid money for the book, have enjoyed the other DeMilles I've read, and I kept thinking it just HAD to get better. Instead, the irritating little writing tics that just annoyed me for the first 100 pages or so have become, by now, so grating that it's like Chinese water torture. There's no way I can make it through another 400 pages of \\"He said to me...\\" and \\"He then informed me...\\" and \\"He said to Paul and me...\\" and \\"He let me know...\\" and \\"He then reported...\\" AAUGH! Just deliver the fricking dialogue, will ya? Cluttering up paragraph after paragraph -- and interrupting the flow of the dialogue -- with all this pointless, boring, distracting filler makes me want to scream. Or at least, get out my red pen and delete massive quantities of verbal clutter. I can't even remember the last time I've read writing that was this wooden and plodding. Oh, and don't even get me started on the way DeMille apparently tries to compensate for the essential dullness of the dialogue by having the narrator, John Corey, make wisecracks out of everything -- and I do mean EVERYTHING. No real, believable person is a joker every single waking minute. Hey, I get it that people in stressful, life-and-death situations relieve the tension with dark humor. But do you know anyone who's NEVER straight with you? Who makes EVERYTHING into a joke? I've known a few people who came close to that, and it didn't take long for them to start wearing thin. It gets old.<br /><br />All in all, I can't even fathom that this book was written by the same man who wrote the BRILLIANT \\"Night Fall,\\" which I absolutely loved and can't recommend highly enough. I'm wondering if DeMille might have had a stroke or something. But if so, why didn't his nearest and dearest save him from himself by making sure the book got a decent editing job?<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of only one is that DeMille at least did his research. You can always learn a lot from his books. Unfortunately, even the payoff of learning some more about Yemen is not enough to tempt me to try schlogging through the last 400 pages. Life is short. \\"So many books, so little time.\\" Not gonna waste any more of my time on this one, when there are so many others out there that are a joy to read, not a chore.he reason for two stars instead of only one is that DeMille at least did his research.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|A summer must read. Picked this book to read on the commute to work.  I became so engaged with the characters that I kept reading when i returned home.
B009R659L8|1.0|Too many characters. It was confusing and not enough clues to head you in the right direction . A lot of scum bags in the plot.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|The appnis really good. Easy to use. Has all the settings for your tasks easily arranged in order to set a task fast.<br /><br />I totally recomend it
B00CDUVDEC|2.0|The other guy who gave it 2 stars got it completely right. This album is missing so much. There is no groove, nothing stands out, if Phil were not in it most people would never give it a listen. Phil said he wrote most of the riffs which makes sense because they are super simple and sounds like Pantera verses played by an amateur. The vocals are ok but very monotonous. I was really looking forward to this album, but $10 for 8 songs and 2 of them are more demoish than anything else? Weak. I was looking forward to this, unfortunately I am let down
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Great app.! Totally recomend it. Is compatible with most of documents extensions, so you cn open almost any file. thanks ocuments to go!
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|The year is 1935 and 13-year-old Briony Tallis wants to be a writer. On a hot summer day at her English estate, she witnesses a private moment between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie, a life-long friend and the son of a servant. Briony is too young to understand what she is seeing, and her vivid imagination and penchant for drama lead her to misread the situation. When a crime occurs later that night and people are desperate for answers, Briony spins her greatest story yet -- a story she knows, on some level, is not true. This story, and the accusation she makes, has far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />Atonement follows the repercussions of Briony's actions through the destruction of WWII to the late 19th century. We see Briony as a nurse in WWII London as she adjusts to a lifestyle drastically different from her luxurious childhood and as an elderly woman reflecting on the fallout from her childhood lie. We also see the tragic aftermath of her betrayal on the bloody turf of war-time France and in the heartbreak of a pair of star-crossed lovers.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. Ian McEwan is a very strong writer, and I loved delving into Briony's mind and seeing the ways she tried to atone for her actions. I especially loved the revelations at the end of the book. I don't know if I'd call it a twist, exactly, but Briony makes some interesting admissions; let's just say she is a creator of fiction through and through. The ending is genius and heartbreaking, and it perfectly conveys the depth of her regret over the crime she committed as a girl. McEwan does a great job portraying the multiple ways Briony's lie permanently changed the lives of those around her.<br /><br />Atonement also depicts the brutality and terror of WWII. One section of this book takes the reader to war-torn France as the British soldiers retreat to the Channel; it was horrendous and very powerful. The descriptions of London were excellent, too. I spent four months in London a few years ago, and it was strange to read about how incredibly different the city was during the war.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I'm pretty much the only person I know who didn't like this book.  I found it depressing.  It in no way is &#34;this generation's Breakfast Club&#34;.  Very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Neat game, helps kill time when you're bored. I just don't understand how the officer catches you so fast when you have a head start.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you read 50 Shades and loved it, I feel you will certainly like this better.  The sex scenes are more graphic and just plain hotter.
B00A5IXYR8|5.0|Didn't know what was going on, didn't really care what was going on. Amazing movie. Stole my attention completely. It's best not even to try to figure this one out... just enjoy the oddly disturbing imagery and sounds.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm not sure how I get sucked into these books...I guess it's all the great sex scenes.  I hope this isn't a spoiler alert, but it's not the end of the series.  The books are a good vacation read or good for some mindless entertainment.  If you liked the first two, you will certainly like this one.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Kids love it but it always freezes in the same place on first gen Fire. Works just fine on Nexus 7. Too bad...
B00846REIS|4.0|A better version of 50 Shades of Grey.  If you liked that, you will like this better.  The writing is more creative and sex scenes are better.  Because be honest, that's the only reason people read these :)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good story and smart puzzles. A well made game. The story kept me coming back to solve more of the case.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I hated this book!  The only thing it did was reiterate how big of jerks Philly fans are.  Def skip over.  The only thing worse is the movie.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Andrea Bocelli is truly an inspiration!  Besides being so talented he is such a humble and loving man.  One can see and feel the passion that radiates from his voice and inner being.....he is really the best in my ratings, would love to see him in Italy....saw him in California last year and the performance was exhilerating!  He had FOUR standing ovations and sang and sang and sang.  When he first entered the arena I had tears of joy and all during the finale I had tears running down my face along with 50% of the audience.  So moving!  I LOVE all of his works!
0765325950|5.0|For those of you who have waited so long for this book to be published, how can one give it anything else but five stars? If you love fantasy, you'll fall in love with Robert Jordan's writing. Be sure you start with Book One, &#34;Eye of the World&#34; and read the series in the order that they were published. I'm not into fantasy all that much, but I skipped nights of sleep to read these books!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This is a powerful and unforgettable film. Natalie Portman's Oscar winning performance. Great DVD quality, too. Some very subtle video scenes which are quite creepy. Watch for them.
0345529057|5.0|He loves the books and can't put them down. I'm sure we will be ordering book 5 when it is available.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like that I found a free Uno game. I saw another one but it wasn't free. So I think it's a good game.
0141345659|4.0|Oh yes, leave it to me to be one of those left behind who haven't read The Fault in Our Stars. I'm sorry. In my defense, I am not keen over reading realistic fiction. I feel like I've already had my fair share of reality that books should be otherwise more ethereal. But there are also times that I need a break from the fantasy world and so, here came the opportunity to read something different...<br /><br />I'm going to keep this short since I'm sure a lot of you have gone through the tons of reviews that this book has received.<br /><br />I was surprised about the normalcy I found in Hazel. For someone who was diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer, she comes out as just any typical teenager (except for the oxygen tank and all, of course). She's witty and spunky. Cleary, not what I expected. Some would imagine that people with cancer or any form of life-threatening diseases are likely to be sad and depressed, but Augustus and Hazel show otherwise. And I'm glad about that.<br /><br />It was a big mistake to read this book in public. You see, my fianc&eacute;'s younger sister had a fashion show, which we promised to watch, the day I was halfway through with the reading The Fault in Our Stars. Being so engrossed in the story, I couldn't put it down. So while waiting for the show to start, I decided to read through. When I reached the heart wrenching scenes of Augustus, boy was I in an embarrassing state. I kept stopping and tearing my eyes off the book every few paragraphs just so I could keep the tears at bay. My fianc&eacute; just kept smirking and shaking his head every time he looked at me (the dude got so used to me crying over a book that he finds it normal... wow! Thanks a lot.)<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is the very first John Green book that I have ever read. And I'm happy to say that I am definitely reading his other books after this one! It's no question why The Fault in Our Stars has captured the hearts of so many readers. The story may be simple but a very thoughtful one at that. [SPOILER AHEAD!] How ironic is it that the John Green ended the book the way Van Houten, the author of AIA (can't say what that is since it's a key element in the story), ended his own book in the story?ughtful one at that.

B00CCEHR80|4.0|This show brings back a lot of memories: it was hot in more ways than one and this was the first show after GD keyboardist Brent Mydland died a couple of weeks before. Bela Fleck and the Flecktones opened this show and they were great. Too bad we couldn't have gotten that as well! The show is very well played and features quite a few standouts like Midnight Moonlight and The Harder They Come with Bela sitting in at the beginning of the second set. It's a shame that Garcia, Grisman and Fleck never did a whole project together. Highlights, for me, also include How Sweet It Is, Stop That Train, Forever Young, That's What Love Will Make You Do, Tears of Rage, Deal and a good amount of set two. As I said before, the weather was extremely hot and the band sounds somewhat subdued. This show was recorded by soundman John Cutler on to DAT and the mix is pretty good. All in all, a great release if a little laid back. I'm hoping that with the next one, we get a few more Cats Under the Stars songs.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I enjoyed this CD by Rihanna.  The music is fresh and energetic.  I enjoy listening to it while I am driving my car.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book finished it in two days only because I needed to sleep. Highly recommended. Can not wait to read the second one.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|This book should have a warning sign that only for those who like football, as I don't. The protagonist is a die hard, obsessed football fan including his family that was first put down. I found the details about his three obsessions very boring. He is also a mentally disturbed, unstable patient.<br />Story of a dysfunctional family and repeated details about exercise, Stomach Master 600, which you will find every third age, is not what keeps a reader engrossed. The whole story can be told in one page, nothing amusing or interesting.<br />The writing and flow is good but I regretted that I bought the book.
0385333846|5.0|I picked up this book because I have heard so many great things. The book lives up to the hype!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story was bittersweet. I couldn't put it down. It was a good mix of true love and true life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book and it certainly held my attention but I wouldn't put it in my absolute love it category.  I did like how Gillian Flynn divided up the book into character diary sections as the chapters.  It made for a good discussion at book club.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|You can be a whiny die hard fan and hate it, or you can simply love it. I have no idea what those reviewers who gave this 1 star were thinking because the original didn't have the super top grade effects that they claim the remake should have had I don't know they confuse me.<br /><br />This movie on it's own is the best horror movie to come out in the last two years, probably will hold that for another few years. Its got gore and atmosphere and all the effects were really well blended.<br /><br />They kept ash out of this for a reason, no one would give any Ash a chance to hold up to Bruce Cambell's portrayal.<br /><br />Great movie.<br /><br />Only thing I didn't appreciate was the tree rape... to me the original seemed more painful and realistic... which come on I'm talking about a tree rape how ridiculous is that?
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is filled with adventure, frendship, love, and exitement.Its a test of courage and trust for the charicters.And a nail biting final battle.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is a charming, very funny and very perceptive study of a man who thinks he is Doc Martin. I couldn't put it down. For understanding and sympathy, I would rank it with 'The Art of Racing in the Rain'.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I own the 4 movie collection set (great deal on Amazon.com) and watch it religiously around Halloween. While I agree that the movies really slacked off with the third and fourth films (seemed like they stopped trying), I have to say they redeemed themselves with number five. The acting, writing, and gore seriously stepped it up. I watched this in 3D in theaters and it was great! Now I own the DVD and still have to turn away during some of the more gruesome moments! If you like Final Destination, this is a must-own.
B00003CXCQ|3.0|Poor quality by today's standards.  Great classic story, but I would wait for the updated version when it comes out.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I don't think I ever read this book as a child, but I do remember seeing the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. My only complaint is that it ended too soon.<br /><br />This is a free copy typed by volunteers so there are occassional typos. If you can't overlook that, I would suggest purchasing a different version.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I really enjoyed Pollyanna's optimistic outlook and the way she was a postive influence on others.<br /><br />This is the free version though and you have to remember that it's typed by volunteers so there are sometimes typos or hyphenations in the wrong places. If you can't overlook those things, then you should buy another version.
B001RTCP1A|5.0|Loved this movie in blu ray with surround sound.  It may not be one of the most popular movies but its rather well done and edge of your seat.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Suddenly this game quit playing on my HTC One saying there was a &#34;kernel error&#34;.  I had to uninstall it, repurchase it and download it again.  Still having the same issues.  It was fun while it lasted!
1439170916|5.0|Deftly interweaving millenia and centuries' scientific anecdotal discoveries (unbeknownst at the time) with his recent experience in treating cancer patients, Dr. Mukherjee in a human and professorial capacity teaches us whence this illness derives.  His literary and philosophical allusions make it deep and fascinating.  As a cancer survivor I plan on re-reading it and have gifted it to friends.  Wouldn't the world be a more beautiful place if more people were like Dr. Siddhartha?
B0015DWJX2|5.0|A delightful story full of little-known history about the Channel Islands during the war. Wonderful character development; serious but whimsical at the same time. I couldn't put it down!
B000T9OP7G|4.0|I really like this first season. Each episode is action packed. Those who like the movies will like this series.
1400069289|5.0|WOW! I wish I had read this book when I bought it a year ago. But maybe I wouldn't have gotten as much out of it then. Anyway, this is a life-changing book for me. I highly recommend it. Along with the classic Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\\" this is my favorite self-help/professional book. The book is divided into three sections: The Habits of Individuals, The Habits of Successful Organizations, and the Habits of Societies. When I began reading this book, I intended to only read the first section. The first section was so good, I decided to give the second section a shot. The second section was just as good as the first section, so I ended up reading the whole book. Normally, I love sharing my copies of books with friends, but I won't let anyone borrow my copy of this book because I will be referring to this often, and I have written a lot in it! Highly, highly recommend! I could gush about this book for hours!
0385474547|5.0|This is the best book I have read thus far this year. The movie is closer to the book then any I have seen in recent . Not that I am a expert or anything just watch it for yourself on YouTube.
B000ICLRIE|3.0|I picked it up to test a bluray player for a friend and the movie was okay. Its not something id watch all the time but its good here and there.
B001TODCII|5.0|I will find you, and I will buy this movie! This is a fast paced movie that isnt too long so you dont need to feel bad about yourself when you sit on your broken in couch for a little under 2 hours.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|This movie is cheap laughs nothing special but nothing bad. Just the common every day movie. But how can I complain it was 5$ when I got it.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This was a really good movie. Im reviewing the item as an item not as a movie. Came in perfect shape because it was new. What more can I say?
B000W91RUG|4.0|The Big Bang Theory is a really good show. 99% of you wont understand the stuff they talk about but its okay! there is a laugh track to cue you into when to laugh!
B00005ABTT|5.0|I think there is a reason this was not included in the 20 years of bond set. It was bad, but hey, its 007!
B0041KKYEW|5.0|I love this movie, as a male. It was pretty good with a lot of mental break down components to it. I watched it with my elderly mom and she loved it too, but the masturbation seen was odd to watch with her in the room!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I am not a super hero movie fan but my god can that Joker act. One of the best things I have seen in my life. Sad he has to go.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I bought this with my Kindle Fire HD and it is the best case I have seen. It is a good balance between heavy duty and small and portable. The inner shell is a plastic casing that the Kindle fits and clicks into perfectly. The outside leather casing is durable and stylish. I also love the fact that you can rotate the inner shell so that Kindle can stand both Landscape and Portrait-wise. Would definitely recommend this to be the case to buy for your 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.
0525952926|5.0|Writing long mandatory reviews is annoying and people should not be forced to write anything. A star system is enough to express opinion.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It would be nice if you got stuck that there was a place to go for help in some of the rooms, makes it difficult to move on.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app brings a feature that should have been included in the Kindle PDF reader -- annotation. Although the way it highlights is not as accurate as the Kindle MOBI reader, the freehand and note features work like a charm. The only drawback of Adobe Reader is that it takes longer to render PDF with several pictures, BUT they look much nicer on Adobe Reader than on the original reader or on any other app, such as OfficeSuite or QuickOffice.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a pretty cool game for any horse lover. Great resolution. I think  they anyone could enjoy this game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It can help pass the time while you wind down. I would definitely recommend this to all who have a fascination with this game at the arcade (LOL) or even those who want to just simply pass the time. BEWARE, you will be sucked in. :-)<br /><br />Suggestion for the makers of this game: Once you reach a certain amount of coins, there's really nothing you can use them for. I suggest a &quot;opt-out&quot; for dozer dollars! I currently have over 1000 coins but no dozer dollars. :-(
B000001FKY|5.0|What a great time period for music, def leopard is one of the all time great bands of the 90's
0439023513|5.0|The Mockingjay book is the third and final book in the Hunger Games Series. I had read so many reviews before buying this book for myself and a majority of them stated that this book was not as good as the 1st and 2nd books in the series. So not true!!!! The third book was super good! I was surprised on how the story unfolded. The first part of the book was very boring to me because it was basically just explaining Katniss' thoughts and feelings about the war, but DON'T STOP because as you get further into the book, the story picks up and becomes so suspenseful! I literally would read for hours on end because at the end of each chapter it leaves you with soooo much suspense that it is nearly impossible to stop reading.<br />I will admit that there are so many characters in this book that I often had  gotten confused on who was who, which would often lead me to reread parts of the book just to get a better understanding of what is going on in the book. There are far more deaths in this book than any other book in the series, in which a majority of the deaths were very violent! I'd recommend this book to readers who love reading about war and love. This book has a surprise twist at the end of the book. No i'm not going to tell you the ending but I will give you a hint to what will happen. *SPOILER* As you get further into the book you realize that the Capitol has almost no chance of winning, it's a pretty obvious observation. So then you know that President Snow will get captured. On execution day, Snow is cuffed to a pole and Katniss has her bow loaded and ready to pierce Snow's heart, when she unexpectedly shoots someone else (who is very important in this book). It was a crazy twist that I almost couldn't handle! You will definitely be impressed on how well Collins wrote this book. It's definitely a great read!
8674360335|5.0|This was required reading for my child this summer and was a great deal. It was in GREAT shape and saved me about half of the cost.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was an amazingly fun game!!!! It challenged me mentally and very addictive I'm ready for more rounds to play!!! I highly recommend this game!!!
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|I like this mlp toy or modle its sturdy.looks  just like in the show and it looks cool in the box.  ..oh and the box has no tape so it makes it easier to open and keep the box safe
B005N1E8A4|2.0|I bought the blu ray version of this tour about a month ago, and as we all know its not a cheap blu ray. When it arrived I was super excite and popped it in the blu ray player. The concert itself was amazing an the picture was perfect, but when it got to the maybe the last 5 or 6 songs it started skipping horribly. Thinking that the skipping was caused by my player I took it out and put it back in but unfoutunately it started skipping at the same spots and on the same songs. I don't know if it was just the copy I bought or if its on all blu ray copy's but I would be a little cautious when buying the blu ray copy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This really caught me by surprise. An apocalyptic tale that never slows down. A tale where the protagonists are constantly changing and that formula adds nothing but suspense to an already enthralling story. I look forward to many more Silo adventures.
B0043URV8M|3.0|This is a fairly good soundtrack from Desplat. I didn't like the soundtrack as a whole, but there were a few highlights, or tracks that i enjoyed, from the soundtrack. A couple of the ones I liked were<br /><br />Obliviate<br />Sky Battle<br />Ron Leaves<br />Farewell To Dobby<br /><br />While this soundtrack may not be the best, it shows some promise for Desplat.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a master at \\"out there\\" fantasy and this short novel is no exception. The three generations of Hempstock women are well defined and their mysterious ways are well-balanced with the rationale of the young protagonist of the story. I read this in one evening and if you are a Neil Gaiman fan, so will you.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|If you were there 40 years ago this will be a great reminder of that midnight show and if you weren't there you may have seen it on tv.  Of course for some reason in the continental USA we didn't get to see it for several months - never sure why but any time you have the opportunity to hear or see Elvis - take it!!
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Follett';s knowledge of the subject always makes his fictional writing seem like it actually happened, Have read most of his books and can not put one down after starting it.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I was hoping that this movie would hearken back to humorous banter between the villain and McClain. Apparently that was too much to hope for.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|The movie was pretty predictable. The plot is quite shallow. It's always fun to see Bruce Willis in action though!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing! the graphics are quite impressive especially for a free ap. everyone should try it.<br />I downloaded it thinking my husband might like it but it is so good I cant put it down
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child keeps your interest throughout the book. Second book I've read and can't wait to get to the third one.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is entertaining and fun, however it occasionally glitches and I have to re- boot the game. Perfect for kids and teens though. :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is an excellent tool for tracking inputs from many projects. I am about ready to upgrade to paid version.
B004XANKVO|5.0|It rocks!! Super comfortable to carry....The first thing that you notice is how well bult it is! Plenty of room for my needed items on my next trip overseas...I'm loving the outside open compartment..It is really handy!!! and the hard compartment for the glasses is a very nice addition!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|How can a minion run 2500+ meters and run again in a split second? Ps:pay for bananas or just earn them? ***** stars
B0028R3NCU|4.0|This thing is great, turning my spare (not sure where it even came from) microSD card into a much more useful USB drive at a much lower price than buying a new USB drive.  I've occasionally found it useful for transferring content to my phone microSD, though that was not a consideration when I bought it.  I can heartily recommend it for anyone with a spare microSD card or who is regularly transferring things between a computer and portable devices.<br /><br />The only problem I have run into is that it doesn't like transferring large files (over 1.7GB) to some computers.  Just 2 out of maybe 12 that the reader has been plugged into.  I've reformatted into into different formats at different allocation sizes and haven't been able to lock down exactly what's causing the problem, so buyer beware.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is such a neat app. Build your parks (3 of them) and play as often or s little as you like. Love my Roars
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|This device works almost as well as I could have possibly hoped.  The face buttons are crisp, it functions well in my emulator apps, battery life is ridiculously good, and the included case/stand are great accessories.<br /><br />My gripes are relatively minor (to me), but it feels only fair to list them.<br /><br />1) The unit feels too light, which is great when stowing it in my bag but kind of disconcerting when using it.  I can't tell you why, it just never feels well-seated in my hands as pressing the nicely-crisp buttons wants to wiggle it around in my hands.<br />2) The triggers feel too squishy, which is not much of an issue for the games I play, but might matter if you were going to play high-end games.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I bought this game to play candy  crush not to look the levels don't buy it its boring if you buy it you'll want to delete it trust me
B00992CF6W|5.0|if u have a android go to pandaapp.com and get it for free just saying. so if u want to be smart and dont worry about virises.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It is so addicting and so much fun. I can't stop playing. The noises the Minions make are so adorable too!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you read the first Crossfire book in the trilogy and loved it, you will love this one just as much.  A continued dysfunctional relationship between young multi billionaire Adonis Gideon and the obsession love of his life Eva.  Throw in a murder, gay roommates, a helicopter socialite mother and ex- finance and you have a real roller coaster of a story that keeps you wondering what's next.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is addicting at first but then you start to want to try and get all the characters so it makes you play even more. It's an enjoyable game as well.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I choose this rating because it was more than a book.. it was lesson that all people need to know.. and that is, the meaning of life.
B0013TPV0Q|4.0|I really enjoyed how this book flowed as though I was reading someone's thoughts. Sedaris is a great thinker in the sense that he picks up on a lot I imagine most people would heed no attention to, and then find some humor in it. The book is not a barrage of laugh out loud moments, but it is a good cache of smiles and Silent chuckles.  The only problem I had with it was that a lot of the book is about his life as a gay man. I don't care if anyone is gay and don't consider myself homophobic but when it kept coming up I felt like it was hard to connect with the stories and feel the experiences. Others may not have this problem and Sedaris isn't lewd in any way, so don't be off put. I would say I really liked this book.
B00D3ZJB1S|1.0|I wouldn't pay $34.99 for something you can walk into Best Buy and pay $13.99 for the Deluxe version. Looks like someone bought a bunch a copies then charged a $21 premium. What a RIP OFF!!!! Go to your local Best Buy and buy it!!!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|From shows I've watched when the two main characters FINALLY hook up, everything changes.  The chemistry disappears and the show goes down hill.  I've stopped watching a couple shows for that reason.  But this show, (shaking of the head) defies all the rules.  Somehow they've rewritten the rules and gotten away with it.  Becket and Castle are exactly the same.  They still tease one another & Castle is still a big kid / dreamer - only now Becket's little smile that says his child like antics are endearing (more so now that before).  And when Castle tries to use the relationship to assert his &#34;rights&#34;, Becket puts an immediate stop to it.  Which allows the work relationship to remain as it was.  Also the show doesn't revolve around their relationship, you know they are together but it isn't the main focus of the show, thank goodness.  The writers keep the show as is and &#34;Casket&#34; (which the writers cleverly poke fun at) is a subtly focus in the beginning of the season.  Of course I'm only on S5E7, so we'll see how that changes. Hopefully I'll be finished in the next few days...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game to kill some time. starts out easy n gets a bit aggravating as the levels move up maybe its just me but id have to push a few times to click on something to pick it up but beside that fun
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I've been a fan of Nathan Fillion for a few years now.  I guess I've been living under a rock for the last 4 years because I never knew he was on a TV show!  I was channel surfing one day and saw him on some show called &#34;Castle&#34; and decided to check it out and I'm glad I did.  I laughed & chuckled through the last 20 minutes of the episode.  I was hooked.  I got online to research the show and found out it'd been on for a few years.  So I went back and started watching it from the pilot and decided to buy the last two seasons.  The cast is great, from the teasing between Becket and Castle to the sarcastic looks and comments from Ryan, Esposito & Lanie.
B000FA675C|4.0|Wish I had read it before the movie. Much more enjoyable than the movie. Must read.Highly recommended. One of the better books I have read lately.
0385342071|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book! I've read it twice & will surely read it again! There is humor & a great love story. The heroine is very likable & you can sympathize with her.
B00DSOG0QS|3.0|I wasn't totally sure what to expect with this novella. The synopsis pretty much sums up everything that happened, but when I first read it I wasn't sure how the intercourse related to the plot of the mystery/bioterror part. I'm still not totally sure to be honest, aside from the fact that the people who participate in this intercourse are the same people investigating the case.<br /><br />(I'm going to try and be vague enough to not give anything away) I really enjoyed the mystery aspect. Trying to decipher who was a bad guy and who was a victim of circumstance was fun and I definitely did not see a lot of that coming. That in and of itself is a feat, because I've found that I tend to guess the major points of a story pretty easily, so I loved that this wasn't a pushover. How the professor tied to the terrorist group was fun, as was the villain that was revealed in the end. It was absolutely entertaining and I wanted to keep reading.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the story is told from Neil's point of view, but also basically omniscient. It was unique to be sure, and it didn't rub the wrong way, only made me curious. Is it that Neil did his own sleuthing after the fact and discovered all of this on his own? Perhaps. It's not going to keep me up at night worrying about it.<br /><br />I actually really enjoyed the parts about Jack and Rachel. Being geniuses, they each had their little quirks that made them just a bit unusual. I found it a bit overwhelming at first--Rachel's sidejob, AND she's a addicted to intercourse AND she's a genius? Jack is a genius AND a musical virtuoso AND a wannabe gangster kind of? But they actually flowed really well, and while I still couldn't help chuckling when I read Jack's parts (the \\"up-nods\\" were amazing) I found that I liked reading about their lives.<br /><br />Again, I'm not sure how all of this ties together. The good thing is that there will be a part 2, so hopefully some things will be answered
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is an awesome game. I have it both on my my iPod touch and on my kindle. Some of the characters though are expensive. I really like this game. My little sister always plays it. It keeps her entertained. This app though is kind of a copy of temple run, though. I play subway surfers more than I play any other of my games. I've had this game for two weeks and now I have 137,679 coins to be exact. It's really easy to get coins, although I would never buy anything with real money, but that's my opinion
B001974DG0|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time!  I love dogs, sometimes better than some people I know.  There's something special about how they accept and take life as it comes, enjoying every moment in the  present.  People can learn a lot from dogs and I've often thought they have an intelligence and wisdom that we will never obtain or understand completely. That being said, every dog lover on the planet should read this book...extremely enjoyable. Thanks, Dean, for providing many hours of entertainment.  If you're sitting there in your robe and slippers and reading this in your old age, I hope you realize how blessed you are to have such an incredible gift for writing (as I'm sure you do).  :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is funny and sad at a part .I recommend this for everyone!<br />I love this book so much!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I could go on and on about this book. I'm sure someone already has. I will instead say do yourself a favor and just read it.  Just. Read. It.
1423377001|5.0|I loved this cd because Daniel Pink does not say to fix or get rid of anything.  He only suggests to add a new perspective.<br />Balance is the ticket here.  He does not suggest that there is only one right way.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book was as cheesy as you would expect. But interesting.<br />Only a good read if you are a bit heartbroken.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was heartbreaking and beautiful at once. These characters were so easy to become invested in and anxiously awaiting await their next move. Can't wait to read the follow-up book!
B001EBYMB2|5.0|A movie you can watch over and over again. The first part is my favorite. It give you an insite on how things were like in that time.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Extremely confusing, don't know how it works.  I gave up on it. Tried a few times but I still don't get it
B00CWY76CC|1.0|It would have been helpful if the user was given some instructions! I had no clue as to how to play the game, so I deleted it.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Very Jeffrey Archer he is writing has a style of its own. Waiting for the next book in the series to come out next year.
B00DE76PM8|4.0|This is an alright APP, don't have to open/fold a map. + and - feature is great. Have used two separate cities. Very good .
B00A4OALL0|2.0|I've been a fan of Wayne Shorter for years. I love pretty much everything about his playing. The elastic sense of time and placing and his impressionistic interpretation of harmony, his tone on both the soprano and tenor, his motivic development and witty quoting while soloing (e.s.p., for instance) I only understood the basic vocabulary of his language after studying jazz for years. He is among the most sophisticated saxophone players ever, with original ideas and a truly distinguishable voice.  Night Dreamer, Juju, Speak no Evil, The all seeing eye, Native Dancer. Brilliant albums. I was more interested in him than anyone else on the Miles Davis Quintet, his writing was essential and I loved how he appeared as the silent achiever. Always subtly reserved, eternally devoted to the music.<br /><br />This collection of performances though, are not well rounded as an album in my opinion. Shorter is definitely as energetic as ever, his playing does not correspond to the stamina you'd expect from an 80 year old musician. And so is the rest of the quartet: on fire. But perhaps too much testosterone, and not enough lyricism and finesse. The notes are insistently played staccato on the sax (shorter's responsive to his musical surroundings), the phrasing's broken up rhythmically in an abrupt and explosive way, the drums' dynamics are violent and sometimes even intrusive, patitucci sounds too much like an amp, and not enough like a wooden instrument. I miss the soft buzzing of thick strings against the fingerboard. Danilo's left hand often hits too hard crying for attention that really takes away from the melody or harmony, for example (flying down to rio, under shorter's first head.) The arrangement on pegasus for instance, although quite beautifully voiced and intelligently constructed (reminds me of bartok's concerto for orchestra) is ultimately poorly articulated and the development is not as 'musical' as one would like. It comes across as a bit disparate at times. Particularly the bit when the drums come in muscularly slamming the tom toms. On top of this you have often over excited audiences that are way too prominently portrayed in the mix. One woman even yells \\"oh my god\\" on pegasus and a crowd chuckles at the sudden nature of the 'quirky' arrangement. There's a jerk center left whooing fairly often too. I find this terribly distracting and a bit old fashioned, like a laugh track on a sitcom. I really don't need to be told when to get excited and it detracts from the sublime music this band is capable of. I think this is a purely technical aspect of the delivery, mic choice and positioning. Difficult to ignore.<br /><br />An album presents itself with a feeling. And whenever I want to listen to it again, I want to submerge myself in its world, not only the musical content, but also the technical delivery of the sound and nuance of the ambiance. I never want to be surrounded by a rude screaming audience, an obnoxiously loud drummer (no compression?), listening to aggressively crude music delivered through raw sound. It's not the 60's anymore. Some people love art because how close it resemble the real thing. And that is perfectly fine, in the end I'm only stating my opinion. For me the old photographic adage applies: \\"if you want to see reality, look out the window.\\" I want to buy a subtle, sublime fantasy of spacious and engrossing depth, that transports me away from the reality I can easily open my eyes to. I want a fiction, I want the dark passages of the album to be cinematic the spacious ones to be like a stark painting by turner. I need more color and contrast. Having said this though, I can see how someone could love this album, Shorter is still a master at his craft, but blue note is not doing their job properly imho.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a super cool game. It is kinda like WoW but it is less stupid and more awesome. The thumbs up.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Journey of Souls made so much sense about why we encounter the people we do.  It made me feel like there is a master mind in control who does give souls opportunities of free will and growth.  The book has given me peace about why seemingly unfair things happen in life and why some are called to be care-givers, others victims, and others seemingly \\"lucky\\" in life.  The book also gives one reassurance in an afterlife (and preceding ones).  The law of Karma and Grace comes in to play...a universal ying/yang.  Super book.<br />[[ASIN:1567184855 Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives]]
B001BR5NN0|5.0|It isa classic movie and shows that even the most different of people can be friends. I really enjoyed this movie
B0027MJU00|5.0|An amazing book. I could not put it down! Looking forward to reading more of her books. Highly recommend this one!
B00008NEQM|5.0|Very pretty selections, reminds me of Catholic church mass music in Latin as well as Enigma or Lesium groups. Recommend Era and this album in particular which repeats a few selections from other Era albums.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|My first experience in this genre was Ransom Riggs Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  While waiting for the sequel, I came across this find.  Full of fantasy, magic, alchemy and adventure, I highly recommend it.
B000007MVD|3.0|Two disc set of early Beatles radio-live songs are interesting. Good price and many of the songs show influence of 1950s rock and roll.
1781162646|4.0|This book may not be what you expect when you look at the pulp cover and the title, at least if you're expecting a spooky, over-the-top gore fest about a crazy Carnival demon on a killing ramage.  What you will find instead is a really well written coming of age story about a character that you will surely like.  Face it, he's a likeable guy and I really enjoyed spending the summer and fall with him in Joyland.  King's success comes from his characterizations, he writes clear concise characters that are the real bones of anything he presents and it's no different here.<br /><br />I won't ruin anything with a plot spoiler, but I will say if you are a King fan, and enjoyed books like Lisey's Story, Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis than you are mostly likely going to enjoy this as well.  There is a lot more to King than crazed lunatics on a rampage (Under the Dome).<br /><br />If you are looking for something with more bite I would recommend these by King:<br /><br />Cell<br />Pet Sematary (often referred to as his scariest)<br />Desperation
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|my choice of 5 stars should be all that is required hence, this is the only time I will make a comment.  I love them all that is why I choose them
1907523588|4.0|We are discussing this book in a MOOC (massive online open course) with a Brown University literature professor through Coursera. His insights on the novel deepened my understanding of it. Some of these insights were:<br /><br />* Mrs. Ramsey is one of the most mesmerizing figures in literature of all time<br /><br />* This is a unique story of a married couple - most novels have a single heroine in the beginning<br /><br />* No one has written like this<br /><br />* Woolf had a remarkable sense of class differences which are described in this book<br /><br />* Literature brings internal landscape to the table<br /><br />* Proposition that most couples are odd<br /><br />* It's miraculous when we make sense to each other<br /><br />* How expansive this novel is<br /><br />* This novel reveals how promiscuous is the nature of thought - it veers off into tangents easily<br /><br />* Woolf writes about the destruction of family - can relationships survive over times is the great question of the novel.<br /><br />Our group discussed what the lighthouse stood for. Some ideas - it stood for self, aloneness, perhaps even for Ms. Ramsey. It stood for eternity compared to the waves, or moments, of time.<br /><br />We all agreed that the writing is gorgeous in this novel and it's a brilliantly constructed novel. However, it's not plot-driven if you like that sort of thing, and it has a melancholy complexion. We want to read MRS. DALLOWAY next which the professor was Woolf's other great book. I wondered who influenced Woolf's writing - who were her favorite authors?
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is a great character.  I'm enjoying this series by Lee Child along with the Bob Lee Swagger series.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I have had my sonic screwdriver for about a year and I absolutely love it! As a big Doctor Who fan this is a must have. It extends very smoothly and the UV light works great. The sound effects are a bit tinny but its hardly noticeable. My only concern is I have used up all the ink in my UV cartridge. I thought I had read somewhere that you could buy refills but have been unable to find them. If anyone else knows where to get refills for the ink nibs please comment. Thanks for reading!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As always, exciting, but I wish he would finish it!!!!  I read all five books, one after the other, in the past<br />few months. Now I have to wait 5 years for another installment?
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Not being familiar with the movie before I found it on Amazon for instant viewing, and then not feeling overly enthused after reading the description, I was very pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a really good movie with a great ensemble cast. I especially loved the kid who played the son. Good music and really nice cinematography, too.
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy challenging games like this one. They never get old. I like the artwork and Gold trunks, chains, etc.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Changing from fractions to decimals and vice versa becomes a snap with this little app.  Great for the home shop and those projects which require precise measurements in decimals and your measuring tape shows only fractions.  Save me plenty of headaches when fixing a broken deck umbrella.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love trying to beat this game. Kids can probably beat me at this. There is one I cannot beat. Hang'em high number 1. I haven't finished any of them, but I'll keep trying!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Killing off characters that are so pivotal, coming up with plots which speak of universal human truths, and making characters who were once hateful lovable?  Yes, all here, and all great storytelling.  Thanks for this great season.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Overly amazing story, great prospective of a boy's life in India, across an ocean with a tiger and ending up in Mexico. I was pleasantly surprised when the boat ended up just south of Puerto Vallarta Mexico, where I was reading this book! I couldn't help but wonder, at the end, which version of his story was true!
B000YABS8E|5.0|It is one of the best movies . It is something I think that could have or happen . The cast was perfect and would not be this good with out them
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is simple to use and it could be used for any basic math you may need it for without any difficulty.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and all the twists and turns that it provided. There's so much revealed in this book that you're left questioning up to this point, and it's fantastically satisfying.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I finally was able to read this book. It is timeless. What a wonderful writer and storyteller Frank Mc Court is. What an awful life this kid had. I can't believe he survived it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new update ruined the app. My kindle keeps freezing. I Uninstalled this app. I was happy before the change.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|Its no xeon but its pretty solid. these things kind of depend on what your doing with them like gaming or art or whatever your needs are.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I wish they would unlock more but other then that it was fun and cool to play i made my sister in princess version
B002WY65W4|5.0|this fell during what i concider a great movie era. This movie, scott pilgrim, and kick ass all were ridiculously good. funny movie kind of makes me want a twinky but alas they dont exsist anymore.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun but it stinks if you don't have a Facebook because most of the goals have something to do with it
B000FC11A6|5.0|I love this book.  It never lets you down as it jumps between characters and eras.  The Stephenson has managed to make a long novel seem like a short story.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely fantastic read!  Romance written from the male Pov, Drew Evens is arrogant, handsome, rich and spoiled and as he tells about falling in love you can not help but to laugh, feel some sympathy for him and come away with insight into the male brain. This has got t o be one of my favorite books!
B00506NRBS|4.0|It is nice to get an easy to read motivating story. I appreciate the unique approach sivers takes as a small business owner and especially the message of do what makes you happy.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|I have been a beatle fan since I was a kid (just saw McCartney). I have all the cds all the movies and boxes full of collectables . I already had this movie on dvd  but the quality is a definite upgrade. if you are a fan get it, if you are not you should watch it just to see when music was fun.
B0056TYT66|5.0|Good PCI Express USB adapter which you might need to use a new SSD for work desktop PC.  Works well with the Samsung 840 Pro 256 GB SATA drive.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Fun and full of surprises! Great entertainment. I love Stallone! Chuck Norris was a great and showed up just in time.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I didn't watch this show in the '70's and decided it was now time. I love it, and would probably watch it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game for players and they are a minions too try too be the minion of the week and you are a star and try to run more for points
1401235425|5.0|The Court of Owls story arc may be the greatest Batman mystery I've ever read. It somehow acts as a relaunch of Batman's origins - while it doesn't focus on his origin, it certainly visits it and makes some shocking twists in the formula by the end of Vol. 2 - and as a continuation of the old Batman series. That's really the only complaint I have against this New 52 line of Batman stories - I only recently started reading Batman graphic novels, and don't have a handle on the full history of all the characters (I know most, but not all - for instance, I had to look up how Tim Drake became Red Robin of the Teen Titans and what Damian's story was - and the largest one, how Barbara Gordon was once again Batgirl), but this book assumes for the most part you're aware of the characters and the slight changes the New 52 line makes. But that's it - the only complaint!<br /><br />The new villain, the Court of Owls and their assassins, the Talons, are one of the best new additions to Batman, I think ever! I immediately fell in love with their mystery, and how they tied into the pre-existing history of Batman, his allies, and Gotham City itself. They definitely bring Batman to the craziest I've ever seen him get, and the ending (which I won't spoil) leaves you wondering how Batman and his family can ever win.<br /><br />I will offer this advice. Buy Volume 1 along with Volume 2. You definitely want the full story - the best shocks are at the end of the whole story, even after the slight twist to Dick's origin (but that's all I'm saying about that!)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have read. The twist in this story Is amazing and I couldn't put the book down. This story had me going through all the emotions from sadness to happiness to anger to laughter. I would definitely recommend this book for people to read. I don't want to spoil the story so won't say more but if you are looking for a good book to read this is definitely the route to go. Colleen Hoover did a great job and I look forward to reading more of her books!
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Normal remake rubbish - good gore but that's it.  No atmosphere, no scare's, annoying characters.  I am not a stuck up purist - loved Dawn of the Dead re-do, but this was just poor
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's awesome but it won't change the city I'm stuck in Paris please change :)  thank you for creating this
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is fast pace and of course fun. Moves to levels quickly. Fun little characters too. But great all ages.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This is a fun and well designed game. The graphics are really sharp and the game play is consistent without many bugs. The story line is weak as you would expect from a dungeon crawl, but it could use a little more substance to its plot even with that fact. It does a good job of getting you hooked and making you want to come back to it soon. The weapons and gear are intricate which add a nice element to the game. The biggest issue I have is that the weapons are  far too expensive and take too long to buy if you're just playing the game without putting real money into it but everybody has to make a living somehow.
0385611471|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite books. One of the books I will recommend to anybody. Heard about the movie being made. So I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good parody on our society sending our young off to war to fight our battles while we watch on the evening news!
1781162646|5.0|He's not called King for nothing. I couldn't put it down, luckily it was a book so I could go to the back to find out how it ends(that's the only thing I hate about the kindle)the older I get the less patience I have.
1490313370|5.0|I knew of James Altucher before reading this book, his life story displays resilience and non-conformity. I have continually followed his blog posts through Quora for over a year and I've learnt a few things from him. This book was however refreshing and filled with some pearls of wisdom and a myriad of practical advice. The author's nonchalant writing style is a big plus in this work.<br />You should get a copy of this book, you will NOT regret it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|doesnt even have the level i wanted help with, just wanteds to give it a try, i unsinstalled it. oh well
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun. too bad it isn't longer... but it does say that more levels are coming soon...sooo.... yay!!! cant wait! escape games are addicting! D= Hebe x]
B008YKGQR4|1.0|i downloaded this by mistake, so it was uninstalled and i downloaded the other FB app which is much better
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|The Man Of Steel is back and this time for good! What I like about this take of the character is that Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan kept his mythos mostly the same but also added in their own realistic tone to give Superman a go for this generation and for those past and in the future. This version also did not tip toe around the fact that Superman was and is an action packed character and with Snyder its a win all around. Also worth noting is Snyder used a handheld camera for I believe the entire film yet except for 2 or so scenes it wasn't noticeable and it didn't annoy me or anyone really and in fact it made the film more \\"real\\" and less polished, it also helped give you the feeling a man really can fly, again! All in all this is a faithful adaptation that is worth repeated viewings and will be looked back upon as the film that gave Superman his popularity back and added some more in depth mythos. 5/5 stars.<br /><br />Note: The cast was remarkable! Henry nailed the character just as much as Reeve if not better and Kevin and Russell were excellent in their respective father roles.
B00CLMA3HK|5.0|Jess had witnessed her mothers disappearance and has been plagued by nightmares of the event ever since. She is on a mission to find out what really happened to her, while her brother remains skeptical of her reasons.  This story unfolds beautifully and the characters are easy to relate to and its easy to feel that they are real. This author writes a great story with each event leading flawlessly to the next.There are many things I want to say, but cannot due to being afraid I will reveal too much! This is a must read and I look forward to the next book in this series.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Takes a lot of time to build enough resources to really enjoy the game. I still like playing it in my spare time.
B002RVCD6O|1.0|The 6th installment in the Harry Potter movie adaptions is a disappointment for anyone who has read the books, and confusing for those who haven't. Large sections of the plot have been removed, whilst adding in nothing that contributes significantly to the story. As a consequence, hardcore Potter-heads are left feeling disappointed with the adaptation, and non-readers simply cannot follow the plot. All meaning has been drained from a story which was full of subtle nuances and heart.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This product has been great so far.  Love the access it gives me and the convenience it provides!  I would recommend this to friends.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It very fun and entertaining have tons of fun I truly recommend it ! I didn't give it five stars because you have to buy costumes with real money to get farther in the game .
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|By far, the funniest book I have ever read but I haven't read Ellen's new book yet soooooo...well, we'll see.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I hope people think the same way about this game. The game reminds me of when I had my horse.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|It's a fun game and makes you want to keep going to check out next levels.<br />The one think I don't care to much for is the time for example: It will let me play 3 or 4 times (same game if not a winner) and then it wont let me play because the timer shows 30mins, so I have to wait those 30mins or 20mins. WHY???? Why is there a time limit? There is no time limit on Angry Birds.<br /><br />Please see about changing that time limit to zero. I wanna play when I want to play Bubble Witch and not have to wait till time is over.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I really liked this book it was pretty interesting if you give it a chance. So I am looking forward to seeing what is the next generation. This is a good book to read. I give this book a good  rating and the fact that it is a good book to read, I am looking forward to reading more of these books.<br /> This book  is really funny, it tickled my funny bone a lot. But the fact that it was funny, I think that more people should read it. Even my sisters loved the book. It gave everyone a new way to laugh. But the funny thing is, my sisters are only in elementary! They are learning to love these books.<br />  I think the more you read, the better the books get. The reason I give this book a 4 is because there are some parts I wish he did better or parts that are just out of this world.<br />  You never know what's going on in this head of Greg's!
B007THA4FI|1.0|J.K. Rowling had shown real ability with the Harry Potter series but, that ability was diminished with &#34;A Casual Vacancy&#34;. It contains excessive and unneeded profanity and some sections bordered on pornography.  Rowling is capable of great writing without resorting to such things.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|It is the perfect series: well written, interesting characters, beautiful sets, gorgeous costumes and wonderful story. What else could one ask for except not have to wait for the next season? I will now be counting the days until the 4th season is released.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I have been playing Jurassic Park Builder on my Kindle Fire HD for several months and I have had no problems.  The graphics are good as well as the audio.  I play this game several times a day.  My one complaint is that a couple of the most popular dinosaurs can only be purchased with real money, but I must remember this is a FREE game.  Over all I enjoy this game very much.
B005544V6A|5.0|Loved a very sympathetic portrayal of the Corporate America environment. Even though main characters seem to be a little bit too knowledgeable about everything to be realistic - it's nice to watch &#34;corporate superheroes&#34;. I am totally overlooking simplifications of some business cases to enjoy the show. This is the 2nd show that got me hooked in the last 10 years.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love despicable me and this game is so cute and fun! It's an all around great game. Even my 2 year old loves it!
B00AG51RU6|4.0|This is a great action movie for those that like a lot of action. I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The kids really enjoyed this movie.  Loved the concept and other characters that were featured in the film, like characters from Mario and other old games.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Nice game. could improve on graphics. had real fun playing this game. looking forward for more updates from the developer.
0544002318|5.0|I'm a very picky eater and will likely not embrace Scott's diet BUT it was an awesome read. Really enjoyed.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very interesting book covering a long time span. It gives insight into  a different culture. A very good author. Try it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It's awesome and super fun after I started playing it and then I convinced my brother amd dad to start playing it. I love it and I would totally inform and convince people to start playing this game I hope everyone loves it ad much as i do!
B003L77GG0|5.0|The DVD set came on time, was in condition stated, all DVDS in working order. Met my expectation of what I was purchasing.
B001HLZMUE|5.0|WHO DOESNT LOVE RHPS?! I have watched this show with my mom since i could remember and i absolutely love it. I did the time warp for my schools musical for halloween and have even learned how to do various makeups from the cast. But i absolutely love tis dvd and i also recommend Shock Treatment if you are a true hard RHPS fan you will watch these and fall in Transexual love all over again
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have only had this game for a little but and I am already in love with this game. It is great for people who love horses.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you want to understand the mechanics behind the economic collapse this is the movie. Some will be in denial because they don't want to face the truth. The movie will get technical at times but always gives you an explaination that is understandable as well. Plenty of blame to go around.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Great cast .John M. deserves an oscar for his role in this. The cast was excellent.<br />It was funny, intriguing and very human all at the same time.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I am a regional sales director and us my phone almost 80 hours last month.  Earpiece and charging unit together make it trouble free.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Gkids 8 & 9 are really into Oz, so fun to see them enjoy a version of the story I so enjoyed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game but need more lives. I can not get enough of this game. I would play it all day long but got to work sometime. Huh
B002SAUCBC|4.0|One of Stephen King 's best, though it comes under his Richard Bachmann pen name. I read this as part of a collection called The Bachmann Books. Just a great story about a time not too far from now. The study of group dynamics and behavior in life, death and exhaustion situations is eery. Loved it
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Typical Rollins. Was exciting in parts. I read it 3 weeks ago with 3 books in between. Memory is shot tho.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Great movie for my kid who found that he loves Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars.  Cars has excellent voice acting, a fun story with a moral about doing the right thing, and good humor, and just plain fun for everyone.
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|my grandson loved this watched it several times... hes 6 years old he really liked the aliens. So its a cute story and different then from the fable we learned as kids.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My two year old and nine year old love it. I find myself playing it sometimes too lol. Kids the kids entertained for quit I while.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Such a fun game! I don't like the advertisements and hate how long it takes to do a task though.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|We wanted to share some alien time with our teen boys.<br /><br />An old movie good enough to be watch again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Getting the hang of it!! I love the minions from movie,  so this game is just to cute!! Will recommend to friends!!
B000GG4Y32|2.0|Reds, 1981 film<br /><br />This is the Hollywood history of John Reed, a journalist who went to Russia to cover their Revolution and became a supporter. Old people talk about their recollections. Reed is buried in the Kremlin, the only American there. Louise Bryant is shown as an unconventional wife. When a political meeting discusses the Great War Jack Reed makes a short speech. Is this war about \\"Profit\\"? Louise meets him. Jack spouts his beliefs. He writes for \\"The Masses\\" magazine. Jack and Louise become friends. They go to New York (Greenwich Village). We see pictures of real people from the 1910s and scenes from that time. Can society be changed if all the workers in the world united into one big union? [No, human nature creates differences even in one country.]<br /><br />A meeting is dispersed by the police and armed citizens. [No problem with the Second Amendment then.] Jack leaves a publication over their editing. [Don't they all do that?] He argues with Louise over their styles. They put on plays and discuss current events. [As if their opinions were important.] Provincetown becomes an artsy resort. Louise is left behind when Jack leaves to cover a political convention. Gene O'Neill enters Louise's life. In 1917 Wilson declared war (the Zimmermann telegram). Jack develops a kidney disease. Will they support the war? There is jealousy over romantic events. [Basic human emotions, love and possessions.] Jack's diseased kidney is removed, he is warned by his doctor. Jack plans to go to Petrograd to cover politics. They see soldiers by a train station. Kerensky continues the war. Jack interviews Trotsky and Lenin. There are problems in Russia (desertions, food shortages, etc.) Jack speaks at a political rally. They sing a song.<br /><br />Jack and Louise are happy together. They return to America, their Russian newspapers are confiscated! Louise is questioned by a political Committee. Aliens were deported (if politically undesirable). Jack wrote \\"Ten Days ThatShook the World\\", about the Russian Revolution; it was successful. The Socialist Party purges a number of its members. What will they do? A small group discusses politics (interpersonal conflicts). There is a Socialist convention in 1919 Chicago. Those without a red card are rejected, these form a Communist Labor Party. Others form a newer party. Jack will be sent to Moscow to get authorization; he has the background. Jack is a writer not a politician, says Louise. Who is following Louise? Federal Agents enter her home to look for Jack Reed, accused of Sedition.<br /><br />Jack is arrested in Finland, then released later. He does not have a USA passport. Louise goes to Finland. Jack speaks at a meeting about labor unions in the USA. He is outvoted and leaves. The Bolsheviks have taken over the newspapers and other organizations; those who object are shot. Jack is sent on a mission to the Near East. Anti-colonialism is the policy. Louise arrives in Russia. Jack speaks against oil companies. On the return their train is attacked and shelled! Louise meets Jack. He has high blood pressure and can get a stroke. He dies in a hospital.<br /><br />The credits roll. The witnesses were not identified as they spoke. One says few know about Jack Reed today, Aside from his book \\"Ten Days ...\\", who remembers the journalists from that era? Is this movie worth watching? I think a history book about that era would be better. Should a man with a serious disease know his limitations? What would have happened if he lived? Not too many know that the 1918 Revolution in Germany ended the Great War. It was suppressed by the forces that later brought Hitler to power.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg this game is fun for kids and everyone with awesome power ups people to destroy if you don't like it you wouldn't like anything
0756697875|5.0|I went to six stores trying to find this book and every single book was missing the Batman Minifigure that's in the bottom right hand corner of the cover. One store had about 10 books they brought out of the back room & all books were missing the minifigure !! I ordered it from Amazon & the book arrived in perfect condition with the minifigure in the cover. It's an impressive book .. I was so happy to find it & thrilled with the care that was taken when shipped. The price was less than in the stores so that made it even better. It arrived 2 days earlier than expected. Great service & great product.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Love it! I must admit, when I first received it, I thought, hummmm, looks pretty rinky dink to me, but when I started reading through the manual and using it, it works GREAT!! You really have a lot of control of your images, you just need to want to and work with it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I RUN a Kindle Hd. Loved the old app. The new ones maps are terrible, can not figure out how to zoom in and out, coloring and layout is bad,moving from site to site is a pain. Guess I'll try the Weather Bug
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|What is it with the women in Danny DeVito's films.  From &#34;Throw Momma&#34; to &#34;Matilda&#34; he comes up with the most frightening b*t**es ever.  This time he's meet his match with little cute Matilda and sweet Miss Honey.  Great family film (but a little scary) and my 83 old mom loved it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When j firs bought it I hated it because I was a noob but as I got better I realised  this is awsome I got better better then I got pocketinveditorpro hacks for pe only and I could switch from creative to survival edit my inventory and edit my terrain like replace red stone with diamonds so get pocketinveditorpro or pocketinveditor but in the free version you can't edit terrain or spawn animals monsters dropped items but yeah if you get this app it may be expensive but don't worry it's totes worth it.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I'm a sci-fi junkie.  I'm willing to watch some admittedly horrible movies as long as they claim to be sci-fi.  Most of the time I come to the same conclusion as the majority of other people. :-)<br /><br />This movie is an enjoyable action sci-fi movie.  The movie sets up a premise of an alien invasion, and adds some twists to keep it interesting.  One is that the aliens aren't the normal advanced science aliens that would normally be expected to have invaded earth but are rather more animal like.  Another is that the first to recognize the invasion is a group (gang) of kids.<br /><br />This film also avoids one of the more annoying problems that that plague sci-fi shows and films.  Characters knowing things that they really shouldn't have any idea about given their background.<br /><br />The characterization is really quite good for a sci-fi film.  Unlike many where the characters are assigned names, professions, and wait to be slaughtered. This movie attempts to provide some sort of back story for each of the characters.  This however doesn't make them likeable, as I ended up rooting the &#34;hero's&#34; while still disliking them.  I feel that this adds to the film.  It makes the characters more human rather than just cardboard stand-ins until they're needed for the shredder.<br /><br />The story ends at an appropriate point where the kids are no longer going to be involved.  This still leaves a bunch of questions, but at least the part of the story you're watching is complete.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Ok, so many negative reviews and I kind of get it. Kind of. The ending is not what any of us probably imagined, but that's the beauty of reading. I'd much rather be surprised then read pages and pages of what I knew was going to happen. Of course I do wish it would have ended differently, but to rate and review an awesome book on just the last page is not fair. I put off getting Requiem because of those reviews and now I'm a little pissed. I loved this series and was eagerly awaited the final one to be crushed after seeing the poor ratings and reviews.<br />Please, if you loved this series,you must read Requiem. I thought it was amazing, I fell back into this world so
B00C81LYH2|3.0|It's pretty and nice. I wonder how many are purchased for play rather than just collecting. I got it for collecting. The box could have been stronger and more durable. If it were not for the Vine program, I would have waited to buy till after holiday discount.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of reading a book that sent me scrambling for my collection of spy movies!  I was reminded with every page how much I loved the James Bond movies, the old Avengers TV show and the pile of classic novels I've had hidden in the bottom of my closet for years.<br /><br />The characters are just real enough to be related to but they keep up more than enough of that \\"super spy\\" mystique that gets the pulse racing.  The story was interesting in the same way.  It had a charming way of keeping to the classic tropes of the genre while not being cliche or boring.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book and I'm waiting anxiously for the next release in the series, Operation: Trinity.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Best book I've read in a long time.  I really love this author!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Just when you think you have it figured out....BAM! Another twist you never saw coming, can't wait to get into the next book!
B009NY43NY|1.0|And not in a good way.  I LOVED the Sookie books but what happened?  It was like she was over the series and she didn't care what she wrote.  It was very disappointing.  I feel kinda gypped and now there's another one...I don't think so.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|took a little while to enter the universe, but when finally getting there the reward was so fine. I'm in a hurry to buy the third book now. Need to know what happens - no clue...
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I waited on this for so many years! i did own a few black market forms of it but the actual release, was worth the wait.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Words are not enough to describe the fun this brings.  I purchased it as a gift, and of course had to try this out, I loved it!  Hail-fire is a great name for this, as it sends these nerf darts out at an amazing pace.  to fully enjoy it though, you will need to purchase the add on clips, and extra darts.  This gun comes with only 4 &#34;short&#34; clips for 24 total shots.  It can use long 18 dart size clips, and hold up to 8 of those for the maximum 144 capacity.  This is a must for a parent who wants to win the Nerf war!
B000000OXH|5.0|(Asia Alpha) is my favorite album of all time! It was released in early 1983 and i remember buying the cassette and luying on my bed and listening to this beautiful piece of art over and over again. This is a great album to fall asleep to because of it's beautiful mellodies. I also had my first love at the same time this album came out and they just went hand in hand. It has a certain hauntingly beautiful feeling to it through out the enitre album. This album is hugely underated and for me this is there best album by far! It showcases the bands creativity to write beautiful powerful music on a grand scale. My personal favorite track is (Never In A Million Years)! Just listen to the beautiful horn sounds on that song. I don't think the world was ready yet for such a work of art. (Asia Alpha) was by far ahead of it's time then and perhaps today. BUY IT' BUY IT' BUY IT!!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|One of the best miniseries ever made. I've been looking to buy this set since the series came out and had forgotten about it in the last year or so. When someone told me they got the blu ray set on Amazon for $32 I just couldn't believe it. Went and checked and bought it instantly. What a steal.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|just like subway surfers but better the minions are so cool and the graphics are great the bosses are pretty hard
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a very entertaining book. The life of an ordinary, innocent, girl flips upside down when she meets a filthy rich man who's secretly into some kinky stuff. A lot of sex scenes in this book, so I wouldn't recommend this book to the younger generation.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great app that teaches you how to take care of a horse. My son and I play all the time. A great app f or the whole family.
0439023521|5.0|I really liked the twist of events throughout the book. I also enjoyed the creation of this future world. This is a great underdog story.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I bought this book after i saw the movie Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise. Lee Child isn't Shakespeare, but he is a great story teller. This book is full of action almost from the very beginning. Easy read and I couldn't put it down! Great recreational read.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is good most of the time! It does have problems sometimes like when you can't like or comment on your friends posts. It's nice to play the games and interact with friends and family for free. There is no other place quite like it. I play on it twice daily. I have met many friends from all over the world. I can chat with them, send messages to them, and help each other in the games. The best part is, it's always free.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Stuck on Mars!? Are you kidding? Really? Really.  Mark Watney is an interesting mix of realist, scientist and Robin Williams sarcasm.  I can hear him in my head reading his daily logs!  The humor and wit with which he faces his possible demise on a distant planet, alone and unable to communicate with NASA are refreshingly honest and in my household, totally believable.  My husband and children and I are all mastering in Sarcasm, The REAL Language!  He is ingenious in his endeavors and laughably human in his errors, mistakes which could cause him instant death!  Keeps me right with him every day of his almost 2 year ordeal to survive and return to earth.  A must read!

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Abraham Lincoln is one of my very favorite historical people.  Mr. Lewis' portrayal of this down to earth, earnest, passionate and very intelligent and wily man who became the President was excellent.  The book this is based on gives you more about his entire cabinet, but this movie is ALL about Lincoln as President, as a man and as a husband and father.  Truly enlightening.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have loved this series from the beginning. It was sad knowing this was the last book.  I enjoyed the book as I did all of the others, but I hoped for a bigger bang for the ending.

B001AW156U|1.0|For the longest time I only had two controllers and the trigger attachments I bought in 2009 from Game Stop for $.99 each are still in use today. When I finally got two more controllers last month and discovered Game Stop had stopped carrying their trigger attachments I was forced to look else where and settled on these, mainly because I couldn't find them anywhere else. Within a month 3 of the 4 triggers I had purchased were broken. These are junk if you buy them they won't last long.

B00ADIT8U2|4.0|The puzzles are tricky enough to keep your attention, but the graphics leave something to be desired. The only problem is that the game is so addictive that you want to play it through as soon as possible, so it ends up being a downer when you realize there are only 3 levels.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It held my attention the whole time and the minions were a hoot.  Can hardly wait for the second one to come out.
B000F8O35U|2.0|The movie is a copy, it is a good copy but it takes a while to read on the DVD player. The case was a made up case by the person selling it. The movie also seems like a different version. Overall it wasn't worth $25 spent! Very unhappy.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|The last album, Sounds of the Universe, was so good that it seemed like Depeche Mode was going to really deliver with this new album. It feels like they went out of there way to make a slower and radio unfriendly album. It reminds me a lot of Exciter, a low point in my opinion, but if that's the sound you like... Here is Delta Machine.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|This show only lasted 3 seasons but it started a TV  pattern with all its imitators and spinoffs.  Technically it is not as sophisticated  as its successors, but then nothing ever is.  Technology moves on. What  makes it special is not merely being the first (on TV--in books It has been around a long time), but  that all the others have their Captain Kirk  and Spock and Ohuru and even Bones. The plot similarities are there too.  All of them are Space Opera and give us the heroes that are for the most part missing in real life.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I'm really enjoying my dinosaur park so far. (by the way, HUGE time killer. Just sayin.)<br />There are glitches now and then, such as disconnecting from the server or getting slow, but generally it helps to exit the app and restart my Kindle. Works well after that usually.  Graphics are pretty neat; it is a lot of waiting to collect coins and stuff, but still pretty neat. If kids like dinosaurs, this would be really cool for them (if they can stand waiting). I'm about 8 dinosaurs in and the longest wait so far for something to build or hatch is about 4 hours, so that's not too bad.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty cool your own project horse<br />Unique<br />Meet new people who are in the game also and own their own project also

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Ugh. So frustrated with this &quot;upgrade&quot;. The previous version worked great, but this one's terrible. Far too much precious tablet space is consumed by ads, and the simplicity and user-friendliness are gone, not to mention the bugs this one has. After using and loving the WC app daily for 2 years, I'm looking elsewhere.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great to play on a rainy day I like the way the people who desinged made it like the original temple run but they added more fun and excitement to the game:)
B002NN5F7A|4.0|This was a powerful movie and great acting.  Great actors brought together for this movie.  My husband enjoyed the movie more than I did.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This game is quite good. I was wrong,and I was stalemating. Checkmate is when check is inescapable, but stalemate means there is no move to do, but the king is not under check
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Removes background noise and gives strong, steady sound. The storage bag easily attaches to the camera strap so it is always there when you need it.
0786888628|5.0|It's been called the forgotten war, and after reading David Halberstam's deeply chronicled and heavily researched book about the Korean conflict, it's easy to see why. There were enough blunders, both military and political during that long, frigidly cold war to last one nation a lifetime. Or two nations, as this masterly work reveals, both the United States and China. Very much a study in personalities as much as military strategy-- or its lack-- the book follows the career path of two men, Mao and MacArthur, as they rise in stature among their people, then succumb to the same kind of hubris along the way. In their own way, both Douglas MacArthur and Chairman Mao Tse Tung made big, bold, epic calculations about Korea that turned out equally misguided.<br />When Kim Il Sung's North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel in June 1950 victory for the North seemed inevitable, just a few weeks away at most till Korea, Kim's Korea, would be at long last reunited. In the South, Syngman Rhee was equally determined to reunite His Korea, in the opposite direction. America, riven by political division over `who lost China,' Democrats or Republicans, very soon lost any level of objectivity about Korea. If Korea was the forgotten war, it was also the inevitable one, with its conduct and eventual less than optimal stalemated end leading inexorably to future similar theaters of war. According to The Coldest Winter, Korea almost surely begat Vietnam and similar politically-driven American adventures, right up the present day.<br />The book is not complimentary to Douglas MacArthur. Tracing the general's personality back to his own father, Arthur MacArthur, a general in the American Civil War, Halberstam dwells on MacAthur's ego-driven military orders, his conviction that he, the great Douglas MacArthur cannot be wrong, and the way he surrounded himself with sycophants, blinding himself to certain realities. One of those realities was the entry of the Chinese into the war. After Inchon his blindness only got worse. In defiance of reality, and against Washington's express demands, MacArthur insisted on driving to the Yalu River.<br />On the other side of that river a recently deified Mao Tse Tung insisted that his armies, recently victorious over nationalist troops, enter Korea to prove the world that they're more than a match for the vaunted American military. Mao's own hubris turns him back. After the battle of Chipyong-ni in February 1951, a triumph for American and UN forces at a site of the Chinese Army's choosing, the tide began to turn. But in who's favor?<br />Truman, Acheson, MacArthur, Ridgway, the joint chiefs, democrats and republicans in the U.S. Congress, all entered the battles in far off Korea for their own political reasons. From his Tokyo headquarters, the Dai Ichi, MacArthur grew more and more distant, less interested in military reality, seeking more and more to bring war to the Chinese and thereby-- in his estimation-- to defeat global communism and burnish his own image. As one of his aides said later, he should have quit after Inchon. One too many acts of defiance to his commander in chief, and Truman had no choice but to fire the worshipped general, then try to overcome the political backlash that firing unleashed. It says something about the state of 1950s America, and our paranoia about communism, that a general standing against it was given more leeway with the public than the president of the United States. It says something even more distressing that that general's open discussion of using atomic weapons in Korea was lauded by that public.<br />The Coldest Winter wraps up with coverage of the stalemate where the war began, a description of both present day Koreas, North and South of the 38th parallel, and a tribute to some of the men who served that brutal, needless war. Sequel to The Best and the Brightest, Halberstam's book precedes it historically. If it had been available prior to Vietnam, this reader would like to think the latter war might not have been begun, or at least not continued.<br />The only criticism I have of The Coldest Winter is that, though many surviving veterans of that war were given space in the book, the story still revolves around those big men who, more often than not, made terrible decisions that put those troops in harms way. Too bad Mister Halberstam, with his considerable journalistic skill, couldn't find a way to glorify the true heroes of that forgotten war.<br />Byron Edgington, author of [[ASIN:1622490371 The Sky Behind Me: A Memoir of Flying & Life]]ke to think the latter war might not have been begun, or at least not continued.<br />The only criticism I have of The Coldest Winter is that, though many surviving veterans of that war were given space in the book, the story still revolves around those big men who, more often than not, made terrible decisions that put those troops in harms way.

1452115567|5.0|Beautiful book with a great story about how mans best friend can change your life! A must have book for dog lovers!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book is done as a series of interviews that are &#34;left out&#34; of the UN report about the war.  It's the human tales, but provides enough details that you can figure out by inference what happened.  I enjoy books of this nature, anecdotal tales told by people who were there.  I recommend this because it's easy to digest, the author does a fairly good job of giving the people that are &#34;interviewed&#34; different voices so it doesn't sound like the same person telling different stories.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It's 1986, and Eleanor has just moved back in with her mom, her mom's husband Richie, and her four younger siblings in Omaha, Nebraska. Eleanor is not typical. She has curly red hair, is far from being a size two, and dresses colorfully. When she meets Park, an on the fringes half-Korean boy, they bond over comic books and music, which propels them quickly into one another's hearts. Even when they know they won't last, they dare to hope for a future together.<br /><br />I fell in love with Eleanor and Park quickly and deeply. Eleanor is broken, with her insecurities and her tragic life, but she's witty and sarcastic, and wishes so badly to change her lot in life. Park has worked for so long to be accepted by his friends, but finds that he doesn't need their acceptance when Eleanor is around. To be cheesy, they complete one another. Each brings out the best in the other.<br /><br />I loved seeing the slow progress of their relationship. It's filled with mutual respect, love, and a bit of lust. At times they're awkward with one another, exploring new facets of a relationship they've never experienced. It felt very true and natural to me; every word didn't seem perfect, every action wasn't the exactly right thing, but that's life.<br /><br />It's hard for me to have especially high expectations for books that everyone gushes over, but Eleanor & Park definitely deserves gushing. It is the epitome of contemporary YA, keeping true to life while giving a heartfelt story.
B002QYUV5M|5.0|I had seen the movie years ago, but after Iron Man 3 I realized I wanted to see it again to see if I could sense the director's touch in both films.  Everyone in this movie delivers a great performance, and it's got a great combination of funny and serious.  Well worth the time.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The cast of characters were well chosen..and the score was lovely. Makes getting older tolerable.Well directed and good acting. Great movie!<br />Bravo.<br />Encore
0143143492|5.0|Good audio book, listened twice and expect to listen a few more times. I have been on the spiritual path for many years now and this book provided some much needed guidance on my journey. His stories were entertaining and made a lot of sense.  Some of the material was heavy and hard to follow, but each person who listens is intended to have their own experience with it and what was heavy for me, may be easy listening for another.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My granddaughter loves this show and used to watch it on Netflix all the time.<br />Then her parents got rid of Netflix and she was sad, so I bought the film for her.<br />She was so happy and we had good &#34;grandma time&#34; together watching &#34;her&#34; film<br />for the first time!  It is a great show and very well done!
1878424750|5.0|Enjoyed this one tremendously. I have been gravitating away from organized religion and more towards spirituality for the past 10 years. This audiobook is right up my alley and Deepak does a nice job using analogies to explain the law of attraction (what goes out, comes in, e.g. the tied, gravity etc.). I would recommend this one and would buy again.

B009MF5BXK|2.0|That's the best I can come up with - it's dumb -; one long series of implausible set-ups, grating action, & lame dialogue. It put me to mind of an R-rated episode of the old 80s cartoon GI JOE ( I swear, if you listen closely to at least 3 of the big shooting scenes, you will pick up Terry Crews yelling \\"Go Joe! amid the background noise). I have always liked the work of Sylvester Stallone & I still do overall(with several glaring exceptions), maybe because I grew up just outside Philadelphia & he actually looks & sounds more than a little bit like one of my uncles or because at almost 70, he still looks like he could run through a stone wall; but this thing makes it way too easy to forget that he is the guy who wrote Rocky & acted in Cop Land. It was interesting to see Van Damme playing a villain but not to have him named, in essence, Villain (as if they knew this s*** was so bad even while they were writing it that they'd have to label rather than name the characters), & I really feel that Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwartzenegger have now clearly & finally run their course. Dolph Lundgren's vast talents were sadly under-utilized & Chuck Norris..., well, he's his usual dazzling thespian self, you can be sure of that at least, & it is just too clear that he, along with everybody else on display here, was paid a lot of dough just to show up & be whoever they are...unfortunately, ...& now there's going to be a third installment. Wasteful in so many, many ways.
1250006341|5.0|This is a must have if you are a Downton Abbey devotee.  It fills in the empty time between seasons.

B008JFUO0Y|4.0|The movie is very good, super scary, super gory, I was very impressed. Doesn't have the humor and campiness that the original did, but I like it. I didn't want an exact remake like some people did. There are some nice twists, awesome effects! It's too bad this didn't get the complete Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy release.
0316228532|1.0|Addicted to Potter, but understood this would be completely different.  I believe I approached it with an open mind.  Ordered it as a gift for my adult daughter, also a Potter fan.  She had read only a little when she said, \\"Mama, I don't think you are old enough to read this\\".  I am 76-years old, but she was right.  The language is vulgar and coarse in its entirety.  The characters were people I recognized from my own experience, nearly all a bunch of losers.  In Rowling's hands, none of them seemed able to get a grip and rise above their situations.  I found no redeeming value in this work.  An acquaintance told me she read only a few pages and discarded the book.  I wish we had been that smart.  I was so certain that Rowling would come through with something to lift and challenge the spirit. I gave the book away with instructions to not return it. What a waste of her talent and my time!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I purchased this app about a year ago and I loved it! I felt like I trusted this app more than other weather apps since it was it was easy to follow and showed you the forecast that was pretty accurate.  However, it went through the latest update that changed the whole look of the app.  I don't know if I like it yet because I am not sure how to use everything they added or even why they decided to completely revamp the whole look.  They have four different tabs now, and I only use the forecast and the map tabs.  I do like the new map tab since it works better and loads faster than the previous version did.  The forecast tab does have a better layout and easier to read.  However, there is a videos tab and a now tab which I don't use at all because I don't need those tabs on a weather app and don't have the time to figure it out.  You also earn points, why I don't know?! But, I have earned points by navigating through the new version after this update.  I am not exactly sure if I would recommend this app, now, to someone that is looking for a weather app.  I have wasted a bunch of time trying to figure things out and how to navigate.  I will be looking for a simpler weather app for my kindle fire that is easier to use.

0446573027|3.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher / Lee Child books and it was interesting to come across Zero Day by David Baldacci.  I had never read Baldacci before and found it interesting that his main character in this book is a Jack Reacher type:  Military, big guy, lone wolf, street justice oriented.<br /><br />The book was interesting in the first half but then progressed into having too many implausible plot twists.  The Reacher books also have interesting plot twists but are somehow more believable and I've enjoyed all the Lee Child books.<br /><br />I see there are many more books by Baldacci so I intend to give others a try.  I would rate this book three stars since it was enjoyable but not memorable.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Hammer productions has eschewed modern concepts of the horror film and stuck with the traditional model for the Ghost Story. Not a horror story in the modern mode, but ghosts in a haunted house. In this case, there are grieving adult ghosts and lost children ghosts, all making themselves known to the hapless law clerk who has been warned that if he failed to settle the estate of which the haunted house is a major component, he will lose his job. Of course, he receives a cold reception from the townspeople, while his position is even more compromised by the fact that he, a widower, his wife having lost her life in childbirth, is expecting his own child to join him. What a dilemma.<br />While not a superior film of its type, it is well done and has its share of ghostly effects. It should constitute a good evenings watching for those who are fans.

B001CGJ3QS|5.0|i thought i knew these sonatas quite well until i heard this set. if you're on this page at all reading this review, stop now and just buy it, is all i can say. i'm very happy that i did. this may be the best music purchase i've ever made (Itunes library currently displaying 174 GB of music, 71.6 days worth of audio!)<br /><br />i may be a sucker for slightly oldschool sounding recordings, but really the audio quality is charming. the performance cannot be praised enough. a particular favorite is the second movement of sonata #15. buy this set! you'll be happy you did.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|this is a good game. lots of fun. but it freezes up all the time and is slow. even with Internet connection! I love to play this game but It is hard Webb it is frozen I have even had to whit down my device to get it to work again it was locked up because the game froze
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I'll recommend  this book to a friend, but it's a little bit too simple, not much history and characters not real
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author is able to bring me into a time and place that I couldn't imagine before.  The characters are so amazing. The story line was confusing for awhile, but Khaled brought it all together beautifully.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a great game to play when you have a hour or two during down time.Quite addicting if you are competitive.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|The writing was so that I felt her pain, physically and emotionally. I actually identified with a few parts of the book, especially the loss of her mother.
B008JEJNDE|5.0|Crocs aren't for everyone  - but let me tell you - my husband wears the crap out of these.  Every day when he gets home, they go on. He wears them to the store, to run errands - you name it, he wears his crocs!<br />These are as clunky as they look but he doesnt care. He loves them.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I downloaded this book onto my Kindle accidentally, but decided to read it.  I'm very glad I did.  I've never seen Eben Alexander speak, but apparently he's made the talk show rounds.  Completely unprepared for what he had to say, I was enrapt by his discussion of the days he was comatose.  As a skeptic, I am convinced that his words are honest and the experience real.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a very challenging game but very fun and worth the money with things u can unlock  u will have  hours of fun
B003UBTX7C|4.0|What starts out in one direction quickly moves you to a long journey in discovering the true mystery of this story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love how truth and fiction intertwine in the brilliantly written novel.  Stephen King at his finest.  I would recommend this book to just about anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun way to waste a little bit of time. Buying items through the store is not necessary to enjoy it.
B000091O0Z|5.0|Belinda Carlisle is a very talented musician and singer. All her songs are catchy. And you just want to sing along with her. Her songs are playing inside my head all the time. Heaven on Earth in the vinyl edition is in like new condition. No scratches or skipping. Very Pleased with this purchase. Thank you Amazon!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I found this book to be very engaging, entertaingm fun, and with more than a few profound passages. I liked the Kindle version very much, as it was neatly formatted and easy to read. Highly recommended!!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was a story of a young girl's life that was neither beautiful or joyful until she met a woman who wanted to put beauty and joy into her own life by giving her love to other. The unconditional love given to this young girl was revealed by sharing her knowledge of the Victorian  language of the meaning of flowers.  Knowing this language opened up a new world in which the young girl had to find a way to trust.
B002QVFON4|5.0|Not another peep..time to go to sleep...Still scares me to death lol..this movie is a classic could watch it again and again this is a halloween tradition.. The remake is also amazing. DEADITE FOREVER
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Love it but upgrades are expensive is difficult to achieve without buying them with real money but it's addicting to play
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book earned more credit from me than some others I've read based on writing alone. And don't get me wrong: there is much more in this book. Character and plot design were stunning and warm. But the word-working was better than anything else I've read.<br /><br />Let me explain. Perhaps you think good writing is flow and a knack for grabbing your attention. I would agree to that definition with no grudge. But great writing, truly great writing, loves itself. Great writing brings its words to you, whispers them in your ear and says, \\"All of these are for me, but you can hear them.\\" And in that way, the book is much like Kvothe himself.<br /><br />The thunderclap was black? Cut-flower as an adjective? Twice? Glorious.<br /><br />And what characters! The secondary characters were thick and personal, and the main characters  (counting Kvothe and Denna) are powerful and unique. You get a sense of why people like one another in the plot without it needing explanation.<br /><br />Very well done. Truly.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Since I really liked all the previous SS novels, I could hardly wait for this one.  My only disappointment was the ending.  Thought it kind of flat for an up-beat gal like Sookie.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I had heard so much about it , I had to see it for myself.  I enjoyed it.  I would recommend it
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Overall, I thought the album was pretty good.  The price was very good, at $3.99.  I was hoping that I would enjoy the full album as much as Thrift Shop, but to me that was by far the best song, and the rest are just okay.
B000002IOY|4.0|It had been so long since I've listened to this album or any of Overkill's music. I still love it. There is a funny thing that escaped me as a young fan though. The lyrics can be extremely corny & often straight-up hilarious. The music, the vocal melodies & the unique sound of Bobby G's voice will always remain among the best in thrash metal from this era though regardless of the funny lyrics. Overkill had such a &#34;metallic&#34; sound with tons of attack, the way their bassist calibrated his distortion pedal, it really makes the music sound incredible. The bass is definitely unmistakably Overkill which is awesome.  I'll always be a lifetime fan.  .............DECAY AWAY!!!!!!!!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I'm not a Blu-ray/HD aficionado, but I have the means to play Blu-ray discs and I have an HDTV, so I wanted an HD version of the Star Wars Trilogy. To me the picture and sound was great, clear and crisp but still maintained the &#34;look&#34; of that late 70s/early 80s sci-fi grit. I haven't looked at the extras that may or may not come with this set, so I cannot comment on that.<br /><br />The one thing I really hated (along with, it seems, every other nerd in the world) was all the CGI Mr. Lucas went back and put in -- the worst scenes being the Mos Eisley Spaceport arrival scene and adding the Sarlaac coming out of the Pit of Carkoon. This is where watching these in HD is not good. The CGI looks awful, it's like suddenly being transported into a SyFy Channel original movie. Lucky for us it's only a handful of scenes across the three films.<br /><br />If you like the original movies, want HD, and don't mind some crap CGI here and there, then go ahead and pick this up. Great price and you'll be happy with it.

0062255657|4.0|Rich in myth, imagery and amazing magical moments that as a child you knew to be true. Gaiman is THE storyteller of our times, a time when we seem to be falling back on our fairy tale roots and mythological inheritance - the stories that remind of us our humanity. I read this in one sitting, and because he painted scenes so vividly my fingers craved to tickle Ocean's ears and my mouth watered for honeycomb :) - best line that I took away \\"How do you pass at being a person?\\" - what a true thing, something we are all asking ourselves too much these days - Well do I pass??

XD XD XD XD XD
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy the game, it's a lot of fun that will keep you occupied and entertained for hours. The only reason I did not give five stars is because of the el macho update I noticed on the phone version of this app. I was thrilled to hear about it and immediately jumped on my kindle fire, but alas there was nothing. It was quite disappointing, for both me and my eight year old. Please make the election macho level for kindle, that would be most awesome.

B003O86FMW|4.0|A well written second book that made me download the very next one as soon as I finished  reading it.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Lately, I had been going through a rough patch - feeling lonely, desperate, discouraged as if I was wasting away, with nothing good happening in my life. Then as if on cue, my sister suggested that I read The Secret as it had helped her deal with a difficult period in her life. Simultaneously another close friend too said the same thing. Desperate for a change, I begun reading The Secret. As I read it, I felt a change within, just as the book said, 'positive thinking attract positive outcomes, encouraging the universe to re-align itself to give you what you want.'<br /><br />It was very encouraging to note that the true changemaker was the 'I' within. 'I' had the ability to change 'my' life. Whenever the going is tough, change in one's perception, belief in oneself and the commitment to change allows for miracles to happen. The Secret helps to identify that 'strength' to initiate changes in one's life. I strongly feel that its a book one should only read when they truly want to take that step - when they're internally ready for that change.<br /><br />I would also recommend reading The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy for equal motivation and inspiration.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|This is an amazing app. Now the other reviews were right, you don't get all the benefits like commenting, watching in something higher than 420, but none the less the app is amazing. You are able to sign in and view the people you follow to see if they are on live streaming. You still have all the channels to choose from as well. The only downside I would say, if your watching a video and then press the hone button by accident to leave instead of backing all the way out. Then you do run into a little bit of lag which should only last about 2-3 minutes. Other than that this app is great. All the channels worked for me an  I had no problems finding what I'm looking for. If your a person who loves to watch people can  this is a good app for you.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I actually paid for a signed first edition copy of Neil Gaiman's The Ocean At The End of the Lane. Those of you who know me are probably shocked. I usually only pay for independently and self published authors, so this is a change of pace for me. But as always, I will make an exception for Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />As an author myself, Gaiman has probably been the one writer who has most inspired me. Through his works (both in comics, graphic novels and books), I have learned about the art of true storytelling. The Ocean at the End of The Lane provided me with this very same experience. There are so many widely-published authors out there who are very good writers, but they still can't live up to the storytelling ability that Gaiman has all but mastered.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane begins with an adult who is remembering a time from his childhood. These memories, which start out hazy and then begin to clear, involve an adventure with a young girl (who is so much more than that) who shows him a world he never knew existed - a world of magic, wonder and villains made up of old dust rags.  It is about a man who is looking back and fondly remembering the things that both excited and terrified him the most during his childhood, those things that we all too often forget as adults.<br /><br />Gaiman has a way of looking at the world with a child's eyes. He can take ordinary objects and make them fantastical (the monster essentially made of dust rags). It is a gift that is rare in today's world and has always served to stand Gaiman apart from other writers in similar genres. I can almost imagine that at times, just for fun, Gaiman wraps a sheet around his neck and sees himself as a superhero. Perhaps it's a case of refusing to grow up (and we should refuse... often) or some sort of magical writer's ability, but reading his work has always made me feel like I was a 10-year-old hiding under the covers after bedtime to read.<br /><br />The Ocean At The End of the Lane is only second in my all-time favorite stories by Gaiman (Stardust being the first). It's a must-read, something I encourage everyone to buy it and support an author who always that stands out above the rest.Lane is only second in my all-time favorite stories by Gaiman (Stardust being the first).

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|An amazing story that you will not put down once you get started.<br /><br />An amazing love story with an ending so surprising I was shocked how it all came full circle.<br /><br />Several events are sensitive in nature but nothing too offensive that would turn off a reader.<br /><br />Heartfelt & amazing!
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|Love the artists that were on the album and really enjoy the songs.<br /><br />The explicit material is mostly for the 1st song. Just having that 1st song  would do it for that labeling
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I dunno, this book is just out there. It's funny, frightening and cool. It's Stephen King meets Yeats, with a touch of L.Ron Hubbard.<br />Not for the weak minded or the fanatically religious. It might offend, it makes you question, but most of all it makes you really think and think hard.<br />I think? LOL<br />Like I said, weird, but cool.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I prefer Sigh no more to this album.<br />There is language in this one (F word) but not like in sigh no more (wish that album came with the radio version!)<br /><br />The album is a lot more melancholy

B004MYFV0O|3.0|If you already have some ability to draw like I did (I am an adult who took art class as a kid) and you are interested in reviving your interest in drawing, I wouldn't recommend this book because it starts on the premise that you have ZERO knowledge or ability or for those who can barely draw stickmen.<br /><br />If on the other hand, you're a complete beginner or just never \\"got\\" drawing, then this will be an excellent primer. I marked it as 3 stars because it didn't suit MY requirements, but I can see that it would suit beginners totally. Its a fun workbook style text and not so heavy on theory, but on the doing.<br /><br />I opted instead to get \\"Keys to drawing\\" as it seemed to suit my requirements better.... let's see!

B0071BGOJC|5.0|This book is as good as the first book of this saga (Fall of Giants). I loved both books and I´m waiting to read the third book.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Neil Gaiman's novel is in many ways a small-scale enterprise: it is short and it takes Gaiman's vintage blend of realism, humor and mythology to a much more intimate level. Yet like the central image of the ocean which fits into a pond (or a bucket), and in itself is only a metaphor for spaces and times infinitely vaster, the book manages to become a narrative which reveals endless layers of meaning beyond and beneath its surface. I thoroughly enjoy Gaiman's work, yet his narratives have until now kept their distance. Ocean at the End of the Lane, on the other hand, touched me in ways and depths I would not have exptected.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|This book is good for a week end, no more. But you´ll going to enjoy a good week end anyway.

B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This is, by far, one of the most fun zombie-oriented games I've played. The idea is simple, overly so really, but unlike so many games, the simplicity actually enhances the experience. The controls responds perfectly, which is crucial considering what type of game it is, allowing you to tilt your device and keep on keeping on. (You can also choose not to use tilt if you are so inclined, but that removes a lot of the fun in my opinion.) There also isn't a lot of control; you tilt and you tap. No direction arrows or other nonsense to clutter the screen.<br /><br />Basically, this takes place after a chopper crash drops you in an area filled with the undead. The landscape starts off as a cleared field with grass with a few zombies here and there, but morphs into cornfields that are tight to maneuver and forests where you have to think fast. It changes up as you endlessly go forward, speeding up the further you go. You tilt to the right or left, zigzag; anything to avoid hitting a zombie face-to-face and getting that gruesome death scene. You glance off of them as they grapple too, sometimes stumbling as you hit trees or fence lines - it's pretty engrossing. I like that, because a near miss isn't a fatality.<br /><br />There's three types of gameplay: Classic, which means surviving for as long as you can. Massacre (which is unlocked after a specific number of objectives - which are fun to do, unlike many games), which is kill as many as you can, and Hardcore (also an unlock), which is hard. Objectives are charted in leveled tiers, with three to a tier, maybe asking you to go so far or glance off so many zombies, or kill so many with a specific weapon.<br /><br />And, yes, you get weapons.<br /><br />As you progress, you'll see either flares with boxes or crosses marking graves that you can try to get to. The boxes have weapons inside of them that are unlocked as you progress through mission tiers, getting better as you go. You start off with a handgun that takes more bullets to get kills, then a chainsaw, then a shotgun that blasts groups, a better pistol, a sub-machine gun and so on. They appear randomly, so you never can plan, and are pretty fun to kill with. A little planning goes a long ways, but I'm bad about getting carried away and using mine up too fast. Once they're empty, you toss them and keep moving.<br /><br />You also earn coins as you move and earn them fairly quickly. You can use them in a few ways, either skipping missions for a reasonable amount, unlocking guns early, or buying a power-up at the beginning of your run. The cost is good so you can buy power-ups a lot, with a modest run netting an easy 100 coins, and with an individual  power-up costing that. There are five power-ups total and you can stack them (and stacking them is fun), choosing from a companion dog that runs through and takes out zombies, a head start (up to 1500 ft), more ammunition, more boxes, or being armed from go. They're a lot of fun to use and make doing missions fun - this is one of the few games I'd rather buy my power-ups in instead of getting something unlocked for cheap to get a new gun.<br /><br />If you're impatient, you can unlock all your weapons by buying coins to do so or by saving up, and you can buy a coin doubler, more coins; the usual stuff. I actually purchased a doubler just because i like to play and because it was money going toward a worthy game.  It's free to try and addictive, so what's there to lose? It really is one of the more addictive games I've played recently, high-praise from something I first thought, \\"going forward, how fun can that be?\\" when I heard about it.llets to get kills, then a chainsaw, then a shotgun that blasts groups, a better pistol, a sub-machine gun and so on.

B0098XY5VK|3.0|I played this game on the computer and i loved it so i was excited that it was on the kindle. I played it and i was satisfied until  i finished the Bronx level. Then you have to buy the full version. I mean seriously why are all the games like this these days. At least make the free version have more levels. Please make the Bronx level longer!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|I must agree with many that rated this, that because you can't see ahead where you are going it takes some time to move ahead in some of the games. I wanted to get it because it was the closest game to Donkey Kong country style I have seen, and since I don't have any system games in which to play or buy those I thought I would try it out. It's okay could be better could be worse, but couldn't complain to much was free.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Best Batman animated movie yet! faithfully and tastefully done. With a clear appreciation for Frank Millers original work. Must have with the Part 1 of the movie as well.

B00B5JBZGS|2.0|Have you heard Alive or Just Breathing? Yes? Well, what about The End of Heartache? Oh you have? Hmmm. How about As Daylight Dies? Oh. You've heard that one too. Well, if that's the case, then you've heard this album too. While not exact duplicates of these albums songs, there is such a sense of familiarity that there is no excitement with this new release. I've been listening to Killswitch Engage since Alive or Just Breathing came out, and found every album after that to be phenomenal. I even bought their first self-titled release.<br /><br />This album just seems like they did a mashup of various songs and only altered a few notes or song structures to come up with this repetitive release. Is it still KSE? You bet. If you've only heard a few of their CDs then you won't be disappointed. However, if you've been listening to them since you their first major label release then you've heard it all. If a band does not evolve its sound, over time the band, and its \\"signature sound\\", become stagnant. This is what has happened here.<br /><br />I listened through it twice, because I hate just about every bands new CD on the first go through. I didn't even make it through the second listen completely because I was so bored. This happened to Metallica with their Load/Reload albums for me too.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I really like the premise behind the book.  But I am a little confused.  Was the authors intention to make you dislike pretty much every character in the book.  If so, she did an awesome job.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this is a very good app to get if you don't have it for the pc.  I recommend it for all minecraft fans who want to have minecraft for a lower price
B004LROMSO|4.0|It's about time someone did a mature version of the king arthor legend.  Really enjoyed the show.  Too bad it got cancelled.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I also have the Band of Brothers mini-series and absolutly loved it. This is also a good movie, but I personally liked the BOB a little better. However, I would still recommend this to anyone who likes WWII movies made recently.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Well I read all the book and scene all the movies so that's that!  Enjoyed the books more but the movies did a pretty good job as well!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I stated reading the trilogy on a Monday and finished the next Wednesday. Wonderful characters, great story thanks for a great week. Sorry it had to end.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is soooo funny.  And yes it is very raunchy for those who don't like that sort of comedy but I couldn't stop laughing!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a lot of fun and makes you use your mind. It gets harder as you go but progresses at a pace that helps you figure out how to do it. I really enjoy it.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|If taken in a completely different context than the books, you will like it. Yes, at first the accents were kind of overdone, but I didn't notice them towards the end. I do like how the ending of the movie differed from the book a little bit. It was interesting.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love it..love it...love it!!!! So much fun. I enjoy the challenge and it gets harder as you go. I play this all the time!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This was such a great deal on such an awesome show. If only the series had lasted a little longer...
B00C40DJ1G|5.0|Count me among the many who fretted over Nick's departure.  I needn't have worried.  This album sounds more like a Neal Morse Beard disc than any of the Nick-fronted Beard titles did.  And IMO that's a good thing...some of the later SB stuff was getting a bit light on the prog end, less edgy with more commercial-sound leanings.  While I liked quite a few of the Nick-led SB albums (Octane in particular), there were definitely tracks I'd skip.  Not so with this new CD.<br /><br />The new vocalist sounds a lot like the vocalist for Kansas, which is a good thing.  Many of the lyrics (such as in Afterthought) and a lot of the musical arrangements sound straight out of the Neal Morse factory.  Waiting For You sounds exactly like something Neal would have done.  This album may be Ryo Okumoto's finest moment, he excels on every track.  One day this week at work, I listened to Disc 1 four consecutive times....that's how much I like this CD.  It's not perfect, but what tiny things I don't care for (like the a capella harmony bit) don't hide the fact that there is something good, if not great, in each and every song.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I don't read a lot and I'm just staring to get back into this. This book is a great story with a good message. I highly recommend it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Each of Gaiman's books are thoroughly entertaining. I do hope there is another to follow and carry on this story.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|It could have been better the plot was simple and it was so dark needed more light at times. Just Okay!
B000F3AB0Q|4.0|Gary Moore is the greatest!!  I am not really a blues fan, but I could listen to Gary all night long!!
B005XUC398|5.0|I like this movie, I watched, I read few books about &#34; crisis 2008&#34; recently and just want to confront with movie...worth it,
B0097C8XL0|5.0|my daughter downloaded this - and made me play it. I think it is cute and fun - guess I am hooked
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|I do not get frightened easily. I will admit this movie frightened me-- until the ending scenes. I found that to be a bit corny and predictable.<br /><br />Very gory....very dark....very good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|cute game - this is my first experience with these games - can you believe that - thanks to my daughter
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use any where and any time, fun as well as good for brain activity.  Addictive if you want it to be!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Think the adults have more giggly fun with this app than the kids do.  Several of us downloaded and played in the talking mode and it was a riot.
B0055S348W|5.0|If you have a wireless printer, then this is a must have app. I wish the UI was better, but it does it's job well.
B000HL09MG|5.0|As mundane as life seems sometimes, we forget how blessed we are when we are in our comfort zone. It's once when something out of ordinary happens that we realize all the things we have took for granted and start seeing things differently.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Didn't want to have to take our big case everywhere when we wouldn't be switching lenses, etc. so bought this case and it works great!  Good protection but still small enough to carry around!
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I had forgotten how good this movie was a watched it to compare against the recently released movie and found it to be better.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|I had already purchased some color film from the impossible website, which was great by the way, so I thought I could get it shipped faster if I ordered it from Amazon. So I ordered 1 pack of color film and 1 pack of the silver shade. Instead I received 2 packs of the black and white film, but one had a label that said Color Protection Film, clearly wasn't. I didn't have time to return it so I was stuck with an extra pack of black and white. I'll just order the films from the impossible site from now on.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Cheap materials were used to make this it seems. Squeaks with the lightest amount of pressure, the big gray keys next to the thumb stick get stuck, and the lcd screen broke on me. Never abused, or hit. Maybe I bought a lemon.<br /><br />The macros are very nice to have, the layout is nice as well. I just have a problem with the cheap parts that were used with this product. Sweaty finger tips are a nightmare with this. Defnnitely not worth the $60 retail price. I give it $40 tops.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The only thing is the premium stuff is way too expensive meaning no one will be willing to buy any premium items unless if they do the tasks, get level ups.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I was actually looking to get Google play and found that Google search won't work on KINDLE with out putting up all kinds of security flags. SO I guess I can't get my live tv on my Kindle.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Why?  The rubies are too expensive to buy, I'd rather have my dragon go into tournaments and get the rubies than buying anything premium for a while.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I just learned of this last week.  Maybe that's a good thing because they've probably worked a lot of the kinks out by now.  I love anything that will keep me organized and serve as a replacement for my declining memory.  My favorite feature is that I can put it on my laptop, PC, phone & new Kindle and it all gets synchronized automatically.  I'm retired so I don't need it for business, but I can think of many personal applications.  I've already used the checklist feature to make a grocery list.  I could check things off without having to remember to take a pen with me!  (Just wish I'd remembered to charge the phone.)  I will update this review after I've had more time to evaluate Evernote.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|As usual James Rollins writes with an urgency that keeps you turning pages and wanting more. Great summer read.<br />Fantastic,
B004499LX0|5.0|Mike Nichols does a riff on Cosi Fan Tutte.  Sometimes off- putting but fast moving and fascinating ....the acting is superb
B004TI5N38|4.0|This is the first book I had read with the character of John Puller. I suggest reading this before reading The Forgotten because that book refers back to Zero Day.  Sometimes the plot lines always seem so similar but this was different enough that I will remember it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I always like the adventure games by this particular author. GREAT graphics and story and just the right amount of HO/puzzle games to gather up tools and items to move you along in the game. Only tiny negative...Wish the ..'voice' used more of the tone that would fit the scene. Most games I've played the voice and conversations are rather corny and do not fit the intensity of the given scene. Other than that these types of games are really fun and usually long playing.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I always wait for the next book from this author, and I am never disappointed.  Sine &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; have loved these novels. Heartfelt, a look into another culture that leaves you feeling warm inside.<br />Great book..a must-read.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Enjoyed the book at times but found it horrifying many times. Had to put it down oft times and would not read or think about it before bedtime.Truly a disturbing wartime and post wartime story. If this hadn't been a required Book Club read wouldn' t have picked it up.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have never read anything so amazing in my life. This book is breathtaking. I saw the movie and loved it instantly, and the same with the book. I've never been so emotional while reading a book in my life. Absolutely beautiful. I love everything about it and I feel like I'm actually a part of Charlie's life, I feel as if Sam and Patrick are actually my friends. Stephen Chbosky did a stellar job on this piece and I would recommend this to anyone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the continuing story of Eva and Gidean and I can't wait to read the next book  in the series! Would recommend to anyone who enjoyed the Fifty shades series
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have always loved Tina Fey's work but this time she has really out done herself. I feel like I know her because she wrote about so many of her hysterical life moments. I am so glad I read this book. I hope she writes another one.
B0012FCEVA|5.0|Madonna is always sexier  when she's dressed up like a hot dame from the forties and thats all you'll be able 2 think if you listen to this movie soundtrack......three words<br /><br />I LUV MADONNA!
B0014YPEI4|5.0|This was purchased for my 8 year old son. He loves it. It was exactly what he wanted and more.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|I just wrote a review of &#34;Hereafter&#34;....pretty much everything I said about that film, I could say about this one.  The choices Clint Eastwood makes, in terms of actors, subject matter, storytelling technique, music, pacing....all perfect....I understand Angelina Jolie doesn't want to work with/be directed by anyone but CE now.... I can see why..... He takes you on a journey that you didin't necessarily want to go on - and find, at the end, that it was an important one, a vital one, to take...<br /><br />To be able to spin a yarn, and tell us something about ourselves along the way?.... What he does is so subtle and unobtrusive that you don't even realize how much of what you are seeing/feeling is being guided/controlled by, one of the most talented directors around - in this or any other age.<br /><br />I have watched Clint Eastwood's career blossom, fold, be reborn, and take twists and turns that I think probably came as a surprise to most....Certainly to me.... It never occured to me growing up, that Clint Eastwood would one day be right up there as one of my favorite directors of all time....<br /><br />If it has his name on it, watch it/buy it... whatever the subject matter, you will not be disappointed....<br /><br />and ya might learn something about....????....well, given the wide range of his work lately - anything and everything...<br /><br />I am proud to share this planet with someone like Mr. E.... Again - thank you for another brilliant addition to not only your catelogue of work, but to the lexicon of films that elevate us all.... Hasta - see ya at his next flick!...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing I read it in 4 days I couldn't put it down<br />I wish it was longer!
B004NOH9LW|5.0|I have now watched this twice (since receiving it a few days ago).  First of all - thanks, Amazon, for sending a free rental download to my Kindle Cloude when the purchase was made.  I work long hours, with a hefty commute into town - so to be able to begin watching at home, then watch the rest on the train coming into work - wonderful.<br /><br />The film?  I don't want to give anything away.  Too much information would spoil it.  I can tell you that I sat down to watch this film, no expectations, no idea of where it would take me, or what journey Eastwood wanted to share with the rest of us.<br /><br />Every new film I see with &#34;directed by Clint Eastwood&#34; on it, i find a new aspect to this man that i like - as a director, who knows how to unobtrusively lay out a story, draw the best performances from his actors, have a point.... you may not agree with everything that comes out of this man - I sure as shootin' have a few issues with him - but then i see another one of his films, and thank the maker (or whatever) that he chose to pursue directing as one of his acts of human expression.<br /><br />And he even scores his films, wrapping the wonderful choices in music he's picked, with musical compositions that come from some special place in his heart, his head - who knows?  Clint Eastwood never ceases to surprise me, and contintually reveals a talent for, if nothing else (and there's plenty!), picking subject matters that others might pass by....<br /><br />I doubt this movie would have been made without the CE stamp of approval on it.  I am not sure what the audience is out there for such a thoughtful, thought-provoking film.<br /><br />All i can say to end this &#34;review&#34; is:<br /><br />If you have a hankerin' to question why we're here, where we came from, where we're going, what exactly is it, to be alive, and to be dead?....<br /><br />This film will not answer those questions for you....<br /><br />but you will learn that you are not alone in your quest for answers...and regardless of what faith you follow (or not), this film will touch you, likely, give you hope in a way that is hard to explain....<br /><br />and the (Clint Eastwood) music/theme will haunt you long after the credits roll....He's the Man!....Thank you, Mr. Eastwood....
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|Silly; just silly.  So implausible that I could not suspend my disbelief. I admit to not finishing it. Went to bed with more than 30 minutes remaining.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|First things first, I forgot to write this review when I first bought the album after its release, so you shouldn't even be reading it because you should have bought it by now!<br /><br />If you still haven't thrown this on the iPod, then here you go:<br /><br />No, it's not the Justin Timberlake you're used to. No, that's not a bad thing. This album is the best collection of work I've seen from anyone! Still listening to it on repeat in both my vehicles and in the house and don't see any signs of that stopping...until around September 30 when PART TWO comes out of course.<br /><br />There isn't a single song that I skip past when listening to this album, but if I had to narrow it to a top five, in order:<br /><br />1) Mirrors<br />2) Dress On (comes on the Deluxe Version, I bought it at Target)<br />3) That Girl<br />4) Tunnel Vision<br />5) Strawberry Bubblegum<br /><br />Love the variety, love the lyrics and can't wait until the other half comes out in late September or early October.
140006922X|1.0|I expected a trenchant, well argued and literate perspective and was gravely disappointed. On the second page the author repeats the canard that the Jews killed Christ wit all the naievete and stupor of one who has drank the Koolaid. By the time he got around to his Muslim background I had grown weary. When he began to paint a picture of Jesus who struck me as a wild eyed Robert Plant lookalike i grew irritated. The book is unappealing to me on many levels. it lacks a spiritual soul. The author strikes me as an Iranian hysteric in search of some religious dogma to quench some personal family problems. In short a bore.
0525478817|5.0|I have Never written a book review - but I just wanted to say gird your loins and read this book. It is worth your time and the money you will spend on Kleenex. Augustus & Hazel, much like the universe, deserve your attention.
0142437611|4.0|This is the first work by Saul Bellow that I have had the chance to read.  I decided to start with this short novella, well... chiefly because it's short. But also because I found the title \\"Seize the Day\\" to be intriguing.<br /><br />\\"Seize the Day\\" follows 24 hours in the life of Tommy Wilhelm, a 40-year old New Yorker, whose life is in shambles. He has two children and a wife, and although technically still married, they no longer live together. Wilhelm is also unemployed and pretty much out of money and luck, while at the same time having a troublesome relationship with his successful doctor dad, whose approval and sympathy he is desperately seeking.<br /><br />I thought that Bellow brilliantly illustrated the isolation that many people feel in our modern world. Although Wilhelm is almost never alone (many scenes in this novella take place in crowded places) he is feeling isolated and lonely more than ever.<br /><br />Though short, Bellow was able to create quite memorable characters along with bits of wisdom. Here are two beautiful quotes that I couldn't resist adding, \\"You can spend the entire second half of your life recovering from the mistakes of the first half.\\" and \\"Bringing people into the here-and-now. The real universe. That's the present moment. The past is no good to us. The future is full of anxiety. Only the present is real--the here-and-now. Seize the day.\\"<br /><br />Although \\"Seize the Day\\" is not considered to be one of Bellow's greatest works, I still quite enjoyed it. I will definitely read one of Bellow's longer works.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very straight forward, handy, easy to use app. If you are looking to put a man on the moon you might need a few more features.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|If you want a title that shows off your 3D display, this is definitely one to have in your collection.  The effects are not as pronounced as in the theater, of course, but it's still one that stands out, no matter what the viewing method.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|My kids love this game. But sometimes the screen lost the focus. And is hard to return to the game. Window start to move as panoramic and no way back.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|One of the best films I've seen in regards to the mafia, to me, this film is better than the Godfather in that it plays it straight.. the characters are always monsters, and you rarely doubt it.  This is a great ground floor for every every fan of this genre.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|stuck at home w/ a broken foot...  fills some time and builds your skills!<br />Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick! :-)
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Same as the others... Keeps me going until I beat it, then on to another very similar app or a more interesting new one.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This device works great! It takes a while to customize the controls, but the interface and software work fine and are very easy to use. You can even create macros on the fly and have various presets for each game you play.<br /><br />The keys, buttons, joystick, cable and palm rest feel strong, it's going to last a long time.<br /><br />The software that controls Logitech products will eat up about 50~150MB of ram. I have 6GB of ram only and it is not a problem, but if you have less than 4GB, I'd suggest that you keep the software from starting with the OS, launching it only when you're about to play.
