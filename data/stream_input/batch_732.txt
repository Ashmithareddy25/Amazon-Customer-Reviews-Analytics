B0000028WD|3.0|Dylan's songs have been interpreted by everyone from Trini Lopez to Jimi Hendrix, & so goes this excellent collection of legendary artists.  My personal favs were Clapton, Winters, Johnny Cash, & Tom Petty.  I was less impressed with John Cougar Mellencamp Smith Jones (or whatever he goes by now) & Eddie Vedder.    But it's definitely a keeper.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's debut album \\"Ten\\" is amazing and is one of the best albums to come out of the 90's.  It is definitely Pearl Jam's best album to date and I expect it will never be topped.  This album is very diverse and has great elements of rock and roll throughout.  Not to mention the slower, more emotional tracks which are very awe-inspiring and beautiful.  Ten was one of the original albums that really motivated me into embracing music whole-heartedly.  I was eleven when this album came out and it definitely affected me.  The video for \\"Jeremy\\" was very powerful as well and I remember watching MTV's top 100 videos countdown back in the mid-ninties and waiting with my blank tape for like six hours ready and waiting to record it.  It was like number 3 or something and by the time it was finally on I had recorded too many other videos and the tape ran out right in the middle of the song.  It was obviously very upsetting because 13 years later I still remember the incident.  This album is packed with drum infused, hard-rocking songs, reminiscent of the 70's rock craze with songs like \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Why Go\\", \\"Jeremy\\", and \\"Porch\\".  But the album also has a lighter side which is my favorite part of the album.  These songs would include \\"Black\\", \\"Garden\\", \\"Release\\", and \\"Oceans\\".  This album is a must-have for anyone interested in music at all.  My favorite tracks from this album-\\"Release\\", \\"Black\\", \\"Oceans\\", and \\"Jeremy\\".
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I was a little taken aback at Rolling Stone's suggestion of Michael Moore's latest documentary \\"You'll laugh till it hurts.\\" Now I love to laugh so much that it actually hurts, but I found precious little to laugh about in SICKO. I'm also familiar with Moore's wickedly funny trademark style--and like it too. But I also feel that Michael Moore reaches a new level here, more sophisticated craftsmanship, and a tone that is--yes, more serious.<br /><br />Critics of Moore's films have blasted them as being too personal, too politically biased and deceptively promoted as being documentaries when in reality they are little more than propaganda. All this mat well be true, but we can use a little counter-propaganda in these days of unrelenting capitalist & nationalistic propaganda. At least Moore's \\"propaganda\\" is sensitive, aware, incisive and, yes, funny too.<br /><br />The opening sequence immediately draws the viewer into an almost shocking involvement with images of accidental amputation of fingers. These images are not just for the shock value, but thematically foreshadow central events in the film. For example, the medical treatment of two amputees is contrasted between the  experience of one patient in the USA and the other in Canada.  The working class US patient was told the reconnection of one finger would cost $6,000 and the other $24,000. So the patient (who made a living working with his hands) really couldn't afford either, but could only commit to the $6,000 procedure. The Canadian patient received free treatment.<br /><br />When focusing on the state of British healthcare there is a very insightful interview with influential socialist parliamentarian Tony Benn. Benn movingly explains that a free healthcare system is not \\"charity,\\" but rather a democratic right for all citizens. Across The Channel in Paris people from all economic groups are likewise interviewed and is clear that their system too (at least prior to the last general elections) is light years beyond medical care in the USA. One woman observed that she found it incomprehensible that the wealthiest country in the world was so primitive when it came to the healthcare of its citizens.<br /><br />Makes you stop to think...<br /><br />Michael Moore pulls out all the stops for the concluding sequence (and is the first time you actually see him in the film.)<br /><br />Three people who were interviewed earlier in America accompany Moore in a small boat trip TO Cuba! Not only were these people screwed over by the US medical system--they were all 9/11 volunteers whose health was basically ruined by their courageous involvement in the search & rescue efforts. So they went to Cuba--where they received state-of-the-art diagnosis & treatment. An American woman (a nurse) who was suffering from advance COPD due to the 9/11 debris, broke into tears when she found out that one of the same drugs she needed that cost over $100 in the US, was dispensed for the equivalent 5 CENTS in Cuba.<br /><br />I knew that Michael Moore was a great film director (documentary or otherwise), now I sincerely think he is also a great man.<br /><br />OK, maybe he could use a few good fashion tips, but what the hell...?e USA.

B00009UW0N|5.0|I have seen this classic way to many times to count and it will never get old to me. NOTHING compares to Halloween, it is a one of a kind, and the first in its genre.

B00005JPS5|4.0|With the many of animated micro-universe adventures that have slithered out of Hollywood of late, what does Bee Movie have that the others don't? Well, for one it's slightly funnier than its contemporaries - but it wasn't always shaping up that way, as the first half-hour is full of obvious and predictable jokes. Bee Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) has just graduated from college and is dismayed to find that the job he picks will be the job he'll have for the rest of his life. He escapes the hive and lands in human florist Vanessa's (Zellwegger) plants. Barry falls head-over-heels for Vanessa but when he discovers that us humans eat honey, he decides to sue us. The story is thin on the ground and takes so long to get going there's no way to write a synopsis without touching on the legal case, which happens way over the halfway mark. Written by Seinfeld, who employed two sitcom writers to help, it's easy to see why Bee Movie's plot is the way it is - instead of a full story, it a series of set-ups and punchlines punctuated by small episodic adventures: the intro to the hive, the escape, the love story, the discovery of the artificial hives, the court case. The decent jokes, too, take time to come to fruition, but once it hits a groove the gags are pretty consistent there after. With Sting, Ray Liotta and Larry King making funny cameos that send themselves up, Bee Movie will entertain kids and adults alike. Just don't expect it to be vastly different from Antz, The Ant Bully, A Bug's Life et al.

B000YABV90|5.0|This movie was simply beautiful! By the way, \\"Delicatessen\\" is an \\"outrageously black French comedy from 1991 ... a postapocalyptic scenario set entirely in a dank and gloomy building where the landlord operates a delicatessen on the ground floor.

B0000013GT|5.0|If all rap was like this album, I would listen to the genre a lot more than I do. It manages to be totally out-there (the spacey \\"Wheelz of Steel\\", a favorite of mine because of the creepy Spanish guitar and weird synthesizer squeaks and what have you; \\"Elevators\\", which sounds like Pink Floyd meets rap), but really catchy regardless (title song; \\"Two Dope Boyz (In a Cadillac)\\"). They even screw with your standard \\"rap ballad\\" on \\"Jazzy Belle\\" with echoey backup vocals. These guys know how to use the studio as an instrument, that's for sure. It's not just the studio effects that make this such a good release, either. It's also about Andre 3000 and Big Boi - two charismatic rappers with interesting voices who are capable of just packing their songs with as many rhymes as possible - without getting tongue-tied. Plus some great social commentary on \\"Ova Da Wudz\\"; \\"Elevators (Me & You)\\"; and \\"Babylon\\", which might be the best \\"rap-ballad\\" I've ever heard. I love that song's chorus... \\"Oooh, I think the battle's just begun...\\". Good stuff. And the beats are pretty sweet, too (\\"Over Da Wudz\\"). But the thing I really like about this album is the hypnotic mood it has, you know? Surprisingly, I even like the generic little interlude thingy that finds its way onto every rap album (\\"Wailin'\\"). It's quite funky. And I really like \\"Mainstream\\" - again, because of all the atmospheric \\"stuff\\". And our chorus. Now here's a group that understands the power of the chorus. \\"When it ain't all peaches and cream!\\" and so forth. \\"Decatur Psalm\\" isn't quite as big as the other songs, but it's got a nice chorus and a delicate wah-wah part, so it's good. Same with \\"Millennium\\" - not a standout, but a good song because of the mood. The only weak track is \\"E.T.\\", a song where nothing happens. It seems as though something's about to happen, but nothing does. Very bad song on a very good album. But even then, it's tough to deny the power of the moving, piano-based \\"13th Floor/Growing Old\\". Get this right away. I don't care how much you think you hate rap. This isn't your average rap album. Awesome cover art, too.his right away. I don't care how much you think you hate rap. This isn't your average rap album. Awesome cover art, too.

B0000500WN|5.0|A drum roll. A quiet but steady pulse of guitars eventually building to a roar. And the Riff. So begins the best album Smashing Pumpkins ever made. Of course the song I'm talking about is \\"Cherub Rock\\", a bitter attack on snobbish critics who heap loads of praise on the indie community JUST BECAUSE it's the indie community. Okay, so maybe Billy COULD'VE picked a more meaningful issue to vent his spleen about, but I don't care. Why? It's a hard-rockin' yet melodic song, which is what the Pumpkins specialize in. The several layered guitars (all played by Corgan, because, as everyone knows second guitarist James Iha and bassist D'Arcy had broken up at the time and weren't about to go into the studio) on that song are just AMAZING - the riff, the multiple build-ups, and the solo. And the album never loses momentum from there. And if you've never seen the video, do yourself a favor.<br />Now, before I go on, perhaps a bit of backstory. The group's debut album, Gish, was a promising start, portraying them as a band with a unique sound (a mix of shoegazer, hard rock, psychedelia, and grunge heavy on melodies and emotional resonance), containing a bunch of really catchy songs that presented them with small radio hits - \\"I Am One\\", \\"Siva\\", and especially \\"Rhinoceros\\". For a while it was the best-selling indie album in history, and it was met to great critical acclaim. All was going perfectly for the group. Then, as I already alluded to, James Iha and D'Arcy broke up, drummer Jimmy Chamberlain got lost in hard drugs, and the band almost disintegrated. But Billy decided to shut out Iha and D'Arcy and force Chamberlain away from the smack so he could help him record this album - although I know Billy would've recorded the drum parts by himself too if he could play drums. The sessions dragged on, the album went way over budget, Jimmy would sneak out to get stoned. But then this album came out, and, for a brief moment, the Smashing Pumpkins were the biggest band in the world.<br />So back to the review. The next song, \\"Quiet\\", has a lot of drive to it, and is ironically a high-decibel rocker with a drum part to die for. After that comes the song that REALLY made the group huge. I'm talking about \\"Today\\", the depressing but soothing grunge anthem, with a ringing riff, quiet chorus, and roaring verses. Interesting structure, too - rather than the standard verse-chorus-verse, it takes on a rare chorus-verse-chorus. And it gave the group a Top 10 hit that, in my eyes, they deserved. \\"Hummer\\" is a good one, too. It's one of the three long, progressive songs found on this album. It starts off with this quick little Indian section, with a weird sitar riff, before going into slow crushing rock mode. Then it TOTALLY changes pace, simmering down to a near whisper.<br />So, after temporarily getting progressive out of their system, it's back to rock. \\"Rocket\\" was a single, and like the others it's really heavy but melodic rock. The riff is memorable, and I love the \\"I SHALL BE FREE!\\" chorus, with that little echo effect. The best part, though, is the end, with a guitar buildup that annihilates the two found on \\"Cherub Rock\\". It really does sound like a rocket taking off.<br />And now for a TOTAL change of pace. Other than the last part of \\"Hummer\\", this had been a great straight-ahead rock album. But that's not all this group does. See, there's an entirely different subset of Smashing Pumpkins songs: the ballads. Some huge and over-the-top, some quiet and introspective. \\"Disarm\\", the album's fourth and best hit single, is a huge, grandiose, orchestrated to the point of being cinematic ballad. It's got acoustic guitar, strings, church bells, and tympani. It seems like the kind of thing that's doomed to fail, and by any other band it would just come off as cheese. But here's the trick: Billy Corgan. It's got quite possibly the best melody and the best set of lyrics he ever wrote, and the way he sings it just kills me each time. In that context, the strings and tympani and crap only serve to heighten the emotion, rather than dumb the song down for public consumption by grandmothers everywhere. THAT is what makes it the debatable best single of the entire decade. Melody, lyrics, resonance, arrangement. What more does a song need?<br />So after \\"Disarm\\" ends, a trilogy of fan favorites begins. The first of these is the terrific \\"Soma\\". Remember when I talked about progressive epics? This is the second of the two. Only it's the opposite of \\"Hummer\\". It starts off being a soft, slow, drawn-out, simple yet gorgeous love song with some slight crescendos and decrescendos at the end of every phrase. Then things change totally. Corgan sings, \\"Oooone laaaast kiiiiiiss gooodniiiight...\\", and the whole thing kicks into OVERDRIVE, climaxing in the best guitar solo on the record. After that, it's back to soft, slow, and drawn-out. So after that is the PUMMELING rocker \\"Geek U.S.A.\\", with another fantastic drum part and brilliantly layered guitars. Oh, it quiets down for a while, but for the most part it's just beating you over the head until your cranium explodes. That is one great song. RAWWWK ON! And yes, it does rock, but intelligently. And as good as both of those songs are, neither can match the next song. I believe many Pumpkins fans would agree with me when I say it's the best song they ever made. Of course, the song I'm talking about is \\"Mayonaise\\". It starts off beautifully with a quiet, slightly twangy guitar melody. It continues beautifully with layer after layer after layer of heavy guitars with occasional squeals of feedback. And it ends beautifully with that same motif. In between then you get some downright poetic lyrics, dealing with (in my opinion, though it all depends on who you ask) drug addiction, and a short, wonderful, trippy guitar solo. The allmusic guide describes it as the secret highlight of the album, and for a change I actually agree with them.<br />So, it looks like the perfect album so far, right? Well, there's a SLIGHT slip in quality afterwards. Not a big one - I enjoy the next three songs, but not as much as I do the previous nine. \\"Spaceboy\\" isn't a favorite, but Corgan's ragged vocals are cool, and the strings are nice enough. \\"Silver----\\" is an adventurous foray into hard rock, psychedelia, and the avant-garde all at once, and while it's a cool song (at least up until the end, when it falls under the weight of useless feedback), it's not AS memorable as what came before. I'm fine with it while it's playing, up until the feedback part, but when all is said and done it doesn't really stick with me the way the longer tracks on, say, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness do. The Byrds-like \\"Sweet Sweet\\" really has no purpose being here, but it's brief and catchy, at least.<br />So after this very tiny slump comes another one of the record's best. \\"Luna\\", a ballad with a touch of the Far East, is an obscure favorite of mine. A simple, unpretentious, melodic-beyond-melodic love song. Tucked away at the end, it often gets forgotten about, but it's screaming for rediscovery.<br />What an album. What a fantastic album.

B000V9KFLY|5.0|I got this album when it first came out and have bought many different Christmas albums since. Whenever I buy a new Christmas album my first thought is \\"Will it be better then Celine's?\\" The answer is always no. Some albums do come close. Josh Groban's new one Noel was wonderful. Sara Mclachlan's was breathtaking and Jana's was beautiful and unique..but it wasn't the same. Celine's voice has the power to make you feel these songs like no one else can. Every single song on the album is amazing! There is no fillers here. Plus about half the songs were new and written the year it came out. Very rare when most Christmas albums now have mostly covers and a couple of new ones. I don't think there will ever be another Christmas album that can top this. Unless Celine decides to record a new Christmas album. :D
1593083246|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics editionis also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike.

0345298349|3.0|Arkady Renko is the Chief Investigator for homicides in the city of Moscow when three bodies are discovered frozen in the ice of Gorky Park.  In an American city, the investigation might or might not be difficult, but in the Soviet Union it is practically impossible.  Seemingly everywhere Renko turns, he is interfered with, attacked, or ignored.  The book paints a partial portrait of Moscow life and the nature of being an investigator in Soviet Russia and it's not a pretty picture.    The pace of Gorky Park was very uneven.  The first third of the book is dry and slow moving.  Then the story hits a turning point and is quite compelling until it builds to a climax where Renko has confronted the murderer as well as a death trap aimed at both him and his girlfriend.  Sadly, after this climax the book limps on for another 100 pages before building to a second, much less satisfying ending.  The novel would have benefited immensely if the author had cut the story at the obvious ending point, with perhaps one chapter to wrap things up.    All in all, this book was something of a disappointment but it does have its merits.  I would only recommend it if you have the stomach for a bleak read, because this is not light-hearted fare.  It also is peppered with sociological commentary condemning both America and the Soviet Union as corrupt.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it isn't everyone's idea of a detective story either.

1593083343|5.0|Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.     I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.     Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.     In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.

1592332803|3.0|The recipes in here are pretty good, though it's the techniques I've found more useful.  It's convenient to have a repository that tells me how to substitute tofu for eggs and such - helpful when I'm veganizing a recipe.  That said, most of the dishes I've tried have been ok, not fantastic.  Generally I had to heavily doctor everything to get a really rich taste and good texture...one recipe for carrot cake (when baked the way the recipe says) turned out so wet that I had to throw it away after a day.  If you're new to vegan baking, stick to other authors, like the women responsible for the fabulous blogs The Post Punk Kitchen (Isa Chandra Moskowitz) and Fat Free Vegan (Susan V).  If you've got some confidence in the kitchen, this book will be good for inspiration and technical reminders.
0375842381|5.0|Contrary to some arguments, I believe these books are wonderful for a Christian parent to give to her or his child. Rather than being atheist propaganda, they are kind and creative reminders that all institutions, even those we hold most dear, are subject to corruption and hypocrisy. So many churches today are corrupt with hatred and fear and this book reminds kids and adults that there is hope in the world. As a person dedicated to religious studies, I strongly recommend these books for parents and their children to read and talk about together to foster intelligent dialog.

B000VNMMR0|2.0|This movie has non-stop action and big explosions. Yet it's so outrageously illogical that it's funny in many scenes. For example the scene on the brigde where Bruce did a lot of dangerous jumping and fighting. However, he got no serious injuries! No broken bones! There's no suspense at all.    I found the first installment is more suspenseful.     It's still worth renting.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|What a difference from the original version.  I can remember how dissapointed I was sitting in a theater back in 1980 or 81.  If you are a fan of this series, you MUST see this version.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|This move has spectacular special effects. One of the best fighting scenes is between Sandman and Spiderman. I found it's not as touching as Spiderman 2.     It's worth renting.
B000MX1Y78|5.0|This is a beloved movie in France where it remained the top grossing film of all times for over 30 years. Louis de Funes and Bourvil share top billing and are true comedic geniuses.    The story takes place during WWII. The crew of a British bomber is forced to parachute over Paris. One crewman lands on the scaffolding of a building painter (Bourvil). Another ends up at the opera, in the office of a short tempered conductor (De Funes). The two Frenchmen are involved against their will in the crew's journey south and their attempt to cross into the free zone (the part of France that wasn't occupied by the Germans).    The trip provides many opportunities for danger, hilarious situations and misunderstandings. This is the perfect \\"buddy movie\\" where de Funes plays the irascible  and obnoxious member of the Parisian elite while Bourvil is a working class, generous (and often taken advantage of)  average Joe.     The classic nature of \\"La Grande Vadrouille\\" cannot be overstated. It is required viewing for all students of the French language and culture.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|With the demise of the cult favorite T.V. series Firefly, fans of Joss Whedon waited and hoped for anything new in the Firefly \\"verse\\". What they got was Serenity a truly excellent and underrated movie that stood very well on its own to new fans and \\"Browncoats\\" alike. The writing, acting and cinematography are all first rate and with the addition of a bunch of great extras this is an excellent package for any fans of great Sci-fi, or those who just like to watch really good movies! Highly recommended!!
0895260131|3.0|It was interesting but I wouldn't come to any conclusions about Islam without further study. This did bring out a lot of questions about Islam and it's origin.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|listening to Iced Earth is an adventure and a treat. Former Winters Bane/Judas Priest/Beyond Fear vocalist Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens is now the vocalist for Iced Earth. other than the vocalist, not much has changed about the music. the two instrumentals are killer, and if anybody excels at instrumentals, its these guys. if you are a listener of metal, this band is worth your time and money to pick up.
0061544493|4.0|Ok, let me just be honest. I only bought this book because I have an unhealthy obsession with Victoria Beckham, but I was pleasantly surprised. Being an avid lover of fashion, I can tell a good style guide from a bad one. This, while a little bit in the middle, tends to be more of a good style guide. It has a lot of valuable information about clothes, beauty, and other fashion-related issues, with plenty of label/store suggestions that all range from cheaper stores like H&M, to the more pricier Louboutin's and Jimmy Choo. All the while, with a conversation-style writing on Posh's part.    My only complaints, however, is that this book seems to be like one big advertisement for dVb (Victoria's label with husband, David). In each section, she has incorporated a \\"...oh, and I've created something just as good for dVb\\" element, which tends to be boring and mundane.    Also, while she does address SOME cheaper stores and labels, the majority of the book is written for someone who has money like her (I added up the value of her \\"bath and body care kit\\" and it came out to somewhere in the upper $700s for about 10 cosmetic products), which clearly, most of us do not have.     That all being said, if you follow her tips about style and fashion, you will look amazing (a sexy blonde bob, optional.).
B00005NB8K|1.0|I can only say that this film is, as Manzarek calls it, \\"atrocious.\\"     Silly, Hollywood fluff that has Jim Morrison probably rolling over in his grave to this day.    There are so many inaccuracies about his character and events in this film, that it's hard to take it seriously.  The worst is watching Kilmer strut around 24/7 in some exaggerated, drugged out looking stupor throughout the film.  The worst is the way he speaks, as if Morrison were a stoned surfer (\\"like, dude\\").    Just an awful, awful film and typical of Stone's directorial decline.    Avoid at all costs.  Watch the Doors' music DVD's or read the books if you want to learn about or listen to or watch the Doors.
0316779237|5.0|This holiday book by David Sedaris is a collection of sophisticated, sardonic, and quite superb stories.  His style reminds me of Cleveland Amory (remember him? several years ago he wrote reviews for TV Guide--yes, this bit of information dates me)--somewhat crumudeonly, but very entertaining and funny.    Among other things, Sedaris shares his take on Christmas pageants and working as an elf during the holidays.    Written in a totally different style, [[ASIN:0757300537 Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices]] takes a look at how simple acts of thoughtfulnes came have a great impact.
0440238609|1.0|I read all 3 books in the series recently (didn't buy it, but borrowed it), because I was curious about all the publicity it has received with the Golden Compass movie's release. The first book was somewhat enjoyable because the story seemed interesting, though I didn't like the ending (how an innocent child was sacrificed by a \\"good guy\\" to somehow open a window up in a parallel universe). The 2nd novel I found to be too dark and sinister, though with still an interesting story, but the 3rd novel I detested not just because of the dark, sinister nature, but because of its pervasive anti-God and anti-Christian message. The first 2 books also have that message, but it doesn't become really blatant until the 3rd book. I don't have a problem with an author using, as a story theme, an attack on the misuse of religion (or any other belief system) as a means of tyranny over people, but I do have a problem with the author attacking Christianity in and of itself, and basically all monothestic religions for that matter. I would caution parents that they be aware of this before buying this series for their children. Aside from the religious angle, there is also material in there which is, in my view, not suitable for pre-teens, such as the violent, dark themes presented in the 2nd and 3rd novels. I would not purchase it myself nor recommend it to anyone else. Children's minds are more malleable than adult's and so they might be influenced by the subtle and blatant messages in the series. The author invited this kind of criticism by injecting blatant criticism of Christianity into these books. If he had left that out, they might have been pretty decent novels which could have been judged solely on their artistic merit, as he does show considerable literary talent and an ability to create good fantasy. I can't give it more stars than one because of this.
B000001DVD|4.0|Def Leppard's High N Dry gets 4 stars from me because in comparison to Pyromania, it just falls a hair shy of brilliance. If Def Leppard never recorded Pyromania and went straight to Hysteria, then High N Dry would be their best album by far. This one rocks harder than any that followed it, yet still has the guitar hooks and stellar vocals that propelled Def Lep to Hall of Fame-worthy status. I highly recommend this one as the 2nd DL in your collection after you own Pyromania. My favorite tracks include: Bringin On The Heartbreak, You Got Me Runnin, Lady Strange, On Through the Night.
B000002O4X|5.0|I first heard this sound track playing in a music store I entered. I could not believe my ears. What a magnificent sound! When I asked the retailer what was playing I was amazed. I had seen the movie, but hadn't really listened to the sound track. Of course I bought the CD before leaving the store, but it has also made me more aware of listening to the music that goes with a movie. I'm often caught up in the movie though and forget to listen, so sites like Amazon that let you listen to snippets of movies you've seen are helpful.     You won't go wrong choosing this soundtrack if you love the sound of French Horn and other orchestral music. It's my number one choice for soundtracks. Dreamy is indeed the word to describe this music.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|The product was purchased as a gift (quantity of 2) It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It was reviewed in our daily newspaper and I listened to the copy of the one I bought for myself.  It was excellent.   I found Amazon to be a great way to purchase online for the gift giving season.
0439813786|4.0|A wonderful story for children, craftily combining art and literature.  Great material for an animated film!
B000OPP68C|4.0|Is it Yes ? No. Is it Yes' music ? Yes. Does it matter ? NO. This is a fine live recording of Yes music , by 4 key members of Yes. It isn't called Yes , because Yes bassist Chris Squire owns the rights to the name , and he isn't here. But Jon Anderson , Bill Bruford , Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe are. Fine live re-workings of classic material by any line-up. Buy It ? YES !
B00030EIXW|5.0|Add this to your collection of Kleiber performances.  If you want to know what Beethoven was probably thinking when he wrote the 7th symphony, listen to this - perfect rhythm, extraordinarily clean lines, beautiful color contrasts and lots of fun to watch.  They say that Kleiber actually didn't like music.  That's a crock.  All you have to do is watch this DVD and you will immediately share in his joy!
0393061310|1.0|Aside from all the logical, scientific and historical convolutions, which have been exhaustively noted by other reviewers, little is said about Diamond's writing style. He has a terrible command of the English language; he is repetitive and academically dishonest and inauthentic. I cannot really determine the reason this book made all the fuss that it did. What's worse is that this book gives people a sense that they learned something or that Diamond proved something when all he has done is poorly synthesized others' works without citing them, or made things up in a heap of dreadful language. Do not waste your time.
6305428042|3.0|This is not one of Bette's more famous movies, and though it has a slow start, it turns out to be quite a fun show. Imagine 3 sisters from the era of the Salem witch trials in today's world.. They wouldn't stand out too much. But Bette seems to carry this show with her own style of comedy. One of the funniest moments has to be when the 3 have to find brooms to ride; and of course the nuttiest sister has to ad-lib when she can't find one. Though it starts slow, and at times the plot seems to get a bit too complicated, it still has moments of hilarity that only come from a Bette Midler style comedy. Fun for all ages, though some explanations might be needed as the plot lays out.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|I came home from work back in the early 90's, flopped down on the couch, and was home alone.  I didn't know anything about this movie and just started watching.  This movie scared the crap out of me!  Followed the sequels since then.  Classic!
0140288503|5.0|I had actually avoided reading this book because I thought I knew the story already.  I saw the movie - I've heard the stories.  I was wrong.  For me, the book unfolded beautifully and horribly all at once.  I was drawn into the lives of the people on both sides.  I thought Bowden did a good job of telling some of the Somali side of the story without trying to stuff it down our throats.  If you're like me and haven't read this book because you don't think it can hold your interest at this point, I say reconsider.  I was stunned by how much \\"more\\" there was, beyond what I had gleaned from other sources.  Great book that captures the stuff we should never let be forgotten.
B0009A21R6|5.0|The SACD of Dire Strait's Brothers In Arms has a crystaline clarity that music should always strive to equal, the way the music jumps from the speakers like you were in the studio is astounding. When you hear the opening of Money for Nothing seemingly come out of nothingness you will be amazed. Mark Knopfler's guitar has a presence on this version unequalled on any other Dire Straits or Mark Knopfler CD. It is a shame that Sony and the other labels have chosen to let this format die, it is a loss for all music lovers.
032147404X|5.0|I actually don't think I have ever read an entire photography book but not only is this one informative but it has humor also. It explains digital photography in easy to understand step by step instructions. Best book I have ever bought on the subject. It is a MUST HAVE!
0143038419|5.0|This was an amazing read. Gilbert draws such an eerily close comparison to the internal turmoil and conflict that many women go through. She points out that it is OK not to know where your life is going or what your future holds. Women do not have to follow suit of what is typical and expected in their lives -- marriage, family, career. I wish that I could have the strength and courage to do what she did. I recommend this for anyone that may be confused with their life. I didn't expect to find someone that was able to mirror my own concerns in life. I very much understood and experienced what the author did, but could never write about it. Absolutely touching!
B000059LGC|2.0|This is one of my favorite Agatha Christy stories, and Peter Ustinov is the consummate actor to portray Poirot. This show is very well done, and it leaves you guessing until the last moment. My biggest disappointment was when I discovered that it had no captions or subtitles. When will the dvd makers realize that this is a very important tool when viewing a dvd?! The cast of stars in this show is impressive, and all do a great job in bringing the story to life. It's well acted, and the cinematography is spectacular. A great show, but since it is a murder mystery, small kids might be shook up with the violence that unfolds. Well worth watching, even without captions.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I have loved the whole gilmore girls series, the last season was a little bit of a disappointment to me, ended too sudden for me, but it was still all in all good.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|The 7th season was a little disappointing, as it was the last one, but I loved it anyways.  Best show ever!
0140067477|5.0|I had to read this book for a class. I was suprised by how interesting it was. Hoff uses fictional characters to define the Tao religion. If you are looking for insight on other religions, I suggest this book.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|The premise of this show is the coming together of two people who have a chance encounter at a small in on the California coast. They decide to meet at that same place every year after that. Time goes on, and though their lives change dramatically over the years, they still remain in love, though they will not leave their spouses for each other. Perhaps it's the 'forbidden' part that makes them come back year after year, or perhaps they find something in each other that they just can't do without. They deal with the birth of a child, and the death of a son in Viet Nam. Over the years their love deepens and the commitment is always there. Of course, it's meant to be a comedy, and there are a lot of laughs, but it's also a very romantic story, and at the end of the show, every woman watching it will have tears in her eyes. A great show, though in true Alan Alda style, he tends to get annoying in some scenes. Ellen Burstyn is at her best in this movie. Probably not for kids, as the entire show is based on marital infidelities.
0345347951|5.0|I read this when I was impressionably young, and then again and again since.  It is one of half-a-dozen science fiction stories I will always recommend if someone asks for my all-time favorites.    The aliens have landed, and they are friendly.  In fact, they are enormously helpful.  But they won't show themselves until a couple of human generations have passed and people are ready to see them.  Why is their appearance so startling?  I won't spoil it for you.    Oddly enough, you could call this a book without any villains.  There's conflict of various sorts, but no real \\"bad guys.\\"  The conflict is all the more intriguing for that.  Who should you root for?  What do you want to be the outcome?  What IS the aliens' reason for coming to earth? Should humans go along with them or resist them?  If so, in what way?    Oddly enough, the answer lies with an artists' colony.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Iy was a good family movie. The theme, the music and the scenery just outstanding.
B00005JPNW|3.0|Ok I'll say it wasn't a bad movie. As people have said the acting wa great and the animation was awesome, I especially liked Pantalimon aka Pan. I wish they hadn't moved the Bolvangar scene to after the Svalbard scene but I can live with it because they were well done. But, what really bugged me is why they left out the most gripping part of the book, the ending. I mean the revelation of how crazy Azriel is is one of my favorite part. They shouldn't have left out his kidnapping poor Roger and Lyra's attempt to rescue him and they should have left in the opening of the gate and the romantic talk between Coltier and Azriel at the gate. That was my big beef with the movie and they had better put it in the Subtle Knife movie or I will be mad. Oh yeah, the only other thing that truly bugged me was Lyra finding the Costa boy separated from his daemon, It was not him in the book it was Tony Makarios and his daemon was Ratter not the Costa boy's. Ok, I guess I've said enough.
B000VEA38E|5.0|This review assumes you are already familiar with the incredible score John Williams composed for the Star Wars trilogy.  I had a few questions about this release before I bought it, so I did some research, and here's what I learned:    (1)  Is this REALLY the complete score? --- Well, yes, with one caveat.  The content of the 30th Anniversary Collection is exactly the same as that of the 1997 RCA Special Edition and 2004 Sony Classical releases.  These three releases apparently have all of the music composed for the entire trilogy, except \\"Lapti Nek\\" and \\"Ewok Celebration\\" from Return of the Jedi.  These two cues (which are pop-like songs used as source music) do, however, appear in the 1993 Four-Disc Fox Anthology.  Apparently their exclusion in the newer \\"complete\\" releases is due to the fact that these two cues were cut from the Special Edition Return of the Jedi movie (1997).  These cues were replaced by \\"Jedi Rocks\\" and \\"Victory Celebration,\\" which were newly composed for the new version of the movie.  So, I suppose the 30th Anniversary Collection is complete if you accept that two of the source music cues were substituted for the new movie.  You might notice that the \\"Main Title\\" for A New Hope is about 2-1/2 minutes longer in the 1993 Anthology.  This cue is longer in the Anthology simply because music from other cues was tacked onto it.  The newer releases have all of that music; the music just appears on other cues (chronologically) rather than tacked onto the \\"Main Title.\\"    (2)  How does the 30th Anniversary Collection compare with the 1993 Four-Disc Fox Anthology? --- The 30th Anniversary Collection pretty much makes the 1993 Anthology obsolete, except for the liner notes.  First, the sound is much better (see below).  Second, there are 80 minutes of additional music in the 30th Anniversary Collection, making it truly complete (with the above caveat).  More specifically, there are 20 additional minutes of music for A New Hope, 15 additional minutes ofmusic for Empire Strikes Back, and 45 additional minutes of music for Return of the Jedi.  Third, the 30th Anniversary Collection has the music in chronological order, as it is heard in the movies (with the exception of a few well-placed concert arrangements).  The 1993 Anthology put the music in a more concert-appropriate order.  I think the chronological order is much more enjoyable for true fans of the movies: you can almost see the action just from listening.    (3)  Is the sound better than in previous versions? --- Much better than the 1993 Anthology; slightly better than the 1997 RCA Special Edition.  For the 1997 RCA Special Edition, the sound was digitally remastered from the original tapes; therefore compared with the 1993 Four-Disc Fox Anthology, the 1997 RCA Special Edition has much less hiss and the sound is warmer.  On the flip side, the dynamic range is narrower and the uppermost frequencies were lost in the compression.  Overall, I think the 1997 RCA Special Edition sounds much better than the 1993 Four-Disc Fox Anthology.  Then, for the 2004 Sony Classical release, the music underwent Sony's Direct Stream Digital remastering, which provided a minimal amount of clarity.  The sound of the 30th Anniversary Collection is exactly the same as that of the 2004 Sony Classical release.    (4)  How is the packaging? --- Not great.  The 1993 Anthology came with a full-size booklet with color photos, lots of background information, and music analysis.  The 1997 RCA Special Edition came with acclaimed liner notes by Michael Matessino, a film music historian and producer, who provided a track-by-track analysis of the entire score.  The 2004 Sony Classical release omitted these notes and came with only a few screensavers (a major disappointment for fans).  The 30th Anniversary Collection does a bit better than the latter, containing packaging from the original LPs of these soundtracks and a CD-ROM containing files of original materials associated with the films and soundtracks.  I agree with other reviewers that this is a bit of a let down, but I wouldn't let this deter me from acquiring this new set.  The 1997 RCA Special Edition is not easy to come by anymore (and if you look hard enough, you can find Michael Matessino's notes online).    BOTTOM LINE:  If you (1) are a fan of John Williams' amazing score for the trilogy, (2) want all the music available for the trilogy, and (3) don't already have either the 1997 RCA Special Edition or 2004 Sony Classical releases, I highly recommend this set.  If you own the 1993 Four-Disc Fox Anthology, this is a tougher call--get it if you crave the additional 80 minutes of music and better sound quality.    IMPORTANT NOTE:  Do NOT take Amazon's above suggestion and purchase this together with Star Wars: The Corellian Edition.  The latter already comes included in the 30th Anniversary Collection Box (Disc 7)!
B000GY729M|5.0|Like most people say, it takes a while for this album to grow on you, but it does, i love this record, great songs, great music, and a great replay value, each time it gets better.    Favorite tracks:  Read my mind  Sams town  Bones  Bling
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie before I purchased it, which was the reason I wanted to own it.  I rarely purchase movies, primarily because I only want to see them once and that's it.  This movie is a timeless and moral true story of good triumphing over evil despite the odds.  Inspiring, humbling and faith building, this movie is a must see.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|As its release date approached, a lot of pressure was placed on this album.  Madonna's previous effort had been a little lackluster and many questioned her artistic vision and whether or not she could maintain the iconic status she'd achieved.  Then \\"Hung Up\\", the first single from \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", hit the radio waves.  It sounded a bit like old-school Madonna, but simultaneously seemed new and fresh.  Many younger fans failed to realize the obvious sampling from ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\" throughout the song, which undoubtedly helped catapult this single up the charts worldwide.  Still, it is Madonna, and she's always been good at producing slick, likable music.    Madonna's never been a killer vocalist, but she does what she does extremely well.  What makes this album unique from her others is it plays like a club disc, cycling through each song without a break in the music.  The songs have been carefully arranged to flow into one another perfectly.  There isn't a ballad in sight, but thanks to gorgeous chords and sweeping digital effects, it's easy to relax while listening to many tracks here.      \\"Confessions\\" was said by many to be Madonna's best since \\"Ray of Light\\", though \\"Music\\" was a tried effort that turned out beautifully, and it seems many tend to forget about it when comparing one Madonna album to another.  Still, with the release of this album Madonna received some much needed praise from critics and fans alike.  \\"Confessions\\" confirmed Madonna's importance in the music industry, and reminded us of Madonna's initial burst onto the music scene.    Obviously \\"Hung Up\\" is a wonderful piece of work and successfully combines confidence with confusion and doubt.  There are a couple of `fun' pieces, \\"I Love New York\\" and \\"Jump\\", mostly meant to get you moving on the floor without thinking too hard.  The former is a bit sarcastic and almost too goofy to be taken seriously, and while some of the rhymes are a bit juvenile,there are clever lyrics too.  \\"Get Together\\", \\"Let It Will Be\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\" and \\"Push\\" are among the many more intense and preachy songs on the album.  They're a bit darker and mysterious, and offer the ear beautiful musical arrangements with introspective lyrics.  Some of Madonna's most intriguing lyrics can be heard in \\"Isaac\\", a catalyst for controversy as it's based on spirituality and the like.  Despite ones own opinions, the song is gorgeously constructed and is best described as a mix of \\"Secret\\" and \\"Frozen\\" from previous albums \\"Bedtime Stories\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\", respectively.  \\"Future Lovers\\" may take several listens to enjoy as it's quite repetitive, but Madonna's twist on love and fate (not to mention her sensual delivery of whispered lyrics) make this a highly likable track.  She closes the album with \\"Like It Or Not\\" which features some genius metaphors referring to The Garden of Eden and The Devil.      Throughout the album are many beeps, blips, bleeps and contagious drumbeats.  There are also a couple world instruments thrown in for good measure which add to the mass musical appeal.    One thing's for certain: Madonna is comfortable and confident on this album.  She's a fully matured woman and artist.  She may not be the young fresh face anymore, but she still has the vibe.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen every version of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre but this lastest version puts all the rest to shame. Don't get me wrong I like all the version's especially the 1996 version with William Hurt, but this version added something different to the story. It doesn't exactly read straight out of the book, but then none of them do. Still it was lovely and enjoyable with a very moving score. What can I add but I am totally won over!!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Stunning.  Everyone knows it, and I'm just going to repeat it...If you have a BluRay player, and a highdef TV:  This is what you are going to be showing your friends and family when you want to be THAT guy.  You know who THAT guy is.  You know you don't want to be HIM.      You know that you will.
0553805460|1.0|This is a sad book on many levels, not because the characters are at all sympathetic but because its mere existence underlines many of the dysfunctional elements in American culture and society.  The book itself is horrid in its style, lazily edited and ultimately uninformative.  Whoever edited this thing should be banished from the publishing industry.  On top of the aforementioned \\"loamy loins\\" this manuscript contains literally repetitive similes, tired, cliche, over the top dramatics and impossibly unbeleivable and hackneyed dialogue.  The acknowledgements thank  an alleged industry professional who encouraged the author to quit his job after reading the first three pages.  One wonders if any of the folks involved here had read anything by Raymond chandler, Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson or Don DeLillo, all writers who have dealt with this genre of the American underbelly that make this effort look like a comic book.  My sense is that everybody concerned figured this would be a really hypable book and everybody could hustle their way to a big payday.  Some things never change.  Not a word really from Mr. Belfort about the hundreds of millions of dollars that was the result of defrauding gullible folks out of their hard earned dollars.  It's all me, me, me, even when he has supposedly hit rock bottom in rehab, he's still the smartest guy in the room and everybody is just a mark or a schmuck.  Even though the guy can't get through an hour without being massively sedated and insensate.  Sure.  His wife in this pasted up love story is also a prize.  You can bet she held on to the very last moment and then dumped her unconditional love right after he got indicted.  Time to move on to the next wallet and sperm donor.  Can't blame her too much, her husband was engaging in unprotected sex with call girls and strippers, despite professing his eternal love every third paragraph.  Mr. Belfort says very little about the real nuts and bolts of his operation which leads one tosecond the suspicions that he was probably a front for some real heavyweight folks.  If you are looking for a sober rendition of corruption on Wall Street, forget it, you'll learn more on a Yahoo message board at four in the morning.  Even the children are romanticizd into demi godlike creatures that border on messiah status.  another typically American delusion.  too bad their parents couldn't even keep together long enough for them to emerge from veritable infancy with an intact family unit. Children as things, not human beings.  What can you say?  Impulse control doesn't seem to be too evident in this relationship.  That's enough, you get the picture, if you must, take this out of the library like I did.  Better yet, go get \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", \\"The Long Goodbye\\" or \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" It will be a much better use of your time, trust me.  This book will only have value to future historians tring to document the zeitgeist during the collapse of the great American Empire.
1881273156|5.0|I honestly feel that this book is the best read of my life, because it has taught me so much about relationships and the need in each and everyone of us to feel loved.     Chapman is very direct and anecdotal in his style of explaining the 5 Love Languages, and each friend that I have talked to that has read this book has identified with its characters and message in one way or another.     I highly recommend this book to each and every person that has a few hours to read it.  As author Gary Chapman writes, he hopes that this book can help all of us live a happier life of love by showing us how to express love to those around us better and more sincerely.

0439882826|5.0|My 5 year old came up to me in the bookstore and said, \\"They have a whole encyclopedia of Star Wars over here.\\" and showed me this book.      Even though its the most expensive book I've bought for him, it's absolutely worth it.    He's never seen the Star Wars trilogy, but he now knows all the characters and the world of Star Wars.  The art and the craftsmanship are stunning and it is a like a puzzle that has multiple unfolding dimensions.    We read it every night and there is something new to discover in each page.
B000NVL9FQ|5.0|Emerson, Lake, and Palmer are my favorite prog rock band, and this is arguably their most balanced album as a band. On most of their albums, Emerson and Palmer dominated the proceedings, while Lake diddled on his bass guitar, usually playing a simple riff or two while Keith and Carl ripped their instruments a new one. Lake only really shined during the ballads, and probably resented Emerson and Palmer (Emerson especially) for their domination of the band. This album strikes a beautiful balance between all three. The opener, The Barbarian, opens with a killer guitar riff (yes, guitar), then breaks into a blistering version of Bartok's Allegro Barbaro (even though Emerson, Lake, and Palmer are credited with the song). The second song, Take a Pebble, is Greg Lake's most underrated ballad, and it's a damn shame, because it is one of his best songs, and one of ELP's best songs. It's an epic Greg Lake song running 12 1/2 minutes (usually the epic were courtesy of Emerson), and it boasts some great lyrics and amazing beautiful piano work by Emerson. Knife Edge has some great bass playing by Greg, which blends it beautifully with Emerson and Palmer. The Three Fates is mostly Emerson, until the final segment, when they all join in. Tank is a great Palmer drum workout, with excellent keyboard work from Keith and another great bass line from Greg, and Lucky Man closes it. It's Greg's signature song, and it's really all him. The synthesizer solo at the end was an add on. Greg wanted to give Keith something to do on the song, so Keith improvised the solo. ELP would get bigger and better with longer tracks (Tarkus, Karn Evil 9), but here they share more of the music. I'm not saying this is their best album (that's the triple live one), but it's certainly as good as anything they ever put out...
B0000028M7|5.0|Some bitter individuals have found an outlet in AIC-bashing. Perhaps it helps the cowards that the band's vocalist is tragically dead, that his life and his art merged darkly. People see what might become of them, and unlike our hero, have not the guts to even whisper about it, let alone howl out in despair and rage. Here is the truth: This is one of the musically tightest bands the 90s ever saw. The musicianship on this CD is top-notch, without a single gratuitous note. Rather than pouring out some predictable angst, AIC chose to truly dig into the dirt of life, with no fear as to what they might unearth. And my God, the beauty and the horror that they discovered was interpreted in lyrics and music that no-one in the more innovative fringe of the hard-rock genre has ever quite managed to do. This CD is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Let the blind ignore its message; their blindness will have no impact on what is already there. Dirt delivers one of the most unforgiving indictments of human folly recorded during that era rather randomly dubbed as Grunge. But what is Grunge? If it's a style of music that emphasizes loose playing, then this CD just doesn't fit: You could bounce a quarter on its musical tightness. It does not dwell on the woes of urban young adult life: It rips your guts out as it conducts exploratory surgery on the woes of life from cradle to grave. If I had to own one CD from the 1990s, it would be Dirt. It is flawless. It is an epitaph bearing prophecy, and it frightens the living daylights out of many, the same folks who watch horror films through their fingers. I suggest that you open your ears and your minds and benefit from the riches this CD has to offer.
B000VI70WM|4.0|How many icons from the 1980s are still producing anything close to innovative music today with an ear for anything current?     You have to give the Durans a nod for going in this direction at all. Yes, some of the tracks have a heavy Timbaland influence (\\"Nite Runner\\" especially) but they still retain that Duran sound. No where in tracks like \\"Nite Runner\\" or \\"Skin Divers\\" do I ever lose track of the fact that I am listening to Duran Duran.    And then there are the other tracks here. \\"Box Full o'Honey\\" is absolutely beautiful and different for either Duran Duran or Timbaland. \\"The Valley\\" is a great track as well as \\"Tempted\\" and \\"Last Man Standing.\\" There's plenty of really good tunes on this CD. Really good DURAN DURAN tunes. Then of course there is \\"Falling Down\\" which is a very good ballad. Justin Timberlake co-wrote the song but damned if I could tell that. Sounds like a great Duran Duran track, period.    I've been an avid fan of Duran Duran since 1981 and RCM is one of their better releases. Up there with \\"Duran Duran 1981,\\" \\"Rio,\\" \\"Notorious\\" and whatever else you'd like to put up there. Certainly not as lackluster as \\"Liberty\\" or \\"Thank You.\\"     The bottom line is that this band is really trying to make a good record here. Something new and of a very high quality. Are they looking for a hit? This is Duran Duran, of course they are looking for a hit! They certainly don't sell their artistic souls for it here. RCM is a very good CD for the Duran Duran fan and the newcomer alike. Check it out!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|La version larga es definitivamente mejor y mucho m&aacute;s clara, como pelicula es buena pero corta mucha de la trama original del libro y cambia el final! la recomiendo solo para los que nos maravillamos con los libros de la serie de DUNE
B00004RFCM|2.0|Many people out there look at this series as a mature, adult show about women and their real problems. This show is neither mature nor adult. This show is really just a glorified sitcom, with dirty talk and some very short (and not erotic) sex scenes. The 4 women are very superficial, and are not very realistic. Constantly eating out at posh restaurants in Manhattan (there are other burroughs in NYC, such as Queens and Brooklyn, where it is much cheaper to eat) every day, sleeping with a different man each week, buying as many things as they can, partying all hours of the night, and they still find time to work their professional jobs. These women are supposed to be \\"professionals\\", but if that were the case, they would never be able to keep up their lifestyles (even with doing Red Bulls and coke all day). I feel that these women are very unhappy, and they look for fullfilment through a hedonistic lifestyle. I hark back to the 1960's in the films L'avventura and La Dolce Vita, where this kind of lifestyle was depicted as cheap (spiritually speaking), hollow, shallow, and depressing (and it still is, regardless of what the media may tell you). Most of their affairs are quite meaningless, it's mostly sex without emotion, and the conversations remind me more of locker room talk written by sitcom writers. And the sex scenes (which many people told me they were so hot) are tepid at best. I have seen films by European art filmmakers (Bertolucci and Breillat, to name a few) that are light years more honest and artistic than anything this show can put out. Americans have very childish attitudes towards sex, almost childlike. They giggle at dirty talk, and try to show off their \\"knowledge\\" of sex, like when a 6th grader discovers the sex ed book, and brags about the new dirty words he/she has discovered. Overall, a very disappointing show. Do not fool yourselves...
B000YAF4OS|4.0|The mist rolls in, strange monsters, cults, sirens........I thought this was Silent Hill 2; which I feel it could be.<br /><br />I am personally tired of seeing the idea of having people work against eachother in crisis, rather than helping eachother out. \\"The real danger was inside the supermarket, not outside.\\"  Whatever.<br /><br />Anyway, not a bad movie overall.  It did a great job building up suspense and the feeling of despair about the situation the people were in.<br /><br />The ending does not explain things at all and I felt it was poor.  It does a good job making you feel pretty shi_ty though after rooting for these people for most of the movie.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|este es un disco muy tranquilo , contrario lo que se podria esperar de este grupo , con muchas y bellas baladas , salpicadas con algunas tonadas m&aacute;s movidas , creo que le gustara a la mayoria
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This album has some songs that will make your blood flow.  I literally find some of the songs on this album addictive.  I highly recommend listening to this album as loud as your ears (or stereo) will let you.  If it doesn't get your adrenaline pumping then you might be dead and should get some help.  Tim McIlrath is at his best again with his amazing blended style of singing and screaming at the same time.  If you can stop listening to him long enough you can hear some excellent guitar backing him up which just adds to the intensity of this album.  Made me a Rise Against fan.  I have another one of their albums and am looking to get one more.
B000YAF4OS|4.0|This story isn't about braving the creatures in the titular mist.  The story is about the horrors of a society that breaks down.  As heard in a dialogue exchange in the movie:  \\"I truly believe that we are a civilized society\\".  But the response is \\"Yeah, or at least until the machines stop working and 9-1-1 isn't available.  Then we become primitive.\\"  Another character says \\"Put more than two people in a room together and it becomes a battle to see who will be killed first.  That's why we invented politics and religion.\\"<br /><br />The character of religious zealot Mrs. Carmody will certainly rub many viewers the wrong way, in particular because her message is overwhelmed by her delivery.  Mix fundamentalist religion with a scared mob of people and you have a recipe for \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" and all other sorts of trouble.  She gets it in the end, but let's take another look at her message:<br /><br />Perhaps, just perhaps, there was some degree of truth in what she was saying about how the Sinners of the world brought this evil upon them.  (No, I'm not a religious nut.  I'm just thinking about this in terms of the story's narrative as it relates to the ending.)  SPOILER ALERT! ***  The so-called \\"sinners\\" refused to believe that the Evil in the mist was God's retribution for the sins of Man.  And those same \\"sinners\\" chose to make a run for it rather than to sit and wait to die.  The \\"believers\\", however, stood fast and didn't leave the relative safety of the supermarket.  And sure enough, the \\"sinners\\" met their various fates (the one who didn't die probably wishes he had) while the \\"believers\\" were rescued.  Could this have been God's way of separating the \\"sinners\\" from the \\"believers\\" and meting out His various forms of punishment on the \\"sinners\\"?<br /><br />The so-called Sinners, for most of the film, came off looking like the only ones with a degree of wisdom and pragmatism.  Until the end, that is.  What doomed them was their lack of faith (Faith?).<br /><br />Just a thought.<br /><br />I'm not pushing a religious agenda.  I'm just exploring this as an idea.not pushing a religious agenda.  I'm just exploring this as an idea.
1881273156|5.0|I've read other relationship books and they all tell you the difference between men and women and how to deal with it, but this book brings a better perspective to relationships. We are individuals that choose to love and by choosing to love we do the things that make our spouse feel loved. This book has explained a lot of the frustrations I've had with my spouse and with myself for not knowing why certain things would hurt me so much and why I do the things I do. It's because the love language I speak is different than my spouses, and we are always trying to express love to each other in our own language, and the other is not understanding.   I was actually given this book because I am to speak on it in a church activity, and when I got it I thought I already knew what it was going to say, because like I said I've read many other relationship books, but what I found inside turned on the light and has brought new understanding to my life.  Thanks  Tanna

B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I loved this movie on DVD and now on Blu-Ray it is showcased the way it should be! A classic for our families.
B0002F6AYS|5.0|This is the beginning of what became an \\"unexpcted\\" franchise for me. This was a real small low budget film, so authentic. I think this movie could've been better off WITHOUT any sequels. Some of them were ok but others failed, I'll get to my reviews of those seperatly but anyways, I'll start talking about this one.<br /><br />Well, at the start of the film, we are introduced to an awesome kick-ass scene where the \\"children of the corn\\", kill a bunch of adults in a diner, with some really cool effects.<br /><br />Now we cut to present, where we are watching Linda Hamilton & Peter Horton in a motel room. It is his birthday, and they are both going to a new town because Horton has the job of a doctor. So they hit the road, and then hit a kid on the road, and more to their horror, he was already dead because the man notices his through severely cut out.<br /><br />So then we find out all kids in the town killed every adult in the town, because they are in in some sort of a cult that gathers in the towns cornfields. Well, the only two normal people are these two kids. Their older borther was the one hit by the car. So they pretty much help the ouple defeat the god that all the kids worship, and happy ending.<br /><br />I liked this film just because to 80s feel, the atmosphere really reminded me of Amish descent, and this had some great special effects and great gore/makeup scenes. So I would recommend Children of the Corn to any horror fan that has not stumbled across it yet. I give it a full 5/5.
B00005B36H|5.0|Im confused... How can people hate TOOL so much.  They must have an incredibly amount of envy and jelousy.  NO ONE CAN TOUCH TOOL!!!  Not even close.  Some of the most original, rocking and spiritual music I have ever heard.    This particular album has the feeling of the cosmos, a very stellar atmosphere.  Aenima on the other hand, had an earthly and primal feel to it.  TOOL for me gets right down to the core of the humaness in all of us.  All the people that hate TOOL can go to hell, they wont be missed...
B000AMJC2K|5.0|For quite some time my wife has been wanting an LCD monitor arm for her home office. Being the cheapskate that I am, I just couldn't justify spending more on an arm than we spent for the display. Well, my research paid off. The Ergotron Neo-Flex  is just what we needed. It is very well made, sturdy, and easy to set up. Having never owned one of these before, I was a bit apprehensive at first that it would not support the weight of our 19\\" monitor and come crashing down. No problem. We usually keep it fully extended, it works like a champ.   It's great having so much more free space on the desktop. I searched around and thank Amazon for having the best price on the Net. Highly recommended!
0143038419|5.0|This was a magical book in that the author transports its reader to all three countries with such detail and care.  I felt like I was actually there with her.  It was very uplifting in today's gloom and doom.  I highly recommend it.
159562015X|5.0|I have read \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" and StrengthsFinder 2.0 and taken both assessments. Initially, I was amazed to learn that most people believe that their lives will most likely improve if they tend to their weaknesses rather than their strengths. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" and agree with the concept of leading through strength. I especially enjoyed the section about how to manage people with the various strengths, and building a strengths based organization.  When I took the original Strengthsfinder assessment, I found it interesting, but it didn't add much to my life.  The book is more substantive.    The Strengthsfinder 2.0 book offers little more than the original book.  The assessment is a slightly more customized, and the action steps are helpful.  I don't understand why one of my five strengths was not included in my original strengthfinder assessment. What changed?    Discovering and employing strengths is a worthwhile endeavor, so here's your choice. If you are interested in the information, read \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\".  If you are more interested in the personalization of strengths, then take the Strengthsfinder 2.0 assessment with this book.    If you are interested in making the most of your thinking, interactions and any situation, I absolutely recommend the Optimal Thinking Online Assessment.  I believe this is the best assessment on the market.
B00009EJC5|5.0|I expected this disc to be off the hook and boy was it, me being a musician I put this disc on pull out my instument and I'm in another world. I'm amazed at this mans mind set and the times when came up with such a funky sound compare that to the artists of today and the so called freedom in the music industry, not just something, but a whole lot of something is missing.
B000RZIGYU|4.0|This is a decent movie, and the transfer on this HD DVD is excellent.  So you can expect a lot of gunfire, and great picture quality on this one.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|A masterpiece of art. Outstanding musical work and outstanding blu-ray picture quality. Great casts.  An excellent collection for anyone who loves musical movies.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I've seen other Celtic Women shows and this one BY FAR is the BEST!!! My mother and I watched it on PBS last year and each time it came on, we tuned in.     The best gift you could give yourself or anyone on your list. :)
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite series I've ever seen.  Just about anyone can relate to at least one of the characters.  The issues and problems in the characters' lives are actually real-life problems.  Not some stupid \\"Oh no, I lost my Prada bag\\"  type of show that seems to be all too common these days.  Everyone remembers high school and how we thought our parents were and the awkwardness around that certain crush-its actually really amusing because we all have had those stuttering moments.  Overall a great series and one that I can actually watch more than once.  Jared Leto is definately a bonus!  I really wish it had lasted more than one season.
0312330537|4.0|A very nice easy read, with interesting experiences which funnily enough makes you start to wonder whether you take things to serious or not serious enough. There's nothing like an entertaining book that makes you ask yourself questions and laugh at some of your own answers.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is one of the year's best movies for families.  Disney certainly took another rodent and gave him heart and soul.  The animation is wonderful and the story is rich and interesting... plus the kids love to say the name!  I don't think there will be any follow-ups, it has been awhile since I've seen a kid's movie with an ending that doesn't require a sequel.  Great movie.
0143038419|1.0|I thoroughly agree with C. Quinn's review.  The author is insipid and her observations  trite.  Also, I found it totally boring, so much so that I could not even finish it.
B000UNYJV8|4.0|This movie touches on a subject that isn't too well known amongst the general public. The concept of what a traditional skinhead is vs. a neo-nazi, and when the traditional skinhead movement turned into a political mess during the 1980's, and the Falklands being only a part of what caused a lot of the political chaos amongst the working class, the patriots, and the youth.<br /><br />The story is told through the life of a young fatherless boy who lost his father in the Falklands war that befriends a group of traditional skinheads. He is tired of being picked on, and he's tired of being bullied. He's a loner, and the traditional skinhead group he meets become part of his family. When the group encounters Gumbo, a former member of the group, it's a world that the young boy never imagined, and a divide occurs between the traditional skinhead gang and Gumbo's National Front inspired movement.<br /><br />I have to say that I found the story to be a little bit more realistic than \\"American History X,\\" and a little bit more educational. The soundtrack to this film is also very fitting, and the soundtrack of traditional ska and northern soul music is wonderful. The characters in the film are also great, esp. the black skinhead, Milky.<br /><br />If you want a feeling of what happened to the traditional skinheads, or just want an interesting independent film to experience, check out \\"This Is England.\\"
6304698690|5.0|Our family has loved this version of Francis Hodgson Burnett's classic about an ugly duckling and unwanted orphan.    Even as my girls reached adulthood, we would still enjoy this.   We also found the addition of a grown-up Colin and Mary to be charming, and in no way detracts from the original story in the book.
0143038419|5.0|As a married mother of three young children who works full-time, I have to ask, \\"Who hasn't wanted to (on occasion) just throw in the towel and escape from it all?\\"  It is so easy to get caught up in the busy days of work, school, kid's sports, cleaning, entertaining and trying to find time to call your own.  I have often dreamed of just traveling around \\"looking for myself\\" for a full year, as Elizabeth did.<br /><br />To leave all of my worries, stress and responsibilities behind, if only for a short time would feel like a total self-indulgent gift to me.  Unfortunately, stepping out of my life now is not even remotely possible.  The chain-reaction of lives I would affect would not be worth the risk.  I instead, choose to enjoy losing myself in the adventures of those more daring than myself.<br /><br />I think the most amazing realization for me was that she kept changing her external environment in an effort to find what was missing in her life, when what she was looking for all along was inside herself and a relationship with God.  She could have discovered the missing pieces to her life without ever leaving home.<br /><br />Jill Fleming, MS, RD Author of \\"Thin People Don't Clean Their Plates: Simple Lifestyle Choices for Permanent Weight Loss\\".

6304698623|2.0|When my girls were young, we read the book several times.  This is very disappointing in its departure from Francis Hodgson Burnett's story.  (The Shirly Temple version did its own thing.)  Wonderworks has a wonderful production which is true to the book.
B000VS6P9Q|3.0|While I freely admit that imitation is a high form of flattery, and along that vein, so is re-interpretation, I have to also confess that once again I find myself disappointed with another spineless tribute album to a great artist. While there are some great covers here, no doubt, for my money they are the covers by existent sages, not the rabble clamoring around studio mics. While Dylan didn't live the vagabond lifestyle he so aptly portrayed in his music, his chameleonic nature allowed him to empathize to the point of true artistry: he became his creation. I've only been able to listen to this album once since I purchased it (with great anticipation, mind you), and fully expect it to litter CD sales boxes at Roses in the near future. Save your money; go out and purchase a remastered Dylan album (any one will do, particularly Blonde on Blonde), or try the Masked and Anonymous soundtrack. Shirley Caesar hits \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" on the nail (no pun intended).
0783226845|5.0|If this movie doesn't reach down in the middle of your gut and twist your heart, you ain't human. This is one of the best that Al has done. He really plays this part to the max. No one could have done what he has. I feel lucky that I got a copy of this DVD, but wished it would be released on blu ray instead of the other HD wanna-be.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Even though I saw the chicago version of Wicked, this original broadway cast was incredibly well done. The personalities of the actors and characters come though the speakers, and it is incredible to sing along.
B000TUXL2A|3.0|I bought this at the same time as James Blunt's new album. While Knopfler's musicianship is unquestioned, and the 'less is more' approach is evident, it is almost too laid back, as if he couldn't quite be bothered. The ability to create an image is still there, but talking about the old currency (last seen in, yes, James Blunt's 1973) isn't really relevant to anyone now.    Worth two listens. Perhaps not three.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|First, I own about 30 Christmas CDs.  And I think Christmas music is its own genre and is something that isn't judged on its merits but by a combination of hardwired preferences and childhood experiences.  I think people are judging this CD using about 50 different measuring sticks.  Reading the reviews is like a ping pong match.  Loved it.  Hated it.  Best CD in the world.  Worst CD ever produced.    Myself?  Loved it.  Did it reinvent the Christmas genre as we know it?  Honestly, I don't expect Christmas music to do that.  To me, Christmas music should evoke warm feelings and make a party more fun.  And it shouldn't be annoying.  With the hundreds of Christmas CDs still in print (and the hundreds more that died a deserved death), why would we place those sort of expectations on anyone?  It's a Christmas CD, and, I think, a great one.  Definitely 5 stars in my book.  Shouldn't annoy anyone (yet, somehow, it seems it does...)
B0002KPIQY|4.0|Sad and intriguing story of a model that found it hard to keep her life together. I'll watch it again.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|The only thing that didn't convince me about Once was the music, which I found more serviceable than great.  Otherwise, Once is one of the best movies of 2007.  Its entire too-short length is a romance, but not in the end the romance expected at the beginning.  Even more than the romance, it is about Dublin, about carrying on in fragile circumstances, and about giving oneself and others a second chance.  Those are, of course, themes more universal than individual, so it's entirely appropriate that the two protagonists are never named beyond Guy and Girl.  Even in that anonymity, however, they are finely drawn and portrayed individuals.  Once is a movie to see more often than its title.  And each viewing will yield scenes that become stuck in memory -- the father's faith in his son, the brightly colored vacuum cleaner being pulled through gray Dublin streets, and Girl's lunkish adolescent neighbors who pile on to her sofa to watch TV soaps to improve their English.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|Perfume: The Story of a Murder is a fresh and stunning film which effectively combines the best of the world of cinema. From the opening title sequence to the credit reel, the film moves flawlessly from scene to scene painting a picture with careful strokes, creating breath-taking images (scenes outside Grasse in the lavender fields, architecture in Paris[Prague]). The story is masterfully tailored to the confines of a feature length film and the actors capture the time period and feel of the movie very well. The best aspect of this film, however, is the orchestrated musical score. Not only does this music strongly fit within the atmosphere of the movie, it adds an element to the film which takes it beyond another mysterious thriller film. What's more, this score has legs of its own - as an independent collection of music it is representative of some of the best contemporary classical music compositions.The tension and harmony of the film are perfectly captured and distilled in the themes of the score.<br /><br />While I will continue to accept the ending of this film/book the way it is, I wished for less of a departure from Grenouille's behaviors prior to the last eighth of the story. I think the fanaticism and surreal tones of that section take this film out of a five-star category, but the redeeming qualities remain.
0618680004|4.0|If this book is read purely for enjoyment or its educational value, it will be found to be very rewarding. The book is well-structured, well-written, and reflects extensive research and work in its preparation. The very religious readers, particularly those who are Christian, will probably see it as one of the challenges to their faith that they have been warned about and dismiss, as irrelevant, the scientific facts that they really should take into account in the structure of their beliefs. Atheists will find reassurance in Dawkins' clear and persuasive arguments to prove that God does not exist; they will find reasons here to stifle any curiosity as to whether they might achieve a spiritual experience they will cherish or that might benefit them.    However (and this is a big \\"however\\"), the reader should step back and differentiate the elements being examined within this book and the premises at work. At a minimum, there are two questions the book addresses: \\"Is there a God?\\" and \\"Are the beliefs and practices of those who believe in a God based on any demonstrable evidence?\\" The published and spoken pronouncements of what might be called \\"mainstream religion\\" do not make a distinction in these two questions; they are inseparable. In so doing, mainstream religion makes an easy target for Dawkins and similar writers. The religious person says \\"God exists because this happened.\\" Dawkins replies with \\"This didn't happen the way you think. Q.E.D., there is no God\\".    The religious say: \\"God created man, he could not have evolved. The improbability of all of the features of an intelligent human coming together is too great to for it to have happened by chance.\\" Dawkins, on page 121, in effect says, \\"Not at all\\". He points out that the change in a life form by natural selection (he believes Darwin has put the issue to rest once and for all) is really the culmination of a long series of very small and only slightly improbable, but possible changes in DNA. He supports Darwin's analysis that these changes are beneficial to survival so they persist. \\"Nothing miraculous here\\" Dawkins infers. However, the very miracle of inert cosmic dust becoming something alive, surviving, undergoing changes, reproducing itself, and acquiring the awareness of being aware is lost on Dawkins.    The premise at work here in the book (and some believe it is not a premise, it is TRUE!) is that \\"everything that exists in the universe, has happened, is happening, or will happen is known, or knowable to the human mind (given time, with the aid of instruments in some cases, and if the data still remains). If you believe that premise, stop reading this review. If you wish to evaluate that premise, stand back and realize the mind is only an activity within the brain, an organ of the body. It is incapable of processing any data that doesn't arrive through one of the body's senses. You can give a name to a force we call \\"gravity\\", you can quantify it, you can observe its effects, but you cannot KNOW it. The mind is not aware of its origin and cannot perceive the forces in the universe. A Zen master would describe that as kissing your own forehead. Don't look to this book for advice on how to find out who you are. As one reviewer aptly wrote, Dawkins' book is about theological doctrine.    Dawkins sets up a straw man God, which he then knocks down, easily fashioned from the concept handed him by the religious: a divine being, similar to us, who lives in a remote location called \\"heaven\\", who, in a celestial second, created all matter and all life in a puff of smoke, like David Copperfield. He is a divine being who has a personal awareness of and concern for each of our lives, whom we will meet face-to-face when we die. This description does not withstand Dawkins' scrutiny. He has the advantage in this argument because he gets to define the characteristics of a Supreme Creator which he then uses to prove that such a Creator cannot exist. If Dawkins really wants toquestion whether there is a divine purpose in this life, he is looking for God in the wrong place.    An alternate premise to consider is one that exists in most religions, perhaps all: \\"God is unknowable\\". Accessing God is not an intellectual exercise. Those who have experienced spiritual enlightenment would say, \\"If you can talk about it, it isn't God.\\" If you will accept that premise, if only for the time you read Dawkins' book, you will observe, perhaps with amusement, that everything stated or believed, on both sides of the argument, are products of the mind. For the religious, the statements in the Bible (thought products) are the end-all and sufficient. For those who believe that everything that underlies the evolution of the universe and the life that inhabits it is the result of chance and can be explained (thought products), this book will provide some temporary comfort. However, those who have experienced a spiritual realization or some sense of it will not be interested in a debate over evolution. They will tell you that the experience is beyond analytical thought, cannot be discussed, examined, or written about. To them the book will not be offensive; it will simply have no meaning.
0143038419|5.0|Written like poetry, this author has lived many women's fantasies. A beautiful spiritual journey for us to enjoy. After reading this, she inspired me to book a trip I always wanted, to South America. You cant go wrong with this book.
B00005ND42|5.0|The other reviewer has it right! This is THE ONE! I have more than 8 recordings of Beethoven's sonatas for violin and piano...and out of all of the ones that I have heard this is by far the best.<br /><br />Others that are of note are the two Kempff has done. The first mono recording in the '50's with Schneiderhan and the later one in the '70's with Menuhin. Both of those are worth hearing (as is any Beethoven that Kempff recorded).<br /><br />Perlman and Ashkenazy are a good 2nd choice, but it isn't a close 2nd. Oistrakh and Oborin are just that good!!!<br /><br />Here we don't have musicians trying to compete. They play as if they are linked. The quality of the recording is very warm and in my opinion perfectly balanced.<br /><br />All in all, this is the only version of Ludwig's sonatas that keep making it to my player.<br /><br />UPDATE: The three volumes of Ibragimova[[ASIN:B003GWDSWG Beethoven: Violin Sonatas, Vol. 1]] is now my top choice!!! See my review of discs on volume 1!!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|BLOKUS IS A WONDERFUL GAME FOR A FAMILY OR EVENT WITH MIXED AGES!     So many board games favor older children/adults, but this is a true game of strategy that even smaller kids can do well and win.  My kids were 7 & 12 when we first got this game 3 years ago and the first thing I noticed is that my 7 year old could beat his sister and I.      We have owned it for 3 years and still play it - the game never gets old, we just get better!    Our family loves logic games such as Tetris and chess, but the difference with Blokus is that the rules are so simple that a 4 to 5 year old can learn to play easily.  It is the one game that we own that I can bring out in a mixed crowd of small children to adults and you can not predict the winner!    I would highly recommend this game to parents that are trying to sharpen their children's logical/reasoning skills; plus to grandparents or others that need a game that can be played with a crowd of mixed ages. And for the grandparents, it is not a game that is so complicated that the kids understand it and you don't!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a great and wonderful movie EXCEPT for the really stupid and sappy song \\"The Love Is Gone\\".  On our well-worn VHS, we always fast forwarded through that particular song.  I am really pleased to read in the comments and reviews that  the DVD omits that song on the widescreen version.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt's newest album, \\"All the Lost Souls\\" is incredible!  The depth of emotion in his songwriting will break your heart.  This is probably the best album I've purchased all year.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|We love Spidy and now have all three for our movie collection.  Great flick, lots of action.
B00006I53S|5.0|I have a Rebel XTi 18-55 kit.  After only a month I felt the need to upgrade my lens, this is what I chose.  What an awesome lens.  Love the IS, really helps me get sharper in low light (hard with stigmatism), AF is very quiet, but kinda touch and go, if you don't have stigmatism, use the manual focus.  Wish it were just a little bit wider, or a little bit longer, maybe 18 or up to 200, but I've really gotten some wonderful portraits and nice docu shots with this one.  Maybe not a lens I'll I carry with me the rest of my life, but it'll be my first option until I can get my hands on some L series glass.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I make it a chore to watch TV and when LOST came along I was not disappointed. This LOST DVD Collection - The Complete Second Season is just as GREAT as the First Season. I Would recommend it to anyone who thinks there is nothing good on TV anymore.
B0000507R2|4.0|People have opinions on just about everything: Your shoes, clothes, smile, weight, you name it. I have to be honest in that I really have never given a second glance in Natalie Merchants direction. Maybe it was the fact that I looked at the name of the pulishing entity 10,000 maniacs chose to use, and noticed it was anti-christian in nature (of course this was ten plus years ago, they may have changed the name now). At any rate Natalie Merchant was never on my radar screen. Then, out of the blue a former nursing instructor played a song called, \\"My Beloved Wife\\" by Ms. Merchant. She was using it as a symbol of emotions many of the elderly in our nation experience when they lose their spouse after 30 years of marriage. Statistics (statistics from 2004) show men over 60 yrs of age who lose a spouse die within a year. Many of these people experience grief that I can only describe as total paralysis of life. Their world as they knew it is over. I watched my grandfather go through this, and may get the displeasure of watching my own father go through this. Many elderly have lost friends already and really have no one else to turn to. I've seen this in my line of work, and I would be lying to you if I said it doesn't grind your heart into the ground at times. \\"My Beloved Wife\\" really captures this emotional state of despair well, and given what I know I have to admit everytime I listen to it I get a little choked up. The CD in all is a 4 star (all the songs are at least decent), but \\"My Beloved Wife\\" is a 5 star song for sure. If you ever see someone go through a tough loss like this you'll come to the same conclusion as I did; Ms. Merchant nailed the emotional roller coaster of suffering such a great loss. Most move past this and push toward their future. Sadly some don't
B000VBJEEG|3.0|but kinda of disappointed in the bonus part...was hoping to see more \\"behind the scene\\" stuff
6301607929|5.0|What can anyone say about \\"Picnic\\" that hasn't already been said?  Although somewhat dated, it's a wonderful movie and the chemistry between William Holden and Kim Novak is electric. Wish the love stories of today were as beautifully presented.
B000ZOW96Y|1.0|1)Bought the video rental  2)13mins into it, the color gets all messed up suddenly   3)I shutdown and restart unbox, and the video mysteriously disappeared from the play list. All attempts to find/import failed.   4)Now i need to pay again to view it.     Unbox is junk, use netflix instant viewing instead, it's FREE, has most of the good tv shows(heroes, 30rock, etc..) and works flawlessly.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I received this today and I am very pleased with the HD video.  The new effects are, unlike the Star Wars \\"additions\\", very pleasing and subtle.  My complaints are the menus and packaging.    The Transporter Room menus are OK, but the titles are VERY hard to read from across the room and difficult at first to figure out how to use because the fonts are so small.  I would have preferred a larger font and much less extraneous menu area.  Yes, it's a cool menu, but a little overdone for my taste.    The disks are packaged in a very flimsy case that has very little \\"grab\\" area and the only indication of which disk is which is on the disk itself in VERY small print on HD side.  You can't even tell which side of the case to start looking on by just looking at it.  It is impossible to get to the disks without putting fingerprints on at least one of them because there is so little room to grab the case around the disks.  Disk 1 is not even coevered so the only way to get out another disk is to put findgerprints all over Disk1! I can see this case falling apart with a fair amount of use.   Rather than putting the information on the episodes and which disk they are on on one sheet they are on individual plastic collector type cards that have no place in the case itself.      If you are older and have problems reading small print (which many of the people buying this will be) be prepared to get out your reading glasses to figure out which disk is which!
B00012L786|1.0|I bought this movie based on high reputation of criterion collection cinema.  What is the waste of money !!  It's typical hollywood setup story with fixed end.  We had dozen soviet movies where criminals are good criminals because they are \\"our\\" criminals. Nothing new here.
0805079831|5.0|A must read.  I am not going to write a long review because everything has been said.  I've read so many books on current events, economics, on and on and this one is the best.  I've already bought numerous copies and dispersed them to people that I think can benefit, you'll more than likely do the same once you've read this great work.
B000VI70WM|2.0|I cannot stress enough how bad this album is. Two stars only because it's Duran duran and falling down song is catchy and good enough.    Well, just as I feared, Timbalad guy screwed it all. The moment the songs start, you already know who done it. And it's not a positive thing. Timbaland is overhyped and overused producer that always produces the same piece of crap, no matter what artist he works with. It's ALWAYS the same!  I can't believe Duran Duran wanted to be in the same wagon! He ruined the songs, made them bland, using very annoying buzzing (farting) sound and the same minimalistic rhythm.  Actually, the other Timba guy (Timberlake) did a pretty good job. Can't blame him though.  I really like when the group change its sound in every album, but that change has to be something really fresh and good (e.g. Depeche Mode). *This* is neither new (typical timba-like sound) nor good (the songs don't go anywhere).    Ever been to the Duran Duran concert? Know how _energetic_ those guys are on the stage? They can blow you away! Like that energy? Then do not buy this. NONE of the stuff they show on the stage is here.  Bland, annoying and dull.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Thanks to the commenters I discovered that I can hear the dialog much better when playing the original soundtrack instead of the 5.1 soundtrack.  However, the problem isn't my sound system, it just seems that the 5.1 soundtrack isn't mixed very well.  The 2-channel stereo soundtrack sounds fine, though.<br /><br />As for the series itself, Twin Peaks is a classic and deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />============= ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW =============<br /><br />I hadn't seen Twin Peaks since it was on television, so I was really excited when this \\"Gold Box Edition\\" was released.  I was incredibly disappointed when I first started watching the DVDs, though.  The sound is so poorly mixed that it is virtually impossible to watch these DVDs.  The volume level of the voices is extremely low compared to the volume level of the music and special effects.  Since there is music playing most of the time, it is usually impossible to hear what people are saying.  There is one scene where lightning and thunder are crashing outside.  I turned the television all the way up so that I could at least hear the voices (even though they are drowned out by the thunder).  Even that didn't work.<br /><br />Unless you want an incredibly frustrating experience constantly straining to hear what's going on, you should not buy these DVDs.
B000W0DFDM|3.0|I'm a therapist who has had thousands of sessions with \\"women who love too much,\\" and I suppose, on \\"some levels,\\" I'm one of them.  I don't know a woman who isn't.  It's very hard for a woman not to wear her heart on her sleeve when she's attracted to someone. Whether it's a cute puppy on the street or a cute idiot...er, man...at work, in a bar, at the library...wherever those misguided souls tend to congregate that includes women...we can't hide our emotional reaction, either.  The author of this book assumes that his \\"good advice\\" is going to \\"help\\" us crazy-headed women.  Once again - someone is trying to FIX us.  Sigh. How about this scenario? The  handsome, hard-working, athletic, well-endowed hunk you're crazy about has fallen for you - lucky, lucky, lucky (oh, so lucky) woman-  and he can't keep his eyes, hands and money off you.  He begs you to marry him. He'd do anything for you; he says he wants babies with you - but only if you want them, too.  He buys you flowers and jewelry and takes you to nice restaurants. You're thrilled.  You can't hold yourself back from telling him that you love him, too, and want to spend your life with him. Then, suddenly, out of the blue, he stops doing and being all these wonderful things. He \\"forgets\\" to call when he says he will. He stops bringing you gifts.  He asks if he can borrow some money because he lost his job, but he'll surely get one soon and pay you back, honey. He's so busy looking for a new job that he can't come over more than a couple of times a week now. You call and leave messages and he doesn't call back.  Then, again out of the blue - he's gone - with a new (or old/ex) he realizes he loves more than you. I have heard as many of these sad tales as those from women who didn't realize \\"he just isn't that into you.\\"  And who really needs to be FIXED?  Who needs advice here?  There are many, many men who lead women on a whirlwind romance and then dump them in a few months or a year. I counsel women who tell methese things that the men who do this are dysfunctional chumps who will never, ever be able to have a great relationship with anyone, because they don't respect women.  And if they don't respect women, then they're the Big Losers in the romance game.  They'll just go from one partner to another, being enabled, yes, but also living empty lives.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|I wasn't too bowled over with the original Underworld, which is mainly why I had lowered expectations going in with Underworld: Evolution, and probably why I came out liking it better than it's predecessor, albeit not by much.  The sequel picks up where the first film left off, with death-dealing vamp-babe Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) on the run and out of time, as uber-vamp Marcus (Tony Curran) has risen from his sleep, and seeks revenge against everyone who has wronged him, and seeks to free his imprisoned werewolf brother William (Brian Steele) as well.  While writer Danny McBride and writer/director Len Wiseman attempt to give the Underworld universe a more believable spin this time around, a majority if the film just comes off as lame and predictable.  Where Underworld: Evolution works is in it's dynamic action scenes, in which the blood and gore has been upped considerably compared to the last time around.  The CGI effects are pretty well done as well, particularly the werewolf-transformation effects and frequent dismemberments.  All in all, if you enjoyed the original Underworld, you'll no doubt enjoy Underworld: Evolution, but if you're like me and didn't really dig the first film, Underworld: Evolution won't win you over.

B000VI70WM|2.0|Ok, I'm writing this review for more for my own catharsis than anything.  After years of never saying anything bad about Duran, I feel that I now have to write this down, with the arrival of Red Carpet Massacre.      First..a brief history of Duran releases...Duran Duran, Rio, Seven.., Wild Boys single (forget Arena), and Astronaut...GREAT albums with the perfect balance of synth, bass, and GUITARS that made Duran famous and spawned a new generation of young \\"new-wavers\\" who have pulled out the synths once again...all these featured Andy Taylor, who added the \\"oomph\\" to their sound, both in the studio and on the live stage.    Later albums saw Andy go, and that's when Nick took over with way too much synth stuff and turned the guitars down on Warren Cucurullo and anyone else who filled the spot...I personally love Big Thing and the Wedding Album, but guitars were nowhere near as prominent on these....I won't even get into the Thank You album of odd cover selections, and Medazzaland might as well be called \\"the Nick got some sweet new Mac synth software\\" album...I like it, but the balance is wayyy to electronic..And anyone who saw the stage shows during these periods could plainly see that the guitars had been pushed back....Warren was cool, but didn't have the stylistic impact that Andy had/has...    Then came the comeback album, Astronaut....and it was GOOD.  The elements were back in their place, and the music was again balanced so that it had the right energy, not to mention good songs, and Duran sounded like a rock band again.  The live dvd/cd of Live From London shows the return of that energy...it's just great.    So here we are with RCM, which was the straw that Andy left over...and I can't say I blame him...I can't say what his exact reason was, but I imagine it could've been, \\"We just had a great comeback album, a super-successful tour, we've got the next album done....and we're calling in the In-Sync guy for WHAT????\\"  Nick's Answer: To make a record withno real drumming, guitar-playing, awkward sounding raps (skin-divers?ugg)  music that everyone's doing these days...on my Mac\\"  And those are the songs on RCM...they're not terrible, but they are missing something....and that something is GUITARS...As I listen to this album, I can even imagine where a couple good guitar chords could really punch up these songs.    So my review is ...RCM is okay, but after Astronaut, I looked forward to more.  My suggestions..call up Andy, get him to come back because he needs to be there to balance Nick (and mess with him a bit, I think).  I've heard John Taylor say in interviews recently that door may be open..so do it already.  Next, recognize that Duran has SET TRENDS, and stop trying to follow them...be the God-Fathers of new wave that you're famous for being, and don't worry if teen-ages don't dig you...they'll come around (or not) and there's enough people over 25 who WILL.    And last...the band keeps saying they had an album done with Andy before they started the Timbaland/Justin thing....so dig it out...finish it up and get it out before 4 years from now...I'll be waiting.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I have to say that I was sooo impressed with this album!  I liked the \\"Back to Black\\" album but \\"Frank\\" is awesome!!!  I love every song and that is hard for me to do even on an artist that I LOVE!  But I have to say that she did her thing on this album and every song is phenominal!!!  I totally recommend this CD!
B000N6TYLW|4.0|This season was good just not really as good as the others. Of course if your a fan it won't really matter you will want it anyways. The show used to be fun and funny this season was more of a downer I guess you could say.
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|This cd is profound in the stories that are told in the songs.  A couple of the songs can be heard on the radio and the others are just as good.  Most of them are sad but tell a great story.
B00005JOHC|5.0|We have really enjoyed watching this program and hope the second season is released soon.
0440238609|4.0|So, I pretty much bought this to test the message angry Christian groups were giving about the story being anti-Christian.  After reading the series, I can say that I'm neither British or Catholic enough to really get upset over it.  The story makes several large assumptions in order to justify the conclusion of the tale.  It makes more attacks on the church itself rather than Christianity.  A few small changes in names and Pullman would probably have to fear for Muslim retribution.  In short, it's quite clearly a work of fiction and a pretty enjoyable tale.
B000002LR6|5.0|Great thrash album, Al has done it again, great songs awesome riffs and great lyrics all the way threw.
B000TLMWLK|5.0|For all Man In Black fans this is a must buy. Highlights from his show are fabulous, with great guest stars including Dylan,Ray Charles, Louis Armstrong and many others.
B0000019PA|1.0|granted they make the most interesting and innovative music... but really when it comes to an actual song... you know the part where you have a good vocal melody... COMPLETELY LACKING.    its almost tiring... now if they took away his vocals from the music... it might make a great instrumental album.  there's no merit in his vocal tune at all.    a lot of indie bands suffer from this... great instrumentals but unimaginative vocal melodies.  i mean really thats what makes a good song a good song. it has to be the whole package.  good lyrics and good backing music does not equal a good song unless there is a good vocal melody.  sigh c'mon guys you can do better!!!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This DVD was exactly what I wanted and it was delivered within a very few days
B0000C8AVE|5.0|I am an avid music fan and songwriter and I have to say, there are few songs out there better than \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright.\\"  I'm sure Dylan borrowed some chords and phrasing from other folk songs he had heard before, but the song he constructed...wow.  It's a statement to an ex-lover, with a weary, sad tone and such a beautiful melody.  The rest of this album is filled with great songs, Dylan at the top of his game and probably at the best his voice would ever sound (it was later that his smoking caught up to him and he became more raspy and nasal).  Of course Blowin' in the Wind is on here, but Hard Rain is another truly great song which just blows me away.  Masters of War, Girl from the North Country...you can't go wrong if you pick up this CD.
0307277887|2.0|Snarky Television show?  Yes.  Worthy of a quick read?  Not so much.      I picked Dexter up as an \\"airplane book\\" - i.e. a few hours of brainless reading.  Unfortunately, the suspension of disbelief required to stick with this for a few hours was a bit too much.  Dexter tries just a little too hard, and the jumps in logic are just a little too far to make this a book you want to follow.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth (HD) was the first dvd I watched on my new HD player and the picture was phenomenal. This series was well thought out and executed. Some of the pictures are so shockingly close, I can't help but wonder how in the world they got the camera positioning. Buy this and you won't be sorry!
B00009UW0N|5.0|What can you say?  The original \\"slasher film\\" though it hardly qualifies as one by today's standard.<br /><br />Set in a small town where 15 years earlier, a grisly murder took place.  Now the murderer is back to continue on his deranged killing spree on Halloween night.<br /><br />There is a reason why this movie is voted one of the horror films of all time, it is truly creepy.  This is not set at some abandoned cabin or in some haunted graveyard, this is a nice typical small town where nothing ever goes wrong.<br /><br />As I said, this is the first of what we have come to know as the \\"80's slasher flicks\\" but unlike those films, there is almost no blood and the body count is relatively low.<br /><br />This is a must-have for any fan of the horror genre or for anyone who is looking for a good horror film.<br /><br />This version of the film includes a second disc with several documentaries with interviews of the stars and producers.
0143038419|3.0|Given the rave reviews, I started this book with much anticipation and excitement.  Maybe that was the problem...while I enjoyed the book and admire the author's personal journey, I cannot proclaim it \\"my bible\\" or \\"the book that turned my life around\\".  It did allow me to see how fortunate I am in my life and maybe that was all it was meant to be.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I am not the kind of film buff who cries at movies. My wife complains that I am too intellectual, detached from my feelings. Yet, I was moved to tears watching this film, not an oscar-winning melodrama, but a documentary. I am not a sickly or dying individual, but I was able to relate. I am 38 years old, married and our daughter had just turned a year old. So of course I thought about our situation. What if our daughter caught a high fever?! What if my wife developed breast cancer, which runs high in her family? I watched the stories of those who actually died because they were denied payment (\\"we don't deny services, only payment\\"), or the stories of those who lost their homes from medical bills, deductibles and copays.<br /><br />I interrupted my viewing of this movie to call my health insurance company to find out if a Sleep Apnea study my doctor ordered was covered by my insurance. They said that I needed precertification first, and even if they did, I would have to pay a $250 deductible. I had to cancel the study. I haven't had a good night's sleep in years and now it seems this will continue. I work in social services with people whose lives were totally changed due to unexpected illness or accidents. I can't describe to you how it feels to see a 60 year old man cry because his Medicare won't pay for the proper medication and I can't do anything but ask him to turn to God.<br /><br />But what moved me to tears was the story of the woman who lost her home and had to move into her daughter's computer room due to illness and medical bills. Michael Moore brought her to Cuba where they have universal healthcare, and the look on her face when they told her all of the care she was receiving was free... If we had a system like theirs, she may have never lost her home. I was really able to see why other countries have a higher quality of life than us, because there is a much stronger sense of community and caring between its citizens. Here, you're seen as a lazy vagrant if you ask for help from others.<br /><br />I just read all of the one star reviews for this movie, 8 so far. Two of them were not even criticisms of the movie. The others railed against Moore's research of universal healthcare in other countries saying how bad it is in Canada and Britain (long lines, lack of quality healthcare,etc.) but that is just the way it is over here, but we have to pay for it! NONE of the 1-star reviews attempts to disprove the medical atrocities that happened to the Americans in this movie, because they are all true.<br /><br />One of the 1-star reviews, by SN in East Oakland, proves my point about our lack of community are caring in our country with regard to ensuring the health of it's citizens. He writes of universal healthcare: \\"What gives you the right to force others to provide for you without compensation?\\" The doctors interviewed in the movie did not have guns pointed at their heads, they were providing medical care free to the people because they wanted to and feel that's the way it should be: if you have a medical problem, you deserve the best medical care possible without being frightened of the cost. Any country who says that it's citizens are human beings who deserve dignity should provide this basic service, just like the police force and firefighters, two other life-saving free social services.<br /><br />I've heard people complaining about the healthcare industry in the US, but I never internalized how horrific the conditions are. And if you think I am being dramatic, tell that to the people in the movie whose loved ones died because they were denied coverage for life saving medical services. This movie was a revelation for me.r help from others.     I just read all of the one star reviews for this movie, 8 so far. Two of them were not even criticisms of the movie.

B00003CXB2|5.0|A sweeping look at a man who was made by the Great War.<br /><br />Lawrence, a scholar and archeologist prior to the war (something the movie seems to miss) was sent by the British to assist the Arabs who were at that time revolting against their Ottoman masters. The British hoped that an Arab revolt would draw resources away from the Egyptian frontier and from Mesopotamia, allowing the allies to invade the Turkish homeland.<br /><br />Lawrence, working with Prince Faisal, did manage to organize the Arabs after a fashion to attack the Turks but the Arabs were using the British as much as the British were using the Arabs. The difference was that the British had much more far-reaching goals for the region.<br /><br />The movie is a great action film but not necessarily great history. But it is a winderful movie to sit down and watch. Lawrence was successful because he took up the Arab cause as his own. His exploits also served Allied propaganda at a time when everything was stalled on the Western Front.<br /><br />As an aside, Lawrence could not live with being the hero portrayed by the Allies. He tried to get away from the person everyone thought he was.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie has been long awaited in our house. Between loving to cook and loving fancy rats - this movie had it all for us. But it also had sooooo much more - fun times, serious moments and just plain great animation. And they got the rats to be so realistic - thank you Debbie for your input and thank you Pixar for listening. Great job to everyone who worked on this film. This is sooo worth the theatre ticket as well as the DVD price and should be added to anyone's DVD library. Don't miss it - Remember, \\"Anyone Can Cook\\"!

B000OV170W|3.0|The good parts:  - premise is very interesting; it alone was enough to make me think.   - Jodi Picoult writes well enough that it is a page turner.      The bad parts:  - so many points of view are unnecessary and, in my opinion, detract from the story.  In particular, why have a POV for Campbell and Julia?    - unessential romance between Campbell and Julia adds up to several wasted pages.  It was an ok story for another book.   - The ending.  Dramatic endings have a time and place, but in my opinion, this was not it.  In this case, it is the sign of a writer who just wanted to make a shocking impact instead of staying true to book's theme.   - Inaccuracies.  These I can forgive simply because this is a work of fiction.  However, the credibility factor certainly goes away due to these inaccuracies (e.g. legal process, epilepsy, etc.)

B00000ILDE|3.0|Nearly sixty years have passed in 'Earth Time' and Ripley is still floating around in space, oblivious to the world she has left behind, or the world she's just escaped from. Nearly sixty years, she hasn't aged a day but her daughter on Earth has since died. After being rescued, she is told the two great pieces of news that will rock her world forever: her daughter has died, and the planet she escaped from, has now been colonised. But they've lost contact with the colonists.<br /><br />So James Cameron's version of Aliens begins. Taking over the reins from Ridley Scott, comes a far more superior version, expertly handled, and better written, with better characters. I still dislike the first one. But then I disliked the first Harry Potter book! So long as I persevere it's fine. James Cameron has to be one of my favourite directors and I own a few of his movies - plus, he's the only director I can normally put a film to!<br /><br />What makes this movie so much better, is the characters. They're likeable, you want them to survive, and they also have better back stories. Watching Sigourney Weaver's brilliant portrayal of Ripley discovering the awful news that the daughter she left behind, barely a teenager, lived to be an old woman, and died never knowing what happened to her mother. The viewer can quite literally feel her emotion, her sense of loss, knowing that her daughter grew up without her. I hated Ripley's character originally, she just didn't click with me. But by expanding her role, and showing her maternal instinct with the little girl who's found alive on the planet, it works a whole lot better, and makes her likeable.<br /><br />Bringing in the James Cameron standards, Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, also works for me. After working with Cameron on many of his films, you can understand why they make a good team on screen, as Cameron really does bring out the best in Paxton. He almost steals some of the scenes out from under the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Carrie Henn, as the mysterious little girl, left behind on the planet to fend for herself, is a shining star in this movie, and it's a shame it was her first and only film role.<br /><br />With brilliant effects, I have to say that this movie far surpasses the original, and where some sequels failed, this definitely didn't. It has an outstanding cast and director, and for me, was definitely the superior of the Alien movies so far. I've only seen two!!! Definitely worth seeing, if like me, you weren't that keen on the original.ttle girl, left behind on the planet to fend for herself, is a shining star in this movie, and it's a shame it was her first and only film role.

B000OVLBF8|4.0|On the surface, Ghost Rider is a cool concept.  I mean, a biker that's a flaming skull--the same skull that is on a lot of bikers' belt buckles?  How could you go wrong with that?<br /><br />The thing is, Ghost Rider looks cool, but he's a comic book character, so he needs to be more fleshed out than just an iconic burning skull.  That's when things get weird.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of modern Ghost Rider, but I never knew how wacky his background really is.  It involves the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and demons from hell.  Surprisingly, the Ghost Rider movie taps into the weirdness and seems to even revel in it.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) makes a deal with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda, the original Easy Rider): in exchange for saving his father from cancer, Blaze's soul is Mephisto's property.  Of course, the deal turns sour and Blaze discovers that an interesting quirk of his contract: Since Blaze's soul is spoken for, he's nigh indestructible, a trait that's particularly useful in Blaze's career as a daredevil. Eventually, Mephisto comes calling on his debt, and it's a doozy: Mephisto's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) is attempting to usurp his father by absorbing a thousand souls.  And that's when Blaze discovers he actually bursts into flames, his skin melts off, and he becomes the walking skeleton known as Ghost Rider.<br /><br />The plot is reminiscent of Blade in that the bad guy is rebelling against his destiny, filled with a grand plan that basically translates to: \\"I'll do everything the other bad guys do, only ten thousand times bigger!\\" In Blackheart's case, it's a town that sold its collective souls to the devil in another contract.  If Blackheart can collect, it will be enough to help him take over the world.  MUAAHAHAHAHAH.<br /><br />Ahem.  Anyway, there are some other characters, like Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendez, who can rock a dress like nobody's business), and a former Ghost Rider himself, Caretaker (Same Elliott).  They're mostly window dressing really for Ghost Rider to strut his stuff.  Ghost Rider (actually a demon bound to Johnny's soul, but why quibble) is a CGI marvel of chains, flames, and a demonic motorcycle that defies physics.  The Four Horsemen have been replaced with three elemental demons (Gressil, Wallow, and Abigor) instead, who are really just special effects rather than actual characters.<br /><br />What's interesting about Ghost Rider is that the film takes a leather-wearing bike-riding demon to its logical conclusion, complete with SWAT teams and a shootout in the middle of the city.  Then it shifts to a supernatural battle with the demon family, interspersed with Johnny Blaze's comedic struggles with his nightlife.  Occasionally, Ghost Rider does that thing that drove me crazy about the Spawn movie - random shots that suddenly appear in the middle of the film, disrupting the flow, just to show a cool shot.  In this case, it's the two Ghost Riders (modern and western) riding side-by-side to Ghost Riders in the Sky.  Fortunately, it's cool enough to watch that I forgave the director (Mark Steven Johnson).<br /><br />Cage handles most of the heavy lifting.  Next to cage, Mendez just can't keep up.  The rest of the crew are interesting, but it's the special effects that really make the film. Unlike the Hulk, the CGI effects are flawless.<br /><br />Overall, Ghost Rider was a lot more enjoyable than I expected. If you can get on board with the idea of a demonic biker of vengeance working as a bounty hunter for the devil, you won't be disappointed.ly for Ghost Rider to strut his stuff.

B000UR9TQO|1.0|Some audio expresions from Robert Plant are missing on this dvd version  I notice that almost at the end of \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" track you don't hear a \\"come on, here we go\\" compared to the vhs, also at the middle of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" there is another missing vocal bit when Robert repeats \\"wait a minute\\" for the second time...  Even at the end of the same track you can't find another line.   If you look for these discrepancies you will be amazed of how people dare to CHANGE MUSIC HISTORY during a remasterization process.

0192802380|5.0|If you're looking for the Regency as memorialized by Harry Flashman, the regency of his father, with country house parties enlivened with chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours (as Flashy says), you've come to the wrong shop (as Flashy says).<br /><br />If you're looking for Sharpe roaring about Spain doing his Peninsular duty while beautiful and passionate ladies shrug off those gauzy empire gowns to reveal naught, knickers not having come in fashion, Miss Austen will give you the right about, and, if that fails, have the servants throw you out.<br /><br />The post-sixties restoration of Austen has I think its origin in a rejection by Western elites of the \\"spirit of the 1960s\\"...which was mostly chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours, a second Regency.<br /><br />It was Byronic, it was Blakean, it was mad, it was creative destruction, or destructive creation. I can't remember but it sure was fun.<br /><br />But creative destruction, may I introduce diastolic reproduction? People must be fed, infants amused, servants chastised, houses kept up, and daughters married off.<br /><br />However, \\"creative destruction\\" versus Austen's faith in a serious reproduction of fortunes and daily life forgets and  shuns another -tion.<br /><br />This is exploitation. The sensitive reader is appalled of course in a minor key by Mr. Collins' toadying of Lady Catherine. But what's unsaid is that the land on which Austen's heroes lived was stolen land.<br /><br />I would have killed Jane Bennet off in her first fever. In my version, John Paul Jones lands and sets the Bennet's house to the torch. Elizabeth would have been abducted by a motley crew of Red Indians, pirates and Jacobins, to wind up at Waterloo crazed with love for a D'Arcy of a Frog, and nothing to be done.<br /><br />But: the work of art must be accepted on its own terms.

B00000JXVK|4.0|I liked this film but can't quite agree with calling it the \\"best motorcycle movie ever\\" (as it was advertised to me by other people). For that, it is too one-sided on dirt. I'm missing more road racing. I would have loved to see some of the now legendary racers and bikes of this period's GP circuit.    Besides the motorcycling aspect I see this film as a document of a particular time: the overall feel is very upbeat, and people's looks are different compared to nowadays. That made it interesting to me in itself.

B000JVSUS4|4.0|A truly horrible movie with bad acting and moronic script. When the best thing you can say about a movie is that the special effects were good, then the movie sucks. The bluray version looks great. A big budget(wasted here) movie like this was obviously shot with great equipment making a prime candidate for a bluray release. Too bad Ben Affleck couldn't act his way out of a paper bag in this one. Almost like he knew how bad this would suck already. I guess the Michael Bay thing tipped him off.
0375847227|4.0|I first read the Dark Materials series a few years ago, and recently got the Omnibus edition as its beautifully presented with a gorgeous cover and has all three books in one volume. Frankly, I am bewildered by all the hoopla surrounding these books, and can only conclude that its tied in to the movie release and its controversial approach to traditional religion, specifically Christianity.<br /><br />My answer to all those bashing the books - if you truly feel that the author's anti-Christian stance offends you, then don't read them. But, please, let the rest of us who would like to make our own informed decision as to whether to read the book or watch the movie do so in peace. Yes, there are aspects in the books that may require some explanation esp if younger children are reading them, and yes, there are also some dark elements that may not be suitable for really young children, BUT this is where parents/ guardians come in - to explain the deeper issues brought forth in the series, and inculcate critical thinking skills in younger readers.<br /><br />In the end - its an individual's choice, and parents can make informed decisions for their kids if they are too young to grasp the complexities within these stories. The series itself in my opinion is well-written, and though there are some touchy issues, it makes for compelling analysis and intelligent discussion, things that make a book worth reading. Stop with the bashing already!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Awesome pretty much describes this.  It's one of the best concert films I've ever seen.  Gilmour & band are in top form, the special guests are great, and I haven't even begun to dig into the wealth of extras included on the DVD.  If you like Floyd, Gilmour, concert films or just great music, don't miss this!
B000O75F7C|5.0|\\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" is heavy - musically and emotionally. Those hoping for the uplifting harmonies of \\"Lazarus\\" or the sonic guitar explorations of 90's era PT won't find that here.    What the listener will find on FoaBP is a musical and lyrical journey into the youthful psyche of modern life, from the point of view of those addicted to - yet alienated by - the trappings of western culture. If you enjoyed Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall by Pink Floyd, Melancholie and the Infinite Sadness by Smashing Pumpkins, or Amused to Death by Roger Waters, chances are you'll enjoy this CD as well.    Unlike most bands categorized as progressive rock, Steven Wilson's Porcupine Tree has always been able to inject tons of emotion into the music, even as they perform songs that change times and tempos and weave intricate lines and melodies together. FoaBP is no exception, and - keeping in mind that each PT album is distinct from the others - I think it's their most brilliant album so far.     Much like Amused to Death by Roger Waters, it took me a few listens to really appreciate this particular album. I was so used to Deadwing, their previous disc, which is a collection of very different songs that could work as the soundtrack for a script Wilson co-wrote with Mike Bennion. There are only six tracks on this CD, and they are not radio friendly (a plus in my book).    As for the songs on this album, \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" comes out of the gate with percussive acoustic guitar picking that's soon joined by swirling guitars and PT's trademark drum sound. \\"My Ashes\\" is the closest you'll get to \\"Lazarus\\" on FoaBP - it's just as beautiful as Lazarus but in a darker way - and you can feel the lonliness and disconnection in the words and warbling keyboards.     \\"Anesthetized\\" is the long centerpiece of FoaBP, somewhat like \\"Arriving Somewhere\\" is on Deadwing, but it's actually two songs put together (a 12 minute piece featuring Rush's Alex Lifeson on the guitar solo, and a 4 minute piece with amazing vocal harmonies that are far less poppy than the ones on \\"In Absentia\\").     Listening to \\"Sentimental\\", you'll know how it feels to grow up anesthetized and come out of it older and lost. \\"Way out of Here\\" expresses the disconnect from family and the loss of attachment and affinity for those who care.     Porcupine Tree are musicians of the finest caliber, and Steven Wilson is progressive rock's best songwriter. FoaBP tells an emotional story of depression, alienation, drug abuse, and apathy. By time you hear \\"Sleep Together\\" you too might think that the cure for it all is to burn your clothes, erase everything from your computer and online profiles, and find refuge in the closeness of another human being.    After all, isn't that what we're subconsiously seeking through our devices and material objects?
B00005JMFQ|5.0|It has become one of our favorites, sort of a Christmas classic like \\"The Santa Clause\\" or \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".  Great ensemble cast, cute story, something you can comfortably watch again and again.  Definately a DVD you want to own rather than rent.
630587493X|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It takes a special kind of person to enjoy a movie like this. It is definitely not for the ones who enjoy horror or action. It is for the kind-hearted gentle soul, who can be gently touched by all that human mature is. I loved it.
B0000634EV|3.0|What can I say about Down II?  It's ok.  It doesn't come close to the intensity or punchy agressiveness of Nola in any way.  It's more of a southern rock feel on most of the songs.  It's not terrible, but if you bought it (like I did) expecting more of the electricity of their first album, you'll likely be a bit disappointed.    Still, there are some great songs on the album.  It's got a good feel and some solid songwriting.  It's just not the jewel that their first one was.    Overall - If you're a big fan of the band, get it.  If you're a big fan of the first album, probably oughta borrow it from a buddy first and hear what you're getting before you drop the coin on it.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|Like most I was kind of bummed out when Human After All was released in early 2005, it took the sheer tour de force of their coachella live show to wash the bad taste out of my mouth. When I found out they would be touring again in 2007 I was ecstatic. I purchased tickets for the New York show in March and began to plot for an unforgettable show. By the time August rolled around I was in a DP frenzy having seen clips of the show on Youtube all summer.<br /><br />The clips did very little to prepare me for the sensory overload at the show. The lights, the body moving bass, everything was perfect. By the time the encore was over my body was jelly, yet I wanted more. A few weeks later the details of this release were announced and I preordered immediately. If you want to remember a great show or introduce it to friends that didn't go. Buy this cd. The encore is worth the full price of admission so 3 bucks more isn't a big deal considering the lovely packaging it comes in.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|I wasn't as impressed with Down II as I was with Nola.  II was a bit laid back for me.    Over the Under is a step back in the direction of Nola.  It's not quite as agressive or heavy as Nola, but it's considerably heavier than II was.  I really enjoyed this album.  There's some good songwriting, some really catchy riffs, and an all around solid feel to this album, similar to Nola, but not exactly the same.    Overall, I'd recommend buying this one before I'd say buy Down II.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|Taylor Swift and her beautiful voice make this cd great. Though the music seems a little juvenile, it takes you back to how things were when you were a kid. All the plain innocence of having a first crush and other dreams.
B000SM7QUC|3.0|I really thought this CD would have been way different. I was expecting more rock but it seems like a lot of parts have someone talking in them. I understand this CD was a soundtrack to a book but who really does that nowadays? I mean, people do soundtracks to movies of course, but a book? It just seems really awkward to me and even though I really like the song Life Is Beautiful, the rest of the CD is just okay. In fact, the only reason I bought the CD was for that song but instead I just bought into a bunch of talking and a way for the person to make more bucks by advertising his book through a CD.

B000UX6THK|4.0|The video quality of this \\"Definitive\\" edition is stunningly good, and well worth the waiting.  The incredible lighting & camera craft of the original series is fully realized & a joy to behold.      However, as another reviewer has already noted there are programming errors in the \\"episode\\" menu of discs #4 and #6 that leave you without an on-screen cursor, forcing you to retreat & use \\"play all\\" to access the content.    As to the content...  There is a large chunk of program missing around the start of disc #4!  The whole sequence where Cooper is laying on the floor in his hotel room after being shot IS NOT THERE!  As I remember, there were two important scenes in the gap: one involving the World's Most Decrepit Waiter, and another where the giant gives Cooper three clues & takes his ring from him as a token for later.  These scenes were important for establishing later threads of the story, and they are simply not present!  So much for the \\"Definitive\\" label...    Still, I'm glad to have this DVD edition.  It really is gorgeous, and hopefully the errors will be remedied by the Quality Control Genie in the near future.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|The final season of Gilmore Girls gave a proper send-off to all of our friends in Stars Hollow.  After a more somber fifth and sixth season, the seventh started with some drama, but brought back the quick humor that we came to love with the earlier seasons.  The experiences Rory faces in her final year at Yale will hit home to anyone who has survived her own senior year of college.  And Lorelai's love life is--well not to spoil anything!-- a bit surprising, even for those of us who have stuck around the past seven years.  The best part is that you get to see more of Stars Hollow this year, bringing the series full circle.  However, if you are new to \\"the Girls,\\" I would suggest starting with the first season.  Without the full background, you could be a little lost starting with season seven.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|This is a fantastic package for an essential late-1970s release by a legendary new wave group. The CD side of the DualDisc has the original album and four bonus tracks - including an unfinished outtake, Dancing For Money - while the DVD side has the original album in 5.1 Surround Sound, two live performances and an electic photo gallery.<br /><br />The live cuts are from the period when David Byrne began stretching the sound into funk with an expanded rhythm section and additional musicians. While the energy is electric, the tensions that started to fester within the group are seemingly demonstrated by the way Tina Weymouth disappears stage left and stage right during the numbers.<br /><br />Also, as stated on the packaging, the DualDisc \\"is intended to play on standard DVD and CD players. May not play on a limited number of models.\\" I did not have a problem with the playback and this concept is an outstanding means to deliver a wealth of new material in a variety of modes.
0525950079|4.0|I must say I really did enjoy this book.  It was hard to put down, despite my muscles burning from holding up this 1000 page monstrosity.  Mostly, I cared about the characters and I loved the hero and heroine.  It didn't quite live up to PotE, but that would have been a miracle if it had.<br /><br />That being said, I did take issue with a couple things in the book.  I felt like the thread holding the whole book together was a little contrived and, unlike PotE which had the central story of the building of Kingsbridge Priory as its central story, this one wandered a bit off track at times.  I didn't mind much, because the stories and subplots were compelling.<br /><br />The other problem I had was with the bad guys.  Sure, it was easy to hate them.  I mean, they were really bad.  And that's the problem.  They were just too evil.  There was virtually nothing redeeming about them, so much so that I ended up disbelieving them more than hating them.  What I found strange about this problem is that the good characters really did seem to have depth.  They were clever.  They were deep.  They had flaws.  All in all, they were much more believable than their dark counterparts.<br /><br />But those were minor complaints - the only things that kept this book from being a 5-star for me.<br /><br />I think if you liked Pillars, you'll like this.  And don't believe those who say it's way too lewd.  There is some rated R material, but it's mostly appropriate to the genre.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00005RFQ5|2.0|Prince is my favorite artist, even hero, of all time. He has had mostly ingeniously excellent albums and a few (NPG era) mediocre ones full of uncomposed \\"boom boom\\" filler with one or two hits on them, but few were actually bad, as in throw-away bad. Now 'Graffiti Bridge' was pretty bad in a retro way (lyrics include: \\"there is joy in repetition\\"), and includes a hodgepodge of old and new stuff, all lame. *This* album, 'Rainbow Children', like Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' or 'Final Cut' and especially Bowie's 'Diamond Dogs' has an overall story/theme that is however the equivalent of tacky glitter snow falling around white unicorns, for which this is the soundtrack. It's his only truly strange album. I only went online to look it up was to see why he made it, assuming it was a forgivable paid soundtrack for a movie or something (yet one of his best booty shaking songs is 'Bat Dance' for a Batman movie). My current theory is that in protest he made a blatantly tacky and unprofitable album to technically fulfill an unfair contract? Sure, there's a couple normal instead of insipid songs, but none are hit quality, so are not keepers for my Prince playlist. He did a sort of mythical story per song in the double disk 'Sign of the Times' (\\"Starfish and Cofee...\\"). That was \\"good\\" weird, and happy as hell, in the way an adult can enjoy a cardboard page children's book, or an episode of the Simpsons. But what is the epic, mythical story that structures *this* album? It's similar to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy': some bad guys build a \\"digital god\\" and then the \\"Rainbow Children\\" destroy it and dance around some magic tree. Even such a story could be profound, but like a joke, it needs good delivery. This flops so badly it made me cringe. He even uses a cheap sounding vocoder (voice changer box) to make his spoken narration of the story sound like a cartoon Dr. Evil. Only one song is actually sort of funny instead of tortured: 'Family Name'; so if you are a huge Prince collector/fan and want the only actually cool song on this disk, get this song from iTunes (or lately Amazon). It's funny since it has a Steven Hawkings sounding computer voice saying goofy stuff, then the song becomes classic Prince singing/jamming. Surgically extracted from this gum stuck to your shoe album, on its own it's a keeper, but still not of hit or even novelty quality.
B001041JLE|5.0|As soon as Sony confirmed the release of Thriller 25, I was very excited. Both Sony and Michael Jackson deserve an applaud for this newer and modern version of an already amazing album. I cant wait for the re-mixes, and hope several singles are released so everybody can experience the magic of Thriller all over again. This album is a great springboard to a new Michael Jackson album later this year, getting people thinking about MJ in a musical sense!Cant Wait!!
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|This movie reminded me of The Bourne films, in a way.  Mark Wahlberg played a nearly indestructable ex-military man, who was the most amazing shot in the history of mankind.  Very entertaining film, great action sequences, and like my headline suggests, non-stop 2-hour thrills.  Highly recommended.
0375846735|5.0|I found that the final installment to Pullman's His Dark Materials series completed a well constructed plot, and incorporated scientific concepts into fantasy without actually feeling like science fiction. Despite the controversy, and I can see how this book can be considered quite heretical, the underlying idea is about the potential of the abusing power and the revolting that can emerge because of it. In contrast to many other allegorical tales intended to denigrate religion, Pullman was daring enough to name outright his antagonists as the Church and God. This bold stance tends to suggest a heretical viewpoint when misinterpreted as anything other than pure fiction. And to be honest, being familiar with the sciences discussed, if anything I would feel more inclined to be offended by Pullman's liberties with dark matter and quantum physics than the commentary on religion.     Altogether the final book wrapped everything up in a pretty pink bow, and left me with a solid impression of the imaginative worlds Pullman created. The story was focused, well constructed, had many twists in plot, full of adventurous situations, and dealt with themes that ultimately impact not only man's consciousness but the entire multiverse. Although initially hesitant to commit myself to children's fantasy, I consider my time sitting behind these books as well spent and the combined series as one of the most memorable things read throughout the year.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|by now, everyone and their brother can make a computer animated movie.  They just can't make good ones.  With the onslaught on animated product coming out of everyone's basement it's hard to know what to go see.  So, we're forced to have to go back and think about what makes a movie a really good movie (no matter how good the animation).  And that, of course, is the story.  I don't care how pretty your movie looks, if you don't have a good story to tell and good characters to tell it, you have nothing.  I am happy to say that (unless the sight of a swarm of rats in a kitchen disturbs you)you are going to love this movie.  It's your basic \\"fish out of water\\" told wonderfully and animated with exquisite detail.  More for adults then kids it still appeals to everyone. Even though there's not a single penguin in it, I advise you not to pass this one up.

Examining every step along the way in the natural (and now artificial) food chain, and investigating our American obsession with eating, dieting, body image, and the industry behind our twenty-first century mass consumption, Michael Pollan's research for this work sets the standard, and is an interesting read on top of that. One of the best non-fiction books of this decade.

B0002STNQ2|2.0|It's been quite a while since I've read a book this bad from an author so well known.  I remember reading \\"Lost World\\" when I was a teenager and I recall enjoying it, (though it was about mercenary hunters chasing dinosaurs...can't miss) but I never realized how bad of a writer Mr. Crichton truly is.      He's an imaginative guy, and his stories typically follow the tight-knit formula of a summer blockbuster movie...but the prose itself is disasterous.      Hey, how bad could it really be, though?  I read this one from front to back.    It begins strong---I would tell anyone that the first half of the book is a solid read, but the writer quickly loses control of his story and it soon devolves into a cheesy action movie-slash-invasion of the bodysnatchers crapfest.      It's going to be hard to ever pick up a Chrichton book again, though I would hate for people to judge Stephen King if they accidentally picked up \\"From A Buick 8\\".    You may like his work, which I'm certainly in no position to say that he doesn't have some good stuff out there (this may very well be Crichton's \\"Buick 8\\") but you cannot tell me with a straight face that \\"Prey\\" is a good book.

0393327655|5.0|We literally tore it apart. It was that good! We were a chapter apart and tore off sections reading each one separately. If you are an atheist, it's a great book because you won't feel so alone after reading it. If you are an agnostic, it may help clear things up for you. I would also recommend A History of God and the God Delusion if you are thinking about reading around the subject.

B000Y179KO|5.0|After a 28 year hiatus, the Eagles still have their great sense of harmony and solid music. These guys still sound great and show they can still put out some great music. This cd is a little more mellow than many of us might have expected, but it is perfect for me. It is rare for me to like most of the songs on a cd, usually I have three maybe four favorites but that is it. In this compilation, there is only one maybe two that will not be favorites. I am not a fan of Fast Company, but it has its place. I think this song turned me off initially because the first time I heard it I thought someone was trying to sound like Prince.    The Eagles have something to say with most of the songs here. We may not always agree with their views, but I respect their desire to make a difference. At least they make us stop and think. I like the title song, \\"Long Road Out of Eden.\\" The music is good, vocals superb, and has words that make me think.     My favorites include \\"No More Cloudy Days,\\" \\"Do Something,\\" \\"You Are Not Alone,\\" and \\"It's Your World Now.\\" I wish more artists would put out music that actually had meaning.     And no, Ronnie Aldridge, I am not going to compare this cd to any of their other music. It is good that they try something new and I think this effort can stand on its own merit. We can either like it or not. We each have that freedom of choice.     Bottom line is that the Eagles still sound great. This cd is worth every penny paid for it and I choose to give it 5 stars.

Footage is incredible and you just think of how blessed we are to live in an age where we can see things that no one before us could have witnessed (in totality).  This series is spectacular.  What I also love about it is that you can watch it with your kids.  My 1 and 2 year old absolute love it as much as me and my husband do.  Scenes of chases and kills are done tastefully so it doesn't frighten children, yet still close up so that you get the full picture.  I cannot recommend this enough.  Its great.

0440238609|1.0|I just read the Golden Compass from the trilogy and must say this is the worst book I've ever read. I don't even want to read the others. It lacks creativity and character.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|36 years ago I saw a movie so bad that I've waited all this time for something to top it. Congratulations, Babel. A meaningless disco scene does on for 20 minutes with the sound going silent again and again and yet again to make sure for the millionth time that you identify with the deaf protagonist.  Every US border agent is portrayed as an inhumane bumpkin.  While Kate Blanchett's character is bleeding to death in a Morrocan village for days because the US embassy can't find a medivac, we cut back to the Mexican border to see helicopters on border patrol. I guess we're supposed to be subliminally moved about this \\"waste\\". A japanese businessman starts the ongoing tragedy half a world away by giving a friend a rifle. When Blanchett is finally evacuated, the theadbare village won't take the money repeatedly offered in thanks. If it was only preachy claptrap, hamhandedly presented, it wouldn't be unique. But the agonizingly slow pace makes it completely unbearable.
B000005S5N|5.0|Hi fellow music lovers,   If you guys are thinking of starting out with a-ha, this is the album to buy first or second what ever. This album IS my personal favorite album, although all albums are awesome!
B000O75F7C|5.0|I'm not going to go into an elaborate review as I think most everything has been said already. This cd is an incredible display of talent in a day when good cd's are harder and harder to come by. A friend of mine turned me onto this band and I have their last 3 cd's. I am open to suggestions on some of their earlier work. The writing on In Absentia, Dead Wing, and Fear of a Blank Planet really showcases what it means to write and produce well. I wish Kid Rock and Velvet Revolver would have followed suit in their latest offerings which after listening to this band, sounded very safe, generic, and boring.

B000002VEP|4.0|\\"Gaudi\\" would prove to be the last official Alan Parsons Project album that included Parson's long time collaborator Eric Wolfson.  The album is a concept piece that concerns the work of Italian artist Antonio Gaudi.  The album is fairly short with only 7 tracks.  I remember when it came out I thought that it was a bit of a letdown, but over the years it has aged quite nicely.  The opening track \\"La Sagrada Familia\\" is great and sets the tone for the rest of the disc.  The single \\"Standing On Higher Ground\\" is another APP pop gem that should have been a bigger hit than it was.  The ballads \\"Closer To Heaven\\" and \\"Inside Looking Out\\" are both nice and the instrumental finale \\"Paseo De Gracia\\" is a fitting ending to the piece.  I rate this album slightly below the APP best stuff, but it is a nice little album that would mark the end of an era.
B000TP5T6Q|4.0|Some have called this project a disaster. This is an \\"operatic\\" version of West Side Story and may not be for everyone. The problem is that Jose Carreras was ill suited to the work. It shows the uncomfortable problems Bernstein has with Carreras. There is a moment when both were very annoyed with each other. But, Kiri Te Kanawa is glorious and the chorus and other singers are a delight. The DVD shows Bernstein was not well during the project: smoking a lot and moments when he seems to be in pain. Despite its problems the singing of \\"One Hand One Heart\\" is the best you will ever hear. Like I said, great but flawed. Still, the music is timeless and the DVD is very interesting to watch.
B000JLQSWE|4.0|I have read that this album was supposed to be a sequel of sorts to the previous one \\"Ammonia Avenue\\".  The subject matter is similar in some ways.  I don't think that this is a great APP disc, but it does have its moments.  \\"Let's Talk About Me\\", \\"Separate Lives\\", \\"Days Are numbered\\", and \\"Same Old Sun\\" are all good tunes.  The instrumental \\"Hawkeye\\" is cool too.  Overall I would say that it is an above average disc, but not quite up there with the band's best.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|I'm writing this review specifically for the remastered versions of Still Life Talking, Letter From Home, and Secret Story. Chances are you probably already own these and are wondering about the new versions. If these are some of your favorite albums, as they are mine, then you can't go wrong. Of the 3, SLT and LFH show the biggest improvements. They both have a much wider soundstage and improved depth with a much cleaner high end as well as powerful bass and clarity. I have listened side by side with the originals and the difference is VERY noticeable. If you have a good system these are fine recordings. (No Ipods please.)    However unless you are die hard Metheny fan, Secret Story is not that great an improvement. This was already a great recording, especially for 15 years ago, and side by side with the original it's hard to tell. In some areas slightly. Enough to warrant the cost of a new CD, well maybe. The extra bonus CD material is mediocre at best and even though I'm a huge fan I probably could have lived without it. It's just OK. Nothing stellar here.    Bottom line: SLT and LFH? Yes, definitely an improvement. Get them. SS....well, maybe if you're a huge fan. (Or if you've never heard this album in the first place. Some of the best music ever made. Period.)

B00004T9VY|5.0|Some people think Cat Stevens is one of those hippie type of songwriters because he likes to mix mellow rock with the style of commercial rock that was popular during the 70's.  The truth is, he's not like that at all.  He shouldn't be compared to the Grateful Dead in any way (not that someone would compare the two anyway).  I just mean his style of songwriting isn't like anyone else, even though the SOUND of his music isn't that far off from Seals & Crofts, America or Carole King.      You see, many of those hippie artists might remind you of, oh I don't know, everyone on earth standing on top of the planet and holding hands. Cat Stevens has a more realistic kind of easy, pleasant vibes.  When I listen to his music, I think about all the different cultures in our world, and the great feelings that go along with it.  China, India, Australia, you name it.  Every country has a certain level of satisfaction, and Cat Stevens has the talent to write music that fits the pictures in my head of each and every unique country in the world.      Of course, he's also a magnificent songwriter.  Not many people can write one memorable song after another.  The way he persistently writes each song with such ease and special consideration is something amazing.  He's a talented man, and that's why people are still remembering and singing his songs all these years later.  Pick up all his classic 70's albums.  Every one of them.

B000W4HJ44|4.0|I have never been a big fan of musicals. I did do some time in theater a few years back and that gave me a new respect for them. I must say that this movie musical is done right. Lets start with the songs....right? How good can a musical be without great songs? The songs in Hairspray are fun and catchy and like the movie, fast paced. The cast is very appealing and has the energy to keep this film alive. Travolta is pretty scary looking as the obese Edna but, the charm of the character wins you over. Pfeiffer (50ish)is as hot as ever and plays a villain. The three leads, spunky ever-positive Blonsky, \\"cutie pie\\" Bynes and \\"heartthrob\\" Efron are perfectly cast. I thought the film was just a little too long but, it is one movie that lives up to the trailers promise of fun! The DVD transfer looks great, with excellent audio and there are many fun extras.
0751529818|4.0|Fortunately for us, Mitch Albom's newspaper went on strike and he convinced his dying professor to take on one final project with him.     When they crossed paths again after 16 years, Morrie was dying slowly from Lou Gehrig's disease and Mitch was at the top of his profession.  After years of struggling, Mitch had finally found his calling with newspapers, TV, and radio in the sports mad city of Detroit.      Mitch spent 14 Tuesdays with Morrie and got grounded in what is really important in life.  Morrie was one of the bigger than life characters, blessed with an endless interest in people and a long list of very good friends. In the final semester, Mitch takes Morrie's lead and thinks more carefully about family, friends, living, dying, religion, our place in the world, and the importance of education and work.    This is an excellent read, difficult to put down.  As always Mitch Albom writes well in both fiction and non-fiction, here he shows us a little bit of himself.

B00005JM0B|3.0|Compared with the utter drivel that's been out *this* year - Transformers, Beowulf, etc. - Terminator 3 is an enjoyable action to munch away the popcorn to. The special effects are decent, the action sequences memorable, and it's not too long.<br /><br />The problem with Terminator 3 is that the first two set the bar so high that it fails as a successor in the franchise. The plot is a rehash of the second one, the female Terminator is a joke (although nice to look at, plot holes abound, and it just so feels so ...  underwhelming.<br /><br />Of course, the first two are legendary so expectations are high. Once Fox has danced all over the grave of quality with The Terminator Chronicles being released soon, maybe T3 will look like the best movie of the decade.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|The movie was great and so is the sound track. Even though the Beatles are legends, these songs were covered well and used uniquely in the movie. It was amazing. Not to mention Paul MaCartney himself, I believe, helped with the movie. My only problem is that I'm not sure if all the music that was in the movie is on the soundtrack and the fact that even though only pieces of the songs were in the movie, they didn't put the whole song on the soundtrack. I was hoping for a complete cover of the songs on the soundtrack not only the tidbits they had in the film.Overall great product, better than the regular soundtrack which was missing a lot of the great songs this extended one has.

B0013MYNYS|5.0|I had seen not one, but two, articles in MAJOR newspapers attacking the Golden Compass by reactionary Roman Catholic organizations before it was even released! What alarms me most is that secular newspapers are printing articles asking people not to watch this movie on religious grounds! I find that quite astonishing! I'm sure there are numerous religious groups that would like the public not to watch, or read, something because it's against their beliefs. What I'd like to find out is why these outrageous attacks on The Golden Compass are being printed as hard news, instead of being delegated to the editorial page where it's appropriate to express one's beliefs!<br /><br />And I'd also love to know what public relations firms these Catholic organizations were using because it appears to be an extremely well-orchestrated effort!<br /><br />The Dark Materials trilogy is some of the most profound pieces of literature I have had the good fortune to read in my entire life! It's on par with the Lord of the Rings as far as emotional depth is concerned. While the movie can never capture the endless rich nuances of the book - it was a good try.<br /><br />I enjoyed all three books in the trilogy, but The Golden Compass is just a warm-up for the next two books, which will knock your socks off. The theology and imagination that runs through this trilogy is absolutely subversive and incredibly moving. It will drive conservatives crazy because it attacks religious authoritarianism with such mind-boggling intensity. Something truly unparalleled in modern fantasy literature.<br /><br />My concern while driving home after watching this movie is simply this - will the next two sequels be neutered by Hollywood because it will drive conservatives within the Catholic church bonkers? I hope the author, Philip Pullman, makes sure this does not happen. I would rather see this be the first, and last, Dark Materials trilogy film if some weenies up in Hollywood Central intends to sterilize the remaining story by ripping out its heart and soul!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:0300063733 Sin and Censorship: The Catholic Church and the Motion Picture Industry]] and [[ASIN:0521629055 The Catholic Crusade Against the Movies, 1940-1975]]he remaining story by ripping out its heart and soul!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:0300063733 Sin and Censorship: The Catholic Church and the Motion Picture Industry]] and [[ASIN:0521629055 The Catholic Crusade Against the Movies, 1940-1975]]
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Superbly acted, wonderfully captured - we sit rapt alongside our children, shouting \\"I do believe in fairies!\\" No one else could have played Pan better than Jeremy Sumpter, and Jason Isaacs' portrayal of the traditional dual-role Mr Darling/Hook is spot-on and engaging on both fronts. It was easy to forget that ANYONE was acting - even Tink! Thanks, Mr Hogan, for a beautiful film and excellent casting.
0790734850|5.0|Sun Tzu once said that \\"strength everywhere is strong nowhere.\\" That's a good way to describe this movie.  It is strong everywhere.  You cannot point to casting, or directing, or acting, or writing, or cinematography, and say \\"that's not as good as the rest.\\" It's uniformly great.  Guy Pearce was fantastic in a definite breakout performance; Kevin Spacey was dead on and Russell Crowe was completely convincing as the muscle head with he heart of gold.  See, there I go -- I can't criticize any of the actors relative to the others, they were all outstanding.<br /><br />Anyhow, buy this movie for your collection and you won't be disappointed.  The DVD transfer on my copy was excellent, although I wish it had additional features.  It's well worth full price.  The movie even has a surprisingly high body count for action fans!
B000P2A256|5.0|I purchased this CD after listening to the current singles and then the sample blurbs on [...].  Now I can't stop listening to it.  I bring it along in the car while I'm commuting, listen while I am emailing and futzing on the computer, and while I am relaxing before bed.  As tends to be the case there are a few tracks that I am obsessed with more than the others, however, there are none that I cannot stand, which is quite rare in the music world.

B000X1R4S2|2.0|I was assured IT is the most horror filled book of all. I was horrified, all right. Horrified at how boring it is.<br /><br />In fairness, some of the writing is sublime dream weaving, and much of it is ham-fisted typerwriter bludgeoning.<br /><br />IT makes a great door-stop.<br /><br />After posting my review, I waited a few months and read IT again. IT could have been a first-rate horror fantasy with plenty of pruning and tightening of the plot. There are wayyyyy too many irrelevant digressions and flash-backs and zzzzzzzzzzz. And the adults in the book are almost comatose when it comes to excitement about the wholesale slaughter of so many kids.<br /><br />King coulda made the Derry adults hysterical and clueless, that is deaf, dumb, and blind to IT but definitely excited about the Kiddie Killings. The kids coulda been their skirmishers.<br /><br />How did the graphic homoerotic scene get past the editors?
B000AWYOGE|4.0|This was a great movie because it showed the love between the mother and daughter. Jennifer Connelly's chacter flashes back to her childhood  and her mother was a mean mom that didn't love her and it affected  her alot.  The Dark Water just pushed her over the edge and caused her migranes.      This movie is a thrilller but you have to look for a deeper meaning in the movie to see what a great movie this really is.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This movie is a slap on the faces of Neo-Cons for whom anything \\"socialized\\" means evil.  Moore reminds us that we have a lot of things already socialized in America, such as Police, postal Service, education etc. that are working quite well.  He is right in pointing out that not even well-to-do americans can afford the healthcare bills if their insurance companies decline their claims, which these companies do quite often, thanks to so many exclusionary clauses.  The cost of healthcare in America is ridiculously high indeed, and the fact that more than 40 million Americans are without health insurance makes the situation really sickening!<br /><br />Neo-Cons defend the privatized healthcare by saying that people must have \\"choice\\" of drugs and doctors.  But one former British MP interviewed in the film was spot on when he said that, \\"choice depends on the freedom to choose.  If you are shackled in debt, you can't choose anything.\\"<br /><br />To me, the film is an eye-opener that enables one to look beyond the rhetoric propagated by pharmaceutical industry and their friends in washington.  If any American is still not seeing the truth, blinded by his hate for Michael Moore or his unquestioning faith in extreme capitalism, then he is beyond hope!
0316067598|5.0|The Book relays an account by a Patriot about his experiences in the Navy Seals, the war in Afghanistan , a tragic military mission, and his attempts to document it in memory of his fallen  Seal Teamates and Brothers. It won't take long to read because once you get into it you won't put it down. Try not to let your tears stain the pages and when you're done log onto Amazon and read all the different comments by the reviewers. All of these things are why it's worth 5 stars and why you should read it.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|Copying Beethoven   It's hard to imagine what a composer's personality is like after a few hundred years so. Unless we look at his music, analyze it and assume that he wrote to portray his emotions. As far as the historical accuracy of this film I am not quite sure if it is accurate. The relationship between a copyist and the composer himself seems possible. I can just imagine how crazy Beethoven can get. There were some terms that were used that I didn't think they used in the 19th Century, some of them were crude. But if someone were to watch it and not have any knowledge of Beethoven they might find it a cute film with not a whole lot of entertainment value, in my opinion. The whole story seemed like it just wanted to show that women didn't have any rights with the men. I guess someone could see it as that type of film. There were some redeeming factors like when Beethoven destroyed the bridge, I laughed a bit.   When Beethoven had the opportunity to critique the copyist's piece, he was completely insensitive and mocked her work. He didn't realize it at the time but it really hurt her. But it was obvious how much he changed from their relationship, before her he would have not cared and let them run away. But once he realized what he did he ran back to her and promptly apologized.  At this point I was wondering what was the actual plot line because It didn't seem to follow a single line. Just a lot of little plot lines.    Beethoven spoke of himself as Gods messenger and Anna was his mouthpiece. His music was as if God was speaking to the people, telling them of his love for them, the gifts he has given them, and giving them hope in a world that speaks of hopelessness. I think the writer was trying to put s spiritual message in here but missed the target by a bit.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I love every single track on this cd.  I saw her sing on still standing and was in shock, and not quite sure it was really her voice.  Then I saw the coming attractions for the chris botti live on pbs a while back.  I caught a glimpse of her and ordered her cd immediately...I mean come on, chris botti! She has become a favorite in my jazz collection. BUY IT!!!
0757302661|5.0|Marie Mongan's book is essential for those considering natural childbirth.  Inspired by the work of Grantly Dick-Read, M.D., author of [[ASIN:0953096467 Childbirth without Fear: The Principles and Practice of Natural Childbirth]], HypnoBirthing provides a comprehensive investigation of the history of childbirth, the psychology of a natural birth, hypnosis techniques, as well as a variety of tools that can be used to create a calm and gentle birth.    As a HypnoBirthing Childbirth Educator, I'm often asked, \\"Does hypnosis really help with childbirth?\\"  To answer, I frequently refer to the results of a large study published in 1993 by M.W. Jenkins and M.H. Pritchard in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology which found that women who used hypnosis during childbirth had shorter labor and used less pain medication.      Here are some of the results from the study:    1. First-time moms: average first stage of labor with hypnosis 6.4 hours compared to 9.3 hours without hypnosis    2. Moms who had given birth before: average first stage of labor with hypnosis 5.3 hours compared to 6.2 hours without hypnosis    3. Pain medication: both groups of hypnosis moms used significantly less pain medication than the non-hypnosis moms    Hypnosis can have a significant positive impact on birthing.  That being said, I have always thought that the name, HypnoBirthing, tends to sell this book short.  While hypnosis certainly plays a central role in the program, mothers and their birth companions also learn visualization, massage, breathing and other techniques to assist them in having a calm and gentle birth.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|This movie was fun to watch and it was better than the second one by miles.  Ocean's 12 was the most boring movie I've ever watch and I'm not exaggerating!  11 will always be better because the whole story is new to everyone but 12 tried to make it to confusing it didn't make sense.  Okay now back to 13 I absolutely can say that 13 was not as good as the first but it brought back an idea that normaly would be old and boring but made it interesting and fun.    P.S. Teaming up with the bad guy from the first movie was defiantly a plus
B000002UZ1|5.0|This double CD is a must for those who seek the best of the late 60's Beatles music. It has the cream of the crop from the White Album and great selections representative of all the top hits of that Beatles Era. If you want a collection without spending a fortune, this album is a must.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Christmas isn't the same w/out this movie!! I only owned it on VHS and had been meaning to get it on DVD...and now I do!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews, I was skeptical about how the season would turn out.  But after watching it all, I thouhgt it was a great way to end a great show.  Of course I would have liked to have seen more of a reunion with Luke and Lorelai, but I can overlook that.  Rory and Lorelai sitting in Luke's at the last scene of the last episode was a perfect wrap up.  It is hard to say goodbye to a show where I have felt like I was the silent role, watching Rory grow up and Lorelai as well for that matter.  I am confident all who watch will also enjoy the 7th and final season.
B000W1V44I|5.0|At first I thought the sound was a little too 'techno' but now I've grown attached to this c.d. They still have great harmony and a solid sound. They didn't stray too far from what they're known for... thankfully.
B000XSLVN4|5.0|Finally released after months of anticipation, this awesome special edition of Avril Lavigne's The Best Damn Thing is notable for the following:    - The CD/DVD jewel case is enclosed in a cardboard package measuring 10.25\\" x 10.25\\" and includes a 20\\" x 30\\" folded poster.  - The main 12 tracks are from the censored album version.  - The beautiful ballad \\"I Will Be\\" is finally on CD, along with the other incredible single \\"Alone\\".  These two fantastic songs should have been on the original album version from day one!  - \\"I Can Do Better\\" (acoustic bonus track) is the only applicable audio track that is _not_ censored.    - The bonus NTSC DVD includes the four song Orange Lounge performance from summer 2007, in gorgeous 16 x 9 widescreen compatible format.  \\"Girlfriend\\" is _not_ censored.  - The four music videos are not 16 x 9 widescreen compatible, although \\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Girlfriend\\" with Lil Mama should have been.  The original \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"Hot\\" were not shot (or released) in 16 x 9, so that doesn't apply for those two.    All in all, this is a terrific collector's item for any Avril fan!!!
1416914285|1.0|This book is clearly aimed to a specific market: girls with 10-14 years old. The author, a well known fanfiction writer from Harry Potter Universe, decided to take the \\"next step\\", there is, to write original stuff.    The truth is, the author has a lot (really a lot!) to improve. The style of writing is repetitive and, in some parts, boring. Of course, one must take into considerationt that Cassandra Claire writes for girls with 10-14 years old, so we must adapt our expectations to that reality.    On the other hand, the novel it is too much closer (in style, ideas, characters) to Harry Potter, Buffy and her own fanfiction writings. This to say, that Cassandra Claire has some potential but must do a great effort if she wants to reach a broader literary market: for a start, she should \\"forget\\" Harry Potter, fandom and Buffy and she should try to create a more original universe. On the other hand, Cassandra should consider a change in her style of writing in order to be able to open her novels to a more adult audience (particularly if she has that intention).    This said, the book doesn't hold too much surprises, particularly if you are acquainted with her fandom works in Harry Potter Universe. The girl and the guy that is close to her have a lot of resembleance to her fandom characters. On the other hand, the end is preddictable almost since the beginning.    Even so, I think it is important to stress that this author did an important step: to make the transition from being a simple fandom author to someone who actually tries to came up with original stuff. At least, that is something that should be praised.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Any body from 1 to 101 would want to bust out hearing these audio P-funk, pop spells . The musicians behind MJ's lead create a soaring atmosphere of dance heaven. The evidence of MJ  music genius lay within this album.
1416524800|5.0|Mixed with Presidential politics,science, espionage,violence and a little sex thrown in, Dan Brown has come up with another page turner.  I can't remember reading a book so fast and enjoying it so much.  A different kind of story from \\"Angels and Demons,\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code\\", Brown goes in for politics and government secrets and comes up with a great breath taking story. NOW. Onto his next book!!!
B00026W82U|5.0|This album soothed my ears like a warm car seat after a cool swim. I picked it up cheap from a bargain bin as i'de heard one track off the radio which had made my ears prick. The album has some dull songs. Forgiven thanks to the really great tracks which stand the test of repeated plays. A lovely melding of brushes and fingerstyle guitar, piano, violins and upright bass, blessed with beautiful harmonic vocals. It has a folk, bossa, swing feel. Totally dancable tunes you can chill with.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|I always thought the killers were okay but now I think they're wonderful after this album. My favourite songs are  1. Tranquilize   16. Romeo And Juliet (So pretty)  4. Leave Your Bourbon On The Self    It's such a great cd I recommend it to everyone!!
B000020617|5.0|I've been a Foo fan all along, seeing them open up for Mike Watt in 1995 on his Ballhog and Tugboat tour.  Been following Foo off and on since, being your typical teenager of the 90's due to the Nirvana association.  Anyway, their first was pretty good and raw, \\"Colour\\" was much different and too 90's whiny, but by Nothing Left To Lose, it seemed like Grohl broke the Nirvana stigma once and for all.  The albums starts off rough with \\"Stacked Actors\\" and slowly starts getting more warm and colorful as it goes on, minus the \\"Learn To Fly\\" single that was probably done to please RCA as a pre-album release single...they had to lob it in there somewhere.  Since that time, Foo has released the god-awful work of 90% filler \\"One By One\\", got back to their groove with \\"In Your Honor\\" and \\"Echoes\\" seems to be doing pretty good - not a bad one.  But \\"Lose\\", I feel is their most diverse, warm and colorful, whereas on \\"Honor\\" it's contrived-diverse.  Lots of influences on \\"Lose\\", most namely The Police and Alan Parson's Project.  Since then it hasn't been as solid, but it's still there.  \\"Lose\\" has it tightly together in one happy package.  I suggest you get it.  I still put it on every few months or so just to listen to for no real reason after eight years since it's release.  It's a keeper.  I'm sure Grohl & Co. have a few more good ones in them that just may very well top \\"Lose\\", but for now, this one will do.
B00000IUT7|5.0|I gave this to my 23 month old and she loves it. She loves to push all the buttons to make it go either forwards or backwards. She can play with it either on or off and likes to just push it too. She has thrown it quite a few times and it holds up and takes a beating just fine. It works great with her current Thomas set.
B000V1MMLI|5.0|when i first heard this album i was cautious not to raise my expectations<br />very high after listening to the (sissy) linkin park new album and some other artists but from the first song it hooked me and the whole album<br />was amazing there is a lot of new things here its not like any past system of a down albums. there is some songs that i didn't like that much but<br />not because they are bad but just not my taste and they were only 2 tracks<br />the creativity in this album is stunning and i realized that serj was<br />the creative force behind system of a down so if you didn't buy this album<br />yet try it you won't regret it. its something new and refreshing and<br />most of all amazing (highly recommended) hats off to you serj<br />note: the stand out songs of this album are 1- empty walls 2- sky is over
B000URDEB0|5.0|My favorite band is back and they have a new lead singer.  I will admit she does not give me goose bumps the way her predecessor did, she is still very talented.  I give this CD 5 Stars because even with a different singer, no other Gothic band can compare to the heart and soul of Nightwish.
0679720200|4.0|Camus' The Stranger gives us a portrait of the logical extremity of Nihlism in his character who goes through life with a detachment that is quite disturbing. A numbing look at life as experienced as a series of disconnected episodes without meaning, without commitment , without love.<br /><br />Does this short novel deserve the critical and academic acclaim and analysis it has received for the last 50 years? Maybe not as literature but as a reflection of the philosophical climate of postwar Europe in which it was conceived and written it still resonates.
B000TGQDZQ|3.0|Epica tries so hard to be Nightwish and they almost succeed.  They have wonderful instruments and an opera lead singer who sends chills up my spine.  Then this heavy idiot starts growling into the microphone and my ears start to bleed.  5 stars when the growling demon is silent.  3 stars when he is not.
B00006ADD5|4.0|This is a timeless drama because of spectacualr landscape and superb acting by Peter O'toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn. It portrays people psychology and the dirty politics. It showed how Lawrence changed from a peace-loving to a blood-thirsty person. It revealed how some people lied and betrayed anybody just to get what they wanted.    The action scenes are not as intense and realistic as today movies but this is not a big deal.     I've watched it twice.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is one of my favorite holiday films that carries a clear message: You get what you wish for. So starts our film with a bishop who asks for help from the almighty to build a cathedral. The problem is that his major benefactor wants the church built like a Mausoluem for her departed husband. To top that off our dear Bishop has been trying so hard to get his cathedral build that he has forgotten about his wife and daughter. Help comes in the form of Dudley the Angel, charmingly portrayed by Cary Grant. This is a wonderful role for Grant, who was originally slated to play the Bishop with Niven in the role of the angel. One chat between Grant and the director caused  a switch which, in turn, created a magical film. I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Dudley the Angel. You can almost see how much Cary Grant enjoys playing the Angel. Anyway, I won't ruin the rest of the movie for you accept to say that Dudley is there to help the Bishop. Thing is that the Bishop thinks Dudley is their to help him build the Cathedral. Dudley has come to aid the bishop and give him the help he needs. The bishop just doesn't realize where the help is needed.<br /><br />My recommendation is to rent this movie for now.<br /><br />This movie was shot in letterbox but is presented in Pan & Scan. Many of us are discriminating collectors that cherish the original format that the movie was presented in. Why the studio chose to present this movie in Pan & Scan when it was clearly shot in letterbox, is beyond me. All movies made after 1945 were shot in Letterbox. This info is public knowledge. So, listen up studio. Give this movie the treatment it deserves and release it in Letterbox for all of the fans of this wonderful movie who want to own it in it's original format. Letterbox please.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|.....my all time favorite is the \\"Jungle Book\\"!!  I purchased two copies of Ratatouille for a Christmas present to my grandchildren who have already seen this film twice at the theatre!  They love it, but then again they love everything Walt Disney.      I always appreciate how easy it is to shop and buy things on Amazon.com, and the shipping is always on time or earlier.  If ever you need to use their customer service you'll find that they are most helpful and pleasant.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Well, there is not much left to be said after reading all the reviews. As a Czech I am very proud of this movie. It is simple and touching and real. This is a movie which will stick in your head and heart for a long, long time. Just be warned - this is not your average Hollywood tearjerker by any means - which is really good :)
B000VL9XNI|4.0|Finally another AC/DC compilatin besides family jewels, no disrespect to that DVD but after watching it I found myself feeling like there was more to be seen. Sience i'm a hard core AC/DC fan, i've seen alot of \\"rare\\" AC/DC footage and proformances, but I was surprised when I found myself liking this DVD more and more as I kept serching around it. There are so many things I like about this DVD, and a few things i'm not so pleased with.      The good: First off the Bon disc is awesome, lots of great rare things on here, like there 1976 proformance of \\"Baby, please don't go\\" by far the best on the DVD.               Another great addition that I think is long over due, was the release of several \\"Rock goes to college\\" proformances (Which, in my opinion, is there best gig with Bon Scott). The bonus features are amazing, one great one was the Bon Scott interview form 1977, uncensored!  All 14 minutes of it finally realesed on DVD. The Dirty Deed promo was great, shockingly I had never seen it before.                    Brian's disc was great aswell, but my favorite thing about it are the bonus features, when I saw it had them proforming with the rolling stones I fegured it was the on I had seen many times before, but shockingly I had never seen this one. It was great! Gone shotin' was good too, and the Brian Angus interview was really good.        the bad: The Bon disc was, for some reason, shorter than the Brian, which doesn't make much sense because there were alot of \\"Rock Goes to college\\" songs that were missing. Which brings me to my next point even if they didn't want to put it on disc one, there was tons of room on disc 3 for the rest of the show, which I would have liked more than live at   Houston summit(Which didn't contain the whole gig), even though it was a great show, it's no \\"Rock goes to College.\\"                Another problem I have is that on the bonus disc they left out the original \\"Jailbreak\\" music video, that was filmed in Bons backyard (sound pretty important to me).                            Overall it's a very good DVD and I would suggeust it to hardcore fans (Who probably already have it), and the folks just getting into AC/DC, with out having to try and serch down videos to see a good show, from the Bon years.- Chuck
B000RJO58M|1.0|Loved Shaun of the dead but this movie was boring. I hate the way it was cut too. Gave me an headache.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I'm amazed at the number of US citizens who can't see anything wrong with their lack of a welfare state. I am a UK citizen and have been ill for forty five years. My illness is incurable but manageable. In that time I have acquired three degrees at state expense and enjoyed free medical care on a daily basis. Without state help I would have been dead long ago.<br /><br />Why is it such an intellectual impossibility to agree with Michael Moore? Abe Lincoln said you had \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people\\", whereas in fact you have government of the people by a rich oligarchy for rich corporations. The country's wealth is created by the many and should be for the many. This is not socialism; it is Christianity as practised in the Acts of the Apostles.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|The restoration on Metropolis is incredible - it's a pleasure to sit back and watch.  No scratches, no yellowing or fading - just a nice, crisp black and white movie.  There's a good extra feature on the DVD that shows the restoration process - the before and after are impressive.<br /><br />This is a silent movie with periodic screens of text.  Filmed in the early days of cinema, the dialog is sparse, but carries the plot well.<br /><br />The story begins as a conflict between two classes of people - the brains that live above ground, and the hands (workers) that run the machines from below ground.  At first I thought it would be simplistic, but the plot gets more complicated and interesting as more characters get introduced.<br /><br />A few folks on imdb have complained about some of the motion as well as the lack of original German title frames, but I disagree completely - after watching the film I felt the restoration crew did a fantastic job, and created a film that's a pleasure to watch.
B000VZKMSO|3.0|I personally believe Kanye is good for Hip-Hop. But at the same time he represents the bad things about Hip-Hop too. He's too cocky. He's not God's gift to Hip-hop, yet he believes he is. Does anyone remember what he did at the Uk MTV awards? He's a good artist but the third album isn't a good as it could have been. There are some very good tracks on it, but Kanye needs to put the ego somewhere else. When he first came out, he seemed like a grounded person, glad to be alive, glad to make music. He was like the bridge between the mainstream and underground hip-hop music. He made a track with Dilated Peoples when he first came out!!! Now he's arrogant, and his music shows that. He's popular now. Now he's making music with Lil' Wayne and T-pain. WTF??? Nope. I won't accept that. He can do better. Why doesn't he still work with artists who are not as well known, but just as good, if not superior to everyone that's out there in the mainstream. He has the power to really change hip-hop. But he's not, and he won't. He gave in to COMMERCIALISM!!!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I saw the Celtic Woman concert at Slane Castle on MS PBS and couldn't wait to get the cd.  These ladies voices will send chills up your spine!! Now I think I know what angels sound like!!  Highly recommend anything by these ladies!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is the most original series I have ever seen.  By the time you finish the first episode, you are hooked.  This show is so weird and unique, it is hard to describe. To yourself a favor, watch this show.
B000RJO58M|5.0|This movie shot straight up to my Top 5 movies of all time. Everything in this movie is awesome. You NEED to watch/purchase this movie.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I was actually quite surprised that this CD turned out just as good as her other cds. It has a bit more of an electronica edge to it, though. I love it and would reccomend it to everyone!

B000Y7U98C|1.0|\\"Sunshine\\" is like a how-to guide for messing up a vitally important space mission. Ignore the chain of command? Sure! Disregard mission protocols? Why not? Heck, let's forget about the MISSION while we're at it and fly off on an amazingly ill-advised detour! Director Danny Boyle tries desperately to cover for the inanity of Alex Garland's screenplay by stuffing the screen with camera tricks and oh-so-purty F/X shots of the sun and the ship, the Icarus II, but by the time Garland trots out a Random (and overcooked) Malevolent Force to seal the fates of his surviving characters, all you can do is pray for an ending. Which, in the case of \\"Sunshine,\\" sends \\"Say...what--?!?\\" to all-new heights of overblown death-porn silliness. Feel free to leave \\"Sunshine\\" in the shade.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Welcome my people to my official 100th review on Amazon (although a few were lost in cyberspace along the way). 2 years later and I'm still at it. This Seer must be insane. But, it is funny how it all started. The medium who I channel through knew nothing about reviews but went to the library computer and learned there. His idea was to do reviews but make them unlike anything on here. Unfortunately, he was in control of alot of the earlier reviews under my name. Embarassing I tell you- embarassing. Eventually, that energy of a thought (me!) came into the picture and then I assumed full control. It was then when the reviews got more spice. Also, at that point, various ambassadors and heads of state from foreign countries wrote me and wanted me to accept various honors and gifts. Never one to turn down true fawning - I accepted it all. The rest- as they say-is history. But have no fear, my ego remains down to earth as usual (!) and I remain a staunch defender of the common man (you).<br />But let's get to Elvis, shall we, before they knock down the door and take poor Metamorpho away.<br />I suppose that, in a way, it is unfair how some things pertaining to Elvis have become part of the popular culture. Do we really need another impersonator? Or another movie just for the sake of making money? I can forgive Elvis for all the excesses in his life. Besides, fame made him a puppet - and it's all a shame.<br />Regardless- this collection is very formidable and essential for a number of reasons. One thing is that through the music (especially the early tunes) you can hear the pure sexuality and vocal allure that made him the King. The inflection, the rawness,the snarled lip all suggest an animalistic erotic fantasy. I have to say that Elvis was the master of growling and tenderness, knowing exactly how to sing lyrics distinctly and where to place the vocal emphasis. You don't learn these things. You are born with the gift- as Elvis was.<br />Most of this c.d. contains known hits by Elvis (\\"Heartbreak Hotel\\",\\"Hound Dog\\",\\"Stuck On You\\") etc. etc. I especially like the early hits- you know the ones- the unrefined ones that alerted you to the power of this amazing artist. However- I am not dismissing his later hits (i.e; \\"Good Luck Charm\\",\\"In the Ghetto\\", \\"Suspicious Minds\\") for they, in their own right, extend the belief that there was a part of Elvis (his music) that was always in his heart. I suppose that the production of music became more sophisticated in his lifetime so it's only natural to find it in evidence here. However people - those early songs were the real deal.<br />Is this the most comprehensive collection of Elvis? No. Inevidently, there are some tunes I think are better than ones they included here. (Where is \\"Little Sister\\" Elvis? Where is she? Did you break her heart?). And, by the by, that is one killer song he did. But, all in all, this is a pretty decent compilation for the most part- or whatever music could be included on one c.d. Let's be honest - Elvis' archives are so vast I'd have to build a new room in my castle just to contain them. But I suppose it's fair to rate this for what it does include than what it doesn't include. In that- it is stellar and home to many, many, many classics from this man. I choose to remember him as a young man with mega-talent that wasn't allowed to swivel his hips on Ed Sullivan rather than the later Vegas Elvis who was given in to excess and on the down swing of his career. The vision of that early guy is the real treasure-and worth remembering through time. Elvis still remains the King- in this or any other era. Get this. A great and essential addition to your classic rock collection. Tell them Metamorpho sent ya. ;)<br />In closing, I want to thank Amazon in helping me achieve this milestone. It is through their generosity that Metamorpho is allowed to exist and write reviews in his odd and sometimes twisted way (but always informative Amazon!). Ideas, thoughts, creativity are things to be shared with others. Given the ability to do this with freedom is a gift. I have met alot of interesting and unique people who, in their own way, add a spark of life to me as I hope I do to them. O.K. O.K. I better get off this podium because they are starting to throw stuff! Happy 100 people!<br />Thank-you, thank-you very much--(with snarled lip) your, Metamorphoh others.

0307346617|5.0|This is likely my favorite zombie novel ever!  Many reviewers before me give you an accurate description of just how this book plays out.  Whether you are a long time zombie-romero-end of the world fan, or just getting onto the walking dead band wagon, this novel is a great place to lose yourself for a few hours.  Highly recommended!  Also check out JL Bourne's Day by Day Armageddon if you liked this!
B00005JPLW|4.0|300 is (loosely) based on the battle of Thermopylae, in which an alliance of Grecian city-states fought off the entire Persian Empire at the pass of Thermopylae in Central Greece. When the Greeks were betrayed by a local, the king of the Spartans took 300 of his men, 700 volunteers from Thebes and 1000 Helot slaves, and continued to fight the Persians while everyone else ran for their lives. Of course, the Spartans lost, but they took many, many Persians down with them, and gave Athens time to prepare...a massive naval fleet, which crushed the Persians at sea (loosely based, you see). The movie spices this up, of course, by throwing rhinoceroses, elephants, men with large crab arms grafted onto their bodies, hunch-backed men, lizard-like soothsayers, demonic, silver-masked Asianic warriors and one enormous...thing...that looks like the Hulk on steroids.     For all intents and purposes, 300 plays a lot like a video game. The violence is ultra-stylized, the heroes are hit by wave after wave of enemies (much like Space Invaders, actually) and there's even boss battles, many of which you could probably figure out from the multitude of exotic creatures mentioned in the previous paragraph. Although the movie's Leonidas is, surprisingly, almost likable and not quite knuckle-headed enough to be a warrior-barbarian stereotype (although he comes close, sometimes), and while there are some genuinely touching moments where people die and friends and sons mourn afterwards, and although the ending scene is practically mythical, the movie isn't particularly great, and the violence will probably turn many people off.    Why four stars, then? The answer is this: the dialogue. It's not clever, or even well-written, but it has you cheering right with the Spartans as they rip the Persians to shreds. Examples follow:    Leo: Tonight...no-one dies!    Spartan (or Persian, I forget): The arrows will block out the sun!\\"  Leo: Then we will fight in the shade!    Leo: TONIGHT, WE DINE IN HELL!    Slogan of the movie: PREPARE FOR GLORY!    Leo: Spartans! We march!    Critics may hate this movie, parents may hide it from their preteen children and it may end up in the bargin bin ten years later, but I'm betting high-schoolers will be quoting these lines at each other for years to come. Love it or hate it, if you think you can handle it, you should see it at least once. Finally, a message to unbelievers--    Persian: This is madness!  Leo: No. THIS! IS! SPARTA!    Leonidas then pushes the Persian into a bottomless pit, because, you know, all Grecian city-states had bottomless pits in those days. Madness, yes. But hey; it's Sparta.

1401300529|5.0|Halberstam begins in the middle of the Korean War story--with Chinese troops surprising American troops near the Yalu River, a tragic turning point in the war.  So begins a book that is extremely important for anyone who wants to understand American foreign policy today.  But the book is not perfect.  For instance, the opening battle at Unsan is described with a confusing flurry of names and numbers, and without enough descriptive detail to put us there.  The book then fills in the background story with considerable (someimes tedious) detail on the major political and military players.  Halberstam has an unfortunate habit of repeating himself over and over again.  As a result, the first couple of hundred pages seem to take forever.  Nevertheless, when Halberstam returns to the Chinese invasion, and takes us on from there to General MacArthur's ouster, it's heady stuff, full of heroes, fools, and heartache.  This is not a typical military history; some major battles, including the last two years of the war, are mentioned only in passing.  Instead, Halberstam focuses on \\"why\\" and \\"where did this take us as a nation.\\"  As a result, this book is a riveting, eye-opening account of how our political parties got to where they are now, how we got ourselves into the tragedy of Vietnam, and how we repeated in Iraq the same tragic mistakes made in Korea and Vietnam.  The book brims with foreign policy lessons that would have helped us avoid the Iraq disaster if only Halberstam had written this book half a dozen years ago.  I come away from these pages moved and amazed.

B00005JPNW|3.0|While I did like the CGI and all the animals, The Golden Compass felt like a mess to me. The lead girl was good, but the other characters weren't fleshed out in the least. The plot was a little on the boring side, so with all these flaws I can see why the critics are more negative than positive. The ice bears were pretty cool, I give it that, but this movie isn't as good as the Harry Potter films, and miles away from The Lord of the Rings.
B000UJ48O0|3.0|I decided to write a review on this set due to its 5 star rating. The set is definitely a great one; however, it is also flawed.  Let's go on to the good things: It comes with a protective case: a transparent, hard plastic case that doesn't let dust penetrate into the book and CD's. I also liked its size, it is big and the pictures and episode summaries inside are great. I don't usually care for many special features, but I'm sure that diehard fans will be happy with what they offer.    Now, the bad things: The set is very fragile. I absolutely hated the way the CD's are placed on the pages of the book. Any rough movement, they come out of place or fall off the set. When my set arrived, for example, some CD's were already out of place inside the book. The way the set is designed is also weaker than it appears on the picture Amazon displays. By the picture, it looks like the set is completely filled with pages, while in reality, it isn't. There are not as many pictures, interviews, and extra information as I would have expected from the picture. The covers are not as thick as I would like, and the book with the CD's can easily get ruined.     Overall, I am satisfied. At least I didn't have to buy each individual season. This set was released for $120.00, and I thought it was a reasonable price, but its price rose to $160.00, and for that I'm not sure if it is worth it.
0525950079|3.0|Pillars Of The Earth is one of my favorite books, when I first read it years ago I couldn't put it down. I've read every Follett book since that time and have never really been disappointed until now. One of the biggest complaints I've read is that the language the characters speak is modern. I don't really have a problem with characters in a historical novel not speaking like they would have in their time period. Let's face it the English language was very different in the 14th century so you need to adapt to the current audience.     The biggest problem I have with the book is that it Follett doesn't seem to want to end it. Sometimes that's a good thing, if you find a really good novel you wish it could go on forever. In this case he finds way too many convenient events to extend the story line. The thing I loved about Pillars was that while it was long it seemed to flow naturally, there was a rhythm to it.  About half way through World it seems like Follett is just adding events to keep the story going and adding pages, it seems pointless.     After a while the setbacks Caris and Merthin experience just become a joke. They're way to melodramatic to be taken seriously. The entire witch trial is a perfect example, that was such an obvious and simpleminded plot device that it was very disappointing when I read it. While adding all these events with Caris it seems he missed a huge chance to make the story more interesting by following Merthin in Florence but we're only treated to maybe 30 pages of that.     I also have to agree somewhat with other reviewers regarding the sex scenes. I have no problem with sex scenes in novels but they seemed very childish this time. They were repetitive and uninspired, unlike others though I was not offended by them just saddened that there seemed to be very little point in them.    All in all I'm glad Follett wrote a sequel and it was an enjoyable read, my sadness comes from thinking what might have been.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This version of Jane Austen's novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.  I've seen 3 out of the 4 new adaptations of Jane Austen's novels (\\"Sense & Sensibility\\" will not be broadcast in the UK/US until Jan. 08), and this is - in my opinion - the very best of them all.    What the early 80's version of \\"Northanger Abbey\\" (starring Peter Firth and Katherine Schlesinger) lacked, this version more than makes up for.  NA 07 (as it is fondly known among Janeites) stars newcomers Felicity Jones (Servants), JJ Feild (Nicholas Nickleby, Ruby in the Smoke), William Beck (Robin Hood) and Carey Mulligan (Pride & Prejudice), and British tv and stage veterans Liam Cunningham, Sylvestra LeTouzel ('80s Mansfield Park) and Gerry O'Brien.  Screenplay is by Andrew Davies, who also penned the well-loved and swoon-inducing period drama favorites Pride & Prejudice (1995), Daniel Deronda, Doctor Zhivago (2002 tv version), Middlemarch and Wives & Daughters.  True British period drama fans do not need introduction to him or his work.    Those have read the books know the story. For the novice, the story is as follows: young 17-year old Catherine Morland accompanies the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Allen to Bath for her first introduction to Georgian society. She meets the charming Henry Tilney and gregarious John Thorpe who both vie for her attentions, and befriends John's sister Isabella and Henry's sister Eleanor. She meets General Tilney (Henry's father), who mistakenly takes her for an heiress.  After the whirlwind social life of Bath, she is invited by the Tilneys to their country estate, Northanger Abbey, where - due to the influence of her fondness for gothic novels - she thinks up some fanciful ideas about the General.  She falls in love with Henry, but her fancies and the General's discovery of her family's true social standing land her in trouble and threaten to tear her and Henry apart.    This adaptation triumphs in many ways.  Fans of the novels know Henry Tilney as one of the most memorable and well-loved of Jane Austen's heroes. He is charming, outgoing and witty as Mr. Darcy is serious, proud and aloof. Henry as played JJ Feild is aptly charming, handsome and swoon-inducing.  Young and naive Catherine is played perfectly by the delightful, lovely and talented Felicity Jones. JJ and Felicity have an undeniable chemistry that echoes through every scene that they share.  They are - beyond a doubt - perfectly cast.  Also well cast are the lovely Carey Mulligan as the ambitious, shallow Isabella and William Beck is perfectly sleazy as her brother John. Liam Cunningham adds a certain gravity to the role of the imperious General Tilney while Sylvestra Le Touzel and Julia Dearden are endearing and often funny as the flighty Mrs. Allen and maternal Mrs. Morland.    The screenplay blends romance, satire, humor and drama perfectly while still staying true to Jane Austen's novel.  The costumes and production values are top-notch. The only things I could really find fault on was that I wish ITV had made this into a 2 or 3 hour miniseries (instead of only 1.5 hours) and that Bath was actually used for the Bath locations.  Viewers like me who have actually been to Bath will be able to tell the difference.  And there is certainly enough material in Ms. Austen's novel to warrant a longer running time.    Nevertheless, this is an excellent period drama and is rightly one of the best Jane Austen adaptations since the 1995 versions of Pride & Prejudice, Persuasion and Sense & Sensibility (though I also admit a fondness for Pride & Prejudice 2005 & 1980, and Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow)).  Of the 3 recent adaptations that will be shown in Masterpiece Theater in 2008, this is my favorite.  \\"Persuasion\\" comes next, and \\"Mansfield Park\\" comes last. Time will tell how the new version of \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" will compare to these three. As it stands, however, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an absolute gem and a crowd-pleaser that is sure to delight period drama fans. I trust that female (and some male) viewers will become a JJ Feild fans after they see this.
B00000F169|5.0|For the first 20-25 minutes of Dark Star, I sat here thinking this could well be one of the most awful science fiction movies of all time.  By the end, though, my tune had changed rather drastically.  I would say the film is brilliantly funny despite its treasure trove of bad movie qualities.  It is definitely uniquely absurd, the rare science fiction black comedy that actually manages to deliver.  Undoubtedly, some viewers will label Dark Star a disaster and wonder how anyone could like a single thing about it.  If you appreciate droll humor and are willing to conform your own thinking to that of the film (rather than waiting for it to conform to your expectations), you're liable to be in for a most unusual treat here.  In case you haven't noticed, this is indeed a John Carpenter film.  Carpenter co-wrote (along with Dan O'Bannon), directed, and produced it.  Don't be expecting a Hollywood theatrical production, though.  Dark Star is by and large a student film brought to life by Carpenter and O'Bannon.  It was later picked up for a theatrical release (for which an additional 15 minutes or so of action was filmed and added), but the whole movie was made on the smallest of budgets.  Some of the special effects aren't bad at all, surprisingly enough, but there's no mistaking the fact that Carpenter and company had to make due as best they could in scene after scene.<br /><br />Here's the premise.  It's the future, and the crew members of the Dark Star have been sent out on an extraordinarily long mission to blow an array of unstable planets throughout the galaxy to smithereens.  I'm not sure these guys were perfectly sane to begin with, but twenty years in space, trapped inside a cramped spaceship, have definitely taken a toll on each of them.  Now the ship's captain (and all of the toilet paper on board) have been lost to an unfortunate radioactive leak (but let's just say Commander Powell is gone but not forgotten in the deep freeze unit), and Lt. \\"Just give me something to bomb\\" Doolittle has taken command.  Sgt. Pinback (Dan O'Bannon) - who may or may not be a real astronaut to begin with - isn't too happy about this, but his concerns are predominantly voiced in a series of insane video journal entries.  The only thing Boiler (Cal Kuniholm) really seems to care about is trimming his facial hair, and Talby (Dre Pahich) has isolated himself in the ship's observation bubble.  There is also a pet alien on board - basically a beach ball with hands - and its escape from its room leads to all kinds of trouble (not to mention one of the longest, most comically absurd sequences you're ever likely to see involving Pinback and an elevator shaft).  Bomb Number 20 keeps getting lowered from its bay and prepped for launch and detonation, which wouldn't be such a bad thing if the bomb weren't harder and harder to convince that it's responding to faulty signals.  Yes, the bombs on board the Dark Star are sentient, and Mother (the ship's computer) has a heck of a time talking the cheerfully gung ho Bomb Number 20 back into its bay each time it is wrongfully triggered.  In fact, as the film reaches its climax, Doolittle himself has to personally engage the bomb in a profound existential debate in an attempt to save the lives of everyone onboard.<br /><br />With almost no budget to speak of and some highly questionable acting, Dark Star is a film that some will equate with spiritual purgatory, but those with an appreciation for dark comedy will find themselves completely won over by this unique film project, which I would describe as a student film with aspirations of kooky grandeur.  If you're like me, you'll want to watch this film again and again - but you might have trouble convincing any of your friends to do the same.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is tied with \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" as my top favorite Jane Austen novel. I was looking forward to this version, after being a little disappointed with the 1995 adaptation (actors were a bit too old for their roles, I thought, but that's another review).    While \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a story of young love, \\"Persuasion\\" is a story of love lost.  Anne Eliott was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth but has had to give up the engagement due to the persuasion of her friend Lady Russell. Anne is the daughter of a baronet and Frederick is a young lieutenant with little prospects and was deemed by her friends and family as not worthy enough to marry Anne. Fast forward to 7 or so years later, and Anne's family is in dire circumstances. Her family has to move from their large country estate to Bath in an effort to retrench and avoid further debt.  Frederick returns to England as a wealthy and highly eligible naval captain and his and Anne's paths meet again. Frederick is pursued by 2 of Anne's younger sisters-in-law while Anne is left to wonder what might have been. After a stressful visit to Lyme, Frederick and Anne's paths briefly separate.  Anne moves to Bath where she is pursued by her cousin William Eliott and she crosses paths with Frederick again. Will love triumph the second time around?    Whether you agree or disagree with my assessment of the 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, I think you will find that Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins are wonderful in their roles as Frederick Wentworth and Anne Eliott.  Sally Hawkins - unknown to me until now - gives a soul-stirring and endearing performance as Jane Austen's long suffering heroine.  Rupert Penry-Jones is aptly dashing and handsome, though perhaps a little bland, as Frederick (I'd take him over Ciaran Hinds any day). The supporting cast is solid - with a few exceptions - and the screenplay, up until the last 10 minutes, stays true to the tone and spirit of the book. The production values, costumes and locations are excellent. This scores points for actually filming in Bath and Lyme (actual locations from the book). Another high note is Martin Phipps (who also composed the amazing score of BBC's \\"North & South) who delivers yet another stirring score.      The reasons for the 4 stars are as follows (warning, spoilers!):   a) Casting - I absolutely detest Amanda Hale as Mary Musgrove. She is annoying and stands out in a bad way from the rest of the cast. Julia Davis is also off as Elizabeth Eliott and looks more like Anne's wicked stepmom than her older (by 2 years) sister. Elizabeth is supposed to be beautiful and elegant, and Julia Davis is nowhere near this. Surely there are more than enough talented British actresses who could have played these roles.    b) Changes - Some long-time fans will be a little irritated with the changes made to famous scenes from the book. This is where the 1995 version triumphs over this version. While the Amanda Root version remained faithful to the book, this version strayed in some of the vital scenes such as the dialogue between Captain Harville and Anne on woman's constancy; and the scene where Frederick writes a letter to Anne.    c) The last 10 minutes - where Anne runs around Bath like a headless turkey - almost completely ruined it for me. Whoever thought of sending a docile, elegant, poised, upper-class lady like Anne to run around town like a servant girl is beyond me.  The adaptation would have been outstanding except for this miscalculation. I am not a purist, but there is just so much a long-time Jane Austen fan can take and this one crossed the line for me.     All in all, however, I give it 4 stars for Sally, Rupert, most of the supporting cast, Bath, the score and the first 80 minutes.  It goes along swimmingly up until the climax, at which point I have to fast forward to skip the part I detest.  A good and solid adaptation, but \\"Northanger Abbey\\" starring JJ Feild and Felicity Jones gets my vote as my favorite of the recent Jane Austen adaptations.
0743564413|5.0|William Hurt's narration is paced and struck me as unusual at first, but it's perfect for the material, and at the end I was so engrossed I had to immediately re-listen to the book. It's a brilliant reading of classic Hemingway.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|First, context.  While I was in college and graduate school, I did like Led Zeppelin, but I was not a zealot; when I started attending to rock and roll, I paid more attention to other groups, such as the Rolling Stone or to singers like Bob Dylan.  So, as I come to listen to this combination CD-DVD set, I don't know all the recordings of the group, nor all their compilations.<br /><br />Second, then, I find this a very satisfying work.  I got a real buzz out of the video portion; I enjoyed also the CD portion.  It brought together for me (and recall that I was not a collector of Led Zeppelin as I was of Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones), in one place, a great set of works.  So I'm sold on the value of this.<br /><br />Third, the works themselves. . . . In terms of the video, there are a few items on the DVD that typify the ban's work for me (and I happen to like these songs, so the choice is not random!). \\"Moby Dick\\" is interesting mainly because it provides a showcase for John Bonham, the drummer.  He really beats those drums here!  The band kicks in at a later point to good effect, and Bonham closes out thumping his drum kit. It's a lot of fun to watch and to listen to. One of their classics is \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  Plant's vocals growl out one of the main lines, \\"I wanna whole lotta love.\\"  Bonham and Jones provide a great rhythm section, with Jimmy Page's guitar soaring.  Fun to watch the group play and enjoyable to see the interaction with the audience.  Finally, another of my personal choices, \\"Black Dog.\\" Talk about \\"heavy metal\\"!  Page's guitar work is inspired here.  The rhythm section is superb.<br /><br />Then, the CD set.  \\"Dazed and Confused\\" features Plant's voice nicely.  The song shows him to be baffled, as his hard-earned money doesn't seem enough to get his love to respond to his passion. A little more laid back than other cuts. \\"Rock and Roll\\" begins with nice guitar work.  This represents one of Led Zeppelin's trademark songs.  Plant's voice is primal and raw; Page's guitar work stands out.  Finally, \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  Quite a change of pace from other of their songs.  This came to be, perhaps, overplayed on the airwaves, but so what?  It's still a great song.  There is a sense of poignancy here, and the song features a more diverse instrumental feel, including the use of a recorder.<br /><br />Fourth, the liner notes in the booklet provide useful background information and is value-added on this CD-DVD set.<br /><br />So, how to conclude?  I think that this is one of the nicest greatest hits of a group CD/DVD around.  Of course, if you're an aficionado of Led Zeppelin, there may not be much new here.  For others of us, not so steeped in their work, this is a nice addition to our music library.tar work stands out.

B00005JPNW|5.0|Anyone who saw the recent [[ASIN:B00116GEJ8 Goya's Ghosts]] about the Spanish Inquisition would greatly appreciate an alternate allegorical view of a similar subject in Chris Weitz's \\"The Golden Compass\\".Anyone who savours the ability to think freely with no control from authority will find this film absolutely riveting.It moves quickly,so be warned.  I must say, that with all of the senseless furor that has surrounded this film from groups that admit they have not seen it,I found it ludicrous to see why this film should upset anyone.Whether or not the original author's intent was to expose the \\"indoctrinational\\" thinking and effects of religion, the fact that this film is so beautifully crafted and acted, especially in the character of Lyra Bellaqua,aptly and deftly portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards, is a testament to modern day film making with the ability to tell a very compelling story.I saw this film with six adults and fourteen children! We all went out afterwards and had a discussion about the film.I was astounded that the children did not see this film as an attack on religion,as much as they saw it as their need to always scrutinize things,to think for themselves and that a promise to a friend is a bond! Now I think that is a set of great lessons for kids to take away from a movie!I think they got the point that many naysayers seem to be missing!Stop hearing all of the fuss and hubbub that wants you to not see this film (99% of it adult), and decide for yourself.I feel quite encouraged with the fourteen kids that saw this film with me.They are the hope of the future from authoritarianism.I don't think anyone's \\"religion\\" is in danger;except perhaps from those who are the most insecure about their own footing in life.
140120306X|5.0|This is my first review on amazon and it is prompted by the shear enjoyment I am getting out of reading \\"The Black Dossier\\".  My first pass at reading TBD being was like my experiences with League books, I would read the comic first and save the text at the end chronicling their adventures for later, but I soon realized that was a mistake because I became slightly lost.  My second pass I found myself reading the text in line with the story line, but I was just skimming through, at which point I realized I was missing the finer details.  TBD isn't like your traditional comic, it is something new, where the reader is pulled into the story, reading the dossier as the characters do so.  When you finally realize this, you begin to go back and forth throughout the book referencing the text, the annotations in the text and matching them with some of the characters you only encounter briefly, at which point the book really begins to payoff, even so much as to go back and cause me to start cross referencing with volumes I & II.  When you start to see the attention paid to pulling the reader in and exposing them to so many different literary and art styles you realize that Moore is entering a new realm of story telling that is neither a traditional comic or novel, and it is going to make my weekly comic book purchases all the more unfullfilling that I may just stop collecting all together.      I have 2 complaints though (that don't affect my rating) ....     1.)  I never looked at LOEG as an alternate universe, but more of a chronicling of true events that transpired in the lives of fictional characters whose experiences were too fantastic for common man.  Introducing rockets, cavorite, etc ... into the 50's dispells this illusion but serves the purpose of giving Moore and O'Neil a whole playground for future LOEG adventures.     2.)  I think the subtext that Britain became like Orwells \\"1984\\" post WWII is touched on too briefly, I think further explanation (whether in the form of inline text or comic) would have helped make the book a little easier to follow.    The Black Dossier reminds me of a David Lynch film, at first pass it is visually awesome, yet I may not fully comprehend all of the story or details, but upong further examination and study there is a big payoff when you realize the artists vision.

As soon as I saw that this particular production was on HD-DVD...my mouth started salivating like Homer after seeing a doughnut. This beast is worth buying if only to see Damrau perform the Queen of the Night aria in HD-sound and HD-video because, as you may or may not know, she is not only one of the best singers in the world, but one of the best actors as well.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I bought this, having heard about it on TV and hoping to surprise my neighbors with a big gun, I bought this on impulse at Wallyworld. I would recommend buying a spare ammo pack, because 6 bullets in a clip doesn't last long in a firefight. Nevertheless, this thing is COOL. The little detachable gun is an awful gun, but it is accurate up to its about 6 foot range. The scope aims high, and putting the little gun on the front takes away range and accuracy. But take off both of those and you have the best Nerf gun ever. You really can shoot up to 30 feet accurately, and it shoots FAST compared to other Nerf guns. Plus not having to put in a new bullet every time helps. The gun does jam sometimes, just pull back the bolt, open the little slidey thing under the scope mount, and pull out the bullet. Overall, a great gun.
0751532711|5.0|The thing that I love most about this book is that it caused me to kick myself repeatedly while reading and kept me repeating my new found mantra 'why didn't I think of that before!'    I picked up my copy on Friday, after months of having it on my `to do' list. By Sunday I was amazed with the things that I had learned - not just from what Robert teaches, but from the new way of thinking that this book gives you.    There is a lot in there about investing - something that I will get into soon, however just by applying what I have learned from this book into my company has already boosted profits and that's just in a few days and around all of the other stuff that I have to do to run my business.    Page by page the book gave me a new feeling of excitement that renewed and intensified my passion for success.    This book is not for everyone, especially those that don't want achievement, however if you want success then I would say that it is a must read - just don't wait as long as I did to get you hands on it!

0743270754|5.0|This historical dialog is spell binding.  The detail provided into the Lincoln cabinet is beyond comprehension for this era.  The research performed would make this book a bargain at 10X the price.  Not knowing a lot more than superficial information regarding the person of Abraham Lincoln, this book provided a fresh characterization for one of our greatest Presidents.  I am astounded at his leadership and in dealing with people, especially enemies and potential enemies.   God ordained providence provided such a wise man at the helm during our most critical period of history.   Every person in America should read this book.
B000WGNLLW|4.0|I have been a Duran Duran Fan since 1982  I have everything the band has ever recorded \\"and more\\" I love the Duran unique sound so I was more that a little worried when I \\"first heard of the Timberland/Timberlake involvement with this album..  As I'm an 80's kid through and through \\"I don't like modern music..    However, I was I'm happy to say that on Receiving Red Carpet Massacre from Amazon I was pleasantly surprise!!  Although a little different the Duran sound \\"is still there\\" with a nice modern twist the CD hasn't been out of my stereo since it arrived...  I love it!!!    Also the DVD included in this set is a perfect Duran behind the scenes peek a must for any diehard Duranie like myself.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I have been a longterm fan of Michael Moore. I was looking forward to this documentary for months as I find health care in the United States a joke. If someone does not make a 6 figure annual income he is most likely not to survive (literally). This documentary depicts how health care is being held and received in the United States, Cuba, Canada, Britain and France. It illustrates the brutal truth of how things are run in this country and how people who risked their lives in 9/11 and who consequently got respiratory problems from all the fumes of that day, are being treated by the american health care system which has continuously ignored them and made their lives a living hell. This work not only talks about those people but also about every other human being that is struggling to get by under these circumstances. On the other hand Michael Moore did a wonderful job in objectively depicting how things are in Canada, Cuba, Britain and France by interviewing locals and getting into people's homes to show us what really is going on behind closed doors. I could be going on and on about Sicko but I should keep it short and recommend to all of you interested in it to watch it. It will change your life. It certainly changed mine.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|With this live set from their 2007 tour, Genesis confirms that even though they took very bad decisions commercializing their music, their superb musicianship cannot be denied. Genesis has always been an imaginative band from a musical point of view, and here, with outstanding performances on tracks like IN THE CAGE, SECOND HOME BY THE SEA, and FIRTH OF FIFTH, to name a few, nothing can be said on the contrary. The mature sound they deliver with their acute mix and stage sound cohesion confirms their consciousness on plasticity. Genesis has always been a theatrical band, even in their more commercial stage, and the theatrics not being only on the level of performance and lyrics. The musical arrangements, effects and selection of colors of their instruments and sounds, all form part of the Genesis style and blueprint. For example, on the instrumental passages of their classic era songs, Tony Banks retains the essentials and original sounds on his keyboards, but upgrading them to fit the crispness and clarity delivered through 21 century technology. The result: a powerful, organic and rounded cluster of synthesized sound, interwoven with an up-to-the-face percussion ensemble via Chester Thompson and Phil Collins, and colored all up by Rutherfords and Stuermers playfull and inventive guitars, basses and bass pedals. With this record, Genesis proves that a new Genesis era of studio recordings would be up to the challenge, and would deliver great new songs, sounds and tapestries. Imagine what could happen if Gabriel and Hackett hop on the ride: As sure as eggs is eggs...Heaven.
B000VECAEO|4.0|Well, the final season is here and although it's been a great ride so far, this is probably the weakest of the later years seasons. Don't get me wrong, it's still head and shoulders above the majority of TV comedy, but when you have such a rich pedigree as Seinfeld, it feels slightly disappointing. There are good episodes but there are also some poor ones where nary a titter was raised in my household.    Still, if you've come this far, it's an essential purchase.

0307346617|5.0|Being a huge zombie movie fan, I bought WWZ 'cause I enjoyed the author's zombie survival guide and the concept sounded really interesting.  However, it soon becomes clear that the book is not so much about zombies as it is a dissertation on the human spirit.  The book is really about how people deal with an apocalyptic disaster that brings the human race to the brink of extinction.  To a great extent, it is also an editiorial on the many ills of modern society.  Brooks devises a scenario where our greed, ignorance, short-sightedness, and fear almost destroy us before our pragmatism kicks in.  In many way, this book warns us that the modern society is a breeding ground for complacency--and its apparent strengths (including our notions of right & wrong) may work against us when the chips are truely down.<br /><br />While WWZ uses zombies (Zack for short) as the vehicle for this particular apocalypse, you can almost substitute in any other.  Zombies, however, are an excellent choice.  There is almost nothing more frightening than the thought of being eaten alive by zombies (who moments ago may have been your most beloved relative or friend)--then coming back as one.  In addition, zombies are an implacable enemy perfectly suited for total war.  Zack cannot be reasoned with, bargained with, shocked or awed into surrender--he can only be terminated with a shot to the head. It is also ironic that the human race survives by adopting tactics that are as inhuman as Zack is.<br /><br />The closest thing I can think of to this book is the \\"Civil War\\" series by Ken Burns.  WWZ is a stunning, seminal work that will simultaneously inspire, sadden, and scare the Hell out of you.
B00007GZR5|2.0|If you're looking for a movie to show off your new hd-tv, this is probably a great choice, especially if you want to turn off your brain and just gawk at the pretty colors. If you're the type of person who is impressed with the likes of \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" you'll probably love this. Unfortunately, if you're a cinemaphile who wants something like a plot, witty dialogue, and all the other trimmings of a \\"great\\" film, you'd best look elsewhere.<br /><br />WDMC was very uneven, with the first 45 minutes or so crawling by, and the last act a hurried rush. I quickly lost interest in the film for the first half, as the admittedly impressive visuals became sensory overload and actually wore out their welcome. I was keenly aware that the \\"story\\" was bare-bones, and suspected that this was just a vehicle to show off ILM's latest advances. What passes for \\"plot conflict\\" was introduced way too late, and was resolved too quickly, and too unsatisfactorly: we get the \\"happy Hollywood schlock ending\\" where everything works out for the best, but I was at a loss to figure out just HOW that happened. Maybe the book gets into it better, but the happy ending was jarringly forced with no discernable explanation, and actually struck me as the result of test screening polls where the audience wanted everything to end just peachy.<br /><br />The \\"plot\\" is gause-thin, and since I minored in Theology, I almost immediately recognized it as an unambitious lifting of Emanuel Swedenborg's theory that \\"the afterlife is what you make of it\\" -- with a few variations thrown in to force a plot conflict.<br /><br />I haven't read the book, so I can't compare/contrast the film to that -- a few reviews said the book is better, or at least fleshes out the movie. I defer to them on that, but based on the movie itself, have absolutely no desire to track down a copy.<br /><br />Although I'm sure this final comment will draw the ire of this film's proponents, I honestly see this film appealing to only two types of people: drug users looking for something pretty to stare at, and New Age-types wanting a feel good/\\"I'm secure\\" type of film. All others need not apply.ooking for something pretty to stare at, and New Age-types wanting a feel good/\\"I'm secure\\" type of film. All others need not apply.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This is a great feel good musical with a real message. I couldn't quite picture John Travolta in fat padded drag until I actually saw it but he does a great job as Edna and even manages to capture a bit of the Baltimore accent.  All the parts are well cast and Seinfeld fans will enjoy seeing two of that shows \\"older\\" supporting players on screen again along with teen idols Zac Efron and Amanda Bynes as well as proven stars like Travolta, Christopher Walkon, Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah.  The music and dancing in the show are a lot of fun and the authentic period costume design is superior.  Lots of subtle visuals such as a woman scrubbing the famed white marble steps of her row house really set the tone of Baltimore in the early 60's.  But the film's good heart and  messages of tolerance,  acceptance and ultimate victory for the underdogs who believe in themselves and do what is right are what will make this musical an enduring classic.

0810993139|5.0|I learned of this book in my University of Maryland alumni magazine and I'm very glad I did. The author, Jeff Kinney, wrote a popular comic strip called \\"Igdoof\\" in the early 90's for the Maryland student newspaper, the Diamondback. His comic alone made me look forward to each new issue of the paper and I continued to seek it out even after I graduated to read Kinney's comic.    From what I understand, he fought to get the strip syndicated after he graduated, but it never happened- presumably because his somewhat simplistic and crude artistic style is nothing like what you see in the daily comics sections. I had often wondered what became of Kinney, whose considerable talent should not be going to waste, so I was happy to pick this book up once I discovered it.    The book, likely written for kids at or above a fifth or sixth grade reading level, was better reading for a 37 year old than I could have possibly imagined.  Kinney picks up right where he left off with the Igdoof strip with the very same humor and art that made me enjoy it so much.  The book was laugh-out-loud funny throughout and I would recommend it to not only kids, but anyone who can appreciate humor books.  I wish Jeff all the success in the world and look forward to reading more of his works-- he has really found his calling.

Some of the ballads should bring a tear to your eye. The most difficult part of listening to this compelling work it trying to figure out who sounds better with age - Glenn, Don or Timothy. I'm a big Henley fan, but I have to say that Glenn has really emerged in this one. The album is simply outstanding. A must have if you're an Eagles fan.

0375714839|5.0|This book collects [[ASIN:037571457X Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood]] and [[ASIN:0375714669 Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return]].  Both books are graphic novels telling the true story of the author's life.  Book one tells the story of her girlhood in Iran and ends when she leaves Iran to go to a boarding school in Austria.  Book two picks up where book one left off, and tells the rest of her story up to the point where she leaves Iran for the second and last time.  This is a great, moving story.  I found myself empathizing with this girl, even though she comes from a culture nothing like mine and we have nothing in common.  It obviously wasn't easy growing up a progressive girl in a represive culture.  I could go on and on about the virtues of this book, but it's better if you just read it and find out for yourself.

140120306X|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about Moore and O'Neill's _Black Dossier_.  The story is concerned with Mina Harker and Allan Quartermain stealing the Black Dossier - a file that chronicles the various incarnations (and imitations) of The LoEG from the Elizabethan period to the 1940's.  The story line itself was a bit thin, but more on that in a moment.<br /><br />First, the story's strengths: the art work (and variety of it) is fantastic - the detail is simply sublime.  The literary references are almost too abundant, even stretching beyond period pieces (The Phantom of the Opera, for example) into film (\\"Adnoid Hyster\\" from Chaplin's _The Dictator_ immeadiately comes to mind, although I got a laugh at the reference to _Metropolis_, a 1930's dystopian film similar in feel to _1984_ which is also heavily referenced here and _The Thin Man_, given the \\"noir\\" mood of the plot.)  I also liked the variety of story materials that are a part of the \\"Dossier\\": a play written in Shakespearean style, dystopian comics, political humor from the Georgian era, a parody of _Gulliver's Travels_.  The humor and stylistic imitation were very well done, in my opinion.  As an aside, look for Marry Poppins ... a wonderful and surprising allusion.<br /><br />However - and this is why I gave it three stars (and struggled with the book as a whole) - I wish Moore did more \\"showing\\" and less \\"telling.\\"  Much of the _Dossier_ is what the Black Dossier contained: files and letters and narratives rather than a graphic showing of the action.  I didn't mind the writing so much as I minded the fact that I had expected - even hoped for - a graphic novel.  Similarly, I though much of the information presented in the Dossier would have been marvelous material for Moore to show his stuff.  I felt it was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />Of the three LoEG novels, this is my least favorite for the reasons cited above.  Nonetheless, there is much that the latest installment has going for it, which is sure to please fans of Moore's work.  With reservations I recommend it..  With reservations I recommend it.
B00004S35Z|5.0|I just finished listening to this album again. Although I don't know every note by heart as with Songs In The Key Of Life, I love it just as much.  It starts rather slow with Smile Please, a beautiful call for people to put a smile on their faces, to stow away the frowns.  Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away to me is Stevie's all time best song. Wonderful melodies with lyrics that go so deep and stay with you forever.  Like with a concept album Stevie has never built a better tension, constructed a better flow of his different melodies on a single album. A slow start, slowing down even more, then, with Boogie Down Reggae Woman changing pace, only to slow down again. But don't worry, never boring for a second. Of course there's the mid tempo stompin' You Haven't Done Nothing with the Jackson Five as background vocals (and a great horn section). Speaking of which, Stevie's list of guests is incredible: Denise Williams, Minnie Ripperton, Syreeta of course, Paul Anka, Michael Sembello.   A beautiful romantic album that will stay with you forever.
0446577391|4.0|Baldacci is one of those writers who came out of the blocks with a real thrilling ride (\\"Absolute Power\\"), so he had set himself an impossibly high standard to maintain. Nevertheless, and in spite of the one star review - which said nothing - five out of the six Baldacci\\"s that I have subsequently read have been five star for plotting, characterization, great storytelling and gripping suspense. \\"Stone Cold\\" fall just short of the usual high standard.    I like the characters, and the plotting - which carries two or three subplots along with the main plot - is deft most of the time. Oliver Stone (John Carr) carries the load and everything ultimately leads back to him and his past. This one ends with the possibility that there is at least one more coming, and that is something to look forward to. Yet I hope he can now move away from these characters which are running the risk of \\"jumping the shark\\" and becoming boring. Another stand alone would be a truly great next effort from a writer I think can keep up with the best of today's mstery/thriller authors.

Regardless of your opinion of Mr Moore, the truth is told and we need a great change to our approach in medical care in this country - NOW.

B00006FDCD|3.0|\\"It\\" was taken from a rather longish and wordy novel by Stephen King. Lots of characters, very heavy on their respective backgrounds, and a scary monster (\\"It\\") that terrorizes their lives and the town in which they live (Derry, Maine). From all this written material, the filmmakers have distilled the action down to a movie that is a little over 3 hours in length, which was a formidable task. For a 3-hour movie, It is pretty good, given the material/novel it had to cover. Is it as good as the book? No. Is it a pretty decent synopsis with interesting (and well-played) characters? I'd say yes that it is. Are the special effects OK? Yes - up until the end when the climatic battle with the It monster occurs. Then when we see It in its final incarnation, It appears as a big cheesy not-too-scary lumbering spider that looks like it was taken from a 3rd rate sci-fi movie. I realize the movie was made 1990, but the spider monster looks to be out of the 50s. (Note: good scary movie spiders can be found in 2007's \\"The Mist\\" (also by Stephen King) and also in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy). If you read the novel, then you'll understand some of the shortcuts the filmakers had to take and you'll also understand some of the references that are not explained well in the movie. In my opinion, if \\"It\\" were to be remade today, the movie would be about twice as long and the monster would be 100 times as scary. For someone who has not read the book - and does not intend to - I'd give it 3 and 1/2  Stars. For those who have read the book, I give it 3 stars (because you know the compromises involved).
B000P12LWY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1 of The Tudors. It's beautifully shot, well acted, entertaining, and kept me on edge waiting to see what's going to happen on Season 2.     I'm also a history buff, though not such a hardcore one that I genuinely expected any cable TV reproduction to be 100% accurate. Yes, there are inconsistencies. No, it didn't diminish my experience of watching the show one bit. Every other reviewer has a right to their opinions and how they view the show; I just don't know how anyone could really expect a late night Showtime program to give one the same historical value that an in-depth History Channel one would, and then punish the show when it turned out to be more entertainment than history lesson. Frankly, the pure historical angle with these types of films has been done multiple times...portraying the period like The Tudors done hasn't. I like the change.    That's part of why I like the Tudors...it's like the \\"history\\" you watch to unwind from a day of hard work and/or study. As long as the show continues to accomplish being good and entertaining, I'll care less about nitpicking every  detail.

She put herself on the map with \\"Vision of Love\\" in 1990 and her star still burned bright four years later.<br /><br />I remember when the video for \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" was released and, appropriately, hearing it played numerous times on the radio as well, and I knew it was an \\"instant classic\\" (oxymoron?).  The song just had a fun feeling to it, something that was really upbeat in keeping with the spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />Mariah also did her takes on traditional Christmas songs (the list of which can be found on this page), and anyone can hear how passionate and heartfelt she was in belting out traditional tunes.  That spirit still comes through nearly 15 years later.<br /><br />\\"Merry Christmas\\" is a great holiday music investment.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|I've been waiting for this blu ray movie for a long time.  I tried to rent it many times, but it was always unavailable at the video store (blockbuster only had 2 measly copies of this movie in blu ray in the whole city.  I live in Charlotte NC, I also tried renting it from Netflix and blockbuster online to no avail.  All I saw in my queue for three weeks was \\"very long wait\\"); so my husband decided to take the risk and buy it.  The animation is awesome, looks better if you are watching it in true 1080p resolution.  The storyline was great.  This is a movie everyone should watch.  The music is beautiful.

B000NVL9KG|4.0|This is one of ELP's signature albums, the first with one of those classic, side long epic suites in the title track.  It's one of their greatest songs, and one that I never tire of.  It's pretty much an Emerson tune (even though Palmer said he wrote the drum line but never got credit for it), but it has some of Lake's best lyrics.  The next 6 songs are a bit erratic.  Jeremy Bender is a great little ditty.  Bitches Crystal is one of ELP's most complex songs, with some unique, mysterious lyrics.  The Only Way is an atheistic \\"hymn\\".  Infinite Space is rather dull.  A Time and a Place is good, and Are You Ready Eddy? sounds like The Girl Can't Help It by Little Richard, and sounds like it was improvised on the spot.  It's a silly song, and rather a strange way to end the album.  The album as a whole is a little uneven.  There's no Lake ballad on it, and I miss that.  Despite its uneveness, it's definitely worth buying for the title track (which is better than all subsequent live versions), and Jeremy Bender, Bitches Crystal, and The Only Way.

This is truly Ozzy - when he was a true rebel and outcast, not the establishment rebel that he's become today (sorry, I'm irked that after being teased for being an Ozzy fan in the 80s - when it mattered - that those same people are riding his bandwagon 20 years later).<br /><br />Anyway, the songs that made up \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary of A Madman\\" (both released in 1981) were supposed to be Black Sabbath material.  Whichever way it really is and was, I'm glad they wound up on Ozzy's first two solo albums because, perhaps, they wouldn't have sounded as good being Sabbath material.<br /><br />\\"You can't kill rock and roll - it's here to stay!\\"  Indeed, Ozzy.  We (your fans that have stuck with you through the lean times) will love and adore you forever.  - Donna Di Giacomo
B000B8QG4A|5.0|My almost 2 year old granddaughter was enthralled!     There was no time to watch the entire movie, so we turned it off when she went to get her jammies on. Returning for a good night kiss, she screamed and cried that the movie was off. We had to prove to her that she could keep the movie and see the rest in the morning.    The power of Disney connects to every generation!
B00000I2UC|5.0|AUTOMATIC has been unfairly dissed over the years as a \\"sellout,\\" a \\"disaster\\" or, as the Spin Alternative Record Guide said in 1995, an \\"ordinary hard rock record.\\"    If only your \\"ordinary hard rock\\" record sounded like this.    Yes, there are drum machines.  But guess what, DARKLANDS had them, as did a bunch of JAMC albums in the future.  On the one track here with live drums, \\"Gimme Hell,\\" the drums sound exactly the same as on the other tracks.  The brothers Reid were going for a specific sound, and they got it either through live drummers or not.    Lack of feedback?  I invite you to listen to \\"Coast to Coast,\\" \\"Blues From a Gun,\\" \\"Between Planets,\\" \\"Her Way of Praying,\\" \\"Head On\\" or \\"Gimme Hell\\" at full blast and defend this opinion.  No, it's not the proto-shoegazing feedback of PSYCHOCANDY, but even proper shoegaze bands dropped those tricks after their first record or two.    As always, the Reid brothers are amazing songwriters.  It doesn't matter if they drape their songs with PSYCHOCANDY style feedback,  DARKLANDS type gothness, or the grace and beauty of the mellow STONED AND DETHRONED.  The genius of their songwriting shines through, and any true fan will tell you that AUTOMATIC is just as awesome as anything else the band did.
B000OCZ80Q|3.0|The first few performances of Swan Lake were not very succesful. It all changed when the Petipa/Ivanov version appeared. This has become the \\"standard version\\" and has made this ballet very popular. But this is not the version on this disc. In fact, I very much disliked the coreography (Nureyev, 1984), which differs from the Petipa/Ivanov coreography in significant ways. More to the point, Mr. Nureyev has decided that the Prince's tutor and Rothbart are one and the same person! Why mess with the Petipa/Ivanov version? The fact that the picture and sound quality of this HD disc are excellent is not sufficient compensation, at least for me, for these departures from the highly succesful Petipa/Ivanov version. Here is an example: the \\"battle\\" scene in the finale (the Prince vs. Rothbart) has been played down to a few steps! The other negative point of this performance is the spartan bareness of the theater. Why didn't they dress-up the stage at least during the ball scene? There is one redeeming aspect to Mr. Nureyev's coreography, though. The geometrical figures depicted by the swans in the later acts, superbly captured by cameras hovering above the stage, are splendid.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. First of all, it's very well thought out in regards to the relationships between the characters (Mitch and Nicole, Mitch and Darcie, Bernard and Lara). The most overlooked, but important detail is the connection between Mitch (Luke Wilson), Bernard (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell) and Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven). If the four hadn't had a history going back to their school days, Dean Pritchard's relentless fight to end the fraternity would've been lost in the mix.<br /><br />Basically, the story revolves around three men who appear to be lost in their post-college years and decide to form a fraternity in the midst of Mitch's failed marriage and Frank's inability to grow into married life. Living in a campus house and overcoming glitches within the system, the fraternity becomes the most popular group on campus to hang out with despite their unusual and questionable personalities. As the film unravels, the fraternity is forced to face real life challenges that test their friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and heart.<br />The chemistry between Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson is fantastic and demonstrates the true bonds of friendship. The casting in this movie was brilliant and made it that much more hilarious. It includes some of the best one-liners you'll hear come out of Hollywood. It ranks alongside, if not above the American Pie trilogy and is a modern day 'Animal House', an absolute must for any college student.<br />The only problem I have with this movie is its length.  Some of the deleted scenes were not only hilarious, but essential to the plot and should've been used in the final cut. However, that's a minor detail in the final outcome.<br /><br />In addition, if you're a fan of Whitesnake or Kansas, this movie is a living homage to your music.<br /><br />Grade: A+
044024238X|5.0|A great light read.  I normally hate reading, but I devoured this book!  Maybe it's because I'm a lawyer at a big firm like the lead character in this book, so I found it particularly funny for that reason.  I think anyone would enjoy it though!
B000F6IOC0|4.0|First, let me say that I, unlike pretty much all the previous reviewers, have not watch the first film [[ASIN:B000TGJ80I Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray]]]. Although I like these types of films I was unimpressed with the trailers for it when it first was released back in 2003 so just never got around to viewing the movie. After watching this sequel you can bet I will watch it the first chance I get. This is an outstanding film that brings not only non-stop action but provides a strong story coupled with great acting.<br /><br />The Amazon review states that the script is \\"...more confusing than it needs to be, with too many characters and not enough storytelling detail to flesh them all out.\\" Not true. From both the prologue and the narration of the main character Selene I got up to speed quickly and was able to understand what led to the feud between Vampires & Lycans (Werewolves). The main characters were wonderfully developed, making it easy to understand the motivation of each. And the story was very linear, taking us from past to present to future. This sequel actually is unique in that it could stand alone, you really don't need to watch the first film to enjoy this one. Not many sequels can say that.<br /><br />There are many things to like here. As I mentioned earlier, the charater development is great. The acting of all is wonderful, with possibly Kate Beckinsale over acting just a bit at the beginning. But as the film hits it's stride so does her performance. The special effects are above average. And the music score hits the nail right on the head as each piece matches the mood or action of the scene perfectly. It's really nice to view a film where the soundtrack blends with the movie, not overpowers it.<br /><br />While there are many scenes that one could point at that shows the quality of the film, to me one stand above all others. The \\"love scene\\" between the Selene & Michael characters easily could have been exploitive and gratuitous but instead we are treated to a very sensual, slow-paced scene without ANY full-frontal nudity. It was a great scene that contrasted well with the fast-pace action of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone into action and/or horror flicks. High quality, great action, enough gore to satisfy most, and most importantly, a great plot. They also left a small window open for a third film, which I would love to see. Until then, I'll go back and watch the first film and see what I missed.ual, slow-paced scene without ANY full-frontal nudity.

B000P2A24W|5.0|I'm beyond relieved that this album received great reviews.  When I first read the online reviews of the disc, many were disappointed that Bon Jovi had ventured away from his hard rock image and slowly slipped into an experimental country sound.  I'll be the first to say that this isn't my favorite Bon Jovi album by a long shot, but it's still an excellent release.  You can't expect a CD recorded in the heart of Nashville to escape without a hint of country between the lines.  I like the direction Jon went with this album.  I'm hoping someday he goes back to the rock that made him an American icon, but change is never a bad thing with such a multi-talented artist.  Musically, it delivers... Vocally, it delivers... and lyrically, it is without a doubt some of his most clever and intelligent writing.<br /><br />Fortunate enough to be from New Jersey, I got to see Bon Jovi for the first time last month, and he is nothing short of phenomenal.  I saw him on his 10 show run at the new Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, and he tried to do something different at every show.  The night I went, he played the entire 'Lost Highway' album start to finish, something he's never done before (he played 31 songs altogether), and the next night (my sister went) he played an acoustic version of \\"Bed Of Roses\\" and went down into the crowd.. He is worth every penny in concert and I would highly, highly recommend seeing him if you ever have the chance.<br /><br />As far as this album is concerned, these are my song ratings:<br />1) Lost Highway: 9.5/10 (2nd Single)<br />2) Summertime: 9/10<br />3) (You Want To Make) A Memory: 9/10 (1st Single)<br />4) Whole Lot Of Leavin': 9/10<br />5) We Got It Going On: 10/10<br />6) Any Other Day: 9.5/10<br />7) Seat Next To You: 7.5/10<br />8) Everybody's Broken: 7.5/10<br />9) Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore: 9.5/10 (with LeAnn Rimes)<br />10) The Last Night: 7/10<br />11) One Step Closer: 8.5/10<br />12) I Love This Town: 10/10<br /><br />It's the first album since 'New Jersey' to debut at #1, but sales have been down somewhat, so at a very reasonable $10, the album is well worth the purchase.  For some, it may not quench the rocking Bon Jovi thirst, but with time comes change, and talent doesn't disappear. Jon Bon Jovi is still one of the best in the business and his music will live on forever.<br /><br />Grade: A-down somewhat, so at a very reasonable $10, the album is well worth the purchase.

0452286751|5.0|In the introduction to the 25th Anniversary Edition, Ayn Rand suggests that she meant for her book to deal with the notion of the \\"ideal man.\\"<br /><br />I do not think Rand was successful.  Howard Roark is not the ideal.  His relationships with other humans are, in my estimation, far too unhealthy.  Further, his egoism seems, at times, a bit outrageous.<br /><br />Still, despite the fact that Rand didn't meet her goal, she did write a truly inspiring book.  After reading it, I felt powerful, as if humans can be truly remarkable, heroic creatures.  Further, the book can help us gain the strength necessary to maintain our integrity and create good, quality work, even when social expectations drive us to do otherwise.<br /><br />Shortly after reading this book, I spoke to one of my good friends.  He sounded troubled and he told me that most of his goals and major life choices had been decided for him by other people.  He didn't know what he, himself, really wanted, or if he wanted anything.  This sentiment resembled one of the character's thoughts to such an extent that I immediately ordered a copy of The Fountainhead and mailed it to the friend.  If any book could help him sort out his thinking, and discover that there is some value to selfishness, THIS IS THE BOOK.<br /><br />Ayn Rand doesn't provide a true philosophy.  She doesn't tell us to what we should really aspire or what the ideal man really is.  Still, she does write one heck of an inspiring book, which, as other reviews have suggested, can have the ability to deeply affect our lives and thought.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I just realized that this review doesn't, as most of my fiction reviews do, address the author's literary merit.  I should say that, while the writing seems, at times, dry and stilted, and while the dialogue often doesn't sound \\"real,\\" Ayn Rand's prose serve her purpose.  She has written a great, philosophical novel.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I first watched this version of Jane Eyre two weeks ago, and I cannot stop thinking about it! The characters and setting are all exceptionally, superbly presented...what a marvelous piece of work.  Jane Eyre is a profound love story- always was, always will be...therefore, despite certain criticism of the extent of it in this version, the passion displayed by Rochester and Jane is absolutely appropriate.   All I can say is, as far as Toby Stephens' Rochester is concerned, I am in love!- (Somebody please put me out of my misery now!!)  DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!
B000009ED0|4.0|First of all, let me say...great album. I bought this and I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that this was one of the greatest selling albums of all time (look it up, it's on there) and so I figured people must like it. And for the most part, I do also. The album kicks off with one of the best openers I've ever heard, \\"Bawitdaba\\", which is jam-packed with incredible energy that makes one say \\"wow!\\" The song sets the tone for the entire album, which is essentially Kid Rock rapping over huge rock guitars and catchy choruses. The only song that really tends to break away from this formula is \\"Only God Knows Why\\" which is a contemplative southern-rock song about the hard life on the road and a nice step away from the hard party anthems. Overall, this is a great album principally because of its unique style.    A few qualms? Yes. For one thing, it's far too vulgar. I laughed at the sheer absurdity of some of his lyrics; it's almost as if he didn't know what else to rap about so he just cussed and swore until he thought of something else to say. While being a partier and having a fun time is part of his repertoire, I thought that the female-offensive references weren't needed. I also thought that his backing band, instead of playing recycled rhythms, could have come up with some more creative ideas; I think that the musicians could have stepped up and been a more prominent part of the art.    This is a great album. It's certainly not perfect and I thought it lacked in a few areas, but I had a blast listening to the beats and the rhymes and you will as well. Buy it because it won't sound like anything else you own, and you will be amazed by the cleverness of the overall sound.

B00004WG2F|5.0|Legends of The Fall is sort-of an epic movie, filled with everything to please everyone.  Adventure, romance, action, war, and intense drama that will absorb you into the film, if the beautiful cinematography of the Montana mountains and rivers and James Horner's incredible score don't first.  An academy award winner for best cinematography, best sound and best art direction, Legends of The Fall also had 4 Golden Globe nominations - including best actor (Brad Pitt), best original score (James Horner), best director, and best film.<br /><br />The cast of Legends is strong and powerful, led by Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidinn Quinn.  All give solid performances that are convincing and powerful, and the supporting cast as well are just as strong.  Brad Pitt, though he is many times not the greatest actor, gives an emtional-driven performance as the lead charcater, Tristan.  Somewhat overdramatic at times, overall viewers will thoroughly enjoy some of the powerful scenes he is in in the film.  Anthony Hopkins, in my opinion, probably gives the most solid performance and Aidinn Quinn does a fine job too.<br /><br />Legends is about 3 brothers (Pitt, Quinn, and Henry Thomas) and their father Colonel William Ludlow (Hopkins) who live in a beautiful ranch in northern Montana.  The film begins with last scenes of the Indian Wars, in which William was heavily involved with.  His 3 young boys are introduced before the film skips ahead several years into their adulthood.  The drama begins, when one of the brothers, Samuel (Henry Thomas) brings his fiance' Susannah (Julia Ormond) to live with them, but it is obvious the other brothers are attracted to her and she to one of them.  Upset and frustrated with WWI overseas, the 3 brothers leave the ranch to honor their country.  After returning from war, Legends begins to unfold, leading in many directions - some predicatble and some not.  Some things happen that will leave one thrilled, some things angry, and others sad.  The emotions grow, and the great performances by the cast shine onto the audience, to the point where it felt like I was part of that family.  The end of the film is satisfying, and you'll definetly want to watch it again soon.<br /><br />If you have never seen Legends of The Fall, and you love films in the epic tradition such as \\"Dances With Wolves\\" or \\"Last of The Mohicans\\", Legends will definetly satisy to the fullest.  The film deserves a High-Definition release.  As mentioned earlier, the beautiful cinematography alone is wonderful, and a high-def experience of that would just be incredible.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Drama - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5and the great performances by the cast shine onto the audience, to the point where it felt like I was part of that family.

0143038419|4.0|This well-written memoir is about recovering one's spirit, yes, but the underlying thread is one woman's painfully deep depression. Her vast spiritual quest was a wise option to antidepressants -- and I laud her for that. (Yet I doubt that questing around the world is a viable option for every clinically depressed, divorced person.)     I agree with the reviewers who point out that the book seems self-absorbed at times, in some places, but this is the nature of memoir, and often the nature of depression and spiritual quests.     But I need to insert here that I was disappointed -- and felt manipulated -- when I read that the author's \\"spiritual quest\\" was a pre-paid book deal. I appreciate that she admitted this upfront, but still .... this made the book less impressive and more of a commercial venture to me. Likewise, if Thoreau's publisher had paid him to retreat to Walden, well, his memoir of life on Walden Pond simply wouldn't be the classic it is today.    That said, Gilbert's writing is darned good, and her observations, however self-indulgent, were both humorous and poignant.  I would have given five stars had it been edited down a bit more. -- Cindy La Ferle

B00005JPNW|4.0|A rich, yet streamlined adaptation of Philip Pullman's \\"The Golden Compass\\" has finally hit the screen, and boy is it a doozie! The cinematography is dazzling ,the story is complex yet absorbing, and finally a fantasy tale,that encourages children and adults to wake up and guard the one precious gift they have been given-their minds!!!  Writer/director Chris Weitz along with his production designer Dennis Gassner have recreated Pullman's world of dogmatic institutions and the rebellious free thinking world with a hodge-podge of Edwardian and Victorian industry and architecture.This is the only place where I feel the film lacks.We never have much chance to rest and gaze upon this marvel of set design and this \\"mythical world\\" because the story simply runs at a breakneck pace in order to tell the story of the the \\"rough-edged diamond\\",12-year-old Lyra (the name of the beautiful harp whose dulcet tones could subdue angry kings in the Bible!) whose acute perspective keeps her from being swallowed alive by having her ability to think for herself destroyed.She navigates her way through this maze of oppressive authoritarianism.The fact that Nicole Kidman's character is named \\"Mrs.Coulter\\" got me to laughing thinking about the ultra conservative \\"journalist\\" Ann Coulter who seems to be the mouthpiece for modern day non-free thinking!!!( Oh, that comment will be sure to upset! OUCH!)  Yes, this film is rooted in the deep allegories of questioning religious authority, but if you allow yourself a moment to put aside your bisases,no matter what they are, \\"The Golden Compass\\" can point you in the direction that says \\"decide for yourself-question what is told to you-do not take things at face value-keep yourself YOU at all costs\\".This is a lesson that this reviewer hopes all can learn from this film!Frankly, as a person who navigated my way out of years of authoritarian thinking, I welcome this book and movie with open arms.Long live the open mind with all of it's God-given possibilities (at least if you believe in God....you don't have to, ya know!)
0670034711|1.0|I had heard a lot about this book and decided to get it.  It was a waste of my time and money.  This is a classic example of commercialism and marketing.  The author was too self-involved and her narratives made me lose interest pretty quick.

0375703764|5.0|The title may not be entirely true, but this is the most modern, most thought provoking book that I've read.  Danielewksi honestly believes that writing is a thing to be thought over, and this is one of the few books I've seen that takes the tools of the literary medium to they're absolute extent.   There is no way this could be a movie, it's too deep, there are too many layers for it to work.    House of Leaves is a story about Johnny Truant, a drug addict who finds a manuscript of house of leaves, a literary criticism on the movie, The Navidson Record.  The Navidson Record is a movie very similar to the Blair witch project-it presents itself as reality, and it never presents the 'enemy'.  There are two main points to the House that will keep you coming back-    -The \\"monster\\", if there is one, is never presented.  This solves something that's a major problem in horror.  Lovecraft, for example, had a tendency to describe his monsters as horrific, but when you finally confronted them, they weren't as scary.  The monster never appears, so there is never a big climax that leaves you happy with a sense of completion.  -There is no ending, really.  Sorry for spoiling the book for you to a degree, but the ending won't matter by the time you get to it.  There is a difference between some books, which leave you with a cliffhanger, and House of Leaves, which just...ends.  I would compare it to the Wall, which ends with the words \\"Isn't this where...\\" and begins with the words \\"...we came in?\\".  The House is never ending, though you can try to end the story for yourself, you know that you'll never be able to, so you're left with an empty hole where the ending should go, and you keep on going back to it.
B000VR824S|4.0|First off, fantastic show. I was lucky enough to have attended and though I drove six hours (one way), was horribly sunburned (my own fault) and didn't sit down for a whole twelve hours, I regret nothing.    Secondly, I'd like to say that I thought that Pearly Queen (Clapton and Winwood), Hoochie Coochie Man (Guy and Clapton), and A Day In The Life (Beck) were the three cuts that hurt the most. The best you can do to get those is either find the Youtube cuts from the MSN webcast or download the soundboard bootleg of the entire show (which I did because I thought Beck's and Clapton's sets were live album-worthy, as well as various other things). If you do go for that bootleg, know that A Day In The Life is cut off halfway through (OF ALL THE SONGS..........). I will say however, that you should at least be glad that Alison Krauss & Union Station was completely cut out. Granted, they were cut because their set was plagued with the most sound problems, but it didn't really fit into the festival. It was too country, I suppose.    Anyway, the DVD is a must-own. However, I'm curious, because around 45:39 on disk 2 (during Tell The Truth) there's a tiny audio glitch. Just a little blip of something. I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this. Sure, there were blips like that at the live show, but it's not in the soundboard bootleg I have. Please let me know if you've encountered this. I started a thread about it on IMDB's page for the festival.    That is all.

At the time of release I may have not enjoyed it being such a departure from previous Creedence albums but I have to say I found it to be outstanding.  Some of Fogerty's experimentation is a little far-fetched but you have to appreciate that he was trying to reach beyond the bayou.  Any serious Creedence fan should have this CD.
0880704829|5.0|As both an author and reader of fiction, I was impressed with The lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Maybe it is because I have always enjoyed a book that could hold my attention and make me think at the same time. In a nutshell, the characters are believable and yet a little out of the ordinary and the story line interesting. Give this book a try.<br />Tommy Taylor<br />Author - [[ASIN:1419671502 The Second Virgin Birth]]
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|While the premise of this show is a bit out there, it is a really fun and engaging show with wonderful acting.
0425152251|4.0|With a great mix of history, rhetoric and wonder, this story gives you a great knowledge of the history of philosophy simplified through the eyes of 12-year-old Sophie.      While getting her mail one day she stumbles upon a mysterious envelope in her mailbox, and the story unfolds.  While slow to start, this novel picks up speed as she delves deeper into the different schools of philosophy until everything she considered true in the world is flipped.      A great read for anyone who likes books that make them think.  Not a light beach read or a novel to skim through.  This will stay with you long after it finds a home on your bookshelf.

B000VBJEFK|4.0|Does Ratatouille have a predictable plot?  Of course it does.  Does Ratatouille have the classic hollywood assembly of bad guys waiting for their just desserts, unseemly heros waiting to rise beyond expectations and a smart-witted women waiting in the wings?  Sure.  But this time (I bet you've heard that before) it works really well.  The film is clever and beautiful.  Well worth the 1080p tv that you bought behind you're wife's back.  Well Done Pixar, despite your evil Disney overlords.  Keep up the good work!  I'd almost go so far as to say this movie justifies the Blu-Ray idiot tax (come on people, they really shouldn't cost any more than DVDs).
1897299192|5.0|I was introduced to the Moomintroll books by Tove Jansson(a popular Finnish author,) many years ago.  These are some of the most charming, well-written and engaging stories for children I've ever encountered.  I subsequently shared all the books with my daughter, who also fell in love with the whole Moomin Valley collection of creatures.  (My 92-year-old mother still enjoys reading the chapter books!)      I had never seen the comic strips, and was delighted to find them.  Though they lack the literary finesse of the longer books, they are still charming and funny, and full of wit and satire- displaying through these fanciful critters all the frailties of human behavior.  Great for children of all ages.
B0001I55OC|1.0|I recently received a copy of this movie, purchased thru Amazon. It was the third time I have tried to see it. I didn't even get thru the first scene before the picture started to pixelate. When I tried to go to a scene further in the movie, the screen showed the message \\"This DVD will not play\\". So while I can't really give an accurate review of the movie, I will say beware this movie. The first two copies were purchased as new in a store, the third purchased as \\"used mint\\". All were un-viewable.
B0000028PI|5.0|This is actually the second Alice Cooper album I ever got; the first was Welcome to my Nightmare.  This, however, was what really got me into Alice Cooper.  It's a good, even album: while nothing on it is likely to be automatically included on a \\"Best Of\\" album, neither does it contain some cuts which seem to have made it onto the album purely to fill space.  It's a good choice for somebody trying to get into Alice Cooper, up there with [[ASIN:B0000C7PQW The Eyes of Alice Cooper]] and [[ASIN:B000002I99 Welcome to My Nightmare]].
0525457585|5.0|If you have not read this book then you are missing out on a piece of literary history. Make sure you get the version that has the green and red print. Some paperback versions use only black lettering and that misses a significant point of the book (that we are all Bastian and reading the same book).
B000VT6FAO|4.0|first off, I really like \\"Hourglass\\".  It is much more consistent and focussed than \\"Paper Tigers\\".  This could have been a Depeche Mode album, but it has a dark, narcotic feel to it.  After hearing the first three songs, especially \\"Kingdom\\" I felt like either shooting up or checking into rehab.  drug refrences aside, \\"I Saw Something\\", \\"Kingdom\\", and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" have a haunting, druggy feel.  I also thought \\"Miracles\\" was a great attempt at ripping off Martin Gore (or has Dave really learned from Martin after all these years?).  \\"Use You\\" picks up where the first three songs started.  \\"Down\\" is a great closer for the disc, but like \\"Miracles\\", I can only imagine how much better it would be if Martin Gore wrote it.  I will never, ever, like Dave's solo work better than anything Depeche Mode  has or will do.  however, this is a fine collection of songs with no real clunkers.  but seriously, I think dave is using again based on the vibe of this disc.  I say buy it and worry about re-hab later.

B000U7169W|1.0|because that was what I was doing after a few minutes of watching this Cardinal Sin being called a movie.    If at confession you're given penance by your priest to do a thousand \\"Our Fathers\\" or to say the Rosary a hundred times, then count your blessings that he didn't force you to watch this movie just one time.  Perhaps there truly is a place called Hell, because I felt like I was there for an hour and a half.    This movie could have been so great, given the genesis of the story and staring Hilary Swank, one of the best actresses of our day, but it ended up being a complete mess.  Even the quality of the blu-ray transfer was terrible.    Please save your $19, or go buy \\"Seven\\" (which deals with this genera brilliantly), \\"28 Days Later\\", \\"28 Weeks Later\\", or \\"The Skeleton Key\\", which are all far superior films that you will enjoy time and time again.    Happy movie watching :)
0679720200|4.0|\\"The Stranger's\\" theme is that from the moment we are born we are already fated to die and there is no escaping this, so life is largely pointless. Yes, this book is a classic European existentialist-angst downer. The main character, Meursault, is one of those too-cool-to-live guys that just sits in a chair all afternoon and smokes cigarettes blankly--as he does in the book.    Meursault, however, is a post-war Western man. This description may not have been Camus' intention. But the lack of feeling or concern for anything, whether the fact that his \\"Maman\\" (a term of affection?) just passed away or that a girlfriend loves him enough to think of marrying him, clearly crosses the line into sociopathy. Meursault goes wherever the events of the day may take him. It might be sitting on his balcony all afternoon or working or shooting a guy to death on a beach. Either way, it doesn't make much difference to him.    Camus' \\"The Stranger,\\" after this first reading, seems to be an introduction of Western man's inner self after World War II: shiftless, unbelieving (in anything larger than himself), devoid of any intimacy or emotion; utterly uncaring about anything around him. The theme of \\"we're all dead anyway\\" is clearly revealing and is much food for later thought. \\"The Stranger\\" is a book that will require lengthy revisiting despite its brevity. Just don't revisit it during the holidays.
B00000I3JD|5.0|One of my top 5 favorite hip-hop albums.  I never get tired of listening.  Lauryn hill is an extraordinary artist - she can sing, rap and write.  It's a shame we don't see more of her work out there today - we can use some...

Each story is very interesting however the chapters on speculation is a bit boring and drawn out. It would be hard to finish this book and still not believe in reincarnation.

B000002UCN|3.0|I think the songs are great.  Being a life-long Beatles fan, I had no idea these songs were written by George (at the time they played on the radio), so it's great he finally \\"got some respect.\\"  My big beef with this CD is the mix is bad!  Like on, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" there's too much cymbals in some places and not enough of bass in others.  The mix is different than the original recording in other songs, too, is all I can say. Also, a bit into the song, it sort of slows down a bit and sounds \\"wobbly.\\" I'm wondering if we bought an illegal copy and it was done badly, although we bought it at Fry's.  Then again, you never know who delivers to these guys.  It could have \\"fallen off a truck.\\"  Does anyone else have this problem?  Some other songs are excellent recordings, though.

B000N0WCLC|5.0|Blood Diamond was not a movie high on my list.  I originally thought it was an action movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Although it is much more than that.  The story takes us to war strewn country of Sierra Leone where the government is trying to fend off the rebels.  Watching the movie made me realize there is really no good side.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the late 90's when people in the United States were more concerned about the Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky scandal.  There were very real problems going on in the world and that is apparent in this story.  The movie makes no excuses for the excessive violence since it was and is such a real issue in the world.  Diamond smuggling is a multi billion dollar business fed on the Western desire for the precious jewels.<br /><br />The story develops quickly with an average family living in a small village.  Their life was generally peaceful in an exploding world.  The rebels then attack the village taking no prisoners.  The battle becomes very real when you see small children with machine guns shooting at everyone.  When the dust settles the Solomon's family has escaped and he has been trapped.  Solomon is then quickly shuttled off to a diamond field to begin work searching for diamonds.  During this work Solomon comes across a diamond as large as an egg.  Surprised by this find he realizes the only thing he can do is take the diamond and hide it.<br /><br />What happens then is an amazing story filled with action and suspense.  A journey that never stops and can only takes one breath away when they realize this is something that really happened.  It is a sad story but it is also a happy story.<br /><br />I watched the Blu-ray version which was filled with a beautiful picture and wonderful sound.  It also had many extra features including a wonderful documentary about the smuggling business.  For anyone with a Blu-ray player I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best movies of the year.  With the lack of great movies this year it's great to have a diamond in the rough.  A story that is incredibly amazing and true.  Sometimes almost hard to believe this could be real.  This is a journey of how greed can lead to terrible things.  I hope if you take the time to watch this you learn something about wrongs that have occurred because of greed.  A definite must watch for anyone.his year it's great to have a diamond in the rough.  A story that is incredibly amazing and true.  Sometimes almost hard to believe this could be real.

1582701709|5.0|This book is a great. Everyone should read this book because I believe it puts your life into perspective, it allows you to become more conscience about things you would of otherwise overlooked. If you want to change your life, your way of thinking, then read this book. The only thing I didn't particularly like is the constant promotion of the movie they made about the book. I mean one reference ok, but there was well over 20. That became annoying and took away from my concentration of the explanations. They would just throw it in there, weird. But I can undestand WHY they did it. Still a great book and I would highly suggest reading it.
0571202284|5.0|Well all I can say is Richard Williams knows his stuff better than anyone. He has learned from the best, hes overly passionate about animation, it is all a lifestyle for him, and he does nothing more gracefully other than teaching it to others. This book is one of the reasons animation has had a leap in quality towards the better.<br /><br />Definitly a musthave if you are seeking to learn the basics of animation regardless of the medium you are using, wheather classical, stopmotion or 3D animation.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|(Possible Spoilers)    This last season was a worthy edition to the Gilmore Canon. As I watched the DVD of Season 7, the season felt a lot like \\"closure\\" to me. Closure and Change/Growth seemed to be the themes for this final season.     The writing in season 7 wasn't as witty as in past years, but it had an awful lot of heart to it. Throughout the season, words were spoken between characters that, I think, needed to be said.     The last show, in particular, was maybe the best final wrap-up show that I have ever watched.     Luke, looking at Lorelai, and saying simply, \\"I just like to see you happy.\\"--is there any more touching and true way of saying \\"I love you\\"?    Lorelai, looking at her mother, and realizing that her mother is worried about losing her daughter again--now that Rory is moving on. So Lorelai smiles sweetly at Emily and says softly, \\"Why don't we just talk about this on Friday, at dinner?\\"  Anyone who has watched even a few episodes of Gilmore Girls, can sense that this simple remark by Lorelai carries immense emotional weight. And for those of us who have followed the Gilmore girls through 7 seasons, Lorelai's remark is perfect.    But for me, probably the most touching words are those of Richard, Lorelai's father, who says to Lorelai, \\"This party is as much for you, Lorelai, as it is for Rory.\\" Richard expands on these words, and when the camera switches to Lorelai's tearful face, it mirrors what we are feeling.     Like most everyone else here on the comments board, I will miss the Gilmore Girls. The dialog, the truly memorable and fascinating characters created, and most especially the acting by all of the stars, particularly Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel--that will all be sorely missed. The Gilmore Girls was a unique and wonderful show.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|Well since I didn't score tickets for tonight's Led Zep London gig, I did the next best thing and watched the remastered DVD of the NYC concert \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\"    Having recently just seen 2/3rds of the Yardbirds at the July '07 Chicago \\"Crossroads Guitar Festival\\" where Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck stole the show, I watched the Madison Square Garden 'Zep disc with those performances in mind. (BTW, I enjoyed Row 5 center floor seats for Zeppelin's July 7, 1973 gig in Chicago, just a couple weeks before the filmed 7/27-29 NYC dates.)    I have to say that Pagey has not aged well in comparison to his former Yardbirds comrades. In TSRTS concert, he is quite the technician, fast and agile and confident playing the limited repertoire of looping frantic riffs that he favors.    With the exception of \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" Page seems disconnected from the blues roots that are still so richly evident when you listen to Beck and Clapton today.     Pagey's last major tour as a sideman with The Black Crowes should be a warning for any idealistic Zep reunion fans. It was not pretty. And Plant still regrets the silly travesty of the UnLedded joke.     I hope Robert will pass on the obscenely lucrative profiteering of a full-blown Zeppelin worldwide junket and just stay true to his muse by touring this Spring with Allison Krauss.    On his best night at his present age, Pagey no longer has the mojo to play like he once did, and nobody wants to see the legendary Zep magic defiled by a tragic charade.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I was thrilled seeing this at the movie theater knowing the considerable talent of the three principals and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD.  I've purchased a few for Christmas presents to the friends who were with me on that day and, yes, we opera \\"buffs\\" have been discussing it ever since.  The first reviewer is spot on in the details of the review. The only detraction was (as most usual) the production, however, those made no difference in the wonderful pleasure derived from the artistry of the singers.  Dmitri owns the role, period.  Renee was at her very, very best and the chemistry between the two jumped off the screen.  This is a must purchase for anyone who loves the art of pure singing and acting singers.  Performances of perfection!!  I was in attendance at the Met for my favorite performance of all time, that of Domingo and Fleming in \\"Otello\\", also available on DVD.  This is just about as good as it gets in the world of great opera singing.  I've seen all three in person many times and the DVD is a must for memories of these extraordinary artists in a beautiful opera.  Russian is a language that sings beautifully as well.  Don't leave this one in Amazon's inventory.  Buy it!
0340839937|5.0|This is undeniably the best SciFi book ever penned. I've read it numerous times and every time I learn something new. This book is meticulously planned so an entirely new world (worlds) is created. Down to peoples nationalities, religions and style of dress, everything is created new by this author. There is no lingering tant of earth or stupid weapons that are simply discribed as \\"Laser guns\\".  For those of you who haven't read this book the best I can describe it is to picture the Star Wars series for the amount of backstory the author put into even minor charactors and worlds.  If you haven't read this book, you are missing out on something truly great. Frank Herbert is the best that SciFi has to offer, and Dune is his masterpiece.  Oh and if you ever saw the mini series of this book on t.v.  and therefore are dismissing the book, please don't.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.  Those mini series were a disgrace.
B000VSBX34|5.0|The Beatles' second film is wonderfully restored to its original high saturation full color glory in this two DVD set. It looks beautiful and sounds great. The film itself is widely underrated. If the band's amazing film debut, \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" had not been so unexpectedly brilliant, \\"Help!\\" would stand today as one of the classic British comedy films of the 1960s. This is not to say that \\"Help!\\" is a better film, but by comparision, this one has more outrageous site gags, more rapid-fire British wit, much more plot, more funny characters, more locations and more interesting sets. Like \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" it was directed by Richard Lester, who excelled in spectacular comedies. (He later directed \\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\\" and the best and funniest versions of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" and \\"The Four Musketeers.\\") The soundtrack offers seven now-classic Beatles songs and a classical score the effectively offsets the pleasant pop of the Fab Four. The plot centers around the pursuit of a mystical ring stuck on Ringo's hand, giving two sets of comical bad guys an excuse to chase the band through England, the Swiss Alps and the Bahamas. Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear, Eleanor Braun, Leo McKern, John Buthal and Patrick Cargil all turn in wonderfully over-the-top comic performances and the Beatles themselves are very funny, too. Extras on this collection include behinds the scenes footage in the context of several short documentaries, backckground on the restoration of the film and a decontruction of a lost scene that was cut from the film. Beatles buffs will be interested in noting the cameos by longtime Beatles aid Mal Evans as the swimmer looking for the White Cliffs of Dover.
0440178002|5.0|This a remarkable novel on every account, and a true pleasure to read.  Take the opening, which begins with a Dutch trader, the last of his fleet, caught in a storm in uncharted waters.  Look at how skillfully Clavell introduces us to each character, weaves in the backstory, and makes us care about Blackthorne.  And look at that language - bold and clear with gritty verbs that anchor you to the moment, so you feel every shudder of the keel.<br /><br />Later on there's two more journeys by sea, including a battle, and it rings totally authentic, taking you in twist by twist.  And what adds to the suspense is you don't truly know the intentions of the two captains - everything is shaded in grey, so that they themselves aren't sure just how far they'll take it, or for who they're actually fighting for.  The line of friendship tightens and slacks and finally snaps, over and over again.<br /><br />In just this way, Clavell's characters are never shallow, but always surprising and full of depth.  In one part a woman is beaten by her husband, and another character goes to kill the husband, but the twist is how she actually drove her husband to it on purpose.  And then there's the further surprise of why.  Everything in the novel has such richly rewarding layers of meaning, with espionage, blackmail, sabotage, lust, and betrayal all moving under the surface of this grand epic.<br /><br />With Blackthorne's fate always at risk to treachery, Shogun reads more as a thriller than historical fiction, and in fact Clavell meant it to be that way, basing the story on Dutch trader Will Adams, but changing much to suit his tale.  Politics, religion, and conquest play a dominant role, and the line often blurs between them as each side tries to recover from and capitalize on Blackthorne's arrival.  What adds to this is how Clavell knows when to heighten with drama and also when to let off the tension with philosophy and romance.  He mixes poetry with swordplay, religious conflict with pissing from a tower to seal a pact.<br /><br />The twelve-hour miniseries was very well done, and yet there's so much more depth and intrigue in the novel, where you discover just how resourceful these characters are.  For one such example, in the miniseries Toranaga's ship is greeted at the fishing village by about fifty faithful samurai.  In the book there are three thousand, plus five hundred cavalry, and they're not under his control at all.  In fact, he's lucky to escape with his life.  Not restricted by time, budget, or censors, Clavell doesn't hold back, including one breath-taking ten-page scene involving Mariko and hundreds of samurai.  At the end of it, one of the samurai says, \\"When I saw the Lady Mariko pick up Yoshinaka's sword, I thought I'd die with pride,\\" and you feel the same.<br /><br />Toranaga-sama (based on Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu) is one of the most compelling characters you'll ever discover, and if you haven't seen the miniseries, look him up on YouTube (\\"Shogun: First Meeting with Toranaga\\") to get an idea of Toshiro Mifune's portrayal.  In the novel Toranaga's described as having a pot belly and big nose, which contrasts well with his ruthless military capabilities, but Mifune so inhabited the role, and strove for such authenticity, that it's difficult to see anyone else in the part.<br /><br />It's a long book, for sure, and yet at the end you'll only wish there was another book to follow it.  One of the factors that makes this novel such a rewarding experience is how Clavell seems to know everything about feudal Japan and how effortlessly he fills us in without it ever becoming a history lesson or guidebook.  There's a great deal of falconry, as well, for anyone interested in that field, and befitting the culture, there's plenty of sex, so it's not for young readers.<br /><br />What's amazing is that Clavell could write with such understanding and reverence of the Japanese way of life.  During WWII, he was captured in Java and spent three years in the Changi concentration camp in Singapore.  This experience became his first novel, King Rat.  And yet Clavell later dedicated three years writing to this novel that shows how civilized Japan was over the Europe of its day.  As Clavell said, \\"It's possible to end up admiring an enemy.\\"<br /><br />In the end there's only two things I didn't like about Shogun.  First is that even though there's important journeys by both land and sea, there's no map to clue you in to just where they are, how far they're going, or what lays around them.  If anyone knows of a good online map of feudal Japan (1600), please post where to find it (but don't look for Anjiro - the village's name was actually Ajiro).  My only other grudge is that Clavell didn't continue the story.  I can see why he ended where he did, but I didn't want to leave these characters or the land they so richly inhabit.<br /><br />***Click below on Comments for the full Cast Index and Japanese phrases.***s experience became his first novel, King Rat.

It's great that it's been remastered once again in 2014, with a warm, crisp sound that will enthrall even the most jaded listener. The song &#34;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)&#34; could be an anthem for today's anti-bullying movement, and even if the songs here are a bit preachy, the album will grow on you in time, even if ALL THINGS MUST PASS and CLOUD NINE are better first purchases for someone just getting into Harrison's solo work.
B000002J03|5.0|Zeppelin never fails to impress.    Not more need be said. BUY IT!
B00014TJ7K|5.0|CLOUD NINE was a great comeback album for George Harrison in 1987, and it was a true return to form, his best since LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD. Unlike most of the pop coming out in the late-80s, CLOUD NINE is real music played on real instruments by real people, with the best songs easily being the hardest-rocking one, \\"Devil's Radio\\", and the pop-rocker \\"This Is Love\\", both of which got a lot of FM airplay. This CD belongs in every Beatle fan's collection.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|It's been probably 20 years since I originally saw this film and the first time I ever saw this version. I was very impressed by this movie, although it certainly doesn't romanticize submarine warfare.<br /><br />This movie is about a U-boat crew setting out from France during World War II in an effort to sink Allied shipping. Although U-boats had been the terror of the sea at the beginning of the war when the voyage in the film takes place the Germans have lost their edge... the Happy Time is over. U-boats are just as often hunted as the hunter.<br /><br />The film portrays life on a German submarine, not the most pleasant existence, with food going bad and close quarters and the damp. And it gets considerably worse when the U-boat comes under attack.<br /><br />Das Boot does not pull punches. Be warned. And it is a long movie. But if you want to get a good feel for what war was like for German submariners, three quarters of whom never made it home, then you should see this movie.
B000EZ913I|5.0|The Gold CD version of THE NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS gives the Byrds the Super Audio CD treatment, which is a wonderful idea, especially since the band always had very crystalline production values. This version brings \\"Goin' Back\\", a song of longing for childhood which acknowledges that you can't ever really go home again, and \\"Triad\\", which were in competition for a spot on the original album, together for the first time. With this album, the Byrds also started moving toward a country-rock sound and style. The surviving members' opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this Gold CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The DDR was one of the most surveillance-intensive regimes to ever exist. Paranoid, exposed to western ideas from their fellow Germans both to the west and from the enclave of West Berlin, East Germany went to extraordinary measures to detect dissension within its ranks. The secret police were known as the Stasi.<br /><br />This is the background you need to know when watching the Lives of Others. I thought the opening at the Stasi College using the tapes of an actual interrogation was masterful, setting the stage in several ways for the story to come: how the Stasi operates, the introduction of the main character and how he thinks and a segue into the job around which the plot revolves: the \\"suspected loyalty\\" of one of the DDR's top writers.<br /><br />It's an excellent story. No car chases. No shootings. Just human drama done very well.
1400063515|5.0|As a professional portfolio manager and CFA charterholder, I found this book to be of utmost importance in understanding the true risks we face in today's markets.  With several 3 and 4 standard deviation events in the US stock markets this year alone (Gaussian standard deviation implies probabilities for these events such as 1:15,000+), it is obvious that we must strive to understand risk in a new scientific way.    Nassim is brilliant, and this book will become a classic!
0717283534|4.0|ISBN [[ASIN:2894332513 Walt Disney's The Lion King]] (5 stars) - This is now the third Disney version of The Lion King that I've read, I thought I'd found the best of them in [[ASIN:0307127923 Disney's The Lion King (A Golden Look-Look Book)]].  I stand corrected with this one.  Although it's small, nearly pocket sized, and it's one of those \\"novelties\\", with a pillowed hardcover, this edition is better than the rest (so far!).  For the sake of comparison I will, again, merge the reviews.<br /><br />This third edition is, by far, the smoothest flowing storytelling I've found to date.  Leaving out almost nothing, from the beginning to the end, it captures every important moment, running them fluidly together.  This makes a much more complete and easy to follow - and enjoy! - story.  Brimar's edition seems to be author-less, sadly, so it won't be possible for me to hunt down anything else from the writer - which is only one of two negatives I can find here.  The other is that the text is a little small and the font not great.<br /><br />The first edition I reviewed: [[ASIN:0717283534 The Lion King (Wonderful World of Reading) by Walt Disney Company]] (4 stars) - This is the Disney's Wonderful World of Reading edition of The Lion King. Because there are so many, and they vary so much, I think it's important not to confuse them. Some parents might be reluctant to introduce their child to the story because of the murder of Simba's father and the later killing of Scar. If that's a concern for you, this book might be best passed by for now.<br /><br />The illustrations are absolutely beautiful, even a step above Disney's usual standard excellence. The story is very slightly disjointed because it's condensed, but the high points are covered and those who have seen the movie will have no trouble following. On the other hand, those who haven't seen the movie might not even notice what's missing! Either way, a chance to read with your child should never be missed and a wonderful Disney tale is always worthwhile.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307127923 Disney's The Lion King (A Golden Look-Look Book)]] (5 stars) - This is the second version of Disney's The Lion King that I've read.  All three tell the same story, but this one is a bit better.  Hover's adaptation includes more detail and flows more smoothly.  The illustrations by the team of Judy Barnes and Robbin Cuddy are very good and the mood of the moment is captured in fantastic colors.<br /><br />Simba's birth is cause for celebration in the jungle - the future king is presented to one and all, and all show up. Except, that is, Scar. Scar is Simba's uncle, brother of King Mufasa and, until Simba's birth, next in line for the throne. Scar hatches several plans to get rid of Simba and reclaim his place, finally resorting to killing his brother and encouraging Simba to give in to his guilt and run away.<br /><br />Befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba grows to his full size.

B00004ZBLD|5.0|If you enjoy early opera you will love this.  As it stands, it really is just like a Vivaldi opera (for me anyway)--i.e. there is no narrator as in many oratorios, and the arias and choruses all advance the drama.  It has absolutely beautiful choruses, and these are a sort of revelation for fans of Vivaldi opera (because his operas don't really have any big complex choruses--if only opera seria conventions had allowed them!!  There are a few here in Juditha Triumphans, but the long one that ends Act 1 is especially moving).  The other difference from his operas is, of course, that it is in Latin, but the singers still sing very dramatically and act well through the text just as if they were singing Italian.  Anyway, the quality of the music is on a par with Orlando Furioso, in my opinion.<br /><br />By the way, I can't believe how horrible the album covers are for this complete Vivaldi series by the Naive label.  They all feature models in very unimaginative examples of fashion photography that have, usually, absolutely nothing to do with the work.  I honestly think these covers might put some people off of buying the records because they look like (bad) pop album covers.  Ugh!  There is a whole world of beautiful, public domain art out there to choose from, including many pieces of religious art that depict the very subject of this oratorio, so what's with the model with the rose in her teeth?  Anyway, it is too bad, because the recordings in this series are very high quality.<br /><br />By the way, I was not bothered by the acoustics on this recording.  I found it rich and full and nice and not over-resonant as some say here (including the amazon reviewer).  But that aspect of a recording is always so subjective, I find...
1401300529|1.0|I was very disappointed by Halberstam's book, \\"The Coldest Winter.\\" Some have said it is \\"journalism\\" and \\"history.\\" I suggest that it is not \\"history,\\" and I do not understand \\"journalism\\" if this is the nature of it. Specifically, important parts appear to be factually incorrect, and other historical facts are not used, or were not known by Halberstam. In essence, the book is an anti-General MacArthur screed, and it allows others who despised him to vent or disclose their loathing. Additonally, I suggest it does not place either President Truman or Mr. Acheson, among others, in proper historical perspective that can be measured by facts now known from Russian and Chinese sources.   It does not measure the ultimate meaning of the Korean War, which was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union and why it was that.  Moreover, Halberstam seems not to understand that the \\"Korean War\\" was three (3) wars. The first Korean War was against the North Koreans. Under General MacArthur's command,it was a stunning success. The second Korean War was against the Chinese. It, too, was very successful. The third Korean War was a stalemate war. That war was not a success, even though it made South Korea possible and permitted it to become a leading country today in the Western Pacific.   There are a few parts of this book that are pleasing. Those are the first-hand experiences and discussions by some of the American officers and men who fought there, and they fought brilliantly under great commanding officers--of whom Gen. MacArthur was one.   Sadly, this pleasing aspect is nullified by Halberstam who devotes almost no attention or space to the South Korean army units themselves, other than suggesting that they were not competent.  For these reasons, among others, this book was a major disappointment to me.
B000ZOW96Y|3.0|I rented this movie but it said that I already downloaded it, in which I didn't so I couldn't watch it.
B000MCIBB6|4.0|Hardcore Doors purists have been making quite a fuss over Bruce Botnick's \\"remixing\\" of the entire band's catalogue. However, the structure of the songs has not been changed at all, and the production is more akin to what was done in the \\"Elvis 30 #1 Hits\\" package, the songs have been literally remixed from their ORIGINAL elements for a much superior sound quality to any previous releases. The work done on \\"The Doors\\" and \\"Strange Days\\" brought those albums back to life with great energy and complete sonic coverage, the same effect is replicated here with the band's third release, \\"Waiting For The Sun.\\" Although The Doors have always been known for the excellent quality of their packages, which has been superior to even some Beatles and Hendrix releases, there were still limitations in terms of volume and stereo mixing, all fixed here. There is good reason for fans to be skeptical, when Iggy Pop attempted the same experiment with \\"Raw Power,\\" the result was an album that was sharper, but sometimes overblown on the volume levels, here Botnick and his team have achieved a great sonic feat by bringing songs back to life, giving them full stereo coverage, and setting them at a volume level that can finally compete with contemporary releases. So why am I not giving it the full five stars? The sound quality is great, but as an album \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" was never one of the Doors' strongest moments. Like \\"The Soft Parade,\\" it has some excellent songs, but it never feels like a whole, complete work. There are still some classics here that sound just as timeless as ever, including \\"Hello, I Love You\\" which here shines with sharper instruments and keyboards, \\"Love Street\\" remains a tender ballad and \\"My Wild Love\\" is a wicked accapella. One of the best remixes here is \\"Summer's Almost Gone,\\" here Botnick has managed to bring the drums back to life as well as Jim Morrison's vocals and Robby Krieger's dreamy slide guitar, this is the best the song has ever sounded. \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" is a great, gothic epic that pounds harder here. \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" is a strong anti-war protest fitting for our times. \\"Five To One\\" rocks harder here, with Morrison's menacing, half-drunken soothsaying on the end of Flower Power. The other tracks of course sound better, but nothing can save a bad song. \\"Wintertime Love\\" is just lame filler and \\"Yes, The River Knows\\" is a sappy ballad Morrison's doesn't feel comfortable singing. The extras on this disc are not as appealing as the previous two albums' offerings. Here we get three needless takes of \\"Not To Touch The Earth,\\" \\"Adagio In G Minor,\\" which is already available on \\"American Prayer.\\" Morrison's epic, ditched poem \\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" is included here, but it isn't much of a find anymore considering that yes, this has already been released in a previous set. The Doors remain one of rock's great revelations, and Morrison's theatrical, lyrical legacy is timeless, these remixes do justice to the music. A must for fans, purists should open their ears instead of closing them.

1594481938|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books.  It's laugh-out-loud funny, well written and tremendously entertaining. This book is worth every cent, and it's one of the few that I will will read for the second and even third time.
B000VWYNNW|1.0|As many have noted, this is bad.  I grew up infatuated with the solo from SRTS' No Quarter.  Whether that solo was how it was really played or a product of overdubbing, I had no clue, but that was what I came to know and love.  Straying from the grail is not endearing this version to me. It's a shame because the remastered sound is a nice upgrade.  I won't buy this album again, no matter what they do to it.  My lp still plays, just fine.  Thanks for nuthin'.
B0002UOK04|5.0|There are so many incredible bands from Finland (and all Scandinavia) that disprove any ideas that metal music has digressed or that the current metal scene is bland. I hear this empty rhetoric so often in the States, which surprises me b/c there are many great metal bands here too. Maybe its the shear volume that overwhelms people and causes them to simplify in a negative vein? But the plethora of bands does make it more difficult for one to stand out, unmistakably in an unwavering command of everthing a metal fan could hope for; amazing musicianship, complex and coherant arrangement, raw sonic brutality articulated with lyrical concision and  thematic timelessness, all the while avoiding the trap of cliche mediocrtiy.<br /><br />Wintersun accomplishes every one of these feats, unmercifully and exsquisitely. If you think Im overstating it or providing lofty language for strictly personal reasons, listen to them. The band is possessed of a cohesion well into the realm of perfection. Jari, lead singer and guitarist, formerly of Ensiferum and Arthemesia, has the mandate for metal mastery from the coldest winter dawn. As this is the first album, released in 2004, I would recommend it be listened to and revered before the second release... should you wait , you might not be able to absorb them both at once!
B000H6SXMY|1.0|This set has disc holders made of heavy cardboard that WILL scratch the discs as you take them out and put them back.  I just received this set from Amazon today, and the first disc I started watching was scratched and it skipped quite a bit.  I'm shipping this back immediately.  This packaging is very poorly designed.<br /><br />On a side note, the size of the box is also less than ideal.  It's doesn't fit well with other DVDs on a shelf.<br /><br />I'm going to buy the individual seasons separately instead!  The individual seasons are properly packaged with slim plastic disc holders.  Plus, they are the size of other DVDs.

But this dvd was very entertaining to me and she sounds great!  she looks great! and the crowd interaction is nice to see for a change.  but i agree with one other reviewer, the first outfit she wore was not good it was too small and made her look larger than she was, when she changed all was good.  this dvd was actually fun to watch and im glad i did get this i was contemplating for a while and i made the right choice.  Pick this up you wont be dissapointed!
0375758887|4.0|In the spirit of the holidays, I thought I'd pick up this novel because like most people, I have seen the film before I read the book and enjoyed the movie immensely, and I am a fan of Dickens' other writings (i.e. Great Expectations, David Copperfield).  With that said, I knew what the novel was about and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I am suprised to see how the movie adapted itself so closely to the original story (most movies adapted from novels can be so different than the book), and I was suprised to see how short the novel was (you can pretty much finish the novel as quickly as you could watch the movie-- perhaps even faster!)  Anyway, the only difference is that in the novel Scrooge never visits the Cratchits.  That's the only thing Hollywood did to make the audience feel even better.  It's a great read; one I'd recommend to read to a child before bedtime during the Holiday season (a few pages at a time over a few days or weeks of course, the novel isn't THAT short.)<br />  As a bonus, The Chimes and The Haunted Man (more holiday short stories) are included in this book.  They are similar in the structure of A Christmas Carol, but are not as universally touching nor are they as well written.  The Chimes is particular in its story concerning the poor and wretched in England, and the Haunted Man was just vague and hard to read.  You don't get nearly as attached to the characters in either of these short stories so if you're getting the book for A Christmas Carol, it's likely you will not enjoy the other stories.  If you are a Dickens fan, you'll most likely read them and judge for yourself.
B000UR9T7I|3.0|Great action movie to watch in high definition with surround sound.  The kids love it!
0316666343|2.0|I didn't really like it. After all the publicity it got, I was expecting.... more somehow. It started out wonderful, but it really dragged in the middle. There were times when it didn't seem like anything was happening, plot-wise.
B000C20VPA|5.0|This movie really makes one happy not to be involved in shady and slick dealings.  It's really hard to decide who is the champion in this movie as well.  At the end of the movie, it's hard not to be empathetic for Joe Pesci; despite his being a genuine punk.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000E1YW04|2.0|First off, I love Rent.  Have the Broadway and German Cast soundtracks, I've seen it on Broadway, and saw the movie several times in the theater.  Great movie.  But the UMD just flat out sucks.  Believe it or not, there is NO CHAPTER SELECT option in the main menu.  Wow.  A musical UMD naturally ought to be separated into chapters that will let you easily go to the track you want to watch/listen, but that's not possible without a chapter selection menu.  Furthermore, the chapters are not bookmarked so that they start at the beginning of a song, which again, would make sense for a musical like Rent.  Video and audio are good, but I would have just made my own MP4 video file if I knew that the UMD would be so lame, especially since Sony now allows video of full 480x272 resolution to be played from memory stick.  Using PSP Video 9, you can make videos that are of comparable quality but only 700mb-1gb in size (AVC video@768kbps, AAC audio@128kbps) that will play off your pro duo memory stick.  And since the PSP now allows you to easily scene search by 1,2, or 5 minute intervals, it is much easier to find the song you want to play on the pro duo than on this UMD.  Bottom line, forget this UMD even though it is pretty cheap at thirteen dollars shipped.

B000A0GP4K|4.0|A great documentary, except for one glaring and baffling omission: the film does not even mention \\"The Times They are a-Changin',\\" either the song or the album.  How can you make a documentary about the early years of Dylan's career, but not even mention this landmark work.   It's arguably the most significant topical song Dylan ever wrote, not to mention the song most associatied with Dylan's role as \\"voice of a generation,\\" and a centerpiece of his performances from 1963-66 (he opened most shows with this song).    Was there some legal reason that this was omitted?  Very strange.

B000VSBX34|4.0|The picture quality is great and the sound is excellent. The film is a fun way to watch the Beatles, but doesn't quite come up to the level of excitement captured in A Hard Days Night. Both films are required viewing, but AHDN will be the movie you watch more often, even though the songs are better in Help.

0307387178|4.0|This was my first time reading the work of Jon Krakauer, and I was rather impressed with his narrative about a young man whose disillusion with the world made him seek out something bigger than himself.  There were some portions of the book that dragged on a bit, but overall, I didn't feel like I was reading a work of nonfiction.  I appreciated Krakauer's inclusion of the people who knew McCandless and the impression he left behind on each of them, along with a portrait of his family life that played a major role in McCandless' choices in life.<br /><br />Now I'll be the first to admit that McCandless was naive in many ways pertaining to the Alaskan wilderness, and while there were moments I felt he was an idiot for taking such chances, I empathized with his yearnings to just leave everything behind and shoot from the hip for lack of a better terms in regards to living his life.<br /><br />Overall, this book is an interesting read into the mind of someone who wanted to find a deeper meaning into the intricacies of life, but ended up suffering the brutal consequences of his decisions.
B000O5AYCA|4.0|Given how many albums The National have released, I am a fairly recent fan, but upon first seeing and hearing them at the Pitchfork Music Festival in 2006, it didn't take long for me to fall under their spell.  Boxer is another immaculate masterpiece in their collection.<br /><br />Some might be put off by Matt Berninger's baritone vocals, but I find they give more to the overall beauty of each song.  But what draws me to The National are the lyrics.  The songs don't come off as songs, but as conversations that the listener is eavesdropping in on.  Casual, nonchalant, and in some ways stoic, Berninger sings from the perspective of the lone wallflower trying to make the best of every situation, but sometimes falls short.<br /><br />The highlights include:  Squalor Victoria, Mistaken For Strangers, Guest Room, Racing Like A Pro, with special props going to Fake Empire (the last minute is sheer beauty), and my personal favorite, Slow Show.  The lyric, \\"You know I dreamed about you for 29 years before I saw you\\" is the best of 2007.<br /><br />I won't say that a new fan should start off with Boxer, I would recommend Alligator and maybe even Sad Songs For Dirty Lovers, but this album is one not to be ignored.

0143038583|5.0|This is a fascinating look at the food chain from a naturalist's perspective.  The book traces four meals back to their origin and includes sections on industrial farming, organic food, and hunting and gathering.  One interesting tidbit in a book filled with them is this:  of the 45,000 items in a supermarket, more than a quarter contain corn.  Statistics say that when the average American sits down to eat, each ingredient has traveled at least 1,500 miles.  This book tries to get us to think about what we are putting in our mouths, and just how thoughtless we have become about what we feed ourselves.
B000I9YX06|5.0|La verdad es que esta pel&iacute;cula representa bastante bien a Will Smith. No es la octava maravilla, pues ya ha habido pel&iacute;culas tratando el tema de la rebeli&oacute;n de las m&aacute;quinas ante los hombres. \\"I robot\\" es una pel&iacute;cula futurista con bastante acci&oacute;n. Te mantiene entretenido y en ning&uacute;n momento me pareci&oacute; aburrida. Bien gastados esos d&oacute;lares en esta pel&iacute;cula. No es una pel&iacute;cula de culto, sino de entretenimiento. Lo m&aacute;s importante: es para toda la familia. &iexcl;Qu&eacute; m&aacute;s pueden pedir! No les cuento la trama, pues la pueden ver en el resumen.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Leave it to hollywood to simultaneously mess up the wolf man, dracula, mr hyde and frankenstein.  anybody that enjoyed these super villians in past films will hate this movie. yes it's that bad. however younger audiences will revel in the over done special effects that alone can not save this super hyped and poorly cast dredge of a film.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Were it not for the moving and brilliant \\"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\\" then this surely would rank as my favourite film of 2007. Although borrowing from films such as 2001 and Event Horizon, Sunshine expands these ideas and forms it's own originality and mood. Great acting and music and a thinking persons script. The ending will surely alienate some viewers but will enthrall those looking for something deeper than the the typical messages found in a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay film. Absolutely recommended.
0765318741|5.0|I first read this book many years ago as a teenager.  It left a very long lasting impression of what it means to be utterly isolated and completely alone.  A terrifying prospect for most of us.  Throw in the fact that you are completely surrounded by souless former human beings, and it becomes an unbearable premise.  Richard Matheson pioneered this concept in literature to great effect.  Witness the number of similar books that have been written since.  Not to mention the three (that I am aware of) film renditions:  The Last Man On Earth, with Vincent Price, The Omega Man, with Charlton Heston, and now the first film to actually bear the title of the book. I look forward to the new film.  Although I'm not sure Will Smith was the right casting choice.  We'll see.  At one time Arnold Schwarzeneger had planned to film and star in another remake!  That would have been an interesting signature film for his acting career.  In any case.  This book still has the ability to chill and make one feel the unbearable loneliness of the protaganist. It also evokes the atmosphere, quite effectively, of an empty (of humanity), lonely world.  New fans of this genre should find this book affecting and entertaining, if somewhat dated.  (It was written in 1953 after all!) I recommend it highly.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I purchased this game last Christmas for my 9 year old nephew.  The first time it was played , my nephew and my 14 year old daughter faced off.  Both kids are very bright and I was curious to see what their reaction to it would be.  It had instant appeal with both of them.  I wound up playing with them for the second game, and liked it so much I purchased a travel edition.  It is now Christmas a year later and I am back to purchase the Trigon edition for a family board game.  I think that any game that can incorporate family interaction plus challenge players to think the way this one does is well worth the price.
0143038419|1.0|I beg of you, do not waste your valuable time on this book.  The author's unparallelled self-absorbtion is entirely understandable in light of the fact that she was trying to work through a serious depression, but do you really want to spend your time listening to her analyze the minutiae of her daily life? B-O-R-I-N-G.  There were only one or two insightful, interesting paragraphs in the whole book.  I suffered my own existential crisis reading it because I could not understand how it became a best-seller - how could I be so out of touch with my fellow readers?  Spare yourself this pain.
1400079179|5.0|Robert Langdon is just an ordinary symbologist out giving lectures in France, having a fulfilling life. All was normal, until one night he was thrown in the middle of the oddest investigation ever. Then, while attempting to escape the law, he embarks on a search for the legendary Holy Grail. With the Help of Sophia Nevue and clues form the dead will Langdon escape the law and find the Holy Grail? Find out in The Da Vinci Code by: Dan Brown.<br />This book is a must read by all. It is full of action and adventure that you can only get from this book. Page one starts out with a murder, which is not seen very often in books. Afterward, one might find the book slow, but if you stick with it, it gets much better. I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie because, in general, I have found books less appealing after watching the movie. Watching the movie first will give you the plot and the ending, so you might not want to spend the time to read the book and what really happened, for the movie wasn't 100% accurate. Although The Da Vinci Code delves into religion somewhat, I found that it interesting to the unreligious, and I found nothing offensive in it to the religious. Half of the story takes place in France, so there are some French words used, but they are either directly translated, or the meaning is hinted on by what is being said before and afterward. The book is fictional. But some things in it are accurate, but all-in-all the topic was well researched by the author. In the beginning, before the prologue, it is written what is true in the book. The book shouldn't be read by anyone under 14 years of age, because some of the parts are too detailed and shouldn't be read by younger audiences. I have read another book that delved into religion, and it could have been found offensive, so I acknowledge Dan Brown for creating a great tale. The subject of a modern grail quest isn't written on often or in this kind of detail; so that is why I rate this book a solid ten out of ten, for its creative and original idea, great writing style and its easy to follow plot. Read it, it's well worth the time.a solid ten out of ten, for its creative and original idea, great writing style and its easy to follow plot. Read it, it's well worth the time.

044661758X|5.0|Four years ago, Harry Bosch was part of a task force assigned to find a brutal sexual serial killer known as \\"The Dollmaker\\". In the course of following a hot lead, faced with one of those terrifying life-or-death decisions that all police officers fear may eventually come their way, Bosch was forced to use lethal force and shot a completely naked, unarmed Norman Church. Despite subsequent forensic investigation having proved that Church was \\"The Dollmaker\\" and an internal police investigation that cleared the night's work as a \\"good shooting\\", Bosch is now stunned to find himself in court as the defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging improprieties from improper entry to excessive use of police force seeking millions of dollars in punitive damages. What's even worse is that his inept city-appointed defense attorney is squared off against the awesome court experienced power of well-known civil rights attorney \\"Money\\" Chandler, who has yet to meet the stone that she couldn't squeeze blood out of!<br /><br />During Bosch's trial the police department receives a note that discloses the location of a body buried in the concrete foundation of a burned out pool hall. The nature of the note and the state of the buried blonde corpse seem to suggest that The Dollmaker, far from being dead, is in fact alive and well and continuing to kill with sadistic sexual abandon. Faced with the possibility that Norman Church never was \\"The Dollmaker\\" and that Bosch shot an innocent unarmed bystander who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, things are looking mighty bleak for the outcome of his trial. But - Bosch is Bosch, after all - and in the unwavering conviction that his actions that night were not only justified but completely correct, Bosch investigates the possibility of a copycat killer that he nicknames \\"The Follower\\". The hunt is on! If Bosch can't find the new killer before the jury begins deliberations on his trial, he'll almost certainly see the end of his career as a homicide detective in LAPD.<br /><br />Michael Connelly is undoubtedly today's acknowledged master in the crafting of thrilling police procedural novels. And this provides the entr&eacute;e, as it were, in \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" banquet. But Connelly serves up the gustatory delights of some cleverly conceived side dishes, aperitifs and deserts as well ... stirring courtroom drama, insight into the nature of internal police politics, a warmly realistic love story that exemplifies the difficulties and worries that must face the spouse of a police officer every single day of their lives, a down and dirty close up essay on the realities of the skin flick industry and, of course, a continuing character study on Hieronymus Bosch, who has to be one of the most interesting literary characters for whom pen was ever put to paper.<br /><br />If there's any weakness in Connelly's Harry Bosch series yet, I certainly don't know what it might be!

B00079HZUM|5.0|Some people may not realize that those lovely female roles the Bard immortalized were at first brought to life by male actors.  Ned Kynason (Billy Crudup) was one such actor and the top of his form til King Charles declared that women should play women's roles.      I thought when I came into this that I'd be cheering the women on, but I couldn't quite do that.  \\"Stage Beauty\\" presents both sides of the story with such compassion it's hard not to see how wrenching the whole situation is.    As Ned says---playing women's roles gave pretty men something to hope for.  He spent years under a relentless master, deleting every male gesture from his person.  He truly believed that the true challenge of acting was for a man to play a woman.      Yet, there is Maria (Danes), the dresser to the great man who longs to play Desdemona herself.  What hope is she to have save as a dresser and mender of Ned's fine gowns?  When she 'borrows' Ned's pillow and gown and plays Desdemona illegally, she sets off a chain of events that reverses the trend of English theatre.    And why shouldn't it be so?  After all, \\"Paris had women actors for years.\\"      \\"Stage Beauty\\" has so many great lines, you could spend an afternoon just going back to the good scenes.  Costuming, acting, everything was spot on.      I had only intended to rent this film, but I'm adding it to my Wish List and will eventually own it for my collection.  It's that good and that well worth watching again.

B000NA1XSA|5.0|If you are someone who listened to the Beatles in their heyday, this look at the recording process will remove a bit of the fantasy and romance. The studio drudgery is well described, as is the fighting and tension that marked the band's last few years and albums. No one really wanted to work with them, according to this book. George comes off as almost hopeless in being unable to nail his solos. Ringo was detached. John was erratic, then stoned, then just angry. Paul was affable and the most interested in the recording process. Even George Martin gets a bit raked in this book, pictured as something less than the legend would have it. It's probably a somewhat warped view, but even taken with a grain of salt, it remains an account you won't be able to put down.
B000HZHPSS|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It has everything.  The late Jerry Goldsmith did a wonderful job with the score for this film.  Its one of my favorite Star Trek themes.  It has awesome bad guys in the Borg.  Not the Borg lite from the TNG episode Descent, but evil mean Borg and the queen.    I loved James Cromwell in this film.  He was completely believable as Zefram Cochrane.  Johnathan Frakes did an incredible job of putting this film together.  Its my favorite of all the TNG films.

0061547832|1.0|These books are a dime a dozen.  I read this in a few sessions and each session of reading I was more predictable than the last.  Do what you love to do, work hard, take risks, study, learn from others, don't back down when times get rough, learn from others mistakes. Which is one of the most  important lessons the books tells of, I'm teaching you from my mistake of buying this book.  There I summed the entire book up for you, don't waste your time unless you want to read brag sessions from two men who are wealthy. I am in no way taking from Trump's or the Learning Annex guy's experiences they are tremendous businessmen, we all know that. I would love to have them mentor me, who wouldn't however this book does not teach you anything you do not already know. Seriously, if you are looking for motivation, take a real college course, look for a mentor, DO NOT fall for this trap. It could be that I'm jealous I'm not making a ton of cash for writing about my successes and spewing common sense, if I had a known name like Trump that I could piggy back on I would too. Awesome for them, the money pours...     This was one big brag session by the authors, which is fine, congratulations to them for such amazing businesses, again common knowledge, who doesn't know Trump is a billionaire and had some hard times, who doesn't know that the Learning Annex is successful, heck it was mentioned in the show 'Sex and the City' you know you've made when you get that type of publicity.  This book could have been and should have been much more informative coming from such wise, successful businessmen, however it's just another way to build their bankroll, again which is fine, I fell for it. I wanted to learn.    Granted I have a MBA and own a small business myself, of course no where as successful as either of the authors and I know I need all the help I can get and I am looking to learn from anyone, of course from these two authors, which is one reason I thought this book may help me thatthese two amazing men may teach me...this book provided nothing but common sense business idioms and the authors personal success stories, period.     The book pushes the Learning Annex \\"Wealth Building Seminars\\". Which makes sense, this book will get hundreds of thousand of people to attend now, it's not worth it. I went to one in Los Angeles, long before this book ever came out, I went last March. It was two days of being inundated with live late night infomercials marketing a variety very expensive products masked as wealth building seminars in which you have a choice of many different wealth building seminars to sit in throughout the day. All of which end with about 45 minutes of selling you the real program, a few days training for thousands of dollars. I'm not saying the training isn't worth the thousands you'll pay, some of the mini sales \\"seminars\\" taught me enough to think I needed to buy the rest, great sales people and motivational speakers give these speeches. I personally spoke, and this is no exaggeration, to nearly 100 people (out of the 50+K who were there over the course of the two days) who spent near and over 10k a few over 25k on real estate and various other get rich programs which included many DVD's and more seminars to go to. Many of which could not afford to spend this much, but they did, they have financing. I'm not hurting for money so I didn't feel all that bad spending 9k on a program that I got sucked in to a very good speaker (I thought I was thick skinned). I've ventured in real estate thought this guy's program could take it to the next level. I felt the same as a majority of everyone else who was there did about this and many other programs. After I listened and watched the 6 DVD's and traveled to the seminar training location, I was presented with another three day marketing ploy to get me to attend the \\"real\\" training that will really push my wealth building over the edge for an additional 25k! I was furious, this was nearly whatI paid for two years of college for three days of \\"training\\"! I pushed until I got my money back, thank goodness. Wish I could have my money back for this book.     Congratulations to these gentlemen on having such a solid following of people who will pay all their savings after being pumped up by many charismatic speakers, they are good. I heard these exact same stories at the conference. True be told, I know nothing about real estate, I paid as  I said 9k for a worthless training by a big name from this seminar, I took a $75 course at the local community college and learned more in this course than any 9k or 25k seminar. If you buy this book you'll know that Trump is rich as is the Learning Annex guy and you'll read a few stories of how they got rich, that's it.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Quentin Tarantino's style is cool and I really love the references to great movies of the past but this movie was more about how the movie is made than what it's about. Stunt-man Kurt added class to the movie. The girls were hot but in the end Kurt wimps and the girls get ugly. Worth seeing but only barely. Bonus features are interesting. It's heart breaking to see so many 70's era cars destroyed.  I wept for the Challenger.<br /><br />On this whole boycott thing....get over it. They can sell it how they want. If you personally don't like it.....DON'T BUY IT.
0743277457|2.0|Despite the most excellent title and a glowing quotation from Robert Pirsig, the book fails to deliver.  This book is 95% biographical information about Mr. Waitzkin and only 5% about synthesizing these experiences into an approach for learning. And even that 5% is more for elite competitive kinds of disciplines.  If you are pursuing excellence and creativity in science or language learning, this book will not help you. I give it two stars for some entertaining stories about the author's life.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|A visually stunning, plot-less waste of time. The story should have been interesting but the trailers were much more entertaining than the movie. The whole premise could have made a great movie. As it stands, you spend the entire movie thinking of other things. It just won't hold your attention. This movie is not worth $5 let alone the $20 I paid for it.

Oh yes, there are too many insurance exec's making tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars each year under the current plan to even think about change. The insurance companies will raise our premiums, by what ever amount it will take, to raise enough money to lobby Washington to keep the same system. If it's $100,000,000,000 - they'll spend it and we'll pay, pay, and pay somemore.<br /><br />Michael, Great movie and keep up the good work for America!<br /><br />Thanks for all your work in the Traverse City area.

0486283577|5.0|As the book's name suggests, it has patterns from the \\"turn of the century\\". More specifically, from 1890 to 1896.<br /><br />The first three pages run over how to graph out a pattern, take your measurements, and adjust the pattern to fit. Basic knowledge of sewing, and a familiarity with patterns is a must. Or at the very least, you need to be a daring new sewer that isn't intimidated by challenges. The instructions are informative but brief.<br /><br />Each pattern has a fashion etching in black and white to illustrate the design it's based on. The etching shows trims and accessories. There is a diagram for each style that lays out all the pattern pieces needed to create it. All the measurements are listed in inches. They are clear and easy to read.<br /><br />There are 31 womens patterns : included are numerous sleeve layouts like two part coat, leg-o-mutton, 2 part leg-o-mutton, different fullnesses of sleeve. Several styles of skirt, one draped like the previous bustle decade, mostly three or five gore skirts, umbrella skirt. There are different collar styles, bodices cut in both princess and darted. A cape and coat pattern, etc. There is one nightgown pattern.<br /><br />There are 21 misses and girls costumes. They cover the same span of years. There are dresses appropriate to very small children up to teens. There is one evening dress pattern for a girl of about 5-9. There is also one pattern for drawers and one for a chemise.<br /><br />There are two patterns for boys. Mainly young boys. One is a pants suit, so i assume that would be for post diaper age. The other is a kilt costume.<br /><br />There are three mens patterns. One nightshirt, dressing gown and coat. There is no picture of the coat.<br /><br />My count brings me to 57 patterns, I must have missed a couple somewhere. But hopefully this will give you a good idea of the book contents. I have made some of the dresses from this book. The patterns work out well, however to create a truly period looking garment you need more information than what this book gives you. The construction techniques and trimming methods are quite different from how most basic sewing is done today. It would help the beginner to have some hands on exposure to actual period garments. Mostly to see how they are lined, interlined, stiffened, boned, etc. In my experience, it is the linings and foundations that give the finished product it's form. The outer image of the costume is merely floating on that foundation. This book does not cover foundations sewing techniques at all. But with some hands on antique garment experience, you could easily create an authentic looking dress from this book.k gives you.

B0008JIJ2E|5.0|The Karate Kid, starring Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Martin Kove<br /><br />I had watched this entertaining movie during the late eighties or probably the early nineties when it was first released to the movie theatres.<br /><br />Subsequently, I had watched it several times on cable television, as well from videos.<br /><br />I had recently watched it again from a DVD, as I thought it offered wonderful life lessons.<br /><br />First of all, it had a very straight-forward story.<br /><br />A young boy, Danny (Ralph Macchio) & his mother had relocated from the East to Los Angeles. In search of new friends, he bumped into a bunch of ruffians from a local martial arts school.<br /><br />Naturally, there was also this beautiful lady (played by Elizabeth Shue), whose deliberate presence in the movie seemed to complicate matters for him.<br /><br />During one painful encounter with the ruffians, he was beaten up, but luckily was eventually rescued by an elderly handyman, Miyagi (Pat Morita), working in his apartment complex. Miyagi seemed to be well versed in unarmed combat.<br /><br />Intrigued, Danny wanted to learn martial arts from Miyagi, even though he discovered than the old man was more adept in clipping bonsai trees & catching flies with chopsticks.<br /><br />Miyagi reluctantly took Danny on & immediately delegated him to carry out a host of domestic chores, like sanding the floor decks, cleaning/polishing the cars & painting the fences. Unwittingly, they sparked off some sort of a father-son relationship.<br /><br />These apparently inconsequential activities certainly reminded me of those compulsory routines, like sweeping floors, chopping wood & carrying water, that were often carried out by young disciplines of the Shaolin Temple in ancient China.<br /><br />Danny was obviously very disappointed.<br /><br />The story continued with Danny's quest to take part in the local martial arts tournament.<br /><br />What I like about this movie is the valuable lessons it offers to young people in search of their personal vision.<br /><br />In this case, Danny wanted to become a martial arts champion.<br /><br />For an instructor, Miyagi was obviously an unorthodox master. He taught Danny, to his chagrin, how to envision success by asking him to trim a bonsai tree.<br /><br />The old man said: \\"Just trim the tree!\\"<br /><br />Danny replied, \\"What if I don't do it right?\\"<br /><br />The old man told him: \\" Close your eyes, picture a tree, & then, as soon as you have the tree, think of nothing else. Open your eyes & trim the bonsai tree to match the picture.\\"<br /><br />Once again, Danny replied: \\"How do I know it is going to be right?\\"<br /><br />The old man responded gleefully: \\"If it comes from inside you, it is right!\\"<br /><br />It began to dawn on Danny that the real secret to martial arts laid in the mind & the heart, & not in the fists.<br /><br />Once he realised the lessons he had learned from Miyagi - the hard way -, Danny became empowered & went on to beat the hell out of his seemingly stronger opponent in the martial arts tournament.<br /><br />The fight sequences, especially the ending segment, in the movie were beautifully as well spectacularly choreographed, but the principal message of the movie was very clear:<br /><br />The compelling vision of where you want to go & the vivid image of achievement come from deep inside you!martial arts champion.

B000YAF4OS|4.0|Remember reading on the back of a dvd cover or hearing in a movie trailer \\"with the most shocking ending ever\\"?  Well for once, finally, that phrase truly does apply to this movie.    The film starts off pretty basic with a glimpse into David Drayton's (Thomas Jane) home art studio.  Now, only the most observant horror fans will note that one of the pictures we are shown, hanging on his wall, is an exact picture of the dvd and vhs cover from the classic move \\"The Thing\\", starring Kurt Russell, one of my all time favorite horror films.  So, this threw me, at first.  I thought he was some kind of person involved in horror films, and was thrown off the mark in the wrong direction.    Then this storm rolls in, a tree plows through Drayton's studio window, and as the family come outside the next day to survey the damage, they see an eerie mist, hanging back along the lake they live on.  He and his son go to town to buy clean-up supplies, and, basically, the entire movie then occurs in this store, with quite a number of other shoppers, as they barricade themselves inside in fear of the mist that has surrounded the store, and evidently, the entire town and beyond.    When the first encounter with the mist occurs, what is shown is, frankly, a silly looking octopus type of leg.  One of my friend's who was with me commented \\"okay, this is gonna be dumb.\\"  I, too, was then somewhat dismayed at the sight of that leg.  Again, because of that, I was taken in yet another different direction.    Then the movie takes on a totally different tone, of who believes me and who doesn't, as people take sides.  We see just how insane and crazy people act when forced into situations of entrapment, powerlessness, and plain old fashioned being scared.    The actors on this film did a wonderful job, in particular the crazy Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden).  This is a very verbal film for perhaps 90 minutes straight.    When a few people do finally manage to escape, what they see and encounter beyond is just thrilling, gorey, weird, and very cold feeling, in particular the scene in which they are driving along some road and see a very, very tall creature in the mist.  It just makes you realize how far-encompassing this overall thing really is.    Even though the ending is very, very depressing, I said to myself, you know, for once a movie ended the way it really should have, and keeps you wondering \\"why?\\"  Definitely a great, true horror film, and a rare one with great actors and performances.
B000WAGVHE|4.0|High definition versions of Hairspray, the new (2007) version with Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad, John Travolta in drag as her mother, and Christopher Walken as her father are (sadly for this HD DVD fan) available in Blu-ray only currently.<br /><br />I had seen the older version years ago, but couldn't remember any of it.  My wife loved the new version of movie in the theatre. She saw it with friends of the African-American persuasion who were somewhat shocked by some early sequences in the movie, but they came around as the movie kept going.<br /><br />The film looked great on Blu-ray, nice, bright and colorful throughout. Some excellent effects in spots (the Harry Potter talking -- in this case singing -- picture effect as an example). If you like Musicals, this version is very entertaining. If you hate musicals, then skip it. Worth owning if you are a John Waters fan, but personally I rate it a 4/5 star rental as I just can't see myself rewatching this one enough times to justify space in my own video collection. People that love musicals should definitely make the space though :-)
B00005ASOI|5.0|I had only seen a couple of Dario Argento's films (Tenebre and Opera) and having heard about him from various sources was delighted to hear that they were having a \\"argento film festival\\" in my City (Melbourne). Finally, I got to see the much heard of \\"Susperia\\" and on the big screen as well! It was not a let-down. Although the films have not really aged that well (with some of the dialogue being so unintenentertaining funny the audience were in stitches).<br /><br />Despite the fact that some of his films have not aged well in some regards, they remain vastly entertaining and the horror aspect is second to none; Susperia is no exception.<br /><br />Much has been said of the lighting in this film, but it really is brillian. Goblin's soundtrack adds as much to a horror movie as any horror score I've heard (with perhaps the Omen beating it).<br /><br />The story is really secondary to the athestics, I've heard Dario in interviews say that he's not a fan of actors and really is not bothered by their performances and it shows sometimes in his films but I found the acting fine here but the set-pieces really make his movies worth seeing. What a great mind he has (he say's he merely rights down his nightmeres and turns them into scripts).<br /><br />Highly recommended to all true horror fans out their (not you PG-13 loving hollywood only types though).
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is the kind of album you can get lost inside of. It became a world in my mind. This album changed the way I listen to music.    I really recommend kicking back when you're under the influence of something and listening to this album the whole way through on good headphones.
B000KRNG5E|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing Dario Argento's Inferno. As part of a film festival it really had impact on the big screen. Although not the masterpiece that Susiria invariably is, Inferno is a great second part of his trilogy (the third film released next year).<br /><br />There are some great set-pieces in this one and who will ever forget the scene with the cats! The audience were laughing their heads of at the stilted dialogue but that all really adds to the experience rather than taking away from it. Better than most of the Hollywood horror's being churned out today, Inferno will thrill, chill and maybe make you laugh.
B0000508U6|5.0|This album is a work of art. Listen to it when you want to relax and escape.
1595141715|5.0|13 Reasons Why is a book to read in one sitting, with tissues close at hand.  we've all been there, on both sides of the story--we've all been crushed by someone who didn't care about us, and we've also all been too busy, self-absorbed, or crabby to be there for someone else.  seeing this book as a split-screen story was so painful.  i do hope that this book can open discussions on feeling lonely and isolated (or worse) and prevent more tragedies.
B000TENE6Y|5.0|The writer of the previous review is correct. Music is an art and a science. A science because it can be written down into a formula and re-created in a different part of the world to the same results. But music is also an art. A work of art is anything that creates an aestetic feeling to someone. In the past where I live in Utah, nude art exhibits that are highly acclaimed in every other part of the world have been considered porn by the Ellen Jamesian majority that live here, and have been forced to close and move on. Art is and always will be highly subjective. It evokes a feeling even if that feeling is one of anger. It is a wide and varied world we live on and there is room for everyone's opinion. Even mine.
B000001FS6|3.0|You know, there was a time when I really hated U2's more \\"Americanized\\" phase. This is basically the work they did in the mid and late '80s in particular and I always felt at once like it was ill-fated and arrogant. I hadn't yet touched this album, either. And then later on I recognized some of it wasn't bad at all. [[ASIN:B000001FS3 The Joshua Tree]] was the greatest thing the guys had done by the point it was out but for awhile I always was more into the post-punk early records and the electronic later work, and some of the new stuff too. The band has shown though that they can pull that type of thing off and that it's really even entertaining at times. Most U2 stuff is.    I heard a lot of bad rap about the album. So when I found it recently for only FIVE bucks used, I was somewhat skeptical. Only \\"somewhat\\" because I was aware of \\"All I Want Is You\\" which is one of my favorite U2 songs and \\"Desire\\" and \\"Angel of Harlem\\" were pretty good songs as well.    I don't really consider this a studio album, if that makes any sense. It's a compilation of sorts, with some being live and some studio, and two interludes that technically aren't even U2. There's enough studio work to make a long EP or a short album, which the album could have done if that was what they wanted to. And also it may have been more effective with the length. Although I would have liked less of the gospel choir in the song I otherwise found the live \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" to be fantastic, and the live \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" is pretty well done as well. Although not included I think they could have put a version of something like \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" since the song itself sounds like something that would appear on here. They also do a B-side and a cover, but those are both awfully performed on here. \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Silver and Gold\\" have better versions available and the commentary on both of those songs is pretty embarassing.    Not really perfect. Also, there's other ill-fated moments like the failed John Lennon response song \\"God, Part II.\\" Its intentions were probably good but everything else about the song is just failed, in general. Oh, the live \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" wasn't special either, not on par with Dylan and especially not as good as the Hendrix version. Speaking of which one of those \\"interludes\\" I mentioned was his rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" probably the band's nod to Americanism, but I don't mind since it's a cool rendition. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" (which inspired the project's name) isn't really my favorite but it's about as good performed live as it is on \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"    Oh, and \\"All I Want Is You\\" is just an amazing way to close the album. It's probably the song that makes the record worth owning, with a very emotional performance that shows they were pretty good with the more personal songs as well. \\"Desire\\" is the really big single from the album and is nice to listen to even now. More of a western feel than most of it but not bad. \\"Angel of Harlem\\" is a nice melodic piece reminiscent of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" even if not particularly special.    A lot of the album is really in between. It's an interesting record, though. For example you do get one song with the Edge on the vocals and it's a pretty decent song, too (\\"Van Diemen's Land\\"). The only studio song that was really pretty bad was \\"Hawkmoon 269\\"; I guess it's just too bad that one was on the earlier half of the record.    This record is definitely not for everyone and it's a mixed bag in pretty much any definition of the term, but I recommend this to people who are willing to get into more U2. As a guy who wasn't conceived until a few months following \\"Joshua Tree\\"'s release, there's some younger fans who may seek this. It goes in all directions but if you don't mind any of the types of songs that are in here even in spite my warnings I suggest you give it a try and you may enjoy it.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie is probably the most true to the story as anything ever done. That is saying a lot when one considers how many copies of this story is out there. The characters actually quote parts of the book. Of course the typical cynical muppets humor is there. Gonzo says, \\" I knew that because I am the narrator. I am omni present\\". That is just one example amon many they work in.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|Look, I love QOTSA. I haven't heard the debut album but the three records after that were all excellent and had a great playback value. I don't consider those perfect but even the flaws were very far and few between on those records.    I had some fairly high expectations as well. I was FLOORED when I heard the single \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" and found it very intriguing. I especially liked the guitar during the chorus as well. I wasn't expecting a full album of that song but hoped the rest would be similarly good.    But it really isn't very good. There are some good songs here, like \\"Make It Wit Chu\\" and to a lesser extent \\"Misfit Love,\\" but I don't like having to spend time listening to songs that go NOWHERE, and that's exactly what happens on this record. I don't know how a listener could continually sit through \\"Into the Hollow\\" but I guess tastes really are subjective, and I don't like it. The bad isn't embarassing but really kind of irritating still. I don't like listening to songs where the ideas drag as I mentioned and I've repeatedly listened to these songs hoping that they'd grow on me. They haven't.    If you're a casual or new fan I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you're a fan you probably will buy or have it. And at least the packaging is top-notch, the best I've seen this year. That's something clever that I actually did care for at least once around.
B000ZHDBBI|1.0|Offering the album on a USB drive is a neat gimmick, but for a hundred bucks this is just ridiculous.  You can buy the album for 10 bucks, a 1 gig USB drive for under 10 bucks... so we're supposed to pay $80 for stickers?    Give me a break!
B000GBEWHA|2.0|\\"Grease\\" has passed into our shared American experience, and who among us cannot sing along to its justifiably famous songs?  But seeing the movie as a child in the theater is much different than watching it as an adult.  The last time I watched it, the TV channel provided commentary on a crawl at the bottom of the screen, and the two crucial, gaping flaws with the movie finally crystallized.<br /><br />First, the age of the actors.  God bless `em, but they were WAY too old to be high schoolers.  Stockard Channing was 33, or nearly twice the age of her character.  Ms Newton-John was 29.  Now, I'm not asking for perfect verisimilitude in a movie, but you can't violate my willing suspension of disbelief so obviously.<br /><br />The second problem is the location of the school.  The T-Birds look like a classic Long Island / New Jersey type gang, similar to the Lords of Flatbush, complete with the accents.  But the school has palm trees waving in the background, and the final race, as almost anyone who has watched any movie made in America can tell you, takes place in the L.A. River basin.  It creates an inconsistent and inauthentic setting.
B000VBP382|5.0|I bought this item even though I already have a copy. This one's different in that you get to have the soundtrack, 2 dvds (widescreen and fullscreen) that include new special features plus a book that guides you through the process on how this film was made. It truly is a collector's item. It's pleasantly surprising in a way because I'm a fan of the book and the film. I've watched it countless times. It's one of those films that I love watching when I feel blue and it refreshes me and brings me back to the \\"real world\\" in a better mood. This movie will make you believe in \\"happily ever after.\\"
1400063515|4.0|The Black Swan author, Mr. Taleb is a very funny man.  He has a great sense of humor and it shows through in his writing.  Most of the good stuff in this book is in his rambling departures away from the actual subject of the book.  As for the actual theories expounded in his book, they seem to make perfect sense, although writing about uncertainties is fraught with well, uncertainties.  The book could have easily used half the number of pages to discuss the main points, but then, I would have missed all those amusing rambling departures.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|Great CD. Saw them Live in Berkeley and it takes me back to the show eveytime I listen to it.  It was the best show I have seen. Very upset with amazon on this one. I have had this on Pre order for over 2 months and it now is out of stock. WTF?
0385751532|5.0|I feel at some point all children and there parents should read this book.  It is easy reading and the book pulls you in.  I felt like I was walking throw the life of the charicters shoes.  Great book!!!
0802130208|5.0|The book was a fun read, and there were times that I was laughing out loud.  Some of my favorite characters were (of course) Ignatius, Jones and Myrna (her \\"sex solves everything\\" mentality cracks me up).    I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|While not one of my favorites as a Disney movie lover/collector this is a good movie and fun to watch. This movie is more for the teenagers to sit and watch. The voice/character of Eddy Murphy was a great choice for an dragon with an attitude. Fun to watch.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|As an educated scientist, I find Al Gore's analysis and misrepresentations offensive. It couldn't be more obvious that he's using his political skills to make complete suckers out of a very large non-scientific audience. It's not as though we can reasonably chalk up his campaign and the problems it creates to innocent error driven by good intention either. Behind this very serious politically driven environmental campaign are some extremely sinister motives defined by supporters of dictatorship and oppression. I urge any of his current supporters to begin paying more attention to the majority of scientists and their entirely credible representatives who have entered the public discussion to help educate the public. And - for crying out loud - get this junk out of the schools and deprogram the children who have already been exposed to it.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|I love Disney and the movies that are produced by them. Jungle Book will always be one of my favorites. Buy it and enjoy a classic. Phil Harris as Balou (sp) is a classic in it's own.
1582701709|1.0|I was shocked to find some people around me after watching or reading the video got in deep trouble with money, personal affairs, or health aspect by not being concerned with the realities of life that I am compelled to write this grave review.     It should be noted that The Secret was based on the ideas written in the early 1900s by Wallace Wattles in his book, The Science of Getting Rich. Of course he did become prosperous, more from his writing than anything else. But his positive thoughts didn't save his life by not being concerned with the realities of life. He lived to be 51 years of age, two years after his death did the book was published. I guess positive thoughts helped his prosperity, but what is wrong with this? He didn't take care of his health. Only positive thoughts cannot do without proper health care.    While having positive thoughts are helpful, and I am not saying it is not. It is the positive goals that we should actually strived and protect that vision. Removing the facets of \\"we cannot do this\\", \\"we should not do this\\", and finding ways around this is a good idea in any venture of life. As to those I have known suffered deeply and now are hopelessly in debt or deathbed, which didn't happen before The Secret, the idea  was that \\"trouble would never happen\\" with positive thoughts. The Law of Attraction was religion and suffering now was that he didn't use it hard enough. It's bad to rationalize. A proper thought was what we should do to protect them from not happening instead of allowing it to happen of such misfortune would be a much more proper thoughts. For those who understand the Ancient Eastern Energy Flows and medicine, if we focus on things external to ourself, there is a chance we will get them, but higher spiritual plane is one thing, a reality plane we should take care of it too. If those energies were misdirected toward money and materialism, which is somewhat frowned by Eastern energy medicine, our energy focus is on materialism tobe tradeoff with our own health. If our energy focus were on our health and our own spiritual awakening, there is a tradeoff to remove materialism. You simply can't have spiritual awakening in light of a material focus either. Oil and water don't mix.    It is this very concept that there is a possibility that Wallace Wattles forgot about his health in exchange for material wealth, but the realities of life is another dimension we need to take care of too, not just the spiritual plane. Spiritual can't exists on materialism, and health are connected with spiritual integration, but materialism is external to ourself. Realities won't make a best seller book, and I wrote a book on such things but couldn't sell a single copy, and has since been lost.     While the thought \\"The Secret\\" is not a secret after all. The ancient masters never really kept this idea a secret, it's the marketing of the book and video that gives us this impression that it is intentionally kept secret. This gives the impression that this book was something of \\"value\\", a propaganda ploy sometimes used by huckster. Just read the book The Power of Persuasion.     The people in the video is not without perfection, one Australian in the video that was interviewed is actually in debt from his enormous house he built and is considered by local Australian television media as a scam on his stock advisory business where people put up money for investment ventures and the money was never returned and promises were broken. It should be noted that some people who have written books on how to be rich motivational books became rich from writing those books, not that other areas of his own life anyway. It might be the same with the secret foundation that was set up in Australia, where making video and the books from The Secret made the authors rich, not from their own personal life either, but from selling promises. It's the problem with some MLM, luring sales with being wealthy and forgetting the product, wherein reality the ones who actually make the money, and you can check their Income Tax Revenue Service on this for confirmation, it is the owners of MLM that are actually raking the money. Napoleon Hill made money from just this very premise. It is for us to decide whether promises to be rich, or our own actions decide the outcome of our own lives.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|If you are a big fan of Disney and enjoy animation this is a must. It is about the inner spirit in each one of us. It is funny and a very good movie for families to enjoy and spend time together.
1401207529|5.0|this is the best comic book i have ever read. it is far more than just a super hero story, but an in-depth crime drama.  this book reminds me more of the movie Serpico or other crooked cop stories.  james gordon in this is in my top 5 characters of any story, comic, book, or movie.  just great.
B000PFUA9G|3.0|Again I will admit that my wife is the bigger fan of Country Music. I like Brad Paisley and enjoy his music. We purchased a cd with his Christmas recordings and it is great cd to listen to and enjoy. He has alot of fun with his peers and contemporaries. Give him a chance and listen to this CD if haven't already. You might just like his voice and style.

B00005JPNW|3.0|.....I have not read the books so I am not sure as to how well the transition went. However as a movie the jist I got was that its about an orphan girl in an alternate universe, wear peoples souls are on display outside their bodies in the form of an animal they call a daemon.  The State is controlled by The Authority that is apparently a semi religious order, children are disappearing, no one is to talk of \\"dust\\", there is a race of warrior polar bears who talk, gyptians which are a cross between gypsies/pirates and witches.  The girl has been raised at a college where her uncle does research and when he goes away to the north for futher research into the dust the girl is kidnapped, he is hunted and the chase is on from there.    .....I gotta admit that this is a a rollercoaster ride of a film and it looks technologically nifty but there are some rough patches in the editing when someone is taken and then others are hot on her heels to save her but you don't know how they figured out where to go.  In addition a large world is built for you but you never see the real people and therefore are not sure how they would really react to the Authorities grand plan considering it would be orchestrated on their children in the end and would steal from them something that every parent has spent their entire lives tied to.  It just feels like a few pieces of the puzzle are missing and unintentionally so.  While rarely a proponent for longer films it really dis seem like the Studio cut 10-15 minutes of transitional scenes, explanation and character development.  If not the studios then the director, who has no prior experience on big budget, speciall effects films, simply wasn't up to the task.  .....Still it is a fun film though pretty violent and scary for little kids.  When the bear appears to get his jaw knocked off I was pretty surprised.  Kid torture, animial torture, etc. don't take the under 10 crowd unless they have been desensitized.    .....As to the whole anti religion thing, I see hints of it in the film but then again I am looking for it and am fairly well read but otherwise it seems harmless enough that organized religion should give it a rest.
B000YKFJ66|4.0|We really enjoyed the film.  Cage is a great actor and while the story-line is far fetched....it has all the action, drama, and surprise ending that makes for a good night at the movies.  Enjoy....and notice the credits at the end......
B00005JPRZ|5.0|Director Frank Oz (The Stepford Wifes, What About Bob and the voice of Yoda in the Star Wars films) combined with the writing talent of Dean Craig (Lift, Dirty Little Secrets) have created one of the most unrelenting British comedy's that has been created in years. What I mean by `unrelenting' is the non-stop jokes and hilarious situations where the audience simply cannot stop laughing from start to finish. Death at a Funeral is an absolute riot.<br /><br />One could also propose that this film is a fine example of British black comedy that the British are famous for...<br /><br />Daniel (Matthew MacFayden) does a superb job as the son of his recently departed father, attempting to do the right thing while chaos explodes all around him.<br /><br />The film begins as the undertakers' bring the coffin to the home for the eulogy to find that they have brought the wrong body, having to rush back in time with the correct one.<br /><br />The successful novelist brother (Andrew Nyman) arrives from New York only to be complaining about first class air travel, and immediately commits a faux pas, sending his mother away in tears. Successful though selfish, he will not pay for half of the funeral expenses because of recently renovating his Manhattan penthouse.<br /><br />We see the sibling rivalry between the two: Daniel the want to be writer and Howard the successful one; however success does not necessarily equate to a good heart which Daniel has in abundance.<br /><br />A mysterious dwarf appears at the service who continually stares at Daniel until we find out about the little man's relationship with the deceased.<br /><br />The film picks up from here with a hallucinogen mistaken for valium and the antics of those affected by the drug only makes the entire afternoon a string of comedic errors and laugh-out-loud- antics.<br /><br />Absolutely the most hilarious film I've seen in 2007.<br /><br />A solid 5 stars.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Or so I think Bruce Says.  Anyways, the unrated version is, as I have said about other movies which have been chopped to PG-13, the de-facto gold/good version. In this case, its more John McClane, More action than I could have thought possible, and they top themselves in so many ways in all the cool stunts.This is really a ride  and a half in the un-rated version.John is all analogue age action hero, and the \\"side-kick\\", is a very unlikely Black Hat Hacker, with an ultra Cool appearance by Kevin Smith, this all combines for a total blast.The Fight Sequences around the Elevator shaft and IN the shaft are very nail-biting. This is a must see in 5.1  The Commentary is just on the PG13 Version but explains a lot and adds a lot to the movie experience, a very nice extra.    DVD Versions:  Careful what version you buy. It seems that the labelling on the first few US  batches has been messed up.The Single disc version clearly states that a Music Video and a Behind the Scenes is added, where-as the Double disc has this added feature on disc two. So, whats the story ? Hopefully someone will either sort the discs or proof the DVD covers. But, a minor   flaw.
B000QXDED6|2.0|Based on a Frank Miller comic book (graphic novel? Come on.), 300 is a gory depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans held a narrow pass against a huge Persian army until eventually being annihilated.  Their doomed stand against incredible odds has been told countless times as an example of heroism.  On another level, the tale is often retold when Westerners are rallied to hate Eastern \\"hordes.\\" The battle has often been disquieting to Western listeners because it extolls the heroism of the Spartans - a people who lived for little more than combat, and who almost constantly sparred with the revered Athenians. With its combination of militarism and anti-Easternism, this tale's time for retelling has come. 300 lauds the Spartan \\"warrior ethic\\" without irony, lovingly depicting the progression of children into efficient killers (a good wolf-impaling earns them an Eagle scout badge), and sneering at Athenians as \\"...philosophers and boy-lovers.\\" Paradoxically, it claims that the Spartans were the ancient upholders of \\"freedom\\" against Persian oppression. Decapitations and spritzes of blood are shown in slow-motion again and again to a snappy rock beat. It could be a good modern \\"Triumph of the Will\\" - it only needs an \\"I Want You!\\" recruiting poster after the scrolling credits to be complete.
B00005JPNW|1.0|The casting for this movie was fantastic; the acting was great, and everyone did a really good job. The special effects were even good...But if you're a huge fan of the book (like me) then I'm afraid you'll find this movie to be a disappointment...I was so sad after watching it; I had waited forever for it to come out, and then it hardly follows the plotline for the book at all. The ending was cliche as anything (kids all running out of Bolvanger while the facility blows up...what?!?!?!), and it wasn't supposed to end where it did. The movie rushed into everything and left out so much that was in the book.     I would have expected a lot better of New Line, especially with their good adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Finally everyone can be happy. I first saw Blade Runner back in the 80's. I really enjoyed the film. There is something different and engaging about the film. The look is also very original. I am a big fan of the original Theatrical cut that includes the narration and the upbeat ending. I am not sure why people like the version with no narration, adding a scene that might suggest Deckard is a replicant & cutting off the upbeat ending. The narration and the original ending make the film a classic. Without them I would take a star away. Anyway I will watch all five discs and enjoy them all for the most part. Finally there is some gore and partial nudity that make this an R rated film, but the profanity is minimal(which I enjoy). You don't need profanity to make a great film.
B000IMUYJM|2.0|I bought this movie when I heard about it over the radio. I can see why it was a breakthrough movie as far as the cinematography, but everything else about it was mediocre. You're not missing much if you never see this move.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Wes Anderson is at his best when he explores a small group of people -- sometimes family, sometimes not -- and explores what makes them tick.<br /><br />And after the cluttered \\"The Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou,\\" Anderson returns to those roots with \\"The Darjeeling Limited.\\" Technically it's an Indian road trip movie, and it's full of his quirky charm... but at heart it's just about three unhapppy brothers with a lot of baggage. Both literally and psychologically.<br /><br />The forlorn Peter (Adrien Brody) and his luggage barely make it to an Indian train in time to join his brothers, woman-chasing writer Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and  bandaged control freak Francis (Owen Wilson). They haven't spoken for a year, and now they're planning to awkwardly bond as they travel to their estranged mother's convent.<br /><br />But after disasters involving a snake, painkillers and pepper spray, the three brothers find themselves (and their monogrammed suitcases) thrown off the train. As they trek back to civilization, the three men set out on a quest to explore the spiritual, deal with  life, death, feathers, man-eating tigers, funerals and their own painful memories... and possibly find their mom.<br /><br />Nobody in their right mind would expect Wes Anderson to spin up an ordinary good-ol'-boys road trip movie. At least, not the way most directors would. Instead, Anderson crafts this as the baby brother to \\"The Royal Tenenbaums,\\" exploring a fractured, mildly dysfunctional family with an absent parent.<br /><br />And the cinematic flavour of \\"Darjeeling Limited\\" is much the same as in \\"Royal Tenenbaums\\" -- bittersweetly funny and arch, with a tinge of poetic melancholy underlying the plot. It would be an endearing movie in any setting, but somehow putting it in the mellow glow of India's dusty roads, bright fields and cluttered shrines makes it even better. The bright, visual richness gives it a sense of whimsy.<br /><br />For the record, Roman Coppola and Schwartzman helped Anderson out with the script, but there isn't much change. As always, lots of  wry, amusingly contemplative dialogue (\\"I wonder if the three of us would've been friends in real life. Not as brothers, but as people\\"), though there is some hilarious comedic scenes of sibling infighting. It even gets slapsticky.<br /><br />Fortunately, Anderson never puts artificial twists into the story, for any extra drama, comedy or thrills; the closest thing would be a brief detour into a child's funeral. The story simply flows by, because it's all about the brothers -- and focusing on anything but their self-imposed journey would just be extra baggage.<br /><br />And the three men playing Jack, Francis and Peter are nothing short of brilliant.

Not as brothers, but as people\\"), though there is some hilarious comedic scenes of sibling infighting. It even gets slapsticky.    Fortunately, Anderson never puts artificial twists into the story, for any extra drama, comedy or thrills; the closest thing would be a brief detour into a child's funeral. The story simply flows by, because it's all about the brothers -- and focusing on anything but their self-imposed journey would just be extra baggage.

B000VZBCWE|5.0|This is one of the best performed, filmed, recorded live dvds I have ever seen!  Screw all that MTV video crap with 400 cuts a minute.  This is how you record a band live.  Queen was one of the best ever, and this dvd proves it.  Freddie lives on!

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|10 years from now, maybe 1 out of 10 pop stars currently on the charts will be still around.  I don't know if Clarkson will be on that short-list, but one thing is for sure - she isn't afraid to put together a hard album that stretches her voice and emotional power, and that will help.  That said, this is a solid album, with better writing and much more emotion than Breakaway, but it isn't a great album, merely a good one.      The 1st half of the album is quite good - a combination of strong rockers and one very deep personal Ballad (\\"Sober\\") that makes you wonder if Kelly has a few demons.  \\"Never Again\\", \\"One Minute\\", and \\"Hole\\" are a 1-2-3 punch of hard-rock combined with Kelly's legendary vocal ability should have you relegating your Avril Lavigne CD's for coasters.    \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" and \\"Judas\\" are also powerful, competent rockers - the latter being the most angry danceable song on the record with it's alt-rock foundation - one of my personal favorites - as is the very last song \\"Dirty Little Secret\\".    Unfortunately, the stuff between \\"Judas\\" and \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" is competent but disposable rock-pop filler that maintains the feel of the record but without the good elements of the 1st half.  Some of it sounds like it was designed to give the album a couple of radio-friendly songs and ballads.  \\"How I feel\\" is one example.  It has a tempo and a sound, but it's lacking a hook.  It also ends the argument for me that Kelly had no radio aspirations.  This is where Clive Davis might have been able to add value to the record.    Oh by the way - is anyone still listening to the same music now that they  were listening to when Breakaway was released? Then why would you expect Kelly to be still producing it?  I guess in some minds, we fans are the only ones capable of changing and growing.....    4 stars for the 1st half of the record, 2 stars for the 2nd half, 5 stars for Kelly's always pleasant voice, even on the worst songs..... = round up to 4 stars.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|Having read all of Fitzgerald's novels and most of his short stories, I've come to the conclusion that some authors' best works simply just don't come across well on the screen. Let's add it up in \\"Gatsby\\". The film itself is about as close to being 100% accurate compared to the novel as you'll see. Redford plays the enigmatic protagonist excellently, Farrow as his former sweetheart is fine, and a young Sam Waterston does a good job as summer neighbor Nick Carraway. The photography,deliberately hazy and very beautifully done, seems to represent the novel's intent in presenting the rich as having plenty of problems hidden behind the facade of riches. The green light at the end of Daisy's pier is obviously symbolic. All of the secondary characters are more than acceptable as well, so we're right back where we started:the sum of the pieces should add up to a 5 star rating, but for me at least , I rank it a 3 plus, turn it off and then proceed to reread the 5 star American classic of 1926.

Somebody should re-release this with some sort of on-screen drinking game, it might make it a little more tolerable - of course it may just depress you into a suicidal alcoholic stupor and you'll end up bitterly bemoaning the loss of your childhood crap you gave up for wealth and power. It isn't even that I dislike Welles, I enjoyed him in the Third Man and The Muppet Movie (&lt;---joke). Good movies tell stories capable of engaging the audience, this didn't it presented an obituary with a lot of bitching.  Look up something by Lang, Jodorowsky, anyone.

0143038419|5.0|Never have I cried more often than when reading 'eat pray love'. It speaks to me. It speaks of me. I am reading about my struggles, my fears, my needs and my wants.<br /><br />Of course that's not true. It's not a book about me at all. It's a book about and written by Elizabeth Gilbert. It starts with her time in Italy. After a difficult divorce and a difficult relationship after that, Elizabeth spends four months in Italy. Eating, yes, eating. Eating and recovering her sense for pleasure. Taking time to grieve, to recuperate.<br /><br />She then travels to India for four months and lives in an Ashram. This is my favorite part by the way. In the Ashram she meets Richard from Texas. He's my favorite supporting character in the story. He is the one explaining to her about soul mates and the great misunderstanding about them. They are mirrors nothing less, nothing more.<br />He also observes that he's never seen anybody fighting as much with themselves as Elizabeth. Well, he's never met me. And that was one of those instances that made me cry not just hard but very hard.<br /><br />After India, Elizabeth spends the rest of her year 'off' in Bali. There she recovers her balance.<br /><br />I promised my best friend to lend her the book but I don't think I will. I will buy her her own copy because I don't want to give my copy away. That's how much the book means to me. Read it!<br /><br />PS: LOL I just read one of the one star reviews in which the reviewer wished he/she could give it zero stars... Yes, I can see that. I can see how many people will not relate to this book. I'm making up that especially men will fall into this category but when I viewed the comments to the reviewer's review there was woman after woman agreeing with him/her. All of them seemed to have regretted spending money on this book and that made me sad. Therefore I want to encourage anybody who may think it's not for them to get it from the library because if you like it you will get your own copy anyways. And if you don't then no harm's done!s done!
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Thank You For Smoking is one of those few dark comedies that truly had me laughing all the way; and I can't remember how long it's been since I laughed so much watching a movie! The lines are funny; the acting is convincing and the movie manages to make a great point about \\"spin\\" (aka bulls***) in today's world.<br /><br />The action begins with tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) appearing on a talk show to put a spin on the fact the smoking causes cancer. Nick, smirking all the way, says that the tobacco companies want a boy with cancer to live so they could keep another customer. Nick argues further that health officials would love to see the young \\"cancer boy\\" die so their budgets would be fatter. This is just the tip of the iceberg, folks; Nick goes through his whole life putting a spin on tobacco to make it seem safe, romantic and glorious.<br /><br />Nick's partners in crime include two people he meets for lunch from time to time; and they call themselves \\"The Mod Squad.\\" Look for great performances by Maria Bello as Polly Bailey and David Koechner as Bobby Jay Bliss who work for the alcohol and gun lobbies respectively. Nick's slave driving boss, B.R. (J.K. Simmons) puts in a great performance and the head honcho of the tobacco group, simply referred to as \\"Captain,\\" is played wonderfully by Robert Duvall.<br /><br />Nick's personal life isn't peachy--he's separated from his wife. When a seductive female reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) gets the real scoop on Nick's secrets and lets it all out in a tell-all article in a prominent Washington, D.C. newspaper, Nick's world comes crashing down around him.<br /><br />Will Nick be able to bounce back from the negative publicity he gets? Will he keep his friends and his job? What will his young, impressionable son Joey (Cameron Bright) think of him when the whole truth comes out? Watch the movie to find out these answers and more, folks--there are no spoilers here!<br /><br />The DVD comes with a plethora of extras. We get an interview with Aaron Eckhart and others on The Charlie Rose Show; there are quite a few deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; there's a brief \\"making of\\" featurette; a director and cast commentary; storyboard and more! I am very impressed.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend Thank You For Smoking for people who enjoy indie movies that are really funny and try to playfully make a point at the same time. You'll notice that no one in the film is ever filmed smoking a cigarette! However, this is not a family movie; there is a fair amount of swearing and there are some violent scenes that could upset small children. (The kidnapping scene is one of them; but I won't say much more to save the juicy plot for you.)<br /><br />Now THAT'S what I call a great flick!with Aaron Eckhart and others on The Charlie Rose Show; there are quite a few deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; there's a brief \\"making of\\" featurette; a director and cast commentary; storyboard and more!

B000002LR6|1.0|Midway through the opening cut, \\"N.W.O.,\\" with Bush Sr. rapping at the mic, there's a moment where all the steroid-chugging axe grinding and scream-at-the-top-of-your-lungs-like-you're-a-frantic-ghoul vocals fade and the listener is left with a myopic dance beat. And that's when well-versed listeners will remember that Ministry started out (shudder at \\"Twitch\\") and was condemned to remain a sissy boogie band. Alain Jourgensen and pals merely added a Skinny Puppy motor to their makeshift parade float by the time they recorded \\"Land of Rape and Honey.\\"<br /><br />\\"Psalm\\" continues to lose IQ points as you delve further. The clunky wrestler's-catwalk theme \\"TV II\\" and meathead-friendly powerpuff \\"Jesus Built My Hot Rod\\" reveal Jourgenson to be in the same dopey league as the Bush clan he so constantly rails against. \\"Tell me something I don't know\\" is apropros of George Jr., as well as \\"Diggy diggy-don a dong dong ding-dong.\\" But the line, \\"Who'm I trying to impress, who could care less?\\" has for me come to merely mean that Jourgensen is a man who has no faith in his convictions ... or pumps so much noise, lights, screaming and other testosterone-sized diversions into the mix that you ultimately realize he just can't take himself seriously, which should be insulting if you are a fan.<br /><br />However, if the most challenging music you can handle is jerry-built by bands like Kid Rock, Monster Magnet and White Zombie, then by all means add this to your collection. However, first put down that bong and check to make sure you don't already have it somewhere in your milk-crate library.

079073639X|4.0|We can recognize the various models that are at work in this film and we are amazed how strong they can be. Aliens of course, but at the bottom of some ocean abyss and some spacecraft that got buried deep down there and that can only liberate itself with the psychic energy of some humans who it attracts into a sphere and then suck up dry: it feeds and regenerates on the fears of three human beings that it has been able to invite inside that living sphere. Stephen King's Tommyknockers are not very far. And the black hole in the cosmos, the force that takes over the computers and machine of the submarine of course recalls the Space Odyssey to our minds. And the deep sea abyss, the monstrous octopus, the submarines ring many bells that summon Jules Verne in a nearly obsessive way.  But there is something missing in this complex fabric. It is too contradictory to be satisfactory. How come this force that can only liberate itself from its wrecked position will use the three people it manages to invade to destroy all the others and then one another? That living sphere can only take off if these three human beings join their minds to erase their memory of what happened and donate their mental power to the sphere. If they succeeded in destroying one another the sphere would be trapped forever. So why manipulate them into that kind of an ending that liberates the sphere for sure but that is absurd like some kind of divine power that comes like a streak of out of place absurdity? What's more the woman of the trio has been manipulated into setting so powerful a bomb that everything will get destroyed miles away and around, including of course the three humans trapped down under the water. All that is illogical too. It is not enough to say that this poor being, but is it a being, has been trapped under the water for three centuries to explain these discrepancies. A better job could have been devised more in the line of Jules Verne or Stephen King or Kubrick, but probably not the three without counting the aliens and their eggs. That makes things slightly too labyrinthine and sibylline, enigmatic and mysterious and it destroys the utter pleasure we expect: to be confronted to something inescapable, something so logical that it takes a stronger, hence human logic to defeat it, and yet only for some kind of short resting interlude. The defeat and victory of that sphere, if that cosmic calamity comes literally by accident, haphazardly.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinese three without counting the aliens and their eggs.

B000YENUI6|4.0|I'm actually not sure how to describe this movie, but I'll give it my best shot. First of all, Viggo Mortensen is outstanding as Nikolai, a driver and enforcer for the Russian Mafia, and full time baby-sitter to Kirill, the wayward son of Mafia boss Semyon.  He's one cold, emotionless dude when he has to be, but has a human side that peeps out ever so often from behind that steely, chiseled mug.<br /><br />Vincent Cassel (Kirill) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (Semyon) are also extremely convincing, the former as a violent drunk and the latter as the charming and affable, but very cruel father.  Naomi Watts doesn't light up the screen and steal the show as she normally does, but it could be the depressing role of Anna, a midwife who delivers a baby for a fourteen year old girl who doesn't make it off the operating table.<br /><br />Anne Frank may have left a more famous diary, but the diary of the unfortunate young woman is so revealing that some people are prepared to kill to keep the contents from being brought to light.<br /><br />Fascinating in some aspects, such as the story behind the tattoos, and graphic in quite a few others, including a memorable scene with a totally nude Viggo battling against guys with linoleum knives, I found some parts a bit too long and drawn out, and some too predictable.<br /><br />Never-the-less, the acting, the casting and the intensity of this drama make it extremely watchable (if you like this movie genre), and although it isn't going to be one of my favorite movies, it certainly is worth mentioning here.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 9, 2007
037582913X|5.0|As a child, this book was hands down my favorite book.  It was responsible for my learning to read before I started kindergarten.  I made my mother read it to me so many times that I memorized it and could read it on my own.    After I had my first child, I found this book and started reading it to him when he was about 3.  He was nearly as enthusiastic about it as I was.  Children simply love monsters and Grover, so the combination is irresistible.     I highly recommend this book to any parent of a silly youngster.    P.S.  I wouldn't bother with the sequel that they made years later[[ASIN:0375805621 Another Monster at the End of This Book (Big Bird's Favorites Brd Bks)]]  It features Elmo along with Grover and just doesn't have the same charm as this one.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|While it obviously could be referred to as a boxing picture, this nice Michael Mann biographical effort is more a character study of the one of the most charismatic figures ever to step into the squared circle. Mr. Mann shifts gears appropriately from his heavy action yarns (Thief, Last of the Mohicans, Heat) to provide an insightful look into the life of this legendary boxer as Will Smith pulls off the title role rather well yet regrettably holds back much of the wit, humor and unpredictable antics Ali was known for. As a result, viewer's eyes actually will be more fixated on the dynamite supporting cast including Ron Silver as Ali's longtime trainer Angelo Dundee and Mario Van Peebles playing a formidable Malcolm X. Both of these memorable characters are only to be outdone by an almost unrecognizable Jon Voight as he dons the patented yellow ABC sport jacket and gives an incredible, Oscar nominated performance as the exuberant and controversial Howard Cosell who always seemed to be where Ali roamed the globe. While the film does span 10 years of the famous boxer's life, the major disappointment of the film is the 157 minute which could have been shortened by needles/monotonous training footage sequences.

If you're looking for mindless action, THIS is the movie for you.<br />It's over the top, totally unbelievable, physically impossible, but absolutely brilliant all at the same time.<br /><br />2 minute version:<br /><br />Clive Owen eats a lot of carrots, and values his privacy.  There are many things that he absolutely hates, and he comes into contact with most of these things when he unwillingly gets involved in a plot to kill a very pregnant young woman.  Suddenly faced with a nanny job, he shoots his way out of the frying pan and into the fire, each scenario more draw-dropping-ly impossible than the last.  Paul Giamatti plays an unlikely criminal mastermind and Monica Bellucci is under-utilized as the proverbial professional with a heart of gold except she's also got a chest of milk to go with it.  Things get political, and hopelessly complicated, and of course there's lots and lots (and lots) of shooting, during any (and I do mean ANY) situation.<br /><br />Good stuff:<br /><br />1. Clive Owen<br />2. Clive Owen's one-liners<br />3. Clive Owen's stunts<br />4. The hilariously bad but breathtaking, yet impossible scenarios<br />5. Paul Giamatti's cell phone calls<br />6. The body count<br />7. Clive Owen's nude scene<br />8. Clive Owen<br /><br />Bad stuff:<br /><br />1. Carrots are DEFINITELY not good for some people<br />2. Not enough Bellucci<br />3. Plot (nuff said) but then again, we don't need no steenkin' plot<br /><br />If you can forget that this movie professes to have a plot, you're in for a rollicking good (but extremely violent) time.  Definitely a must-see if you're looking for mindless adult entertainment, and don't mind looking at Clive Owen.<br /><br />Rated: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 9, 2007
B0009YNRZM|4.0|You're probably wondering why I rated this one anywhere below five stars. This is Zappa's \\"undisputed masterpiece\\", right? Well, it's true that it's one of his better albums, that there's a lot of uproarious mock-acid rock (\\"Who Needs the Peace Corps?\\"; \\"Flower Punk\\", with a simulated drug overdose; \\"Take Your Clothes off When You Dance\\"); that the lyrics are some of Zappa's finest, skewing both hippy ideals (\\"Absolutely Free\\") and conservative values (\\"Mom & Dad\\"; \\"What's the Ugliest Part of Your Body?\\") - at the same time, Zappa sends out his warmest regards to the \\"real\\" counterculture (which he probably considered himself a member of) - check \\"Mother People\\", with a strong melody, and \\"Take off Your Clothes Off\\"; there's also some just plain hilarious weirdness, as demonstrated on the outrageous \\"Let's Make the Water Turn Black\\". But I'm not a fan of any of the avant-garde tracks: I'd much rather hear \\"Monster Magnet\\". Most of them are mercifully brief (dialog snippets \\"Hot Poop\\" and \\"Telephone Conversation\\"), and some of them can be funny (\\"Are You Hung Up?:\\" - \\"Hey kids, my name is Jimmy Carl Blackman and I'm the Indian of the group!\\"), but when he tries to stretch them out to standard length, they fall apart (\\"The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny\\"; \\"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\\"). And Zappa's arrogance can get the best of him on occasion (\\"Lonely Little Girl\\"; \\"The Idiot Bastard Son\\"; \\"Harry, You're a Beast\\"). Freak Out! and Absolutely Free do the whole counterculture parody thing better; and Hot Rats has more of Zappa's guitar playing and composition skills - all three are, in the opinion of the author, better albums.
B00005JKBC|3.0|Excellent thriller with new millennium A-list star Brad Pitt teaming with 70's A-lister Robert Redford (smartly casted in a 'Buddy picture' after Pitt took direction from Redford in his memorable yet under-appreciated \\"A River Runs Through it\\" from 1994) in an entertaining spy film directed by action-obsessed Tony Scott which will have you at times on the edge of your seat. Scott rewards his action hungry audience in calculated doses as the picture is laced with lots of intrigue, and second guessing including a clever use of flashback sequences for additional suspense to this international thriller. Catherine McCormack is appealing as the love interest for Pitt's character which goes beyond obligatory since the joining of the two conflicts with his mentor's guidelines for espionage survival. The chemistry of all the players along with Scott's exciting action input make this an above average Pitt/Redford 'Buddy flick'.

B00005JPNW|3.0|The movie is fun, great to look at, and should receive recognition for the special effects, art direction and photography.  The New York Times aptly described Nicole Kidman as the movie's best special effect - her cold, glacial beauty is perfect for this role.  The biggest disappointment is the brevity of Daniel Craig's role.  When photographed at the premiere, he looked strangely subdued and serious, and in an interview, in his usual tactful manner, mentioned that other scenes were filmed, but not used in the final cut.  He reportedly has great admiration for the book, and most assuredly expected more from his role in the movie.   What a waste of his fine talent, although, as always, he lights up the screen in the moments when he is allowed to appear.
B000056QD0|5.0|Axis is the weakest of the original Jimi Hendrix albums. Still, it does get 4.5 stars, so it's not like it sucks or anything. The emphasis is on the songwriting this time (rather than the guitar), and he's moved well beyond the debut's sex, drugs and rock `n' roll approach. In fact, there's a lot of first-rate pop ballads to be found here, and not just the beautiful mini-symphony \\"Little Wing\\": \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" is Jimi at his most poetic; \\"One Rainy Wish\\" is a wonderful piece of psychedelic folk with heavy guitars; \\"Up from the Skies\\" is mellow, jazzy, and funny; \\"Bold As Love\\" unloads original metaphors and a heavenly guitar solo. There's some hard rock here, and while it's less pronounced, it's certainly worthwhile: the anti-conformity fusion jam \\"If 6 Was 9\\"; the stampeding \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\"; likable funk-rock on Noel Redding's \\"She's So Fine\\"; \\"Little Miss Lover\\"; and \\"You Got Me Floatin'\\" (I stress likable because they're clearly not highlights). The only real headache is the feedback experiment \\"E.X.P\\": the rest is quite recommendable.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Billy Wilder's \\"The Apartment\\" is a film which can produce some of the biggest laughs and at the same time... can bring many viewers to tears, Billy Wilder's quaint little tale about everyday people who get tangled up in love, jealousy and infidelity boasts a top-notch cast led by the trio of Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray who are tremendous. The plot revolves around C.C. (Lemmon) who unknowingly makes the unethical attempt of climbing the corporate ladder by 'loaning' his apartment to members from his management chain to entertain their 'women on the side'. Given the change of circumstances, this premise certainly could even hit home in the current office environment. Although the office party and secretarial gossip scenes could be viewed as dated, the power and attitude of the corporate executive, Mr. Sheldrake (MacMurray) is certainly symbolic. The character of Fran (MacLaine) for today's standards of course seems too submissive and vulnerable but the reward of her finding true, admirable, unconditional companionship is quite enriching and fulfilling to any who see this memorable film.
034547581X|5.0|Having studied the Vietnam war for many years, I found this to be the most accurate account of two actions, one that turned out as well as any such conflict, and the other a horrible disaster.  When comparing it to General Moore's After Action Report, one finds all the details, complete with maps, comments, and recommendations that were largely ignored.    This is not a pretty story; there is nothing beautiful about battle.  What is compelling and extremely powerful are the author's straight forward, un-filtered account of the true face of battle. This is not a self-serving, ego driven  account. It, in many ways, is reminiscent of Caesar's Commentaries in the description of the way  events unfolded at LZ X-Ray and Albany.  This is a must read and study for anyone trying to understand the American involvement in Vietnam.    Jim Payne  Las Cruces, NM
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is truly a great satire while simultaneously being scary and right on the zombie money. I've watched this four times and in each viewing I saw something different.

B000023X9W|2.0|Okay, what a boring record this is! And given how good Neil's work with country-folk can get, that's not good at all. Several songs (\\"Good to See You\\"; \\"Daddy Went Walkin'\\"; \\"Red Sun\\") sound like campfire singalongs. You know, the kind of things most people cut from their albums, and leave in the vaults until they put out an odds-and-sods album: he also embarrasses himself with the nauseating \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\", a tribute to his old '60s group. Another song with embarrassing lyrics is \\"Distant Camera\\", a metaphor about life being a photograph. Entertainment here sadly comes in bits and pieces, unlike Harvest, Harvest Moon or Prairie Wind: the simple beauty of \\"Horseshoe Man\\"; the modest, unpretentious title track and \\"The Great Divide\\". When you take everything into account, though, this is clearly one of Young's lesser albums.
B00008BXJJ|2.0|Up until this point, I had the 1 CD version, which was good.  I've been wanting the 2 CD version for a long time and finally the price drops at Wal Mart and I get it.  HOWEVER, it seems on this version all of the songs fade out at the end, wha the hell were they thinking there?  Its a live album, I wanna hear a show, now the songs... so that little fact makes the entire album unlistenable to me... moron move.    Otherwise, the songs are high energy and great, its that little flaw that makes me less then likley i'll ever want to listen to it.
1428156585|4.0|I first came across Ayaan Hirsi Ali on television.  She was being questioned by a left-leaning interviewer who hardly seemed sympathetic.<br /><br />I enjoyed this well presented recording from start to finish.

0439813786|5.0|I'll keep this short. I got this today for my 57th birthday, and just finished my second reading. A wonderful story, with beautiful drawings, gorgeously produced.    I'm grateful to have it.
B000002J6F|4.0|When I dug this one up to review it, it had been over a year since I last heard Manassas, the first of two albums by Stills' supergroup of the same name, which includes ex-Byrd Chris Hillman and CSN associates Calvin Samuels (bass) and Dallas Taylor (drums), former Blues Image percussionist Joe Lala, and session men . You know what? That's way too long. This is a good album! Not fantastic or wonderful or anything, just good. It's a double, which means it's a bit on the long side, and there's some I could've done without. I don't have any problem with side one, the straight-up rock side (The Raven). In fact, it's very solid straight-up rock `n' roll, with gems like the groupie tribute \\"Rock and Roll Crazies/Cuban Bluegrass\\"; the bluesy \\"Jet Set (Sigh)\\", and \\"Anyway\\", packed with solid guitar licks. The countryish \\"Both of Us (Bound to Lose)\\" is okay as well, and has a fantastic Latin-rock coda that just comes out of nowhere. Most of my problem lays in side two, The Wilderness, packed with country-rock that's either insincere (\\"Fallen Eagle\\"; \\"Don't Look at My Shadow\\"), hokey (\\"Colorado\\"; \\"So Begins the Task\\"), or both (\\"Jesus Gave Love Away for Free\\"; \\"Hide it So Deep\\"). And \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" rips off Stills' Buffalo Springfield-era sound without adding anything new to it. But \\"Johnny's Garden\\" is one hell of a track, some lovely little pro-environmentalist, metaphoric folk-rock. And \\"Bound to Fall\\" is a haunting folk piece, \\"Right Now\\" is more chugging rock; \\"Love Gangster\\" is funny and actually not a rip-off of Steve Miller's \\"Gangster of Love\\". Even the obligatory early '70s blues guitar jam (\\"The Treasure\\") is pretty much fantastic. And the solo-guitar spot \\"Blues Man\\" is an efficient way to close the album, with Stills' great blues vocals. Twenty-one tracks are a few too many (I'd say get rid of seven or eight of 'em). There's a lot to be said for this one regardless
075640407X|5.0|I've been reading sci-fi/fantasy for many years (& it's not polite to ask a lady how many, but it's been more than a score!), and over that time, I've refined my tastes. I have a small child, so I really don't have time for just \\"escapes\\". I prefer fantasy over most hard sci-fi. I enjoy character-driven stories that deal with the ugliness of living without wallowing in it. In short, I read a lot of Neil Gaiman, Pat Hodgell, Charles de Lint, Ellen Kushner, Pat McKillip, Jo Clayton, Robin McKinley - those Scribbly, Endicott-studio type of folks.   But my Beloved decided to give me my Yule present early. And despite the small child, a full-time + job, teaching dance class, etc... I found I couldn't put it down. I finished it in less than a week.   Wow! It made my brain feel good, in the same way that eating healthy food that actually tastes decadent makes your stomach happy and not regretful later. I couldn't put the damn thing down!   As a dancer, I was even getting pre-performance butterflies during some of the scenes (never happened when reading before). As a parent and as a sibling of an abandoned child, I ached at the descriptions of street-life for an orphan.   I'm lucky enough to have a few people in my life who are as smart as Kvothe, so though I am usually skeptical of \\"Brilliant Young Heroes\\", I could sympathize with his surety and cockiness at the same time he was wracked by self-doubt.  This is a wonderful book - just make sure when you pick it up that you have the quality time to spend reading it! (I had to have my Beloved hide it while I was at work so that I could get some sleep for a few days.) Thank you, Pat, for persevering through all the rejection letters, and sharing this with all of us. We're all going to be waiting for the next installment, but there's plenty of re-reading value in this to keep us happy for awhile.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|The story itself is wonderful with wonderful lessons.  It may be a little slow for children, but the majority will love the story and characters.    The video quality itself is amazing for a BD movie.  Everything is crisp and great extras are included.
B000E97HIA|3.0|For the first time in his career, Prince seems to be out of ideas. So he does one of two things: either falls back on his old reliable clich&eacute;s (title track, an admittedly enjoyable mix of party clich&eacute;s; \\"Black Sweat\\" and \\"Love\\", poor \\"When Doves Cry\\" rehashes), or sets his sights for the Urban Contemporary market (\\"Incense and Candles\\"; \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\"; \\"The Dance\\").I assume he could be doing much worse, but I'd rather not hear him run over the same old ground. Needless to say, the days of Prince blending multiple genres into one song are over: the only major experiment is the Spanish tinged love ballad \\"Te Amo Corazon\\", and I'm not so sure what I think of that one. The good news is Prince still can make some good music in this comfortable little nostalgia mode of his: I've gotta admit that \\"Satisfied\\" is a hell of a ballad; and \\"Lolita\\" is funky as anything Prince has ever done; \\"Fury\\" boasts a few scorching guitar parts; \\"Get on the Boat\\" has all kinds of enthusiasm and fun horns, and best of all, a pair of sax solos from Maceo Parker, who proves that he still has a lot of talent left in him; the title track is very entertaining and danceable, even if I don't like the computerized voiceover. But I think that Musicology is a much better record: it's got more of Prince's personality, that's for sure. There are no real distinguishing features of 3121 - he sounds like, I don't know... Chris Brown or someone like that. And that's not good. And forget social relevance - another thing Musicology had at least a bit of. Well, at least there's no absolute crime against humanity to it. Then again, this is Prince we're talking about, and not Souljah Boy.
0349106746|4.0|This work should be compulsory for politicians in times of change and turmoil, such as ours. The only problem I have with the book is the choice of Troy as an example. OK, I understand that it can be used as the archetypical model for a government which has left rationality behind and can only continue on its chosen path of self destruction, because otherwise it would have to admit that it is wrong.  Perhaps the book should have included at least one more example, like the Pelopponesian War (Athenian refusal to accept Spartan peace overtures) or the Mexican - American War of 1848 (the Mexican government refuses to arm civilians), to make its point even better. As it stands now the examples are very poignant but hardly support a comprehensive theory.  Even so, the examples of the US war of independence and the Vietnam war eerily points towards the invasion of Iraq. The author died in 1989! Interpreting this book would indicate a trend in US foreign policy, inherited from the former British colonial masters.  A good companion volume to this would be Gordon Dixon: On the Psychology of Military Incompetence.
0684857219|5.0|I was interested in the art of bodybuilding and this book was recommended.  It is historically informative and detailed to the excercises for each body part.  The workouts are for the professionals, so you have to adjust to your own personal needs.  After a month of following some of the tips, there was a noticable difference in my physique. I would venture to say, after the first workout, I knew there was going to be a change. You could read up on newer books, but this book is a solid foundation for everything.  It's worth the price.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|\\"Stargate: The Ark Of Truth\\" is first Stargate SG-1 Direct-To-DVD film. It also is the film which closes the Ori stary arc initially begun at the beginning of it's 9th Season (\\"Avalon\\" Parts 1 & 2 and \\"Origin\\").     I have been looking forward to this film for some time given it's placement within the Stargate Timeline. Even though Atlantis S4 is currently airing, and Samantha Carter is now the base commander (\\"Reunion\\"), in fact, this film takes place some time before Atlantis' Season 3 finale \\"First Strike.\\"
B000002L7R|4.0|This, as it has often been pointed out, is an eccentric, psychedelic album. Of course Prince was always kind of an odd guy, but nobody was expecting something like the calypso-laden title track. Even the funk song \\"Raspberry Beret\\" is slightly odd, with psychedelic tinges and violins. The thing is that he actually managed to crank out a very entertaining album in spite (or perhaps because) of all the experimental insanity. It's not all good and fine: \\"America\\" is your standard '80s funk song; \\"Condition of the Heart\\" is too long and is inaudible for most its length, and \\"The Ladder\\" revives the previous album's Messianic tendencies without the melody of \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" or the shocking coda found on \\"The Beautiful Ones\\". More often though it's either charming and melodic (\\"Paisley Park\\"; \\"Raspberry Beret\\"; title track) or hard-rocking/free-jazzing and melodic (the long, insanely experimental, multi-part sex jam \\"Temptation\\", with a sax that I believe is played by Rogers Nelson himself), and its eccentric, eclectic nature is delightful as well.
B000002O5L|4.0|One of Tom Petty's better efforts. \\"I Won't Back Down,\\" \\"Running Down a Dream,\\" and, of course, \\"Freefallin'\\" are superb pop songs. Beautifully written and beautifully sung, with ringing harmonies and jangling guitars. Buy it.
0670034711|3.0|The author makes a lot of great points in this book as she chronicles her spiritual journey around the world...and some of the points had a great impact on me in light of opening my mind to inner peace and happiness.  It encouraged me to try mediation with the hopes of achieving that balance we all seek in life.    That being said, I was surprised to learn that this is not the first book the author has written--her writing style did come across a bit amateurish.  I found myself getting a little irritated and wishing I could have edited the book --not to change the content--to to allow the words and sentences to flow better.  Further, she would go on these tangents with anecdotes and details that made no sense to the overall picture.    All in all, I do believe Elizabeth did come away from the experience a more peaceful and self-relected individual, but the hype on this book was quite over the top for the content.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|Kanye West can maybe be dubbed \\"the king of the second single\\" because while his first singles from each of his respective albums don't do a WHOLE lot chart-wise, the following singles just blow up (yes, people, \\"Stronger\\" is the SECOND song released from this album, not the first). And his latest album Graduation keeps the good times rolling.<br /><br />Now, I always thought that Kanye's albums were a little overrated because I could never give any of them five stars -- actually, I gave all of them three-and-a-half stars (albeit for different reasons). But I was wondering if I would even be able to give this album THAT much because of the nonsensical two-in-a-row of \\"Barry Bonds\\" and \\"Drunk & Hot Girls\\" (featuring Lil' Wayne and Mos Def, respectively). And when I found out that the song that precedes those two, \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\", was the first single, I wondered why it didn't make any waves; but then I listened to it and I said, \\"Oh.\\"<br /><br />But there are plenty of good songs, like \\"Good Morning\\", \\"Champion\\", and my favorite, \\"The Glory\\". The Dwele-assisted \\"Flashing Lights\\" is a contender for my second favorite, except for when Ye sloppily ends the second verse with: \\"You know you can't Rome [roam] without Caesar.\\" There are also two good collaborations with two Chris Martins, the Coldplay frontman on the necessary tribute-to-your-hometown \\"Homecoming\\", and the Gang Starr DJ on \\"Everything I Am\\". In addition, the final track \\"Big Brother\\" is an interesting song about Jay-Z even though I'm not quite sure whether Ye is showing love for him or dissing him.<br /><br />The only other song that I can really do without is \\"I Wonder\\" (especially that weird sample, but Ye does get more momentum toward the end of the song). While I don't think Graduation is classic material like everyone says it is, it still has enough good moments to be worth your while. (And one more thing, R.I.P. Donda West.)<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000JR0P5Y|4.0|Finally, a breakthrough! An exquisite album: one of the best of 1991, in fact. And there was all kinds of good music put out in the grand year of 1991. It's funk! It's metal! It's rap! It's all of them! Woo-hoo! A winning combination there. I still think this is a slightly overrated album: I prefer Californication and Stadium Arcadium. Let's get back to the point here, though: the sheer coolness of several of these more obscure songs is off the charts (to say nothing of the hits. We'll get to those later). \\"If You Have to Ask\\" is an example. Anthony's low-key rapping, in a deep voice, which he sadly would never reuse, isn't much different than the stupid songs from Freakish Stupidity, but it's so much better! Flea's bass line is much improved, and the guitar solo is a jaw-dropper. And \\"Funky Monks\\"... that's my jam, yo. A song titled \\"Funky Monks\\" had better be sweet, and it fulfills all its title promises. So does \\"Mellowship Slinky in B Major\\", which has my pick for the best chorus on the album (\\"Good god! Ah-purple haze now!\\" and the like). \\"My Lovely Man\\" is about Hilel Slovak. Again, it's funky! And the guitars are so good! My favorite song, though, obscurity or hit, is \\"I Could Have Lied\\". It wasn't released as a single, which is a shame, because everything about it is melodic. The distorted guitar solo is melodic. The line \\"I'm f***ed-up now\\" is melodic, okay? Sure, it's just a melody and a sweet guitar solo, but there's a lot of power in the song's simplicity. And \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" has hilariously tasteless, way over-the-top, not-intended-for-kids lyrics. I think it's a bit overrated myself: the last two minutes that everyone else seems to love so much strike me as repetitive. Then there are those four inescapable hits. \\"Give It Away\\" is their best funk song! Listen to the bass! And the lyrics! No, it's not about what you think it is: there are references to sex, yes, but also to giving blood, to world peace, and to Bob Marley. A whole verse about Bob Marley! In other words, it's about nothing. \\"Under the Bridge\\" also has a deceptive title: I thought it was supposed to be a neo-\\"Under the Boardwalk\\", but really it's a gripping testimonial about Frusciante's drug problems with a killer guitar riff and a striking video. It's also the group's most recognized song, and why not? \\"Breaking the Girl\\" probably may make you think that it's about abuse, but in truth, it chronicles a dying relationship. It's got a memorable chorus, and a flute! That's right, a flute! And it sounds amazing! Lastly, \\"Suck My Kiss\\" is exactly what you think it's about. It's the weakest of the singles, but it makes me dance and shake my butt, which was the intention. And some dreary, blah-ish songs. \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\"; \\"Naked in the Rain\\"; \\"The Righteous and the Wicked\\" and \\"The Greeting Song\\" all sound quite a lot like \\"Mellowship Slinky\\" or \\"Funky Monks\\" (or \\"Give it Away\\"), and I don't really like any of them. \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" itself is a totally unoriginal sex jam. The only cool part is the deep-voiced rap, which even then sounds better on \\"If You Have to Ask\\". And \\"They're Red Hot\\"... what's up with that? So it's good, very good, often fantastic, but it can't keep the fantasticness up enough to get a higher rating than four stars. Not that four stars are bad or anything...! In other words, it's about nothing. \\"Under the Bridge\\" also has a deceptive title: I thought it was supposed to be a neo-\\"Under the Boardwalk\\", but really it's a gripping testimonial about Frusciante's drug problems with a killer guitar riff and a striking video.

B000002MZ9|3.0|I would be quite hard-pressed to call anything with Pearl Jam on it brilliant. I mean, good? Certainly. Pearl Jam's a good rock band, and Ten is definitely a high point of the alternative revolution. They're definitely better than their imitators, you know, like Nickleback and Creed and Puddle of Mudd and all those other stupid bands whose singer tries for the life of him to sound just like Eddie Vedder, but will never because Eddie Vedder was the best singer to emerge from the grunge movement. But nobody's better at reinventing the wheel than they are, you know what I mean? Of course you do. So anyway, the first song (\\"Song X\\") is by far the best, a protest against religion with churning guitars and an arena-sized (though not half as big as, \\"Jeremy spoke in... class today!\\" or \\"Oh, I'm still alive, hey, hey, I...\\") sea chanty refrain. And that sets the tone for the rest of the album - \\"Act of Love\\" is especially close to it, only minus the big bad chorus. It's okay, though. Unlike \\"I'm the Ocean\\", unacceptably long and repetitive and poorly produced. Everyone and their Rolling Stone Album Guide loves that song, but I'm not too fond of it. It's boring. And \\"Big Green Country\\" sounds like Green Day. I wish I was lying about that, but I'm not. Anyway, it takes a while for the next really good song to show up, but when it does, it does: \\"Downtown\\" is an awesome song. It's like a grungier Black Sabbath song with that chugging, distorted riff, only it's not slow and it doesn't have lyrics about Satan. Instead, it's about hippies, and it has blues guitar solos like the Rolling Stones. So it's like Sabbath meets the Stones meets Nirvana. I like it a ton. Anyway, after that you get three straight songs that go on forever (\\"Peace and Love\\"; \\"Throw Your Hatred Down\\"; \\"Scenery\\"). By the way, what's with all the hippiness on the album? Who do you think you are, Neil? David Crosby? Oh, wait, you're not hopelessly addicted to every drug that crosses your path. Never mind. So anyway, I don't really know what to say about this, so I just give it two and a half stars and call it a day.way, I don't really know what to say about this, so I just give it two and a half stars and call it a day.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of songs from Led Zeppelin's catalog, though I was sad to see some songs missing, it is a great introductory product for people who are not aware of Led Zeppelin.    If you newbies like this compilation, you NEED to purchase their entire discography. Led Zeppelin is a band that it is impossible to make a \\"Best Of\\" collection for because there is so little that everyone can agree on. Off the top of my head I can probably name a dozen songs that I listen to regularly that are missing from this compilation.

B00005MIJ0|5.0|This is Zappa for those who don't like Zappa: there's next to no lyrics, so if you think the political work is mere grandstanding and the \\"adult comedy\\" stuff is immature, this is for you. Just about all this record is instrumental- there are about two minutes of vocals, both of them found on \\"Willie the Pimp\\", both of them sung, or rather barked, by Captain Beefheart. And even then the best part of that song is not the vocals, but Frank's guitar solo, which features him piling on crazy effects, distorting his guitar to the point where it almost doesn't sound like a guitar, using a gratuitous amount of wah-wah, and overall kicking everyone's butt. Add that to the violin riff that starts the song, and you've got what is easily my favorite Zappa tune. Weirdly enough, he also throws in a catchy, hummable, happy pop song (\\"Peaches en Regalia\\") - one of his very best compositions, I'll add. Another one of the finer points here is when he takes a novelty off Uncle Meat, \\"Mr. Green Genes\\", and converts it into a beautiful stew of jazz and classical, only to break the near-ethereal mood with another hyper-distorted guitar solo. But back to melodies: the brief \\"Little Umbrellas\\" has enough of them for three or four songs. The seventeen-minute free-jazz jam \\"Gumbo Variations\\" has none, but I'm pretty sure that was the point: it was more about the band's capabilities (especially those of Mr. Ian Underwood, who really whips it out for 7:31) then Zappa's songwriting. And I love it. The sax solo is the obvious highlight, but anyone who isn't blown away by the insane electric violin, or the equally manic guitar, is either hard to impress or not a Zappa fan. What I want to see is video footage of Sugarcane Harris playing that violin solo in the studio. Must've been intense. You've heard of air guitar, right? Whenever I hear that song, I take out my air electric violin. God, that song is crazy, and I've gotta give the drummer credit for being able to play so accurately at such a fast speed for so long. Plus those little organ blasts during the guitar solo make my day. Very, very well-made piece, and it's not even the best here! Because it cannot beat with \\"Willie the Pimp\\". It can compete with it, though. Did I mention it has a bass solo? Pure bombastic wonderful indulgence. \\"It Must be a Camel\\" is a rather forgettable piece with rather annoying percussion, but it shines in places.t speed for so long.

B000B0QOJA|4.0|An archival concert release that surprised just about everybody when it came out: four very long pieces, recorded with the Quartet, just before Coltrane made the jump into free jazz. The best songs here are quite good: a powerful \\"Afro-Blue\\" and an intense, spiritual \\"Song of Praise\\" (with a great McCoy Tyner piano solo; Elvin hammers his drums and Trane honks away). It's a bit uneven, though: the extended take on \\"My Favorite Things\\" isn't too revealing, and the fact is there are far better versions of the song found elsewhere, and it eventually descends into pure noisemaking for the sake of noisemaking - plus, at 22 minutes, it's far too long: meanwhile, an extended \\"One Down, One Up\\" runs its course fairly quickly: for a sharp contrast, see the version found on Dear Old Stockholm. This isn't too bad, and in fact is often quite good, but Live at the Village Vanguard, Newport '63, and Dear Old Stockholm are much better live albums.
0066620996|5.0|This book introduces a management methodology that Collins and his team discovered by analyzing eleven carefully selected companies. Out of hundreds of researched companies, only these eleven firms have changed from good to great and sustained their status. Remarkably, these eleven companies transformed under the same process of buildup followed by breakthrough, which can be broken into three broad stages, each driven by two key concepts:<br /><br />1. Disciplined people: Level 5 leadership and First who...Then what<br />2. Disciplined thought: Confront the brutal facts (yet never lose faith) and The Hedgehog concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles)<br />3. Disciplined action: A culture of discipline and Technology accelerators<br /><br />Wrapping around this entire framework is a concept of flywheel, which, under disciplined people, thought, and action, accumulates inertia and takes the company from good to great.<br /><br />The book illustrates this methodology with multiple examples and specific and detailed rules that can help entrepreneurs in various businesses turn their companies from good to great.

B000002G8J|1.0|Pointless, Meaningless and Substanceless would've all been more appropriate titles - this makes no Reason to Cry seem like Disraeli frickin' Gears. \\"Promises\\" is one-third of Clapton's \\"axis of evil\\" - that is, three big, grating soft-rock hits from the period (the other two are \\"Blunderful Tonight\\" and \\"I've Got a Soft-Rock-Cheesier-Than-Foreigner-MOR Heart and I am Now Writing Songs That Make Me Seem Like I've Never Played Rock or Blues or Any Music with Emotion in My Life\\" - the rest of the population knows them as \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" and \\"I've Got a Rock `n' Roll Heart\\"), and it could very well be the worst of the three. And while one bad song can't ruin an album, seven or eight can - \\"Golden Ring\\" has an accordion, for the love whatever's holy anymore! And really, Clapton, why all the ubermellow, not-even-remotely-tasteful-or-interesting country-rock? (\\"Walk Out in the Rain\\", \\"Watch Out for Lucy\\", \\"Roll It\\", \\"Tell Me That You Love Me\\")? Oh yeah, because he's a greedy superstar willing to jump on anything that can possibly make him money. Forgot about that... anyway, fans of his bluesier work will want to hear \\"Early in the Morning\\" and \\"Tulsa Time\\", but this should be near the bottom of your Clapton buying list. Unless you're on crack. Actually, I don't know what being on crack would have to do with you enjoying this album. I just threw that in there to scare your parents. Did it work?

B00008G1KJ|5.0|Whoa! This is overwhelming. I'm serious. The best, most creative and arguably most eclectic double-album I have ever heard. This is all about the studio effects: For all his talents as a singer, guitarist and songwriter, he was also quite the producer. Listen to the amazing twenty-minutes suite that merges \\"Rainy Day, Dream Away\\", \\"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\\", \\"Moon Turn the Tides... Gently, Gently Away\\" and \\"Still Raining, Still Dreaming\\". Could Deep Purple succeed making a suite that combined elements of psychedelia, jazz, hard rock, blues, and the avant-garde? I have my doubts. They can barely keep me interested for five minutes on a good day (unless it's \\"Demon's Eye\\", now that's a good song), let alone twenty. The other hugely long song is the blues jam \\"Voodoo Chile\\", which is also excellently done: fellow '60s luminaries Steve Windwood and Jack Casady guest on organ and bass, respectively. The remaining songs are all quite diverse: you get some bone-crunching psychedelic hard rock (\\"All Along the Watchtower\\", sporting one of the most famous guitar solos ever; \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return), with its instantly recognizable wah-wah riff; the stomping protest \\"House Burning Down\\"; careening, punkish \\"Crosstown Traffic\\"; \\"Gypsy Eyes\\", with strong tribal beats), some psychedelic blues (\\"Come On (Let the Good Times Roll)\\"), a bit of psychedelic pop (\\"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\\", a pseudo-symphony with layers of keyboards, guitars and backing vocals: like Spector, but actually good), and even smooth psychedelic soul (\\"(Have You Ever Been) To Electric Ladyland\\"). Don't worry, though, it doesn't sound dated at all: in fact, it's one for the ages. Not the ideal starting point for Hendrix, but far and away his best album.

B000002KDI|4.0|Sure, if you've heard the studio versions of these songs you know exactly what to expect. So what? It's still a lot of fun. This is divided into an acoustic and an electric half, much like Neil's career in general (damn I'm good!), and while there are a few minor disappointments (by-numbers \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and \\"Needle and the Damage Done\\"; an arena-rock \\"Like a Hurricane\\"; a joke, faux-reggae ending of \\"Cortez the Killer\\"), it's impossible not to rock out to the electric half (which includes my favorite take on \\"The Loner\\" and the classic \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\"), or mellow out the acoustic half (which features his rare single \\"Sugar Mountain\\"; an acoustic \\"Comes a Time\\" that fits the song much better - no stupid fiddle! YES!!!; the Buffalo Springfield tune \\"I Am a Child\\" and \\"My My Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\\"). And the loose, rambling closer \\"Tonight's the Night\\" is given more chilling power. Good album, in other words.
B000M5AJQI|3.0|I'm not going to review the movie, but I'm going to state some observation.  I bought the DVD version of the movie a while back, the limited edition with the metal casing.  Once I got my PS3, and I played the DVD on my PS3 with HDMI cable, and it looks AWESOME because it unconverted DVD's to 1080p.  But since I essentially have a BluRay player now, I'm eager to get my favorite movies on BluRay.  I got the BluRay version yesterday from Amazon, I popped in this edition in the PS3, and there are some obvervations I'm noticed.<br /><br />I don't see ANY DIFFERENCE between the Video quality.  I mean, there are some scenes like sceneries that I can see maybe a sharper picture, but I don't see a difference between picture quality between the excellent DVD transfer and the BluRay version.  So, I kind of wasted $25 on the BluRay version, and now the question is which do I sell.  I like the metal casing for the DVD version, but BluRay is BluRay, so.......<br /><br />Also, there is a special feature missing from the BluRay version, and it's the \\"Feature-Length TCM Career Profile Scorsese on Scorsese\\".  Don't know why they left it out, I mean BluRay has a lot of capacity, so why do that.  It makes the point of BluRay having more capacity than HD-DVD mute.<br /><br />I don't see a difference between the unconverted 1080p DVD and the BluRay edition, unless somebody can point it out to me.
B000006TZ8|5.0|I'd call this my favorite punk album, but the truth is it's about as far from punk as you can get. There's only one fast, furious rocker, and it's the strongest song here: the emotional, hook-filled punk ballad \\"To Be Someone (Didn't We Have a Nice Time)\\" is probably the most rewarding song in the Jam's catalogue. Of course, I've only heard two of their albums, so I can't say squat about their whole catalogue, but I do really enjoy the song. There's also a mid-tempo punk song, \\"A-Bomb on Wardour Street\\", and its guitar solo makes it a high point too. Anyway, this is a very diverse album: there's demented new wave (\\"Mr. Clean\\"; \\"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\\"), folk (the lovely, touching \\"English Rose\\"), folk-rock (\\"Fly\\"), music hall (A tremendous cover of the Kinks' satirical \\"David Watts\\"), Beatle-esque pop-rock (\\"It's Too Bad\\", with a funny interpolation of \\"She Loves You\\"; \\"The Place I Love\\", with a Creedence-like riff). Not only do they try all of these styles, they do well with each one: it's an ambitious, eclectic disc with strong songwriting that never forgets about the importance of the melody, even on the nastier songs (\\"A-Bomb\\"; \\"To be Someone\\"). This is nominal punk for people who don't think they don't like punk, but it's more than that: it's far-reaching, well-crafted, intelligent, funny, quirky, and a must-have by any standard.

B00003CXD5|5.0|The collaboration between director John Huston and Humphrey Bogart seven years after their memorable endeavor in \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", resulted in one of the finest action adventure films of all time, \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\".  The combination of a superior screenplay, penned by Huston himself, rugged outdoor Californian and Mexican scenery and terrific acting performances yielded a classic movie.  The central theme to this outstanding flick in man's unquenchable greed.<br /><br />Set in Tampico, Mexico in the mid 1920's, the film features Bogart playing down and out worker Fred C. Dobbs who teams up with buddy Bob Curtin played by Tim Holt.  Seduced by tales of gold prospecting spun by grizzled prospector Howard played by the venerable Walter Huston they pool their resources to fund an expedition into the remote unexplored Sierra Madre mountains.  Huston, who acted without his full upper denture, garnered an Oscar for his superb performance.  Huston, experienced in prospecting was well aware of the perils of such a trek and the pitfalls of striking it rich.<br /><br />As luck would have they strike it rich while eluding natures hardships and a pack of Mexican bandits led by a memorable \\"badgeless\\" gold sombreroed Alfonso Bedoya.  As the piles of gold dust grew, the greed for more and paranoia started setting in especially in the mind of Bogart.  Finally packing it in they set out back to civilization led by Huston who acted as the mother hen for Holt and Bogart, each guarding their own loot.<br />When Huston was coaxed by native Indians to return to their village Bogart and Holt were left to drive their pack of mules by themselves.  Bogart growing more and more covetous and paranoid eventually losing his mind, hatched a nefarious plot to double cross his partners.<br /><br />The irony of the tale plays itself out as film concludes with Hollywood justice meted out, as villains get their justifiable punishment.<br /><br />While the film was not initially a box office success it was nominated for best picture and produced Oscars for both Hustons, John for best director and screenplay writing and Walter for best supporting actor.  The film is now acknowledged as a cinematic classic regarded highly in many best movie lists.d for best picture and produced Oscars for both Hustons, John for best director and screenplay writing and Walter for best supporting actor.

B000Y179KO|3.0|Disc one is about three and a half stars, I guess, and disc two is maybe one and a half, so I feel I'm being quite generous here.    But first of all, I'd like to point out that I have all of the Eagles' albums, and the notion that I may have one or two that they're not making money off cannot wholly be discounted either.  Okay? So I'm actually a fan. Yay...  And I got this album as soon as it was released (here in Denmark you can just buy it like any other album, no Wallmart-clause). I put it on. \\"How Long\\" is really great, a catchy country-rocker. But wait, isn't that song about the same age as me? Yeah, at least. I've heard it sung by its creator, John David Souther.    Hm, that's a bit unsettling. The first single off the first \\"real\\" Eagles-album in 28 years is a cover?  Well, on to the next one. A typical, slightly bitter Don Henley-tune, \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\". It's quite good. And it's followed by a nice ballad sung by Glenn Frey, and another well-chosen cover, \\"Guilty of the Crime\\", sung by Joe Walsh. He has sung that one before, by the way, in 1995. A bit of recycling.  Then comes, yes, a third cover tune, a soft-rock song for Tim Schmidt. Good one, but not all that memorable.  And then another original. Wow. Don Henley sings the near eight-minute \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\". Good song. Not great, but certainly a good one.  Disc one beginds to wind down with the dull, 80s like synth-fest \\"No More Cloudy Days\\", the hideously dated \\"Fast Company\\", which must be a \\"Long Run\\"-reject, the mediocre Henley-composition \\"Do Something\\" (sung by Schmidt), and a decent Glenn Frey-number, the acoustic ballad \\"You Are Not Alone\\".    You see where I'm heading here, right? This album is a huge disappointment. But it's not really a surprise when you think about it. \\"The Long Run\\" was mediocre. And even \\"Hotel California\\" had one or two songs that pointed in this direction: Long and self-righteous. The Eagles have run out of Eagles-material, guys.    I really wanted to like thisalbum, but each time that I listen to it I like it less and less, and I've come to the conclusion that the people who give this album four and five stars muct be doing it because they're just so darn happy that Don and Glenn are recording again, and singing brand-new Eagles songs. Such as it is.    I won't go into details about the second disc. It's one of the most boring CDs I have ever listened to...not unlike Don Henley's equally boring, preachy and over-long compositions on the \\"Inside Job\\" CD.  There are one or two songs which are okay, the rest of disc 2 is forgettable or worse. \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\" completely lacks the melodies and the vitality of the Eagles' early-to-mid-70s albums, mixing instead the worst of Don Henley's tuneless, self-righteous preachings and Glenn Frey's dime-a-dozen 80s synthesizer ballads.  \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\" is too close to being a bad trip back to 1982 for my comfort. Disc one by itself would have been okay, but for such a great, great band to put out such a lousy CD as disc two actually tarnishes the Eagles' reputation. They should have left well enough alone.
B00005JPAO|4.0|I hadn't read much about the film before renting it so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />The film covers a few short months in the lives of the Royal family beginning at the election of Tony Blair and ending two months after Diana's death.<br /><br />The plot is slow moving. Don't expect action. Quiet moments of discussion between the Queen and different family or staff members fills the majority of the film.<br /><br />Interspersed between newscast reports of the details of Diana's death are scenes of reaction and struggle as the Queen stretches to do the right thing -- even though it may not feel proper.<br /><br />This is a very well acted study of characters placed in tough and unfamiliar situations.

B000VI70WM|4.0|Following on from the trite 'Astronaut' album, Duran Duran release 'Red Carpet Massacre'. This album is quite simply the best Duran Duran album since 'Big Thing' back in 1988. Fresh, slick, polished and melodic, this is Duran Duran evolving into something new.    First things first. Don't believe the rumours!! This is not an R'n'B album. To be honest I was expecting 12 dull R'n'B tracks the way people were going on about it, but that is just so misleading. This band has never stuck to one sound, they have always tried to be different, they change with the times, which is what makes Duran Duran special. They could just put their feet up and live off former glories, but they choose to try something new and exciting and here it pays off...big time!!    What I really like about this album is that unlike some previous Duran Duran albums, I don't have to skip tracks. Fabulous opener 'The Valley' sets the tone and then the albums title track just blows the whole thing wide open. I must admit to great concern about Duran Duran working with Timberlake & Timbaland, but as much as it pains me (I don't really like R'n'B!!).........it works!! 'Nite Runner and 'Skin Divers' are both infectious and melodic and fuse the Duran/Timberlake/Timbland sound together pefectly. 'Falling Down' is a good song, but it just lacks something. It has a languid feel and doesn't quite take off. I can't help thinking that it was the \\"safe\\" choice as the first single and probably not the greatest idea they could have gone with. 'Box Full O' Honey' is very simple, stripped down and laid back and is just stunning. 'Tempted' has to be a single, upbeat, catchy (stuck in my head!) and could fill the dancefloor, really great stuff. Instumental 'Tricked Out' is amazing and sounds like Duran Duran covering The Killers covering Duran Duran!! If that makes sense!! The Timbaland produced 'Zoom In' is a grower, didn't think much of it to start with, but eventually it worms its way into your head. In the same league as the brilliant 'Still Breathing' (the only GREAT song on Astronaut!), 'She's Too Much' is a touching melodic ballad that gets better and better with every listen, it is classic Duran Duran. Written by Simon LeBon for his daughter, the emotional message certainly gets across to the listener. Just when you think the album might tail off towards the end it doesn't. The last 2 songs on the album keep up the momentum. 'Dirty Great Monster' is great and has a 'Liberty' album feel to it....in a good way! 'Last Man Standing' is very catchy and sounds like a new Arcadia track and finishes the album off in fine style.    I really can't fault this album and I say that as a fan of 24+ years. Okay, so the Duran Duran on RCM don't sound anything like the Duran Duran from 1981, but did the Duran Duran on 'Notorious' from 1986 sound anything like Duran Duran from 1981 either?? Some fans see this album as \\"selling out\\", but they have got it so wrong. RCM sees Duran Duran moving on and showing creative progression, which is surely a positive thing, isn't it? Do we really want Duran Duran to turn into UB40 or Bon Jovi and stick with the same sound and end up with every song sounding exactly the same as the last? No thanks!     This album feels like it has been the most controversial album the band have ever made. Why? because of the fans. Duran Duran fans are VERY hard to please. How many times have I heard recently \\"Where's the bass?, there not enough bass!!\\". and the old favourite \\"Whats this?.....it doesn't sound anything like 'Rio'?!?!\\". And finally, I couldn't go without mentioning the 'ATFC' or as its better known the 'ANDY TAYLOR FAN CLUB', who are just a little bit bitter about Andy leaving the band. Nearly every 1 star bad review of this album that I have seen mentions Andy Taylor. Comments such as \\"This album is awful....no wonder Andy Taylor left!\\" and \\"Good on Andy Taylor....he left just in time!\\". I think that we get the message now folks, thank you. The funny thingis, I am an Andy Taylor fan myself and I appreciate his reasons for moving on and I can also see why he left, as the overall sound of RCM would not have suited his own style.    For anyone left wondering why such a glowing review has only got 4 stars, well I dropped the 5th star due to some classic dodgy Simon LeBon lyrics!! You'll know them when you hear them!!! In summary, RCM is a fantastic album and a truly great return to form for a band who have been doing this for nearly 30 years and hopefully for a little while longer yet.      Please open up your ears and enjoy.......I know I did.
B00000255F|5.0|If Bruce Springsteen in his entire career only wrote \\"Born to Run\\", he would still be enshrined in Rock n' Roll stardom and history.

It is Five O'Clock was the number one song in Italy for many weeks. Never got any recognition in the US though. There is too bad. Vangelis is a \\"genious\\" and one of the greatest Composer of all times. I really love all his music. Demis has such a sublime voice. Together they make glorious music.

The story includes several eclectic characters that add to its entertainment value. As a bonus, the cinematography is outstanding. If you're into blood and guts, or feel like a movie has to produce angst to be worthwhile, you won't like this one. For everyone else, it's well worth your time.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|I think this movie is great.  It has an all star cast.  The action never stops and the good guys win.  It's fun and something a girl could watch with a guy and not be bored.
B000063UR2|5.0|Ridley Scott is the best director out there when it comes to creating stunning cinematic beauty.  Watching \\"Legend\\" is literally like stepping into a fairytale. Seventeen year old Tom Cruise's future star power is already evident; Mia Sara is a charming heroine whose naivete destroys innocence and whose growth through suffering redeems her mistake.  Unfortunately, \\"Legend\\" and the equally visually breathtaking Blade Runner were the last two times that Scott used his unique visual gift to convey an equally beautiful moral message.  Since then he has diverted his exquisite talent to glamorizing the seamy side of life for Hollywood gold (e.g., in the Hannibal Lector films and in the recent American Gangster). \\"Legend\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" remind us of what we lost when he went commercial.
0679423001|5.0|After an unpleasant chance first encounter, protagonist and narrator Charles Ryder, a student at an unnamed Oxford University college (though critics have suggested Waugh used Hertford College as his model; in the television series Charles Ryder wears a St Edmund Hall tie), and Lord Sebastian Flyte, the younger son of an aristocratic family and himself an undergraduate at Christ Church, become friends. Sebastian takes Charles to his family's palatial home, Brideshead Castle, where Charles eventually meets the rest of the Flyte family, including Sebastian's sister, Lady Julia Flyte.    During the holiday Charles returns home, where he lives with his father. Scenes between Charles and his father Ned (Edward) provide some of the best-known comic scenes in the novel. During the holiday he is called back to Brideshead after Sebastian incurs a minor injury. Sebastian and Charles spend the remainder of the summer together.    Sebastian's family is Catholic, but only first generation: Lord Marchmain, an Anglican, converted to his wife's religion, Roman Catholicism. Religious considerations arise frequently among the family, and Catholicism influences their lives as well as the content of their conversations, all of which surprises Charles, who had always assumed Christianity to be \\"without substance or merit.\\" Charles is also put off religion by Lady Marchmain, Sebastian's mother, a devout Catholic who tries to control others through guilt and manipulation. Sebastian, in some ways a troubled young man, learns to find greater solace in alcohol than in religion, and descends into that habit, drifting away from the family over a two-year period, which occasions Charles' own estrangement from the Flytes. Yet Charles is fated to re-encounter the Flyte family over the years, and eventually forms a relationship with Julia, who by that time is married but separated from the wealthy but uncouth Canadian entrepreneur, Rex Mottram.    Charles plans to divorce his own wife -- who has been unfaithful -- so he and Julia can marry. However, motivated by a comment by her brother and by her father's deathbed return to the faith, Julia decides that she can no longer live in sin, and for that reason can no longer contemplate marriage to Charles. Lord Marchmain's reception of the sacrament of Extreme Unction also influences Charles, who had been \\"in search of love in those days\\" when he first met Sebastian, \\"that low door in the wall...which opened on an enclosed and enchanted garden,\\" a metaphor that informs the work on a number of levels.¹ Waugh desired that the book should be about the \\"operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters.\\"    During the Second World War, Ryder, now an army officer after establishing a career as an architectural artist, is billeted at Brideshead, once home to many of his affections. It occurs to him that builders' efforts were not in vain, even when their purposes may appear, for a time, to be frustrated.    This is a wonderful, well-written book, about nostalgia for a time that was rapidly disappearing, thrust aside for a much more harsher and more modern existence.   The book itself is a beautiful edition, and a lovely experience to read.
B000006MV8|4.0|Well Loved Then and Still Love it Now!  It stand the test of Time!  How ironic though; In the song \\"Perfection\\" the line says \\"So listen to my song of life.  You don't need a gun or a knife\\" Wow!, reflecting on these words now.  I wish we could have prevented the suicide of both Pete Ham and Tom Evans.  Heaven is rich!
0670034711|1.0|I understand the author's pain and respect her journey to heal her heart. However, I found the book woefully lacking in depth. I cannot fathom why people have found this book inspiring. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|The Corrs decided to do what they are good at. Or in other words, where they come from. This album features many of the greatest Irish songs of all time. I saw it first that I didn't love it at first. It's because I was expecting Corrs' style music not down to gritty pure Irish music. I decided to write this review it's because I think many of the listeners would feel the same way like I did but they didn't turn out to love it at the end.     I've to really give it up to the studio crew at dublin who helped them record this album. It sounds superb!!! Unbelievably clear sound. Especially when you have someone like Andrea that sings that well. It really needs nothing more but her voice to be heard. And yes, I'm saying it again. Andrea's voice is the key to this album. A lot of the melodies didn't come out directly from the instruments. Don't get me wrong though, there's still drums, percussions, violins, orchestra, guitars and etc.. as background foundation. But Andrea's voice just stands out in this album. There's not much his sisters voices. But it's okay since the songs are traditional. I really start to appreciate the heritage of their music. It's got its roots. This album might open up your ears and listen to more Irish music that's not heard by anyone.    The songs in this album were carefully selected so there's vocal part as well as some instrumental parts interchanging. To be honest, I still have no idea who originally wrote those beautiful tunes. All the songs are so romantic. If you're alone or with your loves one at home, I highly recommend you to play this CD and light a few candles in your living room. It's just the way I view how this music has to be played and listened.     All the instruments sounded just right. It blended particularly well since there's no pop editing involved in this album. It's all done with the Corrs instruments and an orchestra. I love the acoustic sounds. It's just a joy to listen to the fresh sounds like this. The other night Iwas listening to this album laying down on my bed. 'Brid Og Ni Mhaille' was suddenly playing on my computer. Guess what,..I really thought Andrea was singing in my room. If you don't believe, get this CD and feel it yourself. I was so so so hyped at that moment. I guess the main reason is because this song starts will her vocal only. Then second verse guitar comes into play. This song is recorded with Gaelic. I've not heard Irish language Gaelic in my life. Now I'm craving for more songs like this which means I'd listen to it again and again.     I love the following songs in partiular:  My Lagan Love - piano, vocal and the drums fused well. The vocal really stands out.    Spancill Hill - Who doesn't like acoustic guitars?! with bodhrán + violin outro twist. Oh wow. Splendid recording.    Black is the Colour - My favorite song in this album. I love the moody feel here. I love the lyrics.    Heart Like A Wheel - Love song with piano and Andrea's vocal. That's all you need for a song like this.    Brid Og Ni Mhaille - As long as you have this song playing. Andrea and Anto Drennen (Corrs guitarist) will be playing in front of you 24/7.    Old Town - studio version of their unplugged cover hit song.     There's also two instrumentals in this album. You can have breaks between all the love songs. You'll jump right out of your seat and start dancing along with the upbeat music.     If you enjoy the acoustic side of the Corrs. This would be what you'd enjoy. You can't really ask for more to have a CD features the traditional sounds of Ireland and the best family bands actually playing it. It's can't go wrong! I gave it five stars for all the aspects of this album, Quality of sound, album art (really nice), songs selections..    You might argue, hey those songs were not written by them. Right, I don't think people would've heard those masterpieces if the Corrs didn't make this album for the fans 'around the globe'. I'm a live example.     Hope you find this useful and always support CD quality music, get your own copy of this CD.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is for kids the way Harry Potter was for kids: it works for all ages.  People who say this is too scary for children ought to remember the dementors or the character deaths in the Potter series and (as another reviewer has said) the older Disney movies before deciding that their children would be too frightened.  It tells a great story for kids, about growing up and accepting responsibility, and yet manages to be a great fun movie for adults, too.  Glad to see that Disney is discovering anime, maybe it will give them some ideas for ways to improve their own recent films (Tarzan, anyone?)
B0010YSD7M|5.0|After a 10 year long run, I've just about hit the wall in my withdrawal symptoms of no more new SG1 when what in my inbox should appear?  The notice that I can pre-order the first Stargate SG-1 movie!   What a wonderful early Christmas present, even though the movie won't actually arrive until March.  But until then I can happily bounce around knowing it's coming! It's coming!!! :)
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the best anime films I've seen in years, and I've seen a lot.  Beautifully dubbed (although Billy Bob did throw me a little at first) and a near perfect script.  I like my books and movies a little more realistic, with believable, flawed characters with some ambiguity in their actions, otherwise, whether it's anime or not, it feels cartoonish.  This had everything I was looking for.  If you haven't seen this yet, why not???  It's better than a lot of real Hollywood dramas (most in fact0 that come out every year.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|SPIDERMAN REALLY IS THE 'BEST' COMIC-MOVIE SERIES EVER! YES, THIS HAD MORE FLAWS THAN SP2 WHICH WAS THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE, BUT THIS 'STILL' COMPLETES THE THRILLING TRILOGY..JUST OVERLOOK THE EERIE WACKY SIDE EFFECTS OF PETER PARKER'S VENOM PLOT AND THE DRAMA WITH M.J. THE MOVIE IS ACTUALLY 'GREAT'!!     ACTING, ACTION AND VILLAINS ARE 'STILL' IN TOP FORM...YES, THEY DID SQUEEZE IN TOO MANY VILLAINS, BUT AFTER WE ALREADY KNEW OF THIS A LONG TIME BEFORE, THIS WAS THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE TO COMBINE THEM ALL IN A BUSY STORY FOR PURE ENTERTAINMENT:    TO GET 1 LAST GOBLIN-GO-AROUND OUT OF THE WAY FIRST AT THE BEGINNING, WE MOVE INTO SANDMAN WHOSE REVEALED IN THE MOST SHOCKING WAY TO PETE, AND HIS BUGLE RIVAL EDDIE BROCK IS WELL-PLAYED BY 'THAT 70'S SHOW'S' TOPHER GRACE. ALTHOUGH THE 'CLASSIC VENOM' VILLAIN WAS UNFORTUNATELY  THE SHORTER ROLE (ONLY BECAUSE OF STAYING TRUE TO THE COMIC STORY OF PARKER'S FIRST-HAND SLIME ENCOUNTER) HE REALLY WAS THE MOST WELL-CRAFTED ENEMY OF SPIDEY! THE EFFECTS NEVER CEASE TO EXCEL AND THIS EVEN COMES TO A DRAMATIC ENDING OF A 4-WAY BATTLE WHICH IS SPIDEY'S TOUGHEST YET ON THE BIG SCREEN!!
0792165020|5.0|Great film, with much suspense and a richly atmospheric background.<br />All the leads and co stars  give great performances.<br /><br />A wonderful end of the decade and end of the millennial motion picture.
B000VSBX34|1.0|One of the first rules you learn in art school is, `You always cut the frame to fit the art, you never cut the art to fit the frame'.  This is out of respect to the artistic vision and the recognition of the frame as merely a subservient presentation tool.<br />  FULL-SCREEN was developed for kids who cannot tolerate any unused part of the old FULLSCREEN CRT TVs. Some people just don't get it.  I actually know someone who has a 65 inch SONY LCD WIDESCREEN TV but there is no way I can convince him that a FULLSCREEN DVD is actually a misnomer since FULLSCREEN format takes a WIDESCREEN image and crops off the right and left sides of the movie to square it off to fit on a standard TV.  He only buys FULLSCREEN versions of movies and then converts them to WIDESCREEN by distorting the image by stretching and cropping the top and bottom of the already cropped image to fill his widescreen TV screen!  It should be obvious to everyone that this bastardization of image is a plague of the mind to be avoided whenever possible.  Converting FULLSCREEN to WIDESCREEN is something only kids do who not only believe that bigger is always better, but also believe that includes any illusion of being larger.  Since the faces in a FULLSCREEN image look bigger on a WIDESCREEN TV, then the picture on a FULL SCREEN DVD must be bigger.  At no time can a person who thinks this way tolerate any unused part of their TV screen because unless every square inch of it is lit, they feel cheated somehow.  In order to get the entire ORIGINAL image of HELP on a WIDESCREEN TV, there must be unused space on the sides, but WIDESCREEN MANIA won't allow it.  Such is the ill logic that prevailed by the manufacturers of this DVD.<br />  In 1965 this movie, HELP! was originally filmed in British Standard of 1.6:1 or one and two thirds to one (wider than Full Screen) but the film was cropped on the top and bottom to create a FAKE WIDESCREEN effect for the American theatrical release in the USA WIDESCREEN standardof 1.75:1 or one and three-fourths to one.  When HELP was released in the US on TV it restored the top and bottom of the movie that was cropped for the US WIDESCREEN but the original 1.6 image was then cropped on the sides by using the pan and scan technique to fit on the TV FULL SCREEN of 1.3:1 or one and a third to one, and this pan-and-scan version has been previously released by Apple in their Beatles DVD Collector's Set if you want to compare images.<br /> For this DVD release, the movie was converted from the 1.75:1 (one and three-fourths to one) USA FAKE WIDESCREEN version to a WIDER SCREEN format of 16:9, as is stated on the box.  The top and bottom of the already cropped  movie image has been cropped again for this purpose, which is nothing less than a CRIME against art!!  This MORE FAKE WIDESCREEN version often decapitates any of the actors at the top of the frame, as well as one of the opening credits.  Why do we have to tolerate this? Please don't support this inanity foisted upon us by corporate idiots.
B00005JPNW|3.0|I have never read any of the books, so I entered the film with very little in the way of an expectation of what the plot would be.  Obviously I had seen the movie trailers, so I knew this was probably something in the NARNIA, ERAGON, perhaps even LORD OF THE RINGS vein.    First of all, it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that this movie is in same category as LOTR.  Those films dared to take their time to tell a story, stretching to epic length.  They developed characters we truly cared about.  And much of the films actually took place in real landscapes.  Think of all the breathtaking New Zealand locations that were used.    GOLDEN COMPASS is almost totally located in a CGI world.  Not for one second does it feel solid or tangible.  It's all very pretty to look at, but honestly it just feels a bit cold.  NARNIA was the same way...it needed some sets that were REAL.    In addition, COMPASS zooms through its story, taking virtually no time to establish characters beyond simple archetypes.  For instance, think of the character Sam Elliott plays.  He's an \\"aeronaut,\\" basically a pilot for hire (except he flies a motorized hot-air balloon concoction).  Basically, his character is that same guy that Sam Elliott always plays...twinkly eyes, big mustache, grizzled look.  That's it.  We like him, because we always like Sam Elliott.    Anyway, I haven't touched on the plot, which is what has gotten so many people in an uproar, apparently.  The story takes place in a \\"parallel\\" world, where people's souls live on the outside of them, are called \\"daemons\\" and take the shape of an animal of some sort.  This is a neat idea...and allows for some of the more fanciful special effects, as we get to see each animal that is attached to a person.  (For children, their \\"daemons\\" aren't settled yet, so the animal form will change.)  In this world, things seem to be run primarily by The Magesterium...a powerful group of what seems like semi-fascist folks who are against \\"free will.\\"It's my understanding that in the books, this Magesterium is clearly a reference to the catholic church.  That may be, but in the movie, it feels like a generic \\"big brother\\" type of organization.  Their goal seems to be to figure out how to separate children from their \\"daemons\\" so that they are left \\"soulless\\" or at least without the gumption to resist the Magesterium.  There seems to be any little real logic to any of this...we just have to accept it.    The young girl Lyra is entrusted with The Golden Compass, a device that \\"sees what is hidden.\\"  Naturally, the Magesterium are eager to get this from her, and to thwart her, they send Nicolle Kidman as a charismatic, glamorous woman of means to entice the girl to serve as her assistant.  Lyra learns fairly soon not to trust this woman, and suddenly she sets out on a quest to free the children who've been kidnapped so that their souls can be stolen.    I'm guessing my plot summary is a bit confusing...and frankly, trying to sort all the tangents, politics, allegiances, etc. is tricky, and ultimately not very interesting.  Mostly you just end up watching the movie in order to see all the spectacular scenes.  Are there are some.  The Ice Bears are impressive creations, and the big duel between a couple of them is a highpoint.  Daniel Craig, as Lyra's uncle, has a brief but exciting chase scene out on the frozen tundra.      So the special effects ARE pretty special, for the most part.  (Although I say again, I missed the tangibility of REAL landscapes.)  But the script is trying to pack in too much in short span of time.  The actors are more or less lost in the shuffle.  Kidman looks the part, and she's always been good at playing cold, insincere parts.  Craig has nothing to do, but his eyes look great.  The young lady who plays Lyra is pretty game and well cast.  But no one is going to win an Oscar for this film.  Costumes and makeup do most of the acting.    Even though the film runs just under two hours, I frankly found myself bored at times.  Ironically, I think that if the movie had been longer and taken the time to make us care about the character and to delineate what was at stake a bit better, I would have been more engaged.  As it was, it was mostly a piece of eye candy.
B00005JPNW|2.0|Pfffft.    Watching this movie is like listening to Paris Hilton reading Othello: we're fairly certain that we ought to be impressed by the material but there's no punch or muscle behind the vaguely epic plot to explain the various grandiose settings and overblown production.     Starring a whole slew of \\"Hey! It's...\\" A-list actors, \\"The Golden Compass\\" tells the tale of Lyra, an orphan girl living in a University in a version of Earth that's very different to our own. She's invited by the sinister Mrs. Coulter, an employee of the shadowy Magisterium, to accompany her on a mission to the North, where Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel is researching the mysterious properties of Dust (a mystical and feared substance). When Mrs. Coulter turns out to be something more than she first believed, Lyra escapes and goes on a quest to find her kidnapped friends, reinstate the king of the bears, free imprisoned children from the Magisterium's grasp and return the legendary truth-finding device known as the Alethiometer to her Uncle.     So much for the basic plot. Performance-wise, Dakota Blue Richards is very good as Lyra, and Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (for the two-and-a-half seconds he's actually IN this movie), Eva Green and Sam Elliot do perfectly passable jobs in their roles. There's not much of a chance to really act, given the limitations of the script and editing, and so the supporting human roles, as well as those voice roles filled by the likes of Sir Ian McKellen and Kathy Bates, fall kind of flat.     The script, for what it is, feels often like a mere explanation for the visual effects, as opposed to developing characterisation or furthering the story: it's not terribly memorable and contains nothing you'll not have seen before.     The visuals are amazing, for the most part: top-drawer art and production design coupled with some gorgeous CGI make for some very compelling scenes - there are really only one or two points (Lyra riding on the back of Iorek Byrnison immediately springs to mind) where things look fake. The bottle-of-orange-soda effects when the Alethiometer is doing its thing do begin to grate after a while, though, and the Witches look just like every other Evanescence Emo-wannabe you'd love to smack with a broomstick. But, for the most part, \\"The Golden Compass\\" is a visual treat.    The editing is really what lets \\"The Golden Compass\\" down: scenes jump from conflict to resolution at a disappointingly rapid pace, and there's absolutely no chance to develop a sense of connection with any one character because of the lack of time spent on any one situation. Also, the direction is infuriatingly pedestrian: in \\"About A Boy\\" Chris Weitz proved himself capable of more than silly little American Pie tragedies, but here, he seems to be out of his depth as the potential of Lyra's world and the stunning effects and art of \\"The Golden Compass\\" go largely unexploited.    This is a very disappointing movie: if you've read the books then don't waste an evening in theatres watching this: a one-time DVD rental will be enough to satisfy your curiosity. Check out \\"Stardust\\", \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" or \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" instead of this one: they;re far, far more rewarding and much better made movies.

Just ordered & got the remaster and this one-off with Steve Vai at the writing helm along with Bonnett on most tracks -- one helluva listen!! You can always expect the un-expected from Vai,and his involvement on 'Disturbing The Peace' was VERY noteworthy. I still remember listening to this on vinyl when it came out in '85,and my jaw just dropped as I heard these tunes! I'm not a huge fan of Bonnett's vocals normally,but here he seems to jell perfectly along with Vai's guitar histrionics.An overlooked gem,for sure.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Hey kids, guess what?  Creed is gone.  Done.  Over.  Never to return.  Get over it. The band left Scott Stapp and formed this supergroup. Alter Bridge has already given us a stunning debut album with \\"One Day Remains\\". However, all the Creed fans either didn't know who was in the band, or didn't want their band to be over.  Sales in the US were pathetic for such an incredible  hard rock record.  Mark Temonti (lead guitarist) already had most of the music and lyrics before new lead singer Myles Kennedy came aboard.  This guy has a three-octave vocal range, and he lets go on the first album, with Tremonti's guitar work blowing away anything he ever did with Creed.  Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips hold down the rhythm section, with Phillips really coming into his own on the skins.  Why so much about the first album?  Because \\"Blackbird\\" rocks even harder!  Tremonti is a new guitar god, and Kennedy not only writes and sings, but plays guitar on this one as well. Look them up on YouTube and watch the video for \\"Rise Today.\\"  Then, go buy both albums!
B000P0J024|4.0|We've enjoyed this album.  Great for road trips.  Received promptly and in great condition.  Thanks.
B000WGNLLW|4.0|Well, perhaps surprised isn't the best word, but more on that in a minute.    I must admit I was hesitant when I heard my favorite band was working with Timbaland and Timberlake.  Now, I said they were my favorite band, but I don't think they are the best band in the world, so I think you can take my review seriously, and not just as tripe from some starry eyed fan.  Anyway, I really believe this has some legitimate hits on it.  While I think the two Timba tracks are perhaps the weakest (Nite Runner and Skin Divers) they do seem to have some mass market appeal as evidenced by all the commentary on the net.  I highly recommend the tracks \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" \\"Falling Down\\" (co-written by Timberlake) \\"Box Full O' Honey\\" and \\"Zoom In\\" for any fence sitters.  While not quite as \\"Duran Duran\\" as 2004's Astronaut, this album still proves the band is viable.  Give it a listen.  Fans new and old won't be disappointed.
B000001E29|5.0|What a perfect project for Tom Waits! Like Woyzeck (Blood Money), not to mention Alice, The Black Rider (Der Freischutz) is perfectly complimented by Waits' inimitable style(s). Carnival music (which is just the creepy version of a waltz anyway) and avant-garde orchestrations brought a whole new aspect of Tom Waits to the foreground at the time. Now, he's done the aforementioned albums and so, looking back, it only seems natural.    William S. Burroughs (of which I'm a huge fan as well) co-wrote many selections and is even featured vocally on \\"TAint No Sin\\". So, his inclusion is even more of a treat, which shows why this is my biased review, as well favourite album.     I do agree with the previous reviewers here, in that I would not recommend this album as an introduction to Waits. Other more accessible albums would be better (perhaps Alice, Heartattack and Vine, Rain Dogs, Heart of Saturday Night - maybe even Real Gone). Nevertheless, once you're initiated, there's no better album in the Tom Waits' catalog.
B000V1Y43W|2.0|And I'm really sorry to say it.  I love nearly anything Disney, and the same goes for Pixar. As an adult writing this for other adults, this may be less a review, and more of a bewildered diatribe. I wish I could put my finger on it exactly what was missing here.  It just didn't seem to have the magic of Toy Story 1 or 2, The Incredibles or Finding Nemo.  I also loved A Bug's Life.  However, Monsters Inc. kind of fell flat for me as well.  The voice acting in Cars from Owen Wilson and Paul Newman was serviceable, to be sure.  The animation was top notch as well.  There is just something missing with the heart of the movie.  I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one, but if you are looking for the the sweet, heartwarming type of movie as the ones I previously mentioned, look elsewhere.  Children, however, will probably not miss the absent sense of wonder.

B000BT97AO|3.0|The Jim Henson Company teamed together with Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman to bring to life this fantastical tale about a young girl, named Helena (Stephanie Leonidas),struggling into maturity. Helena is a part of a family of circus performers. Even though she spends her free time thinking about fantasy worlds, Helena longs to have a more normal teenage life away from the circus. After a terrible fight with her parents, her mother (Gina McKee) grows very ill and Helena blames herself for her mother's sudden illness. On the evening of her mother's surgery Helena seems to dream herself into a strange world where all the inhabitants wear masks to hide their true selves. The world is in terrible trouble and is being swallowed by a black nothing apparently because of a conflict between the Queen of Light and the Queen of Shadows. The Queen of Light is deathly ill and can only be healed if Helena retrieves an object known as the Mirrormask from the Queen of Shadows. The world is full of stunning beauty and vivid images, including tethered floating giants, moving books, and (my favorite characters in the entire movie) monkey birds. Helena initially believes that the experience is just a dream, but learns that her journey is possibly something much, much more.<br /><br />Visually speaking, MIRRORMASK is a remarkable film. The film had a relatively small budget, yet there are some things in the film that are more visually astounding in my opinion than in many big-budget fantasy epic films. The music in the film is also very impressive; I was enchanted so much by the score that I find myself listening to parts of the soundtrack in my mind weeks after I had seen the film. Yet, that's pretty much all MIRRORMASK is. The characters are not very well developed and the pacing of the story is incredibly slow. The movie combines elements from two other Jim Henson Company films, THE DARK CRYSTAL and LABYRINTH as well as elements from THE NEVERENDING STORY. However, those films succeed on a level that MIRROMASK does not because the audience actually cares about the characters in those movies.<br /><br />It's disappointing because MIRRORMASK could have been such a great movie. I don't think there are too many people who will enjoy watching this movie. I'd recommend it for fans of Neil Gaiman, for people who have to see every Jim Henson Company movie, and for film fans (because of the visual elements).a level that MIRROMASK does not because the audience actually cares about the characters in those movies.<br /><br />It's disappointing because MIRRORMASK could have been such a great movie.

I wouldn't have cared had it not been a gift.  May have arrived a bit nicer had it been in a bubble wrap envelope or a hard cardboard envelope.  I would probably order from them again if it was just for myself to read.

B000VNMMR0|3.0|It's a lot of fun to watch, but not even close to being believable anymore.  Somehow the first DH movie made you think this stuff going on was almost possible, and McClain was a human being.<br /><br />He must be made of rocks or was replaced with a robot for DH4, because he's basically become the terminator.  Oh yeah, why the tired old \\"he gets shot in the shoulder\\" bit again? Jeesh
B000K06432|5.0|There is no good way to summarize this truly unique book.  It's not actually one book--it's a three.  On one level, it's a textbook of philosophy, rolling back over important ground often missed by more scholarly works.  Beneath that it is a book about motorcycles and touring, taking you to why do it, and how to make it a pleasant experience.  Beyond that, and even more earthshakingly, it takes you into a man's personal struggle with his personal demons and history on a cross-country trip with his son.<br /><br />No other book can I re-read again, and again, each time taking new layers and subtleties from a painfully honest and open review of one man's world, from how to use a wrench, to living a quality life.  After a dozen reads, I stopped counting how often but each and every read has replenished my mind and soul.

B000YABV90|5.0|Enough's been written about the movie, so I won't 'review' it or tell you the story. I'll just say that it has been a long time since I cried in a movie hall... and there I was, sitting in the theatre with tears streaming down my face!     I've seen a lot of movies recently, but this one is Great. It's like a fairytale yes, but it is a very touching & moving fairytale. Do yourself a favour: watch it!
0440238609|5.0|Since I have been bugged for not giving a product description in my reviews, I will get that over with. These are amazing book, no one \\"kills\\" God, the representation of God dies after living a life oppressing the multi-verse and while arrogant peoples who want to follow their faith without thinking for themselves will disagree, it's not far from truth.       When Phillip Pullman wrote these books, he was NOT promoting atheism. That's a very selective and arguably small audience. He was making an  allegory on how people in our day and age live for the afterlife.       Before posting a comment calling me arrogant, Monotheists, consider the following.       If in the final seconds of life, you look back on your life, in the reasonably large chance there is nothing more, no Heaven or Hell, will you say you lived a good life worshiping something that wasn't there?       I'm sure there's people out there who agree with me. And after the dismal results at the cinemas, whether you agree with my views or not, I say we do exactly what Phillip Donahue did to us; make Prince Caspian a failure and ensure there to be no more Narnia films since he did that to the vast amount of fans of His Dark Materials.       I don't no how to make a website, but I say someone does. We can stand up as a force and not go see Prince Caspian. When it fails, poor little Donahue will cry himself to sleep wondering what's become of the world.       THIS IS NOT AN ANTI-CATHOLIC OR PLUS-ATHEISM IDEA! THIS IS TOO PULL SO CALLED CHRISTIAN FILMS DOWN ALONG WITH THE SO CALLED ATHEIST FILMS! THE GOLDEN COMPASS MOVIE WAS VAAAAASTLY SUPERIOR TO NARNIA AND AS SUCH< IT DESERVES BETTER! TOGETHER WE CAN GET A SEQUEL, BY DRAGGING THE OTHERS DOWN!

B0000DIJO2|5.0|This will be short but informative by only asking a couple of questions from YOU! Which generation of The Bee Gees did you like:<br /><br />1. Their beginnings in the 1960s?<br />2. Their disco era peak?<br />3. In between the two eras?<br /><br />IT DOESN'T MATTER! If you were/are a Bee Gees fan, this is a wonderful Vegas production of their final appearance. The direction and use of multiple cameras and as others have mentioned, fantastic sound make this a must have DVD.
1932100660|5.0|This is a great book.  A very well written, fast and easy read, it exposes facts about the traditional American diet which will forever change the way you eat and feed your children.  Dr. Campbell is a brilliant Professor at Cornell University with five decades of experince in nutrition science.  The book reveals the ideal diet - what to eat and what to avoid - and discusses the fallacies in the \\"food pyramid\\" which we have all assumed to be based on sound science and governmental agency action in the public interest.  This is an imprtant book which should be part of the standard curriculum in every High School.  I buy several copies at a time and give it as a gift to family, friends, my doctors and others I care about.  Buy this book.

B00001U0E1|4.0|London,1593.Queen Elizabeth is on the Throne,two famous playwrights Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare rule the theatre and women are forbidden to act on stage.That's the truth.Now the rest is all the hilarious and witty conjecture of Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.Anyone familiar with Stoppard's other famous spoof on Shakespeare,ROSENKRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD,knows that Stoppard's works are filled with one liners and so many references to Shakespeare's characters and writings, that one almost needs to be a true Bard Officienado  to take all of it in! (I am not-but I know enough).Stoppard and Norman place us in the time when Shakespeare has writer's block and is need of a Muse to inspire him.The result will be his \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and eventually his \\"Twelth Night\\".Shakespeare,a comically tuned Joseph Fiennes discovers his inspiration in Lady Viola de Lessups,Gwyneth Paltrow,whose chief love is poetry and the theatre.She disguises herself as a man in order to be on stage, and thus begins the love affair and the comedy.  Though I have seen this film several times over the years and genuinely like it, I still find it tedious at times and unnervingly frantic.I especially do not like the clumsy editing and cutaways that that are very obvious.What I do like is the acting of Joseph Fiennes who I feel is the best that this film has to offer.Other roles that seemed to have gone unnoticed were a very funny Ben Affleck and Imelda Staunton.  I did and still do not feel this should have won the top prize at the Oscars,but I do find it an enjoyable jaunt every time I take the trip.

0792165020|5.0|I am not exactly sure why, but I have really grown to love this film over the years,rather than the nebulous feeling I had about it when it was a theatrical release.Probably because I just saw the other \\"Ripley\\" film,RIPLEY'S GAME and felt rather blah about it is my most current response.Whatever it is, Matt Damon and Anthony Minghella's taught script and direction riveted me to the sofa.What a vacuum of a character Patricia Highsmith created in her 1955 novel.What I think is great about this adaptation is the way in which Damon presents Ripley as a \\"master sponge\\" who can soak up any personality around him and then discard the original host thus becoming less the original Ripley and more now a new creation.In one of the last lines of the film,Ripley turns to his friend/\\"lover\\" and sobs,\\"Tell me something good about Tom Ripley.\\" Matt Damon's performance is what is good about Tom Ripley.I am glad that I have gone back to this film over the years.With a supporting cast like Cate Blanchett,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Jude Law and to a still lesser degree Gwyneth Paltrow,and a soundtrack that moves to the nth degree by Gabriel Yared,this is a Minghella film that grips me.I now can safely assert the 5 star rating! LOVE IT!

0141439807|3.0|I've read \\"Mansfield Park\\" three times so far in a desperate attempt to like it as much as Jane Austen's other books (I even love Northanger Abbey, which NO ONE likes anymore), but it seems to get a little worse each time.  While it's still worth sitting down and enjoying once, it's a lot more dependant on the tastes and principles of Austen's period than any of her other works, and it seems like on re-reading the good points don't get much stronger while its flaws glare out more and more.<br /><br />There is much to enjoy in Mansfield Park.  Austen's stock characters (the dominating but foolish old woman, the wise but emotionally absent father, the charming young man who does not quite deserve the main character in spite of his attractions), appear in sharper relief than any of her other novels.  Mrs. Norris is too horrible for me personally to laugh at most of the time, but her blindness to her own hypocrosy and the sheer absurdity of her judgement will be appreciated by most other Austen fans.  The Crawfords are two of her most intricately created and fascinating characters, and truly steal any scene either of them is included in.  This novel has been called her \\"most autobiographical\\" work, and though I don't see any similarities between the personality revealed in her letters and that of her main character, Fanny's position as the poor dependant on a rich family is much closer to Austen's own than any of her other heroines, and the amount of sympathy for this Cinderella-type heroine will be appreciated even by readers who are not very interested in Jane Austen herself.<br /><br />But I can't help but feeling that while her other novels have a transcendant universality (Pride and Prejudice will always work no matter how much our culture changes), Mansfield Park is very wedded to one time and place.  To a modern reader, the main character, Fanny Price, is almost unlikable for at least the first half of the book.  You pity her, definitely, but she's so timid and such a wet blanket that it's hard to feel any real identification.  She is the wisest and kindest character in the book, but spends most of the early chapters in a state of guilt-ridden terror from her assumed inferiority and her inability to live with the fact that she cannot love an aunt who has been nothing but nasty to her her entire life.  In the latter half of the novel, she gets better as she grows enough of a backbone to at least trust her own judgement, but she's still really an example of a dead feminine ideal that a modern woman just can't admire.  While we still value common sense, moral fiber, and a generous and forgiving heart, conviction of one's own inferiority is not really a desirable trait.<br /><br />This is the most consistant flaw of the book, but there are others almost equally troubling.  Without revealing whom she ends up with, Fanny's early revealed crush on her cousin Edmund, whom she meets when he is sixteen and she is nine, gets more disturbing by the year.  Not only is love between first cousins considered incestuous now (at least in the US), but the way he considers her his adopted sister, and actually calls her his favorite sister, adds a whole new level of creepiness for anyone raised in a culture in which adoptive family ties are looked at in the same way as blood ties.  Then the often-cited fact that he \\"shaped her mind\\" by being the only member of the family who seriously talked to her and recommended all her reading material makes it still worse for me, because there's something about Pygmalion-type relationships that really freaks me out.  Anyone who joins me in this is sure to be disturbed.<br /><br />The sole remaining flaw is that three readings in, I can't make any sense of what it's supposed to mean that Sir Thomas makes his living as a slave trader.  Though we're suspicious early on because of his frequent business trips to Antigua, when it finally is confirmed that this is what he does, none of the characters attatches anymoral stigma to it, not even Fanny.  Nor does the narrator weigh in on his profession during any of the frequent asides that judge the members of this family more harshly than her protagonist.  It made even less sense when I learned that Jane Austen herself was a confirmed abolitionist in real life.  Can it really be that its only purpose is to draw a comparison with Fanny's situation?  Maybe even an abolitionist of that time could be ill-informed enough about what the slave trade actually entailed to use it as a metaphor without much thought, but no one picking it up today has the luxury of that kind of ignorance.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's a must read for anyone scholarly interested in Jane Austen, and still enjoyable enough to be worth reading for any casual fan of her other books.  But save your money and use your library card.  It's  not something you're going to want to read again.
140120306X|2.0|Moore and O'Neil's latest installment of their now famous League (the hardback in the series), is visually splendorous but inevitably boring and poorly plotted. Moore gets lost in his references very early. As for Kevin O'Neil (the artist behind this adventure): well, he never fails to please as the artist behind LXG, and here is no exception--if you're solely for the art, well, go get this book.<br /><br />In LXG Volume One, Moore sets his unique, humorous and decidedly adult twists on these pulp characters just as he adeptly links their worlds into a sprawling fictional universe. In LXG Volume Two, our old friends grow into the dangerous risks, possible loves, and superheroic potentials that Moore sets up--and they already seem like old friends by this point, if somewhat terrifying old friends. But where Moore's original Leagues seem like celebrations of old pulps and other fantastical tales, Black Dossier seems less a celebration and more an indulgence into Moore's impractical world views and towering intellect. And although Moore certainly has these former traits in spades, they are not, nor have they ever been the only things that make his work so transcendent, and perhaps more disappointing still: Moore is intelligent enough to know this, and he is neglecting his obligations as a story-teller in this book.<br /><br />The Black Dossier in some ways is an ultimate reunion for his fans: at the end of Volume II Moore separates his age-defying lovers, Allan Quatermain (from King Solomon's Mines, among others) and Mina Murray (or Mina Harker, from Bram Stoker's Dracula), and here we find them lovers united and stronger in love than ever--but much to the failing of this volume, he leaves this far in the past, and begins with a vague explanation of the dangers that this couple now face. Stealing the Black Dossier, a hidden (if strangely neglected) file filled with Allan and Mina's past exploits, the couple flee from a stable of newly arranged Extraordinary gentlemen, a petulant, misogynistic, gadget-infested James Bond among them. And then Allan and Mina begin reading this Dossier, and when they open this folio so too must the reader, turning the page to find prose, postcards, illustrated books, and many other wonderful little mediums BESIDES comics within. And, as some of loyal Moore readers know, Moore is stuffy and a tad too purple when writing prose. When he writes his comics, these incredibly wordy and descriptive passage fall into his instructions for his artists, but here Moore crams and crams, and he is as dense, if not denser, than any of the mediums (and the popular writers in said mediums whom he emulates) which he works in. In Moore's other volumes he offered his prose as ancillary, if mildly entertaining backstories to his major throughlines. In Black Dossier, these subsections are in the majority, and  though most do not exactly serve the plot (but do serve to hash out Moore's new characters, of which we don't care much about, because Moore hasn't properly introduced them to us in his comic), the reader will certainly be clueless unless they pay close attention. More often than not, however, I felt much like Allan Quatermain on first reading these lengthy gender-bending, sex-filled, and satire-filled passages: I fell asleep.<br /><br />One immediately experiences the overwhelming sense that a host of esoteric penny-dreadful, pulp, and children's lit references are populating this world--a host of references that the average reader will have little knowledge of. And where Moore deftly engages his readers in finding out such things ONLY IF THEY WANT TO in his previous Leagues, here the reader is all but lost if they chose to skip the once optional subsections.<br /><br />Moore's a master plotter, capable of juggling multiple story-lines and character-developments and twists and turns. We know this because we have read him doing it. And we also know Moore's exhaustive, beautiful implementations of research. But we also know Moore's literary, philosophical, and pomo metafiction tendencies.<br /><br />Moore is at his best when checked by his propensity for the telling of a good yarn, and his love for visual storytelling: unfortunately, Moore's intelligence here gets the best of him, and though he throws in a token dose of action and sex for levity, he mainly mires under the crippling weight of trying to keep every single character of pulp fiction linked together, not in the potential for interesting dynamics between characters, or the occasional \\"low-minded\\" plot-point that makes most readers turn pages, and keeps most books (and especially comic books), as dynamic and compelling as they are.phical, and pomo metafiction tendencies.

B00018D44U|3.0|Unlike a lot of reviews of less than 5 starts, I enjoy the music on this CD.  If you enjoy the sound of Norah's voice, you'll like the CD if you can put up with:  The recording quality of this CD is horrible.  Most songs have clipping or distortion no matter what system I play it on.  The higher the end system the more obvious the recording has issues.  If I wanted a low quality version of her music I would have just downloaded it from iTunes.
B000YAF4OS|4.0|My parents saw this movie and said it was alright but the ending sucked. The movie starts off like The Twilight Zone and its really creepy. A siren wails and this is where the movie takes off. I thought it was kind of dumb when the monster comes in because it looked so out of place. The monsters were never really explained expect for the part where they say the army was at fault. Cool monsters though. I thought the ending was alright but dont go see this movie expecting answers. Overall some good soild acting but a few members in the cast and a few moments of terror. Even a few laughs were thrown in for good measure. Good but I still like 1408 by King better.
B00005JPNW|2.0|Philip Pullman's stated plan is to \\"undermine the basis\\" of Christianity. \\"The Golden Compass,\\" the movie version of part one of Pullman's trilogy of novels, is an inept and chaotic film whose flimsy philosophical underpinnings are nothing more than a self-deluding narcissism that could only appeal to a sophomoric consciousness.<br /><br />As bad as it is, \\"The Golden Compass\\" deserves at least two stars. Nicole Kidman -- the swanky, evil Mrs. Coulter -- reveals yet again that her gifts, in addition to flawless beauty, include acting finesse and fierce craft. Daniel Craig (Lord Asriel) is one of the sexiest men alive; it is criminal that \\"The Golden Compass\\" uses him for only about ten minutes. Given how little Craig is onscreen, he really should be listed as a cameo, rather than as a featured player. The suggestion of a relationship between masterful, macho, Asriel and tragic ice queen Coulter is delicious; Kidman and Craig's pairing in just these roles would ignite the screen. But they share no screentime.<br /><br />The special effects are very pretty to look upon, indeed.<br /><br />As a movie, though, \\"Golden Compass\\" is all computer generated gimmickry, geegaws and gimcracks. If watching a computer generated bear talk with Ian McKellan's voice makes your day, \\"The Golden Compass\\" is for you.<br /><br />Me? I felt like I was lost in a shopping mall overstuffed with cheap, lead-impregnated, Chinese import toys during holiday rush hour. For fantasy to work, the fantasy world has to have internal logic and address deep truths. Viewers who have never traveled to Oz all know, within minutes of first watching the \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", that Dorothy needs to cling to the Ruby Slippers, and that the Wicked Witch covets them. \\"There's no place like home\\" resonates for us all. There is no similar internal logic or truth in \\"The Golden Compass.\\"<br /><br />Characters lack depth and arrive merely to fill some gapping hole in what passes for a plot. When the heroine, Lycra, is lost in the Arctic, a Texas cowboy on a dirigible shows up to rescue her. Sure, why not? It may as well have been Amelia Earhart. Some will find this disregard of coherence charming; I found it to be the most shameless deus ex machina. Ironic that Pullman wants to kill God; this cinematic \\"Compass\\" can't function without resort to a god from the machine.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that the main character is a heroine. We are supposed to celebrate Pullman's feminism. Hogwash. Lycra is as pretty as Botticelli's Venus and she's, for the most part, as passive as a 1950s Disney cartoon princess. A talking bear rescues her, a cowboy rescues her, a sky-ful of CGI witches rescues her, even the evil villainess, Mrs. Coulter, rescues her. If Lycra shows creativity, courage, or spunk, never mind a convincing adolescent girl's character, it must have been while I was dozing off. And Mrs. Coulter's purely feminine evil is misogyny at its ugliest.<br /><br />For a story that wants to be revolutionary, \\"The Golden Compass\\" is entirely retro. The fantasy world is, of course, England, just as it is in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", \\"Narnia\\" and \\"Harry Potter.\\" Nobody writes blockbuster fantasy novels about Yiddish-speaking characters; no one has yet given us a blockbuster fantasy world set in New Jersey. That would be too real, too gritty, too working class. And fantasy England is not today's England, of course, a multicultural land of active trade unions. This is Victorian England, when the sun never set on Pullman's ancestors' empire and the lower classes knew their place. Servants, in Pullman's world, are accompanied by docile and loyal doggy daemons. In short, meet the new boss, same as the old misogynist, classist, imperialist boss.<br /><br />The musical score kept trying to do what the story could not, standing there, hands on hips, shouting, \\"You should care about this scene! It's very climactic!\\"<br /><br />And I kept wanting to shout back, \\"Blast, it's the movie's job to construct a story that makes me feel like the battle is climactic, even if it is filmed silently, as Kurosawa did it! Lay off with the endless crescendos, already!\\"<br /><br />The bad guys are priests who inhabit a rectangular version of Vatican City, \\"The Magisterium.\\" \\"Magisterium\\" is, of course, the Latin word for the teaching authority of the Catholic Church. Christianity kidnaps and tortures little children, lies about \\"dust\\" (had to keep from sniggering during the \\"dust\\" scenes) and is responsible for all evil in the world. In short, \\"The Golden Compass\\" is to Christianity what \\"Birth of a Nation\\" is to African Americans or \\"The Eternal Jew\\" is to persons of the Jewish faith.<br /><br />Outside the evil Magisterium, everyone is good and kind and noble and peaceful. So, they have to eliminate persons of faith in order to make the world a better place.<br /><br />Atheists tried to do just that during the last century, in the Soviet Empire, in Mao's China and in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.

B000KRNG5E|5.0|Let's face it, when making a follow-up to a perfect film like Suspiria it's going to be hard to live up to those expectation's, but I really think Argento deliver's with this one. Inferno is the second film in the \\"Three Mother's Trilogy\\" by Argento (about the mother of darkness), with the first being Suspiria (mother of sigh's), and the last one titled Mother of Tear's, which has just  been made now and shown at film festival's as we speak. Argentos' Inferno follow's a lot of the same theme's and imagery as Suspiria did, but instead of dealing on theme of witch-craft, deal's more with the theme of alchemy. It has the same beautiful cinematography, vibrant color's, and attention to detail that Suspiria has (maybe even a little more), and a very dark and beautiful nightmarish quality that only Argento can deliver. Argento film's are usually lumped into two catagorie's: Supernatural thriller's (Suspiria, Inferno) and murder mystery's (Deep Red, Tenebre), and while it's hard for me to choose, I'd have to say I love his supernatural stuff the most. Inferno has a good amount of special effect's, stylistic murder's and good gore scene's (probably a little more than Suspiria in my opinion) that are very well done, and Mario Bava also helped out with some of the the visual effect's for some of the scene's. I'm so sick of hearing people say that Inferno is hard to follow and incoherant. The plot is very simple, you just have to pay attention to it. It make's perfect sense, but you must have an attention-span greater than a five year olds'!!!!! Italian director's do not spell out every little detail of the for the viewer's like American movie's, they try to make you piece together the puzzle through dioluge and character's actions, instead of literally describing the plot in full detail, which I really love about them, and find flattering to my intelligence. The score for Inferno is one of my favorite score's ever for a horror film and is f*****g amazing to say the least, although it is not performed by Goblin (who did all the great Argento score's), it is still f*****g amazing, I can't wait to pick up the soundtrack. Inferno is a very worthy sequel to Suspiria in my opinion, and one of my favourite movie's of all time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!hough it is not performed by Goblin (who did all the great Argento score's), it is still f*****g amazing, I can't wait to pick up the soundtrack. Inferno is a very worthy sequel to Suspiria in my opinion, and one of my favourite movie's of all time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!
0765318741|3.0|What's good about this book:<br /><br />Richard Matheson did a superb job creating the bleak, horrific world that  Neville inhabits, as the sole human survivor of a plague that has turned the world into a living nightmare filled with the undead.  He does a magnificent job getting into Neville's tortured mind as the vampire slayer struggles to find a way to cure the illness that is the true cause of civilization's demise.  You can taste a little of the ordeal the character goes through in his battle to make some sense of his life in a world surrounded by the dead.<br /><br />What's bad:<br /><br />The ending.  Late in the story Matheson takes it in a completely different direction, abandoning the human versus vampire theme that occupies the first two thirds of the book.  He replaces it with an odd, rushed through climax to the story that left me wondering \\"where did he get that from?\\"<br /><br />There are also numerous holes in the story.  What, for example, is the difference between a \\"living\\" and a \\"dead\\" vampire?  Why didn't Neville watch the vampire named Cortman as he headed back to his hideout as dawn broke?  Why were his final adversaries so hostile, when they knew he had done invaluable research on the infection and might have vital information?<br /><br />For that matter, why develop the whole story line of Neville studying the vampires from a scientific perspective, when it essentially led nowhere?<br /><br />And why do stakes succeed where bullets fail, if Neville's theory of the vampire's Achilles' heel is correct?  Either one would allow oxygen to get into their systems.<br /><br />Overall the story impressed me with Matheson's talent as a wordsmith, yet made me feel he didn't think the plot out very well before publishing the story.<br /><br />If you enjoy good writing then the story is worth reading for that reason alone.  But don't expect to put the book down and say \\"wow, what a great story!\\"  That is, unless you have a penchant for confusing, depressing, implausible finales to otherwise great tales.
B00002RAOU|4.0|Bay of Blood single-handedly invented the slasher sub-genre with it's use of a high body count (around a dozen), ton's of gratuitius nudity, and it is the first movie to use the first person camera from the murderers' point of view. Some of special effect's are a little dated now, but they are pulled off very well for their time (70), and this is a very stylistic murder mystery. The only reason I gave this four star's is because there are a lot of character's in the story, because of that it becomes a little disjointed and hard to follow. Also, sometime's the cinematography is a little too experimental with constant fade's, zoom-in's, zoom-out's ect., and even though I usually enjoy experimental cinematography, I thought they went a little overboard. Overall it was a highly enjoyable slasher/giallo with a good plot and stylistic kill's, but I think it could have been better.
B000QXDED6|5.0|This film takes quite a bit of dramatic license in presenting the story of 300 Spartans, led by one of their kings, who stood against the armies of Xerxes as the Persian Empire attempted to annex the Greek states. The Persian Empire, composed of many conquered peoples, represented the autocratic despotism of the slave state while the Greeks, for all their faults, represented the future of western civilization. Having invented democracy, a usable phonetic alphabet, rhetoric and philosophy the Greeks and their culture would have a long-lasting impact that would last right up to modern times. Had Xerxes managed to defeat the Spartans under Leonidas quickly and destroy the various Greek states before they could fully mobilize then the spark which lit our civilization would have been snuffed out.<br /><br />It is interesting that Sparta, which represented all that was bad in Greek civilization, was the city-state which saved civilization. Centered around war, harshly administered and with a slave caste which provided targets for training their soldiers Sparta was NOT a democracy.<br /><br />All that aside, the story as told in the film is a moving one and it meets all the marks. The nudity seems a bit unnecessary but the violence depicted, if anything, was probably not as graphic as what it actually looked like.
B000AQJPQE|2.0|I bought this prodct for my son's nursery. I was so excited to receive it (I want him to be an astronaut when he grows up) I was pleased with putting it together and hanging it, would have been better if it fit over an existing light ceiling fixture. The worst part is that the electric motor in it is LOUD!!! You can't even hear the audio disc that came with it unless you turn it up VERY loud. Needless to say I was really bummed, but way too lazy to return it and get my money back. Probably why its only 30 bucks. You also can't turn on the light without the planets orbit motor on.
B000W4KT64|5.0|I love this movie!!!  Me and my family watched this on Thanksgiving and, although it freaked my family out the John Travolta played a woman, loved it. Me and my mother and my aunt even stayed up late to watch it again!  Now I wont spoil anything for you but I will tell you this. Every part of this movie is filled with laughs, fun songs, groovy dance moves, and a moral that really gets you thinking. Unlike a lot of other dancing movies, the moral isn't that you can do anything if you really believe, its that you need to accept people the way they are. Whether you're black, white, fat, skinny, popular or unpopular, people are people and they are all created equal.  All in all, this is a great movie that you definitely need to add to your collection.
B0000524CY|5.0|The first time I saw The Exorcist, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week. That was back in 1980. Twenty seven years later I was almost reluctant to watch it again. Even though the special effects are a little outdated it is still a very disturbing movie to watch. I didn't have to sleep with the lights on this time but I could have sworn I felt my bed shaking.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I bought this double album after a friend introduced me to Jesse Cook's musicianship a few months ago. Not only are the songs first-rate but the performances by Mr. Cook are exciting and attention-grabbing. There's an unusually-wide range of styles sprinkled throughout the tracks of these two discs which kept the listening fresh and even surprising at times. I especially liked the Middle-Eastern-themed songs. A huge bargain to boot, and an ideal exposure to this music and artist for a very fair price.
014011324X|5.0|Seldom have I read a historic novel that stays so close to the documented  facts, while at the same time being thrilling and engaging on every page.<br />There was no point where I lost concentration or interest.<br />Penman really makes the characters and events come alive.<br />Falls the Shadow is the sequel to Here Be Dragons and  is the story of two great men- Simon de Montfort, the principal leader of the Baronial opposition to Henry III, and the progenitor of representative democracy in England. It also feature's Simon's beautiful and strong-spirited wife Eleanor (Nell)- a daughter of King John and Isabelle of Angouleme, and their children.<br />It also traces the story of Welsh national hero Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, his rise to power as Prince of Wales, and his struggle for Welsh national self-determination, as well as struggles and relations withing the Welsh princely house of Llywelyn Far.<br />The book deals with the rise of the young De Montfort, and parallels<br /> events in Wales and England, as well as scenes taking place in France and Italy.<br />The book deals with the persecution of the Jews in England, and the man who stood up for their rights, the Mayor of London, Thomas FitzThomas, who continually fought for the rights and welfare of the Jews of London.<br />Like it's predecessor, Falls the Shadow always strikes the right balance between the dramatic events that shaped the history of Britain, as well as the trials and tribulations of the men, women and children, featured in the accounts.

B000UVT3OI|5.0|I was inclined to dock Garth Brooks' newest compilation `The Ultimate Hits' by one star.  Finding 1995`s `The Hits' to have Garth Brooks' truly greatest work, I knew that a new collection would collect songs from lesser albums like `Fresh Horses'.  But, this is what \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums really do:  They harvest and refine an artists' work.    Listening once again to \\"The Beaches of Cheyenne\\" in its place with his other songs, I discovered there isn't a dud to be found in this rich and generous two-CD, one DVD extravaganza.  That song is easily more layered and accomplished than previously thought, so good judgment continues to follow him from all his post 'In Pieces' work.  \\"Beer Run,\\" \\"Wrapped Up in You,\\" and \\"Good Ride Cowboy\\" ably represent 'Scarecrow' and 'The Lost Sessions,' arguably his best albums since 'The Hits' was released.  Staying in touch with his audience, 'Sevens' is perfectly extracted with two fine drinking songs, \\"Longneck Bottle\\" and \\"Two Pina Coladas\\".      Besides using good judgment, the new material fails to mar.  \\"More Than a Memory,\\" \\"Midnight Sun,\\" and \\"Leave a Light On\\" are postscripts that fail to disappoint.  Less familiar gems like \\"The Change\\" also offer welcome departures.  And, as much as I like Bob Dylan and Billy Joel, there's much to prefer for Garth's quietly passionate version of Dylan's \\"To Make You Feel My Love\\".  To add variety, guest star appearances are amply present, including a countrified duet with Huey Lewis on his own \\"Workin' for a Livin'\\".     If I were to cower like a spoilt child, I'd nick pick and write that \\"Allison Miranda\\" and \\"No Esta Aqui\\" were left out of this work, but who's to say they would sound as well integrated as the rest of the C.D.  Furthermore, I think \\"Right Now\\" is worthy of the rest, but there's plenty of wisdom and respect for the audience to leave 'Chris Gaines Greatest Hits' out of the mix.    Briefly, the DVD is magnificent!  Containing more than half live renditions and slightly less than half studio originals, the videos are outstanding--especially for people like me who were left standing outside the stadium and never were lucky enough to see him in concert.    `The Ultimate Hits' tells us an awful lot about Garth Brooks.  The selection says he hasn't lost touch with his audience.  The price and the wealth of material remind us that the man who'd like to beat the Beatles in royalties and on any given day afford his own \\"Cowboy Cadillac,\\" still knows how to be generous and offer plenty of helpings of hospitality.  No matter how you size it up, Garth Brooks' 'The Ultimate Hits' showcases a harvest of plenty.
0743298020|4.0|If you can make through the first 10% of the book (a lot of description, D. Setterfield describes almost every movement of each finger of every character :) It is a novel after all). So if you'll make through the beginning of the book, you'll be captured by the story and won't be able to abandon the novel until you'll get to the end of it.
1400063515|5.0|I liked it very much. However friend of mine began to read but didn't finish - lost interest in the middle.
B000XPOB0M|1.0|Wow, one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Predictable, and boring.  This movie is five as short as the original Ten Commandmants but seems fives longer.  Waste of time.
B000WC3864|1.0|It must be that time of year again... Christmas, you ask? Nooooo! a new evil dead dvd, of course!     I'm guessing with the adoption of hi-def dvd's they feel the need to milk the DVD format one last time (a final hurrah, if you will) before the onslaught of hd releases cometh.    PS, I love this movie and give the film a solid 4 stars, but these dvd releases are not more than a joke at this point. After the last behemoth edition, what new could be added?
0440238609|4.0|When I first read this series, I absolutely loved it. It had a unique storyline and the characters were interesting enough to stick with it. Unfortunately, when I read the trilogy again a couple of years later, it was kind of disappointing. The first book was great, the second one was good, but the last one was kind of mediocre and the end in my opinion was terrible. I'd recommend this trilogy to anyone, but it isn't one of my favorites.
B00012FXB8|4.0|So far my opinion on the first three movies have changed quite dramatically. Wasn't that keen on the very first one, thought the second one improved, and after watching the third, I really enjoyed it! I actually thought it was the best of the series so far! (Bearing in mind I haven't seen Resurrection at the time of writing this review.)<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is getting better with each movie, and quite possibly, making it the reason why I like the movies better. I didn't think she could have surpassed her portrayal in the second movie, but in this she did. We get to see a very different side of Ripley, as she discovers she's the lone survivor, losing her 'adopted' daughter, Newt, and landing alone, on a prison planet, where the men are rapists, child molestors, murderers etc, and haven't seen a woman in years. Cue much shock when a battered and bruised Ripley walks in. And then we finally understand where Britney got her inspiration from!!! (Sorry it had to be said!)<br /><br />The film is made to be very claustrophobic I thought. Especially in the last act, where the camera is filming upside down. It's also different to the previous movies, with Sigourney now made executive producer, and the Alien is not scary as such, but it's taken on different characteristics. Alien 3 is also a lot slower paced, considering the fast paced, action packed James Cameron previous work, but in no means is it a slow film. It builds up the tension in such a way that before you know it, you're at the dare I say it, (almost) cliffhanger ending. How the fourth one came about I don't know, and I'm dying to find out.<br /><br />For any Casualty fans (that would be) in the UK, look out for Clive Mantle, appearing in a couple of scenes. He appeared as Mike Barrett for 10 years in Casualty, and I remembered him very well, although I was originally distracted by the fact that everytime I got told there was a guy from Casualty, Pete Postlethwaite always appeared straight afterwards!<br /><br />If it wasn't for the fact each movie was a continuation, I would have skipped out the first one, because it has paled in comparison so far to the second and third movies. I am definitely looking forward with curiousity to the fourth chapter, and to see what finally happens.t wasn't for the fact each movie was a continuation, I would have skipped out the first one, because it has paled in comparison so far to the second and third movies.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I stumbled across this DVD when viewing similar films/tv adaptations on YouTube - the small snippets of scenes I saw there were enough to make me want to buy it and I was in no way disappointed!  It is absolutely wonderful! Very P & P-like in some ways, but very different in others.  I thought Daniela Denby-Ashe did an excellent job as Margaret and Richard Armitake plays the part of John Thornton brilliantly (not to mention he is positively gorgeous).  I'd never seen him before in anything, and found him to be an extraordinarily talented actor - his use of facial expressions was downright mesmerising, especially in the final scene at the train station.  A thoroughly enjoyable adaptation that I will continue to watch over and over again!  Two thumbs up from me - if I had more than two thumbs, they would be up too!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Well what can i say a great movie I enjoy watching it , and many of my friend do, too. I really enjoy being able to see my favorite parts over and over again.
1401211909|4.0|What I enjoy most about Neil Gaiman's writing is how effortless he makes it look. I just finished reading `His Majesty's Dragon' by Naomi Novik and the dialog seemed so forced and labored. Stardust, on the other hand, reads like a classic fairytale. You can almost imagine Neil weaving the story in front of a campfire and the brevity of the tale keeps it from wearing out its welcome as many books tend to do. For most of the story I was ready to give it five stars but for some reason it fell just a tad shy.<br /><br />It's been hard for me to put me finger on just what it was about the book that didn't completely mesh with me. Maybe it was because some of the storylines had disappointing conclusions. Maybe I just didn't truly feel an affinity towards the main character. Probably, the reason was because the story just didn't go where I was expecting or hoping it would go. I don't have a complaint about the finale per se but some of the supporting threads may have promised more than they delivered.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie yet but I looking forward to watching it when it's released on DVD. All in all it's a very enjoyable book that offers everything one might ask for in a fairy tale including witches and talking trees, spells and castles, romance and death. It's also a story that will appeal to a wide range of age groups. I give it high but not perfect marks.
B0001611DI|4.0|....the original or the remake. The original shows characters with a lot of imagination and ingenuity which I appreciate. The remake is exciting and action packed. I think I like them both in their own ways. I would highly recommend this movie as it WAS very exciting, brought real human issues into it, and was funny. Try it! You won't be disapointed.
B0007TKNII|3.0|* Spoilers Warning *  As a fan of the stage production I wanted to embrace the Phantom of the Opera movie much more than I did.  What was done well can almost entirely be traced back to Webber and the stage production.  The music is there in all of its pop majesty as are the flowing costumes and set pieces.  That was enough to make the show a worldwide sensation.  Why did the filmmakers feel that more was needed?        The movie opens with, and is interspersed with flash forwards and flash backs that undercut, not enhance the story.  Why give the origin of the phantom?  To make him more human?  He isn't supposed to be human.  He is supposed to be the embodiment of music; one that demands devotion and love from those whom he seeks out.  He is a jealous force that would kill anything that interferes with his disciple's complete dedication.  He is not a circus freak.        I also disagree with the symbolic use of a clockwork monkey music box.  It was used in this movie much like the \\"Rosebud\\" sled was used in Citizen Kane.  But by focusing on this symbol, the true icon of the show - the phantom's white half mask - was reduced to a costume piece.        Finally, the movie ends at Christine's grave.  What purpose does this serve?  Aside from a date and a title, we know nothing more of Christine than we did when she was \\"saved\\" by Raoul in the catacombs.  Did she continue with her musical gifts?  Why or why not?  Raoul leaves the monkey music box with her - but it wasn't hers and she barely interacted with it.  Is this Raoul's way of returning the phantom to her?  How did he know that it was the phantom's music box and not some random prop?    It would have been a better movie - and better served the source material - if they would have just stuck to the stage show.  As is was, they added extraneous, and in some cases erroneous, material to the story and as a result muddied what could have been a remarkable screen adaptation.
0440238609|5.0|AAA+++ Fantastic !!!!!!!<br /><br />The most intelligent, amazing and metaphysical books I've read so far this year. It is a battle of good over evil.  It just happens that the good and evil comes in a form that most people don't see or understand.<br /><br />I think the books were not heavily promoted here in the US, hence most parents don't know about this series and buy it for their kids. Overseas, this is a very well known series, especially in UK.<br /><br />The Golden Compass invites you into a world where the Magisterium (think Stalin, Nero, Qin ShiHuang, Hitler, any megalomaniacal ruler or government) wants to control people by controlling people's free will.<br /><br />As long as there is no free will, then people must follow what the government or ruler says, and believe in their doctrines.<br /><br />And the source of the free will is the soul, which in The Golden Compass world, is the daemon, the amorphous animal companion that each person has. One who has no daemon, or soul-less person, is not human, and not to be trusted.<br /><br />Lyra discovers that the alethiometer tells the truth. And she has the only remaining alethiometer in the world, the rest had been destroyed by the Magisterium.<br /><br />After destroying all the \\"truth\\" meters, and then creating the machine to separate and kill the souls of children, the Magisterium thinks it can now control all the soulless children that it created. For children without souls will do as they are told, will believe in whatever doctrine or dogma they are told to believe in.  In the words of a Bolvangar doctor, \\"this is how children grow up\\" - by killing and removing their souls - the ultimate act of evil.<br /><br />And now, the stage is set, for in the coming wars all people in all parallel universes must choose between a world with no control over your life, or free will.<br /><br />And then there is \\"dust\\" - that which is in all, permeates all, and was there at the beginning of time.  In my opinion, \\"dust\\" is the metaphor for the Universal Creator, your God, whatever God you choose to believe in. In the books, it says that \\"dust\\" was there at the beginning of time, dust permeates all, while one lives, \\"dust\\" is channeled into us through our souls (called \\"daemons\\" in this world) and when one dies, we return to \\"dust\\".  So far, this is very Christian. God created us, God gave each one of us our soul, so that HE is always with us, and He gave us free will, so that we can choose, and when we die, our souls return to God.  This is the allegory.<br /><br />It is so important for children to understand they have a soul that is their inner guidance, and the soul gives us free will, so they can create whatever kind of life they wish for themselves in the future. This kind of information has always been suppressed and the people who don't know this info were oppressed by rulers throughout time.<br /><br />Knowledge is information, information allows us to choose.  Without information, we have no choice in life.<br /><br />For Americans, it should be a no brainer that we value our freedom.  Our freedom is tied in with our free will - our ability to choose and decide for ourselves.<br /><br />Yet we don't teach our children these values ???<br /><br />I don't understand the controversy, maybe because I think for myself and decide after I have read them.  I choose freedom - I choose to have my soul - I choose free will.you choose to believe in. In the books, it says that \\"dust\\" was there at the beginning of time, dust permeates all, while one lives, \\"dust\\" is channeled into us through our souls (called \\"daemons\\" in this world) and when one dies, we return to \\"dust\\".

B000G1ALRK|5.0|The first time I saw Eric Chuch play you couldn't cram another person in the bar and there were charter busses liningh the parking lot of the bar I work in.  I had no idea who he was just a song or two and that he was semi-local.      After that show I had the album and was sold.  He put on one of the best shows I have seen in the last year and then on his return duplicated the first effort.  His energy and sincerity are genuine.  The emotions behind is songs come through and his passion for music are evident.      This CD has loads of depth, covers several sobject matters of life, and feels like you are going through a bit of his life.  Case in point, these boots reveal a journey through life and lessons learned.  Two pink lines is an upbeat reminder of how life can throw you a curve ball and sometimes you get a strike but you aren't out quite yet.  While not the most lyrically deep album I have ever heard there is still depth in the music.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|\\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is another example of how Rush has never been afraid of change and not completey open to new input.<br /><br />Anyone expecting the Rush of the 70's, 80's or even the 90's just doesn't get it.  Great musicians adapt, develope and grow over time.  There are plenty of artists out there that are still living off of music that was written 20 or 30+ years ago and happy as can be - so are their fans.  They just want to hear that song from their high school days one more time...and by the way don't change a note.<br /><br />Rush has NEVER been like that and NEVER will.  All of their music evolves over time and if you heard a favorite song live 20 years ago when you hear it today it will sound different...BY DESIGN.<br /><br />I give a great deal of credit for Rush to bring in a new producer that has his finger on the pulse today's music and to listen to him!  These 3 guys have more talent and experience in thier pinkies than he will ever see in his life, but they wanted fresh ideas - and it worked!<br /><br />For those looking for the old \\"concept album\\" days just bring out your old vinyl and listen to the older stuff (awesome as it is), but that stuff just won't work today, and Geddy, Alex and Neil are smart enough to understand that.<br /><br />This album blows me away and the more I listen to it the more I like it.  If you haven't done so get the DVD version - WOW!
0143038419|1.0|I hated the author from the beginning and she got even more irritating as the book went on. Her views on marriage and kids were selfish and nerve grating. Dont waste your $$ on this book. Buy something else instead.I gave it 1 star but I really wanted to give it -stars.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye West's Graduation has what you come to expect and love from this artist.  The super-producer's unique sound and unique beats can be enjoyed with songs like \\"Flashing Lights.\\" His humor and honesty hit dead on with the track \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" featuring another favorite, Mos Def.  I recommend this album to anyone with a pulse.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|I love the Doors and I think Morrison Hotel is their best album. I'm glad my son and wife bought me this CD for Veterans Day. The remixes are good, but they tried to fix something thay wasn't broken. I have difficulty hearing certain frequencies, so most of the time when a song is remixed I don't notice much difference. However, I did notice the harmonica at the begining of Roadhouse Blues. I could have done without it. The original version where the harmonica is not so prevalent is better. That is the only bad thing I have to say about this CD. The reason I wanted this CD is because of the bonus tracks. Listen to them and you will see why they chose that version of Roadhouse Blues they put on the original album. Over all, the CD is well worth the money. Unless you are interested in owning all of The Doors products available, I would suggest spending a little less money and getting the CD without the bonus tracks.
B000TX7B5U|3.0|Few tracks stand out and the CD is not strong and heavy as SOADs. The absence of typical SOAD (Daron) sound can be seen, more effort is put in the lyrics and less on the music quality.   Anyhow, I still await a next SOAD CD with both Serj and Daron on board.
0792846443|5.0|This movie tells the story of author Paul Sheldon after a car crash has shattered his legs and a retired nurse named Annie Wilkes takes him to her home to recover. Unfortunately, for Paul, the esteemed Miss Wilkes is crazy as a loon and it becomes obvious pretty quickly that he's a prisoner, not a patient or a guest. I don't want to give away much of the plot, but she coerces him into writing a new novel just for her. One that will resurrect a character that Annie loves but that Paul had killed in his latest book. Paul's struggles with Annie to survive, write the book, keep his sanity, and escape are what form the core of the story.    There have been so many mediocre to poor adaptations of Stephen King books that one tends to expect that any movie based on his work will be a waste of time.  Misery is the rare exception that proves the rule because this is a taut, suspenseful movie.  Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her portrayal of Annie Wilkes and she deserved it.  Annie is truly insane and Bates nailed the transitions from the sweet and caring Annie to the psycho screamer with a hair trigger in a way that seemed so natural it's unlikely many actresses could have matched it.  James Caan is equally good as the tortured Paul Sheldon even if his part is less compelling.  Richard Farnsworth also has a nice supporting role in the movie as the town sheriff even if it is an addition to the book.      Misery is a riveting movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you squirm at the same time.  As sadistic as this version of Annie is, the violence has actually been toned down from the book, but it's extremely intense all the same.  This is not a gore splashed slasher film, but the tension between Annie and Paul is sky high and there is one scene, in particular, that is tough to watch.  I don't recommend this for the faint of heart, but anyone else should dive in and enjoy one of the very best adaptations of the modern master of horror.
B00005J6UR|5.0|I was thinking about 80's things that I really loved, things all kids today MUST know about to be complete little beings...and Gremlins was one that I thought my kids had to see.  So I ordered it, told my kids how when my sister was 5 or 6 she was terrified of Gremlins and hid behind the sofa when we watched it... they got a kick out of that.  We watched it, they loved it (so did I!) No one cried or hid.  They of course now want a Gremlin of their own. I had them call my sister after we watched the movie.  When they told her they had just watched Gremlins- she only remembering being scared asked me - You let them watch that movie?! Isn't it scary!.  How funny that at 24 she is still scared of Gremlins.  My kids giggled and teased her. This is a must see - along with Labrynth, ET, original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Back to the Future...all those GOOD, FAIRLY CLEAN 80's movies.  Was a blast seeing Gizmo again...we have watched it 4 times in 2 weeks.

My 8 year old son can't believe I know all the songs.  My 37 year old husband has asked for this CD for Christmas (I lost my original somewhere along the years). This is an AWESOME CD, a must have for any Greenday fan, any 'punk-ity pop fan'...American Idiot is great but this one is AWESOME! Love, love, love it.

As with \\"Die Hard,\\" you need a really great \\"bad guy\\" to make the movie a hit, and Dennis Hopper can be your psycho like nobody else.
0743298039|5.0|I liked this book from the start but, the last 150 pages or so, I had a hard time putting it down.  I am so happy to read a book that shows the harshness of the character's lives without being depressing.  It is uplifting even when it is tragic.  I highly recommend it.
1416914285|1.0|I forced myself halfway through this book (over 200 pages into it, I gave it a chance) and kept pushing myself, thinking it would get better. I NEVER give up on books, but I had to on this one. Nothing exciting happened. The characters were bland. Nothing was explained. If this seems like a book you might be interested, maybe rent it out at the library first, just in case. Some people seem to really enjoy it, so maybe you will too. It just happened that I didn't.
0143038419|1.0|This book did not ring true for me at all.  If the author was in the middle of such a horrible breakdown how did she muster up the energy to go to a publisher and get a book deal and then set out for a year of traveling?  I just couldn't get into listening to her complain about her life anymore.  I had to put it down.  Maybe I missed something but, I DO NOT recommend this book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|...then you're missing out.  I have been watching nature documentaries for 40 years and frankly, I'm a bit \\"jaded\\" in having \\"seen it all.\\"  But this program is in a category of its own. I was totally blown away, not just by its unparalleled beauty, but by the fact that I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes without being astounded by something I'd never known anything about.<br /><br />Their new technology allowed them to glimpse scenes of nature that would never have allowed a camera to come within range, like the family life of the rare, cliff-dwelling snow leopards, or the elusive camels of the Gobi dessert (who eat snow in a land of zero rainfall), or so many other forms of life I'd never known.<br /><br />And it opened my eyes to forms of animal behavior I'd never imagined, like the intricate attack patterns packs of wild dogs whose movements are as well coordinated as if they all had walkie talkies, polar bears who try desperately to adapt to loss of ice in ways we never knew they could, or birds of paradise who transform themselves in unbelievable ways for their mating rituals.  I could go on, but I think I'd have to list about a hundred new things I'd never learned in four decades of watching nature documentaries.<br /><br />This series is simply mind-blowing. I cannot praise it enough.
B000W3YLH8|3.0|Film fans and students will know the name Carl Theodore Dryer for his beautiful film 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' which set an unprecedented standard in film both in terms of performance but most importantly in terms of composition.    It would be difficult to say 'Vampyr' is far from the cinematographic genius that was Joan of Arc.  The film is peppered with Dryer's dynamic close up shots, especially toward the end of the film.  And foretelling of later Kubrick films, Dryer exploits some magnificent tracking shots to help build the eerie dreamlike quality of the piece.    The story itself left me scratching my head, and I'm sure the film wasn't aided by the fact that only 1/3rd of the dialogue has subtitles (If you speak German you've got a leg up).  The intertitles appear to be in tact but from what I have researched about the state of the film, this was likely a composite of two different cuts of the film (likely the French and German).  The subtitles themselves were a bit too large and obscure some of the frame but this was likely to cover up existing subtitles that were on the print.    Generally, if you're in to Carl Dryer's work check this film out, the cinematography and some of the camera tricks are quite interesting though not as thoroughly impressive as Joan of Arc.  Otherwise this is not terribly noteworthy as an early sound film and the design here has moved away from the more dynamic German Expressionist films.
B000X3KZVI|4.0|During the Glitter and Charmbracelet eras, a comeback from Mariah Carey seemed impossible to some. Her popularity, her quality of material, and even her voice appeared to be degrading at a painfully rapid rate. Even I, an avid fan of the songbird, began to think that she was on her way out of the music business. In early 2005, \\"It's Like That\\" was released, and although it was a nice track and the fans enjoyed it, it still wasn't making any big moves on the charts to make anyone think this new upcoming album would perform any differently than the past two. Then, out of nowhere came the mega-hit, \\"We Belong Together,\\" and the rest was history. The Emancipation of Mimi went on to be certified six times platinum by the RIAA, making it the best selling album of 2005. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, it was named the best contemporary R&B album of the year. The album also gave Carey two more #1 singles to boast. This tour, which is her most successful one yet, topped it all off.    I actually was fortunate enough to see this tour in my area, and I must say that this DVD does an excellent job of capturing the magic of her performance. The set is nice, as is the lighting. The concert was recorded in HD and is in surround sound, so obviously I have no complaints in that area. (The only problem I really have with the way it was shot is that I really didn't care to see the fans in the crowd and also, I wish the camera weren't always so close up to Mariah. I would've liked to have seen more full shots of the stage with everything going on at once a few times throughout the presentation.) The background vocalists, in my opinion, were superb and they really did an amazing job. The dancers seemed to be quite talented, but at most times, the choreography was a little lame and unexciting to me. But to be completely honest, I don't really look to the dancers to give me thrills during a concert: my eyes are always on the star of the show.    Throughout the entire show, Mariah proves that she is back and here to stay. The voice, which some critics claimed was withering away to a mere whimper, is just as strong and bold as her early days. The high notes are still there, as is her soulful belting. And she really is singing live! She has astounding charisma and energy, and to top it all off, she looks better than ever.    Choosing the setlist must have been an extremely difficult task; Mariah has been active in the music business for the last 17 or 18 years. She has had many hit singles and also many great album tracks that have become fan favorites. Well, all I can say is that it was chosen perfectly. It has some stuff for all the new fans that she gained with this new album, but it is also faithful to the fans that have been there since day one. Most of her studio albums are represented with at least one song. All of the songs are pretty much performed in their entirety. (It really annoys me when artists do little one-and-a-half-minute versions of their songs, trying to cram everything in.) What I also liked was how she slipped in little pieces of some of her remixes into the performances. It was cool how she sang part of \\"Dream Lover\\" over the instrumental of Biggie's \\"Juicy.\\" The powerful performance of \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" was worth the price of this set alone for me.     Aside from the concert, this also has some special features. The first disc has a behind-the-scenes feature, which are always fun to watch at least once. It also contains a jukebox feature that allows you to arrange and play your own setlist. (Mine: \\"Fly Like A Bird,\\" ten times in a row.) I think the idea is quite ingenious. The second disc has a tour documentary, with interviews from all parties involved, speaking on the setlist, set design, dancers, etc. I always find these things interesting because it really takes an incredible amount of work to put a tour of this magnitude together, and it's always nice to hear Mariah speak. Also, a few, but not all, of the concert's songs are here in karaoke form so you can sing along. Last, a Spike-Lee directed short, Lovers and Haters, is included. It's Mariah's way of responding to--and laughing at--all the rumors that \\"haters\\" have created about her over the years. I don't really think this set needed to be two discs. I'm sure all the special features would've fit on one DVD, but I still enjoyed them all.    This tour documents an amazing performer who has once again returned to her prime. Overall, this is a great, entertaining, and worthwhile DVD set. If you are a Mariah fan, then this is for you.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|The reason this is different from any previous Wilco album is that it features guitar iconoclast Nels Cline and is more a collaboration between Cline and Tweedy than a Wilco album per se. Cline's guitar playing is unlike any other, totally fresh and original, completely non-derivative. That being said, there is a Beatle-esque undercurrent to Tweedy's songs and the CD sounds like something the Beatles could have released in 1977 if they had continued recording and evolving that long. Tweedy and Cline collaborating is something like Rembrandt and Salvador Dali collaborating on a painting but somehow they make it work. This is a very good CD that may take several listens to grow on you so don't give up on it if it does not hit you all at once. If you are a guitar player of any musical style, Cline's playing is not to be missed!!
0380778556|5.0|Many aspects of this book reminded me of Bronte's classic \\"Jane Eyre\\" - a book so revered that its prequel \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" by Jean Rhys is also proclaimed a classic.<br /><br />Rebecca's plot is simple in the beginning. A May-December marriage of an eccentric and mysteriously quiet wealthy countryman (Max or Maxim) to a naive middle class early 20's woman who has little, if anything, in common with her husband or his crowd make strange bed mates.  After a glorious vacation/honeymoon in Monte Carlo, the young wife's Cinderella story is encompassed by coming to his estate, his castle, his Manderley.<br /><br />But, Du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\" is not to be judged by its simple cover.  Rebecca - the deceased first wife of Max - we learn to know in great detail, including her medical visits and romantic trysts.  The first-person-singular protagonist [second wife of Max] recites this story and never reveals even her name. We never hear her name. We hear Max describe her name as beautiful. But, we never know it - first or surname.  Instead, she is like Rebecca, always referred to as \\"Mrs. de Winter\\", wife of Maximilian de Winter.<br /><br />As reading progresses, we learn  more about the deceased Mrs. de Winter than the living Mrs. de Winter. This tale, told by the living Mrs. de Winter, explores more about the \\"others\\" who are rich. Du Maurnier teaches us how the rich are terribly low class and how the lower class living Mrs. de Winter is terribly elegant and debonnaire. The first half of the book we regard the protagonist as the poor little rich girl; in the second half she is the unfortunate rich maiden. She grows as we learn more about the deep dark mysteries behind the walls of gigantic Manderley.  And, when we learn all there is to know, we learn what few others know. I would love to tell it all, but I cannot spoil this great twisting and turning ending. I can say that the ending is magnificent.<br /><br />This book has tremendous character growth created by dialogue.  The evil maid Mrs. Danvers cuts through the young bride with carefully delivered, but polite, statements to Manderey's new  mistress.  A cousin of the late Rebecca -Mr. Favell - is perhaps Du Maurnier's greatest tour du force. Laced with preposterous statements and obnoxious intrusions, he is truly unlikeable - even to the reader whose own character may mirror such personality. And, the gentlemanly companion to Max, Frank Crawley, together with the Magistrate Colonel Julyan (in their inquest of Rebecca's death) are reminiscent to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Mr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />I worried this would be a woman's novel. Maybe it is. But, for someone who does not usually read such novels, and enjoys them less, I loved this novel.<br /><br />At the end, I hit my Netflix account to see if there was a film adaptation. Drafting Alfred Hitchcock to direct a film adaptation is genius. Casting Sir Laurence Olivier as Max is double genius. I wonder if this is one of those rare times when the film rivals a masterpiece of literature.The evil maid Mrs. Danvers cuts through the young bride with carefully delivered, but polite, statements to Manderey's new  mistress.

B000X3VN46|2.0|It has become painfully obvious Tarja is, by all means, not a composer and that those chartered to compose \\"My Winter Storm\\" with her are not of admirable caliber either.  Tarja's voice is beautiful as ever, but she does not challenge herself in the least and neither do the songs, and this is a greatly missed chance. Many of her melodic lines are 13 in a dozen, the lyrics are often blunt and straightforward without much sense for the poetic, mystical and metaphorical.  The music itself is even rather generic and not of great interest. In my opinion, there's a lot of 'easy scoring' in many of the songs and as a result I did not finish listening to this album and probably never will.    If you were a fan of Tarja specifically, you will most likely still enjoy this album greatly, if you were a fan of Nightwish, and their musical power, especially in their layered composing and lyrics, this is not the album for you.
0440238609|5.0|The Golden Compass books are new to me and I've not yet read them.  I saw the movie yesterday and was enchanted by it, literally.  The production was top-notch and a very sensitive presentation of all the complex facets of the book.  The Daemons were very real, each one so like it's living counterpart, they did not seem like they were man-created.  The central argument is one I'm very familiar with, that there is no real need for a God that is outside of ourselves.  Each one of us has within us the potential to evolve not just to the Christ level of consciousness, but to the level of God, with all of His attributes.  This is not a radical or new idea, but is certainly a heretical one.  This doesn't happen overnight or by taking a few seminars, it's the work of a lifetime, I speak from personal experience here.  I'm not there yet at 77.  Works of art like The G.C. and the Narnia books are bringing this much needed new idea forth into our culture.  I know that there are visionaries in the movie industry who are supporting this evolution with their movies.  This introduction of these ideas into popular cultures mark the beginning of an entirely new millennium.  I will certainly read the books in the near future.

Anita Baker might be one of the most underrated yet thoroughly emotive vocalists of our time. She is subtle and understated when she needs to be, truly powerful when necessary, and soulful throughout. Tracks like \\"Sweet Love,\\" \\"Caught Up in the Rapture,\\" and \\"Same Ole Love\\" remain popular on R&B radio over 20 years after the album's release.

078322799X|3.0|You know what Peter Jackson accomplished with effects in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"King Kong\\", well this was a special effects movie that became a laboratory and proving ground for his talent for saturating a film with effects.<br /><br />What a strange plot for a movie that seems more like an excuse to show off the then state of the art computerized effects.  Michael J. Fox plays a guy named Frank Bannister who can actually see ghosts and works with a scam with a few of them to scare people into paying him money to get rid of the ghosts.  However, he gets drawn into a serial murder nightmare that involves the living and the dead (they being \\"killed\\" a second time).<br /><br />Given the material, the live actors do their best with what they have.  But Michael J. Fox seems on the run in every frame of the movie and never gets time to contemplate anything.  Part of the issue is the sheer number of story lines that are jumbled together.  Frank Bannister has his somewhat complex relationship with his ghost buddies Cyrus (Chi McBride), Stuart (Jim Fyfe), The Judge (John Astin), and even Sgt. Hiles (R. Lee Ermey).<br /><br />Bannister also has to resolve his relationship with his dead wife, Debra (Angela Bloomfield) who thinks he killed her.  The law also thinks he killed Debra and wants him under arrest to deal with those charges.  They also think that Bannister's ghost cleaning business is a scam.  It is, but for a different reason than the law thinks.<br /><br />There is also a very creepy character named Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) whose purpose in the plot is simply to be creepy and keep us wondering what he is all about.  He is after Bannister, but the why only comes very late in the film and we learn that our sense of his creepiness is actually understated.  Dammers goes below and beyond what we expected of him.<br /><br />Then there is his new relationship with Dr. Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado) that provides a love story for the movie, but she is also critical to other aspects of the plot where she adds scientific expertise and aids Bannister.  However, she also is awfully busy becoming the precious object put at risk to divert Bannister from what he needs to because he has to try and save her.<br /><br />The source of all the pain in the movie is some strange black robed figure who is going around killing ghosts as well as people.  Eventually we learn how the executed mass murderer Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey) and the recluse Patricia Bradley (Dee Wallace) are involved, which adds another complex set of plot lines to the story.<br /><br />Another problem with the story is the rules for the dead seem to be completely ad hoc.  That is, they seem to be whatever the plot needs at that moment rather than connected to any set of myths or even an internally consistent set of rules the audience can comprehend and measure.  The whole thing just is.<br /><br />However, it is a high energy film with dazzling effects (even after 11 years) and if you wants some mindless frenetic fun, this can be for you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIwhere she adds scientific expertise and aids Bannister.

0440238609|1.0|Until tonight, I was insulated completely from the whole debate on religion, so that hasn't been a factor (I'm woefully deficient in reading Hollywood gossip and watching sensationalist news programs, it seems).  I bought the first book at least 4 years ago and have made at least 3 attempts at reading it, most recently after moving and finding the thing in a box.  It's just no good--I can't manage to hack through it.  The prose is thick and the plot so well-hidden I haven't managed yet to discern what the book is supposed to be about or which direction it's heading.  I'm 40-some, childless, and a big fan of Tolkien, Asimov, Clarke, CJ Cherryh, Frank Herbert, Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. LeGuin, Piers Anthony, Poul Anderson, etc. etc. so I've read a fair few SF/Fantasy works.  I just haven't read this one...and it's not for lack of trying.

B00005V9IL|1.0|This review is NOT based on the actual movie which is one of the best Sci-Fi flicks ever to be seen. However, how can they advertise that this is anamorphic 2:35 aspect ratio, WHEN IT IS NOT?!!?<br /><br />Very deceiving. Says 2 discs but you only get 1, and the other disk with the extra features is great. It says we get it, but there is only 1 disk. It does not offer the wide range of audio it claims it has, but worst of all is them saying this is anamorphic 2:35, when it is not. Great movie, but who the heck can stand to see HUGE BLACK BARS and just a small sliver of the actual movie? I have a 62\\" HD Sony which is AWESOME. But watching this movie, even on such a big screen is intolerable. Odd is at the very beginning it is fine. But as the movie starts, you can see THE ABYSS is cut off by the HUGE black bars and then NO ANAMORPHIC 2:35!!!! One of my favorite movies of all time and I can not even stand to watch it. a 62\\" screen and 90% of it is taken up with huge black bars with the movie playing in the middle on what looks like about a 4 inch wide screen. Zooming does not help as it eliminates part of the black bars, but then you lose a huge portion of the picture which is worthless. How can they advertise this as they do, but be so wrong about so many things? Furthermore, with DVD's, once open you can only exchange for the same title. You cannot get a refund or exchange for another title. So, you buy it under the assumption it is what it says it is and you get what it says you will get. Only to open it and find out it is not even close to what was advertised and you are stuck with it. I am shocked they are advertising this as they are and not delivering what they are advertising you will get. I took mine back to the store and told the manager that IT IS NOT WHAT IT CLAIMS IT IS...even had him stick it in a dvd player to see for himself. All he could do is offer me another copy. No refund and no exchange for another title. How can they lie and then not give a refund?? How can they take one of the best movies ever and ruin it as they are???can they take one of the best movies ever and ruin it as they are???
B00007GZR5|5.0|*Spoilers alert*<br /><br />If you were to forgive the melted Velveeta look that this movie purports to be Heaven (cheesey indeed), and forgive Robin Williams (again) for trying so desperately to be liked in films such as this (the worst of the lot), you simply cannot overlook the injustice behind the storyline this movie asks us to buy.<br /><br />Forget about the simplistic assumptions the movie delivers (such as DOGS belong in Heaven, but SPIDERS are all in Hell!), can we really believe that Robin's character sneaks into hell to rescue his wife, and that God is off cleaning his toilet and so misses this event? If meaning is tied to the REASON people are sent to certain afterlifes, then we can agree Robin's wife was in no fair way doomed to be sent to Hell. How can we feel good about afterlife justice if we buy into the fact that she has been sent there?<br /><br />Logic, folks, prevents me from enjoying this film. I am happy to suspend reality in order to enjoy films, but when a wretched film like \\"What Dreams May Come\\" dares to discuss afterlife in the sense that it does, it leaves you feeling bitter. Does anyone believe that Robin's wife is the ONLY one in Hell to suffer this kind of injustice? What about the innumerable others that suffered similiar fates, only to be left there because no Robin will come about to save them? The ideas behind this film sicken me, and it is among the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of being subjected to.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|I'll start by saying this:<br /><br />If you are a fan of the `Die Hard' franchise and are afraid that the PG-13 movie is going to take away from the violence and realistic action that permeated the previous three films then place all hesitation aside and rent this movie anyways.  The violence here is so above any PG-13 I've seen as of late, realistic and non-stop.  In fact, the action sequences are more realistic and look better then anything seen in the mess that was `Spider-Man 3'.  Now, if you are a fan of the `Die Hard' franchise and are afraid that the PG-13 rating is going to take away from the many expletives that littered the first three films, again, have no fear for there is an unrated version that also accompanies this disk.  I personally don't care to listen to the F-Bomb dropped over and over so the theatrical version worked beautifully for me, but either way you have your pick and both are very pleasing.<br /><br />So, now we'll move onto the movie itself.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, now in his fifties, reprises his role as John McClane and once again proves that no one can do action like Bruce Willis.  The man is god, I mean at fifty he can still hold his own against just about anyone.  In this installment John is up against his toughest villain yet, a computer.  While the plot is underdeveloped a bit (does it really matter as long as enough stuff blows up) it still poses a situation we all can get scared over.  With the whole world pretty much dependant on computers what if someone decided to take complete control over them.  In essence they would control our lives.  So this is what McClane is up against.<br /><br />The film opens with McClane being asked to pick up a hacker named Matt Farrell and bring him in for some questioning.  Picking him up proves to be a little more difficult than expected and after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt on the kid he comes to find out that this hacker may be the only person who can help him through this mess.  At the other end of the attacks is disgruntled terrorist Thomas Gabriel (played by a very one-dimensional Timothy Olyphant) and his beautiful assistant Mai.  McClane's determination to take him down (and out for the count) ends up putting him in a a tight spot when Gabriel kidnaps McClane's daughter Lucy.  Now McClane has even more motivation to kick some tail.<br /><br />`Live Free or Die Hard' is very heavy on the action.  There are some breathtaking sequences and Bruce Willis' fight sequence with Maggie Q is the best `guy on girl' fight scene I've seen since Wolverine squared off with Lady Deathstrike in `X2'.  If you are in need for an action fix then this movie will do it for you. Tag this to the back of `Transformers' and you have one awesome action-packed weekend.  The whole `18-wheeler/jet fighter' scene alone is brilliantly shot and surprisingly realistic.<br /><br />Willis is great again here.  I don't know why people don't realize he is one of our finest working actors by now.  I mean, `drama' is not the only genre that demands you command your character and Willis' portrayal of McClane (especially in the first `Die Hard' film) is award worthy.  Justin Long is funny as Matt Farrell but I've seen him do better.  Maggie Q is awesome here, better than she was in last years `MI:3' and speaking of `MI:3', how come they get the greatness that is Philip Seymour Hoffman and we are stuck with Timothy Olyphant, who is never `great' but has been much better than he is here.  I was actually very impressed with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays Lucy, McClane's daughter.  She really got a handle on her character despite lack of lengthy screen time.<br /><br />In the end `Live Free or Die Hard' is much better than expected for despite it's PG-13 rating it still manages to deliver in just about every way the previous films had.  Sure, there is no comparison to the original `Die Hard' but this installment fits nicely with the rest and proves to be, not a disappointment, but a worthwhile adventure that is a sure fire crowd pleaser.wd pleaser.

Highlander III was goofy in many ways, and Highlander II was such a disappointing flop I'm sure the creators of the Highlander saga wish they never produced such a terrible film.     In this movie, the two stars of Highlander the TV series, Duncan Macleod and Connor Macleod are together in a battle against a very powerful adversary. Kell, the villian of this film has a score to settle with Connor due Connor killing Kell's father around 400 years ealier. During that time Kell became \\"renegade\\", and killed most of every immortal he came across just to become stronger so that one day he would be powerful enough to not only defeat Connor, but to humiliate Connor, and to kill those close to Connor, while Connor would be unable to do anything to stop it. In addition to his impressive head count (661 to be exact), Kell has assmebled a small band of immortals to do his bidding for him. One of these immortal allies of Kell's is a woman named \\"Kate\\", who appears to be one of Duncan's old lovers from the past.     Now, this storyline does seem to be fairly well plotted (I know many disagree on this point), and it does seem to have the true touch of what being an immortal is all about (watching those you love die). Also, you get to see some pretty good martial arts and sword fighting scenes in this movie. The fighting between Duncan and Jin Kei was in actual time, and NOT slowed down like in other martial arts movies. This shows the good fight coordination between Adrian Paul (Duncan) and Donnie Yen (Jin kei).     Finally, this movie has perhaps a nice, but sad touch to it not found in the other Highlander movies. As the old saying in the word of Highlander goes, \\"In the end there can be only one\\", and that is made absolutely apparent in this movie when Duncan and Connor are forced to fight with each other. I feel in the fight between Duncan and Connor you truly see the love that Connor and Duncan had, not only for one another, but for the sake of the game and world as a whole.     I gave the movie 4 stars simply for the good fight/martial arts scenes, as well as for the sad, but pivotal fight that occurs between Duncan and Connor.
B000YAF4OS|4.0|\\"The Mist\\" represents yet another Stephen King piece of literary for Frank Darabont to grab his hands on and try giving it the cinematic magic.  While the film is not at caliber of Darabont's past adapted films, nor is it among the greater films this year, but it's certainly good at what it intends to be.  The film is the case where everything goes wrong and everyone tries to cope with the danger that's fogging (literally) the outside world with mixed results.<br /><br />After a terrible thunderstorm, David Drayton and his son thought they have survived the wrath of Mother Nature.  When David and his son goes to the supermarket to get some supplies, things get out of control when a thick mist surrounds the streets after a wounded person tells the people to close the supermarket doors.  Not long, David knows there's something dangerous within the mist, so for the course of the movie he's stuck w/ a religious extremist, a woman who looks like Amy Smart but isn't, some military guys and mostly non-believers that will eventually become cannon fodder.  Things don't seem to look good for the locals of Silent Hill (yea, I know it doesn't take place in Silent Hill, but judging by the thick fog, the location and the inclusion of a crazy God lady, the movie might as well took place in that desolate town).<br /><br />\\"The Mist\\" is not essentially a horror film, and if so, the film certain falters.  There's too much moments of comfort so the scare factor was low, the build-ups leading to the kills are rather predictable, and some people are just too \\"durn\\" ignorant to easily get away from the creatures. What's more distracting is the monsters have a way of sticking out like a sore thumb, thanks to its bland CG design.  I like them better when the sight of them is blurred by the mist, but when they're up close and seeing how fake they look, it pushed me away from the connection I have with the film.  At least the film did a good job of rarely using the soundtrack for the sake of ambience, but that doesn't ignore its by-the-book conventions, although that's not what the film is emphasizing.<br /><br />What really made this film sell is its character study.  The monsters that appear are few and far between, so it's all about the townspeople stuck in the supermarket and seeing' their fear of the unknown eventually succumb to their primitive nature; what the movie is really about is humans fighting against themselves.  The concept is rather been-there-done-that, but \\"The Mist\\" does it so effectively.  William Sadler's character goes from being a rough-and-touch mechanic to being spineless from the sight of the monsters to becoming obsessed with the praises of an extremely-devoted nut-case that is Ms. Carmody, and the transitions are rather believable.  On the subject of Ms. Carmody, Marcia Gay Harden does an incredible job of making me hate her character as she tries to preach to the survivors that what's going on is God's wrath against humanity and ultimately form a cult that does human sacrifices like they're Mayans.  For a woman who's deeply blessed, though, I'm surprised by how much she swears; I don't think her God would appreciate that.<br /><br />What I like most about the study is not even the main character is completely sane.  Sure, Ms. Carmody and her followers are downright loony, but it's tough to see David trying to maintain composure while protecting his son and trying to figure out how to escape from the mist with some of the less-crazy people in the market.  His character is definitely well-developed and so were a few characters that I find likeable, such as the gun-toting stork clerk who did something later in the film that mad me literally applaud him.  Too bad some of the other characters are underutilized, especially the young military fellow and the female store clerk who had a moment of desire before their fates are sealed.  The foreshadowing is so obvious and the end result is pathetic, I wonder why the director even bothers using that sub-plot?<br /><br />I must admit, I was bored out of my mind for maybe under the first-third of the film, but then I just noticed that I was starting to get into it.  Cast aside the thought that the movie might've ripped off a few invasion films and how the creatures never tried breaking through the windows to get their meal instead of waiting for the humans to come to them, when it gets to the heart of the cast, that's when \\"The Mist\\" becomes a solid drama story in a horror-setting.  The whole notion of primal lunacy sets the comparison between Ms. Carmody and David Drayton, and I knew that from the shocking ending that they may have differences, but when it comes to being in a hopeless situation, both have made some desperate choices that will ultimately affect them for the rest of their lives.  That moment left me feeling devastated by the time the movie's over, and I hardly felt that for most films of its kind.I must admit, I was bored out of my mind for maybe under the first-third of the film, but then I just noticed that I was starting to get into it.

B000V9KFLY|5.0|This is one of the best traditional Christmas albums out there.  Celine's voice is perfect for the holiday classics \\"Oh Holy Night\\", \\"Ave Maria\\", & \\"O Come O Ye Faithful\\". She soars to highs that would give anyone chills.  She also covers Elvis' \\"Blue Christmas\\" & John Lennon's \\"Happy Christmas\\" with the touch of sadness the songs require.  She brings home the Christmas message with the Diane Warren song & title track \\"These Are Special Times\\".  It also includes the hit song \\"I'm You're Angel\\" with R. Kelly.      The re-pckaged 2007 edition includes all the songs remastered along with a dvd of her CBS Christmas special.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I've found that a lot of special edition DVDs lack something in the extras, and usually wonder why you bothered paying more for extras you have no interest in.  That wasn't the case with this one.  Not only was the quality of the movie and sound fantastic, but I also loved the extras.  One of my favorites was the interview with the original actors who played the Von Trapp children - it was a lot of fun to see how they grew up.  It was also nice to see Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer together, although I think it would have been fantastic if they could have gotten them together with the children as well.  The documentary with Charmienne Carr was really adorable too.  This one is definitely worth the extra money for a second disc.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Shakespeare, like every other writer, director, and producer since the beginning of time, was aware of his power to sway public opinion.  He was also, like them, up to his eyeballs in politics while pretending to be passive and neutral.  Unfortunately for him, Queen Elizabeth the First was no fool.  So he found it healthy to write a lot of magnificent, politically correct tripe about previous English kings.  However, he was allowed to write a \\"what if\\" story about Danish politics that shows us what a truly dangerous man he was.      That story is Hamlet.      If you want to hear the story, you need to hear the whole story.  All four hours of it.  Unedited, unimproved, unsimplified, cut neither in time nor in content.  This is that story.  One could discuss Kenneth Branagh versus Mel Gibson or Laurence Olivier.  One could wax ecstatic about the all-star cast or the Blenheim Palace setting or the 65mm film format.  Or the music.  Oh Lord, the music.  Placido Domingo's singing during the closing credits is alone worth the price of the disks.  But the real issue is the story itself.      Firing up Google Maps and entering \\"helsingor, denmark\\" will take us to the modern Danish city that Shakespeare called Elsinore.  Clicking on the \\"satellite\\" tab and zooming in will take us to the castle itself.  This castle overlooks the narrowest point of a body of water called the Oresund Strait.  All merchant traffic sailing in and out of the Baltic Sea must sail through one of three straits, this being the one farthest east.  The other two straits are firmly in Danish hands, but this one has Sweden on the other side.  Any prince that occupies this castle can break the Danish tax monopoly of Baltic Sea commerce, or if he is lucky, grab the monopoly for himself.  As England was a seafaring nation, Shakespeare would have known this.  So would most of his audience.      The obvious threat is from Sweden, but Shakespeare thought it more interesting to create a threat from Norway.  Atthat time, Norway and Denmark were more or less one nation, as nations were defined back then.  They shared allegiance, such as it was, to one King.  But there is always an enemy within, something Shakespeare knew all too well.  So he created the character Fortinbras of Norway, and gave him a score to settle.      Fortinbras wants to avenge his father's death, and incidentally seize the throne of Denmark.  His father was killed by old Hamlet, father of the current Prince Hamlet.  Throughout the story, Fortinbras is advancing his army of followers towards Elsinore.      But Fortinbras cannot kill old Hamlet.  That's because Claudius, old Hamlet's younger brother, killed old Hamlet first, and incidentally seized the throne of Denmark.      Prince Hamlet, old Hamlet's son, wants to avenge his father's death, and incidentally seize the throne of Denmark.  As the throne should rightfully be his anyway, this is seen as a moral act.  But in trying to kill his uncle Claudius, he mistakenly kills Polonius.  This understandably upsets Laertes, son of Polonius.      So now Laertes wants to avenge his father's death, and incidentally seize the throne of Denmark.  But Claudius talks him into murdering Prince Hamlet instead, thereby leaving himself (Claudius) on the throne.      In the upshot, just about everybody kills each other off.  Fortinbras walks in and seizes the throne of Denmark by the simple act of sitting upon it.      Briefly, that is the plot.  But not the story.  The story is about \\"... how these things came about:  So shall you hear of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, and, in this upshot, purposes mistook fallen on the inventor's heads\\".      This story has lasted four hundred years for good reason, and Branagh's is the definitive production of it.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|On our first date, my soon-to-be husband told me, \\"I'm a good catch.\\"<br /><br />When I asked him why that was so, he responded, \\"I have really good benefits, including good health insurance with a low deductible.\\"<br /><br />But it turns out, having good health insurance may not be enough. The most chilling statistic I heard on this DVD was in the \\"special features\\" section. In that segment, he interviews author Marcia Angell (author, The Truth About Drug Companies\\"). More than 50% of personal bankruptcies are the result of medical bills and MORE THAN 75% OF THOSE PEOPLE had health insurance.<br /><br />Yes, 3/4s of the people who file for bankruptcy due to crippling medical expenses have (or had) health insurance and their health insurance company FAILED THEM. Now if that doesn't scare the bee-jeebies out of you, nothing will.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I rented this DVD because I'm one of those people who think that Michael Moore is a nut and I do not consider him to be a serious journalist, but rather someone who likes to massage the facts and figures until they are conformed into the size and shape he wants them to be.<br /><br />But the strength of Sicko is that he let the smart people do the talking. The experts that he interviewed (such as Marcia Angell) had a long list of impressive credentials. And the statements made by these people were enough to convince me to do more research on my own. And everything I've learned heretofore suggests, Sicko is right. We need to do something about health care in this country. It's a mess.<br /><br />My daughter recently donated a kidney to her best friend. Her best friend was 23-years-old and had amassed medical bills of more than $50,000 in two months. Yes, you read that right. Her best friend needed all kinds of special care to keep her alive while her kidneys failed. That $50,000 doesn't touch the transplant surgery. That was all pre-transplant stuff. And the cost of the anti-rejection drugs was obscene. Absolutely obscene.<br /><br />It is outrageous what has happened to the cost of medical care in this country and what is even more outrageous is the utter failure of private insurance companies to do what they promised to do: Provide payment in the event of minor and/or major health problems.<br /><br />I'm a staunch Republican and hard-care conservative but I think Sicko is correct. Our health-care system has failed us. Time to look hard at a national health care system.pened to the cost of medical care in this country and what is even more outrageous is the utter failure of private insurance companies to do what they promised to do: Provide payment in the event of minor and/or major health problems.

B000K7VHJQ|1.0|I like blood and guts just as much as the next guy (probably more so) but this film just has no entertainment (much less redeeming value) whatsover. Based on what is assumed to be a true story to many (though credible the evidence is certainly not) Mel Gibson basically beats the audience over the head with excessive violence and gore in order to get them to embrace his warped view of the world.<br /><br />So-called Chrisitans take note - you are endorsing the same torture porn that you so readily abuse hollywood for (in such movies as \\"Hostel\\" and \\"Saw 1-4). I believe last time I was unfortunate enough to hear a sermon hypocrisy was still a sin.<br /><br />Cinematograpy-wise the film impresses, and you have to be impressed by Jim Cavisiel's performance (or endurance really) but this is a sick, twisted, nasty squalid little film that if was about Harry down the street rather than Jebus the Christians would have condemned it outright.<br /><br />That being said, an honest film made about god's killing and maiming in the OT would also be just as repugnant - but at least it would make a more interesting story than watching this guy getting beating (and no-one could endure the pain).<br /><br />They say it's good to show the extent of the sacrifice that Jesus apparantly made, but what's the big sacrifice anyway when he knew he'd be back new and improved in 3 days time anyway and would get to fly off to heaven and come back a bit later to slaughter the rest of humanity (if they don't believe).<br /><br />Yuck, left a foul taste in my mouth this one - really Mel I wish you'd made Lethal Weapon 5 instead.

0553579908|5.0|This is the second book in George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. You definately should read the first book, A Game of Thrones, before picking up this one. It picks up right where that book left off.    In my opinion, this is one of the best series out there today. It is set in a medieval like setting, and it is not the usual 'chosen one saves the world' type story. There is lots of deception, intrigue, twists and turns, and true shockers. It sucked me in right away and now I'm hooked.    They have mature adult content. There is gore and vivid sex scenes in the storytelling, so it is for adults only. Give it a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|This film is a great addition to the line of die hard movies.  Bruce Willis brings back his classic NYPD police officer character John Mclain, who has a hero chip on his shoulder.  His family is in shatters, he's all alone, and low and behold, he gets the off duty call that he can't say no to, and is drug into a non-stop rollercoaster from there.  The action is non-stop, solid storyline, bit streached for how much damage one human body can take without dying.  Excellent film to pass time with.  Must see for any Bruce Willis, Die Hard fan.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This futuristic film about a to the letter \\"cleric\\" (similar to 'the cleaner') who suddenly finds himself going against everything he has known.<br /><br />There is no more war in a society that is without emotion thanks to a handy dandy drug that sounds an awful lot like Prozac. All things that stir emotions, literature, art, music, color are banned and those who are caught not taking their medication or collecting emotional paraphernalia pay for it with their lives. But there is an underground movement willing to risk it.<br /><br />One day John (Christian Bale) breaks a vile of his medication and ends up not replacing the daily dosage. This leads to another day, and another day until finally he's hiding his dosages and killing his teammates to protect \\"sensors\\" (people who've stopped taking their medication and are feeling again) and lost puppies.<br /><br />It sounds a little hokey but it is an awesome movie. Beautifully shot action scenes as well as dramatic scenes. The child who plays John's son is perfect as the emotionless child willing to turn in friend or family. The film does have reminders of other movies but it really doesn't take anything away from this film.<br /><br />It was nice to see guest appearances by Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), William Fichtner (Prison Break), Taye Diggs (Private Practice) and Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love).<br /><br />This is going to be one of repeat viewing movies and is a must see film for any futurists or Christian Bale fans.

B000VNMMRA|5.0|Ok, so it wasn't like I was TRULY dissapointed with Live Free or Die Hard when it was in theaters because it was still hard hitting and action packed, but it just wasn't the character that I had come to know and love with the other 3 Die Hards.<br /><br />I bought this Unrated Edition, however, expecting a few more Mother F-ers and of course the end of \\"Yippee Ki Yay...\\" unedited but was surprised about how much more I enjoyed it than I did the PG-13 edition.  There was some more blood, and a few more extras as well.  When I have bought Unrated DVDs, they have turned out to be dissapointments, for the most part.  Nothing really changed from when it was rated, they just wanted an extra buck, it seemed like, by slapping the Unrated in front of it. This Unrated DVD, however, has renewed my faith in buying them.<br /><br />This DVD is SPECTACULAR!  I give my 100% reccomendation of it.  If you were hurting for the 100% John McClane experience, this is it.  But if you wanted the watered down John McClane for the wife and kids, than you CAN HAVE your cake and eat it to!  It has been included as well, and is the first thing that you chose when you insert the disk.
0143034901|4.0|As a young boy, Daniel's father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books where he is allowed to select one book.  He finds a volume by Julian Carax called \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" which he becomes completely enamored with.  However, the book is rare and valuable, as a mysterious figure has been tracking down all of Carax's works and destroying them.  The story spans a decade, and the older Daniel gets, the more involving the Carax mystery becomes. A myriad of characters join the quest to discover the truth behind Carax's life and supposed death.  Set against the backdrop of post-war Barcelona, the book is rich in detail and spans decades through both Julian and Daniel's lives.  The mood is often dark, and I found myself absorbed in the atmosphere, lurking around the corners of deserted mansions along with Daniel and jumping at abrupt noises.  The book evolves throughout and transitions from past to present, and some characters from the beginning of the story become obscured and irrelevant.  But in general, it was a great story and a mystery that any book-lover would enjoy.

Lewis.  Well, we are there again.<br /><br />Aside from \\"deep themes\\" of theological mystery, just on the immediate level of narrative this story \\"kicks.\\"  It grips the reader, and forget expectations or cliche plots.  I defy anyone to predict -- halfway through -- where this story is going.<br /><br />Various church groups, mainly in America, have castigated the book for \\"spreading atheism.\\"  Well, Pullman seems more anti-clerical than atheist, although I have no idea what his personal beliefs may be.  Anticlericalism has been an old staple of European literature since Voltaire.  Much of this ill-considered attack seems based on ignorance.  Few of the bishops or fundamentalist ministers attacking the book have even a glimmer of understanding of literary history.<br /><br />Marvelous.  I can't waste time on this review-- have to get back to the third volume of the trilogy.  Can't stop.<br /><br />This is a real winner.  I'm out there in the snow cheering for Lyra.  Hope this spunky little lady keeps her courage and prevails!

B00110WFYW|5.0|When the first film in the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?<br /><br />Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when \\"The Two Towers\\" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.<br /><br />The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.<br /><br />This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (\\"Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!\\" Pippin wails when a \\"tree\\" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.<br /><br />And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.<br /><br />Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, which is warping our dear hobbit out of his own mind. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.<br /><br />But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman.<br /><br />The journey continues in \\"The Two Towers,\\" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" An amazing continuation.cluding the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard.

McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman.<br /><br />The journey continues in \\"The Two Towers,\\" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" An amazing continuation.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I loved this movie when it first showed at theaters. I never did purchase the DVD until Black Friday, the day after Christmas. I'm glad I waited! $6.99 for this 2-disc set! The movie itself is great (as long as you're not too squeamish about blood). Highly recommended.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|After reading the glowing reviews, I had nothing but the highest expectations from Ratatouille.  Ratatouille is terrible. I can describe it no other way.  What was the point of this film? I suppose something democratic like \\"anyone can cook,\\" but honestly, was that really the point?  The story was boring. Really boring...and predictable and way too long.  Ratatouille had two stories that went nowhere.<br />Everyone knows the premise by now: a rat works undercover as a chef in a fancy restaurant to prove that \\"anyone\\" can be a great chef if they want to. We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two \\"human\\" leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends. We don't; the story just limps to its foregone conclusion.<br />Not the worst film I have every seen but in no way what so ever a classic of any type.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It's been four years since the album has been released, but the album seems to be able to sound fresh any time.    \\"Absolution\\" is an absolute masterpiece, artistically, musically, and conceptually. As each song is unique individually, I was surprised how well the album flowed and functioned together as a whole. They've thrown in all types of colors onto the black canvas and made something colorful and coherent. Rock, electronics, orchestral strings, piano... all blended   into something so complex yet so controlled at the same time.. Every melody convey different emotions, and by the end of the album, I literally felt chills running down my back.    Matt's vocal is definitely one of the most exotic vocals I've heard for a band, with his distinctive soft vibrato and flexible falsetto. When I think of a band, I believe that every unit of a band has equal importance to the song and to the album. In Muse songs, especially this album, he practically uses his voice as an instrument. Even the lyrics, though simple and limited in words, seem to function as a whole other unit to add rhythm to the songs. It's not about singing anymore, but about creating sophisticated music. That very fact sets Muse apart from other bands.    The songs touch so many different realms that each song is a different experience. Most of the songs in here are rock-oriented, and then you suddenly have \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Butterfly and Hurricanes\\" that include classic, gorgeous strings and Matt's crazy piano. These different elements make the next track that follows refreshing from the previous.    The album is a roller coaster ride, and \\"Rule by Secrecy\\" is such an elegant song to end the album with. It's mysterious and sounds like an elegy, but there's a quality of it that keeps you contemplating, meditating, as the album comes to a closure.    Yes, Muse has Radiohead influences, but since when have artists not been influenced by others? Peter Paul Rubens have referred to Michelangelo. But to fuse those influences together with an original touch is also the ability of an artist. That is what Muse did here.
B00003CXA2|4.0|This movie is amazing, but the package was a little damaged. I still enjoyed my purchase though.
B000VJAICK|3.0|The film Tremors is as good as ever - campy, funny, silly, and lots of fun. However, this HD-DVD transfer is not worthy of the medium. The transfer improvement consists only of heavily over-sharpened footage (artifacts and edge halos) and way too much contrast. If you are even slightly discerning about the quality of your video (and if you're watching HD-DVD, I assume you are), then this rendition is somewhat disappointing.    Still, it's Tremors, and that counts for a lot :)
0974872407|5.0|Magical! For those readers of Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Love In The Time Of Cholera is the only other book I've read better than this one), this will be a nice side trip.  Do not underestimate Ruiz Zafon, the only problem is that this seems to be his only adult novel since his prior work was oriented to a younger audience.  Simply fantastic, can't wait to read his next book.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|I actually thought the Jason Bourne movies with Matt Damon got better as they went.  The first one was good until I realized that Bourne was going to be completely indestructible and that Damon's expression wasn't going to change much.<br /><br />The second one was the best.  He had the painful motivation to put his considerable skills to use and the action scenes were dynamite.<br /><br />The third one has some excellent action sequences as well and the movie gets up and moves most of the time...but a big \\"huh?\\" jumped out at the end.  Joan Allen's character is feeding intel to Bourne and she knows the CIA is listening in.  Now the CIA has to figure out what she means while the guy who DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS is supposed to make a connection.  I remember sitting in the theatre and thinking, \\"He doesn't know his name...how is he supposed to know his birthday?  And what to do with that number?\\"<br /><br />I almost didn't see the movie in theatres because of the smug interviews from Damon and the filmmakers at the release.  They kept insisting their spy movie was totally different from the \\"abhorrent\\" James Bond films.  \\"Our hero isn't an imperialist, misogynist, etc.\\"  But Bourne still knows how to kill just about everyone he encounters and blow stuff up!  But, see, he doesn't know WHY he does it, so it's completely okay.  Please.<br />(Last year's \\"Casino Royale\\" was one of the best action spy movies ever made).<br /><br />If the ending of this one hadn't been so implausible, I would've liked it as much as the second film.  Still, much better than most of the junk passing itself off as action thrillers.
1400097029|4.0|Coming to this book with some previous knowledge as to Banvilles reputation I was thrilled to read a fine, imaginative and extremely interesting work. Set in a countryside that I know well, The Sea captured memories of a time and place and interwove it with characters that were \\"real\\". In my view this novel merits its awards and allows every reader to enjoy the work of a fine novelist.It is very much a class apart from many others.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This album deserves every single star it can get.  Not the hardest punk around, but that's okay, because it's catchy to the point of being ridiculous.  I like melody in my punk, and these guys provide plenty of it.    There's variety in the drums, actually clever guitar riffs, and brilliant vocals.  The only song I wouldn't rate 5 stars is \\"The Approaching Curve\\", simply because of the spoken parts.    All in all this album is astounding.  Go and get it now.
0743486285|5.0|This book was so well written and designed.  It moves along well and just captivates your interest.  It is not just a diary of a heroin addict, but you get to know more about the addict through the information provided by those around him at the time.  I rarely ever buy hardback books (frankly, I'm too cheap), but this one was worth EVERY penny.  If you love rock, you'll love this book.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|The thriller genre has really achieved a prominent space where Tightrope (1994), and Absolute power (1997), found into the unsaid scandals behind stages a propitious opportunity to show the audiences new visions around erroneous tactics of Defense around an enigma that concerns us, from extreme to extreme around the world: the insatiable thirst of oil.<br /><br />And so, a well trained shooter will be the chosen prey, for a very zealously elaborated macabre murder, to create an opinion's matrix around his culpability. But this smart strategy ignored what the human factor can do, once the critical point has been reached.<br /><br />The well rounded script, the superb cast that includes the best performance of Mark Wahlberg in his lifetime and a fabulous direction effort make of this thriller the best of the year, after \\"Michael Clayton\\".<br /><br />Kudos !
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Awesome!!  Keeps you interested throughout the whole movie and leaves you wanting more. Great SciFi/Action and though it' SciFi, it makes you think.  I personally think it's an excellent movie with a great plot, great acting, great special effects/images.  Very underrated.
B0007WPJBQ|5.0|Confused by the contradictory reports on the Digiview Productions release of \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" found here in the Amazon customer reviews, I invested the few dollars to see for myself.  Here's the scoop.  It does say Full Frame version on the jewel case, but IT IS THE WIDESCREEN VERSION INSIDE.  I have been purchasing different versions of this movie on DVD for years now, looking for a good transfer, and this is, by far, the BEST TRANSFER of the film released to date.  The reviewer who suspects this is from the old laser edition is probably correct.  If you're a fan of this film, you must must own this version.  Good news, the price is right!
B000MZHW40|5.0|Whatever one may have thought about Leonardo DiCaprio prior to this film, it must be revised after seeing it.  If you liked his work before, this performance will elevate him further in your esteem.  If you had doubts about his abilities - as this reviewer did - \\"Blood Diamond\\" will dispel them.  The story of a civil war in the manufactured African nation of Sierra Leone, the film is nearly an art form of modern power struggles.  Violence is endemic, with meaningless killings, abduction of children to become soldiers and the waning light of justice in a world of social disruption.<br /><br />DiCaprio, in the character of Danny Archer, for all the strength of his depiction as a  trader, remains a middle level figure in the sweeping picture of the diamond trade.  Rebel armies have become mining managers as well as guerrilla fighters.  Villages are raided for workers and soldiers, leading to fisherman Solomon Vandy [Djimon Housou] being taken for the one and his son Dia for the other.  It's hard to know which scenes are more wrenching, the harsh discipline of the mining or the terror conditioning of the boy soldiers.  Solomon is revealed as having found a priceless diamond while he and Archer happen to be in the same gaol.  Archer sees an opportunity and takes up with Solomon, who is seeking his lost son.<br /><br />The interaction between the two men, with its added fillip of the white's dependency on the African, is almost serpentine.  We never really learn if Solomon expects to trade the diamond for his son, or use it to reunite and enrich his entire family.  Archer, under the tutelage of a mercenary colonel [with which Africa seems surfeited], must maintain a precarious balance.  That delicate role is complicated further when he meets a journalist with a sense of mission.  Watching this film the second time with Zwick's commentary on how Jennifer Connelly built the role of Maddy Bowen from accounts of women journalists in war zones is more than just informative.  It gives vivid credence to the wonderful scene where Bowen \\"disarms\\" a group of threatening rebels with her camera.<br /><br />To reach that point, Zwick and his production team have produced a stunning array of images.  From the grandeur of African landscapes in Mozambique, South Africa, Sierra Leone to the intimate close-ups of both major and minor characters, this film is exemplary cinematic drama.  Zwick's description of what had to be done to keep the film's impact strong without harm coming to the participants is enlightening.  That Housou and DiCaprio insisted on doing many action shots on their own instead of using stuntmen must have aged the director measureably.  What some of the battle scenes might have done to the extras, who were acting novices, is beyond description.  Zwick's selection of a 12-year-old music and drama student to play the child soldier is indicative.<br /><br />The denouement of this film is very nearly \\"Hollywood pap\\", but not quite.  The fate of Solomon and Dia, of Danny Archer, but mostly that of the diamond, are suffused with ironies.  While Zwick may not deserve credit for instigating changes in the diamond industry, the efforts of people such as Connelly portrayed most certainly do.  It's encouraging that a film such as this could come out of Hollywood instead of a European studio.  Hollywood may be shedding its fear of reality.  One can only hope that audiences can cope with it as well.

032147404X|5.0|This is a good and simple book.  Doesn't focus on all the technical details, just gives good suggestions. I find myself refering to it again every once in a while to get new ideas for photos.  Very well written and broken up into great one-pagers.  I'd also recommend his photoshop book, which is excellent.
0316172324|5.0|Wow! Finally I get to read a book that shows the other side of this coin. M. Gladwell makes a superb work at giving a different idea of how we make judgements and therefore, how we can manage under certain circumstances those belly messages (according to his book, perhaps, only perhaps, we should give more credit to them than we do...). Each reader can make his / her own interpretation of the cases presented and then, understand and apply to every particular experience. Every case presented in this book is (to say the least) fascinating... one of those books you can't stop reading once you opened it!
0671027344|5.0|I was so gald I read this book before starting high school. It is an insightful, darkly humorous, and beautiful look at surviving adolesence. I took this to camp last summer and everyone wanted to borrow it. Definitely one of my favorite books!
1881273156|5.0|The Five Love Languages is a great book for figuring out what makes your wife or husband tick -- at least in five broad areas.  The idea is that you read this book and discern the one or two \\"love languages\\" that you naturally respond to.  Then, you share them with your husband or wife so that he or she knows how better to speak to and give in ways that meet your needs.    The concept works well with any relationship.    My wife and I give a copy to every couple that we know that gets married.  It especially helped in a couple who had personalities that were polar opposites in many ways.  This helped them to stop talking past each other.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|I had given up on Stephen King adaptions. But I have to say, this movie was great. It leaves you with a feeling of dread. The huge monster walking over the truck at the end was just terrifying and inspired such a feeling of Armegeddon and Apocalypse. There is no happy ending here. You will leave the cinema very disturbed by this movie.<br />I was trying to figure out if it really was Armegeddon as told in the Bible, or if it was government experimentation gone wrong. The film depicts events as told in the book of Revelations about the end of the world. You will be guessing right up to the end.
B0001I561E|5.0|I just wanted to say thank you for making my kids Christmas on mine as well.  They have been wanting this movie and I haven't been able to locate it for a decent price.  I was really impressed w/ how fast I got the DVD and look forward to being able to watch it w/ the kids.  Again thank you and I will be purchasing from you in the near future.
1582701709|2.0|There is more to the Law of attraction and creating your own reality, than is covered in this book. In truth, the laws of mind were only taught to disciples in a mystery school, after many years of purification. You see, it is possible to misuse the power of mind and get totally enmeshed in the acquisition of material things. That's why spiritual development is necessary before getting involved with these laws.  To really understand Humanity's next step beyond the teaching of The Secret, I highly recommend THE POWERS OF THOUGHT, by OMRAAM MIKHAEL AIVANHOV
0316067598|1.0|For many reasons, I expected to enjoy this book.  I'm the daughter and granddaugther of veterans, with close friends who've served in Iraq, and a history major who enjoys military histories.  Still, I returned this to the library after reading only the first three chapters - so technically, this is a review of only the beginning of the book.    Luttrell lost me pretty early on.  He speaks of how he was going to do \\"God's work\\" - call me picky, but it's not like the Navy Seals were heading to Afghanistan to help feed the hungry.  Their mission might best be termed a necessary evil, but referring to killing enemies as \\"God's work\\" makes Luttrell sound strangely similar to the very men he was ordered to destroy.      Speaking of those men, Luttrell considers them \\"crazy\\" and speaks of how they must be worshipping some other god since they're willing to kill civilians and innocents.  Sadly, the Taliban fighters are not crazy at all - fanatical, yes, but not crazy. If they were, they wouldn't capable of carrying out such consistent, long-term attacks against U.S. forces.  As for worshipping some other god? Here Luttrell betrays his complete lack of knowledge of the Muslim faith, and a serious lack of education in history as well.  There are plenty of examples of innocents being killed in the name of Christ - one need look no further than the actions of the Spanish upon arriving in the New World, or the Crusades.  It's perspectives (or lack of perspective) like Luttrell's that have kept Christians and Muslims locked in tragic conflict for centuries.    Ultimately, I think what doomed this book for me was that it was written by Marcus Luttrell.  In his zest to portray the U.S. military's actions in Afghanistan as the ultimate in \\"good\\", he frankly loses all credibility and comes off as arrogant and small-minded.  Maybe he actually believes his own rhetoric; maybe it's a desperate attempt to reassure himself that his friends died for a cause worth dying for.     Perhaps hadPatrick Robinson written the book as a third-person account based on interviews with Luttrell, he could have injected some necessary perspective, similar to Mark Bowden's excellent \\"Black Hawk Down\\".  Perhaps had Luttrell resisted the urge to make \\"his\\" side God's infallible warriors and the other side the ultimate evil, he could have created a nuanced, heart-wrenching account of tragic loss like Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\".      I have no doubt that Luttrell's friends died bravely and honorably, as Navy Seals do. I'll have to wait to hear their story until someone makes a movie about it though, simply because I find Luttrell so arrogant and myopic that I can't finish the book.  If the things I listed above don't bother you, then this may be the book for you, as it seems to be for so many people.  If you find these things troubling, then move this from your \\"buy it\\" list to your \\"library, maybe\\" list.

1582701709|3.0|This is the perfect gift -- for someone who is gullible and greedy.  It sucks you in with it's slicker-than-Madison Avenue-and-Tupperware- combined promotional campaign, its alluring title, and its thrilling promises.  Then it shamelessly \\"blames the victim\\" and panders to your superstitions, prejudices, and desire for an easy path to enlightenment.        There is no easy path to enlightenment.  There is an easy path to wealth - write a book like this, or one promising easy weight-loss, easy fitness, or easy love relationships. But there is no easy path to any of these. Those who are reading this have the great good fortune to be among the wealthiest 10% of the world's people.  After that, it takes more good fortune and a lot of hard work to achieve anything worth achieving.  Except, that is, for crooks, snake oil salemen, and authors of books like this.          As for enlightenment - live fully in each moment; love everything about that moment; and feel gratitude for each moment.
B000TGCR38|1.0|This movie is awful.  I you are under the age of 10 you may be able to deal with the historical mistakes and convenient coincidences, but otherwise this movie's soft plot will make you cringe.  First of all, conflict is created in the movie when a damaged Allied bomber happens to drop its payload on our heroin's safe house.  Coincidentally, she happens to be talking with a man with a sailboat at the time who is happy to help her escape to his farm with no regard for the risk to him and his family.  Soon afterward she escapes a Nazi ambush on a barge that results in the death of her family.  Although the Germans see her leap into the water they do not really pursue her and she swims away.  Somehow she connects with the resistance (it is never really explained how a wet fugitive in occupied Holland is able to evade the Nazis, find dry clothes, avoid observation and conveniently connect with the resistance).  Soon afterward a halftrack full of armed German troops surprises the resistance team.  Although the group is completely surprised they are able to overpower the troops (and their armored halftrack) and kill them all with no injuries to themselves.  They then decide that the troops \\"must have been working on their own\\" and that there is no need to worry about more Nazis.  It is never explained nor do they explain how they conveniently get rid of the troops and the halftrack.  There also seem to be no repercussions as a result of these missing troops.  Our heroin then goes on to find a Gestapo officer who is lonely and sympathetic to her hardships.  I could go on and on regarding the ridiculousness of this movie, but I think I have made my point.  For those looking for a good WW2 era suspense movie I would suggest \\"Eye of the Needle\\" or \\"Enigma\\".  This one is a loser.
B00065MDS6|5.0|This album was and is a remarkable achievement, probably far less accesible than most other Crimson works and not one for the new Crimson listener. Most later fans of the band would be hard pressed to believe that Fripp  plays only classical guitar on virtually all of side one, some great mellotron work throughout not to mention the wonderful horn and woodwind work on side two. Wonderful early fusion from 1970 especially on side two of the original vinyl 'the lizard suite'. I'm a Crimson fan since the early 70's and have always considered 'larks tongues' their greatest achievement  but for some reason still find myself listening to this more than any other of the works. Must have for any prog rock fan.

B000VS6P9Q|5.0|I just looked over some of the reviews for this album, and I can't believe how many old hippies have posted on here about how \\"only Bob can do Bob\\" (one old-timer even insisted that the list of great artists to cover him begins with the horrible, uninspired noodlings of the Grateful Dead!). These songs are reinterpretations of great songs, and yes, many of them are quite different than the originals. One reviewer suggested that these versions are \\"too modern,\\" which says a great deal about that person's closed-mindedness when it comes to music produced after the 1960s. Most of the other negative reviews are clearly unfamiliar with the bands on this album (most of whom are pretty popular among music fans, by the way). I don't know why anyone would want these songs to sound just like Dylan, or why anyone would say he'd rather hear Dylan do them when all he'd have to do is pop a Dylan album in.  This is an excellent soundtrack full of excellent versions of excellent songs. It's really interesting, too: halfway through my first listen to Ramblin' Jack Elliott's version of \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\\" I was about to dismiss it as a cheap Dylan imitation, only to realize that hey, early, acoustic Dylan is really a cheap Ramblin' Jack impression, as he's the first to admit, so it's really almost like hearing 1963-era Dylan covering 1965-era Dylan, if you catch my drift, which is really awesome. Other highlights include Sonic Youth doing a great job with the title song; Jim James and Calexico absolutely killing \\"Going to Acapulco\\"; Malkmus's unbelievable \\"Ballad of a Thin Man, in which his slacker-drawl somehow turns the song into something that I can't help dancing to; Yo La Tengo's \\"Fourth Time Around\\" with Georgia on vocals; Malkmus again on \\"Maggie's Farm\\"; Mason Jennings's versions of the folkie stuff; and the excellent backing by Calexico and the supergroup Million Dollar Bashers. Even Jack Johnson, whom I normally find too vanilla, does a really good job with \\"Mama, You've Been on My Mind.\\" Only Sufjan Stevens stinks up the joint, doing a limp-wristed, Lawrence Welk-ified version of \\"Ring Them Bells\\" that doesn't fit in at all with the rest of the record (but then again, in my opinion Stevens ruins everything he touches).  This is exactly the right kind of soundtrack for this movie: it's smart, artistic, and challenging, and the kind of people who want to see their hero preserved in a time capsule like some sort of psychedelic Vladimir Lenin will undoubtedly be frightened out of their tie-dye. Plus, the vinyl version is four LPs, which is pretty cool.

0142406112|5.0|I am coming late to the Alex Rider series as my oldest son is only seven. This is the second Alex Rider book that I've read, for the purpose of understanding when my spy-obsessed son might be old enough to start reading the series.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book. It obviously lacks the complexity and depth of a book written for adults, but it is still a fast paced and enjoyable thriller that borrows heavily on the James Bond and Mission Impossible franchises. Alex Rider makes a likable hero who is brave, tenacious and resourceful.<br /><br />I would feel comfortable giving it to my son to read when he's a little older - my gut feel is 9-10 years would be about right. He still needs to strengthen his reading skills (words like interrogation, hyperventilating, cloying, claustrophobic and exquisite are typical), but also to develop the maturity to cope with a plot that involves a fair amount of violence (the book opens with the death of Alex's uncle and bad guys get shot on a regular basis).<br /><br />Here are some things that parents may like to know about this book:<br />- The storyline is reasonably simple and the bad guy/good guy lines are clearly drawn.<br />- Violence is not described in overly graphic detail, but it does occur throughout the book. Alex fires a gun twice and hits a bad guy on one occasion. He also causes the death of another villain by causing a plane crash.<br />- There is no swearing or bad language.<br />- There is a noticeable absence of positive female characters (unless you count the housekeeper who barely appears). There is a reference by the MI5 (the English equivalent of the FBI) regarding female agents predominantly being of use if you need to slip someone in as a secretary or receptionist.
0440238609|1.0|The book had the potential to be a great story but the writer failed to have any characters with any character.  The main character is just an obnoxious brat who it impossible to have any sympathy for.

B000M341QE|3.0|Jack Nicholson is a Boston crime boss, Matt Damon is part of his organizatin but is also a cop. DiCaprio is a cop working undercover as a member of Nicholson's gang. DiCaprio gains Nicholson's trust and is instructed to look for a rat in the gang which happens to be himself. The cops know someone among them is working for Nicholson, so Damon is tapped to find him which again happens to be himself. Along the way, they both fall in love with the same woman. And in the end I didn't care about any of it.    We've seen this movie before, done better, and by the same director. How many mob movies are too many? If you're going to do one, there has to be something special about it and The Departed is ordinary. I enjoyed it, but I never need to see it again. Nicholson is just playing himself, the movie is at least a half hour too long and was actually dull in spots.
0783114893|5.0|Sorry Sean Bean your a fine actor but, your no Rutger Hauer. Hauer nailed that role as \\"John Ryder\\" no one else can play that part. Rutger Hauer performance is so amazing as soon as he gets in that car he steals the show he plays the villain very well. Hauer and Howell were so good together it was so real. The car seen between the two in the beginning of the movie was so well done they have very good chemisrty together. In the new movie they added a third person makes no sense at all. It's about a young man driving a drive away car to California, he get's tired so he sees a guy hitching a ride on the side of the road he looks normal and picks him up all he wanted was some one to talk to and keep him a wake. The guy gets in the car and he just happens to be a crazy psycho killer. Having the third person (Remake) in the car took away from the movie. The guy is driving scared out of his mind because, he has a knife in his face the hitcher (Hauer) is crazy your sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see if this poor guy makes it or not. No need for a third person very bad move. Why make a remake of this classic? They should of played it in the theaters again like they did \\"Jaws\\" for it's 20th Anniversary. Don't mess with perfection especially if Rutger Hauer is in the movie.

074325144X|4.0|I highly recommend this book. The techniques in the book really do work, no matter what one thinks about the philosophy behind it. I'm 23 and have been running regularly for about 12 years, though only semi-competitively for about a year. In my sophomore year in college, I was training for the possibility of going into OCS and ended up overtraining. I suffered a relatively serious stress fracture by doing the things that the author of this book warns against. I recently completed a marathon using the techniques in this book, and was amazed at the improvement in my time, and the way my body felt after the race. These techniques are solid, especially for experienced runners looking to improve their distances/times. The Eastern philosophy sprinkled throughout the book is entertaining and, as with all philosophy, good brain candy to chew on.
0440238609|5.0|I read all three books. I thought they all were well written - the first being a fantastic read ... even given the anti-catholic views you can't help but notice throughout the stories. I don't see the books as detrimental to anyone's faith. It is what it is ... well written fiction - albeit you wouldn't mind the girl being replaced with a more likeable main character (and maybe gotten rid of some of the daemons. Some were just downright creepy). Someone should have taken notes from Tolkein, Rowling and Lewis. Unfortunately, the movie was a major disappointment. Like Timeline, Da Vinci Code and a few others out there, DON'T READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE! You'll be severely disappointed.<br />Would I let my nine year old read this book? Probably not right now - He has read and enjoyed Lewis and Rowling, but I don't think he's quite ready for Pullman. As a librarian, I would reserve this book for the high-schoolers....maybe even jr. high depending on their level of understanding, but not any younger. Thankfully, we aren't lacking great reads before he's old enough for this one.<br />As to this book being anything like Harry Potter, Tolkeins works of art, or Narnia ...forget it! Someone clearly hasn't read them. There is just no possible comparison! Although, there are some \\"newbies\\" out there that come close to being great written works of art - His Dark Materials isn't one of them ... even if it's been out for a while and had a movie made.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I think none needs explanation for this masterpiece, Michael is simply Sinatra's heir as evidenced on the rendition of The Best Is Yet To Come.<br /><br />I have been lamenting for the lack of romantic and smooth artists in contemporary music scene but when I saw him singing Call Me Irresponsible, I I decided to buy this amazing CD until I realized he had better songs.<br /><br />All songs (except Everything) were produced by the legendary David Foster ; a man I always consider to be one the greatest music producers/composers of all time... Foster was the force behind Josh Groban, The Corrs, All-4-One, Whitney Houston, The Bee Gees and many other artists.<br /><br />However, the best moment on the album is the jazzy-bombastic \\"Everything\\". This track here is simply the BOMB. Its grammy nomination did not surprise me... I'd be shocked if it doesn't win!<br /><br />The other honorable tracks are:<br /><br />Lost 4.5/5<br />Call Me Irresponsible 4.5/5<br />Me And Mrs. Jones 4/5<br />Wonderful Tonight 3.5/5 (Babyface did better on his latest \\"Playlist\\" cover album)<br /><br />Monsieur Bubl&eacute;, thanks for reviving real music!
1582701709|3.0|I'm reading the book half through, and I have read both camps' review on this book.    Honestly, I don't know whether I want to take sides or I will just share my own dilemma.    Here's the thing: I've always enjoyed the books of Oliver Sacks or others on the topic of human brains. BBC just aired a mini series on human's amazing brains. They all come to the same conclusion: we all still know very little about the grey matter between our ears.    Now, the Secret. Is it scam? Is it real? What makes it hard to decide is because it deals with human mind and brain, a very elusive item. If I put on my scientific cap, then by consequence I can NOT dismiss the book just because it does not \\"make sense\\". Centuries ago, it did not \\"make sense\\" for earth to revolve around the Sun, and sheer observation seemed to \\"prove\\" that, until later optical technology proved otherwise. A scientist is open to everything, with the intent to test its validity. Given our limited knowledge of human brain and means to experiment with it, I don't think it is also 'scientific' to jump to conclusion that the Secret is a complete scam.    So here's my take. Would I believe that by sheer will power a red ferrari will come to my door? Probably not. But the fact that positive thinking has health effect has been shown in many academic studies. And if you have positive thinking, you have better immune system, you are healthier, you are more effective, you live your life fuller - isn't all that the prerequisite to fortune?    Read the book anyway, but use your brain. You may need more than a grain a salt, but there are still nuggets of wisdom applicable in life here.

B000VDDDY6|3.0|Lots of disc quality problems: freezing playback, disc read errors. The sound of the shows was much lower than the sound of the menus, leading other people in the house to yell at me between episodes. I agree with others that the menu is hard to figure out when all three episodes on the HD-DVD are not listed at once - and for no apparent reason. My package from Amazon arrived with broken plastic pieces. The case was hard to open, and it was impossible to remove the inner case without putting fingerprints on the first DVD, which had nothing covering it. However, the new effects made the episodes better. You no longer had to wonder how a purple or pink blob of a planet could support life. I probably won't bother to get season 2 or 3, since even the best special effects could never make up for the poor scripts.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|Wow -- what a ride.  I realize that's not too profound.  I really liked the job Wiseman did directing the Underworld movies, and he really put his heart into this one.  His determination to use \\"practical\\" effects whenever possible results in far greater realism today's typical CGI-fests.  This is a thoroughly thrilling and entertaining movie.  Until this fourth movie came out, the Diehard franchise was just one great movie followed by two weaker sequels.  Ho hum, typical Hollywood.  But this one really puts Diehard back on the map.  I kind of hope they leave it at four, as it's hard to imagine what they could do that wouldn't be a let down after this one.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Dude this rocks! So many great songs and the Syd Barret tribute is wonderful! Dark Globe and David Bowie as special guest on Arnold Layne.  Great to see more guest appearances by living legends that are supposed to be dead but somehow survived like Crosby and Nash and others man!  Its all put together well and long enough to satisfy any fan being 5 bloody hours of music and it's done so well. Amazing Gilmour still has a voice as good as when he was a wee lad. And that he can still perform and play the guitar as well as he does. The 5.1 sound makes this even better and sounds incredible on my 5.1 system!  Davis Gilmour is still rockin and making music as good as when he was young. Not The Stones, The Scorpions, and Styx can not match what Gilmour is now. \\"On an Island\\" is the best album of the decade without question! My wife gave me that album when I was falling madly in love with her and took her. What a great gift to please a man. And to show me she loves me more she ordered this for me. Can't you just feel the love!
B000P46QTA|5.0|Sometimes all it takes is a word and someone's life is changed forever. While attending a play by celebrated playwright Georg Dreyman (Koch) in 1980s East Germany, Stasi secret agent Wiesler (Muhe) is told by the Minister Of Culture that the writer doesn't always tow the party line. That's all it takes - Wiesler is on the case and Dreyman's apartment is bugged. Occupying the attic of Dreyman's apartment block, Wielser spies on the writer and pieces together a plot to publish subversive articles outside the country. But slowly, the cold and detached agent is drawn to the life of Dreyman and his cause. The Lives Of Others is a gripping and intriguing drama with a cracking script, excellent performances and a director who knows what he's doing. Von Donnersmarck drains the screen of any colour, leaving us with a dour grey which compliments the drab surroundings of his East Germany. The acting throughout is flawless but it's without a doubt Muhe's film. It's an arresting (pun intended) performance from Muhe, who personifies the coldness of the secret police whose ambition it was to 'know everything'. The Lives Of Others is a film of a hundred little ingenious touches that add up to one satisfying film experience.

B000W1V5VU|5.0|When casino owner Willy Bank (Pacino) double-crosses Reuben (Elliot Gould), it has such an effect on him that he suffers a heart attack on the spot. With Reuben confined to bed, Danny Ocean (Clooney) and the boys, proving that there is honour among thieves, band together to bankrupt Bank on the opening night of his new casino. However, because the plan is the most elaborate yet, they need the help of their former enemy Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) and his asking price ups the stakes some more. That's the plot, but most of us just want to see Clooney and co. do their smug thing one more time for smugness' sake. Like Twelve, it's best to put the plot - that includes (among others) Carl Reiner's hotel inspector, a trade union dispute in Mexico, simulated earthquakes and Vincent Cassel's revenge - to one side and sit back and enjoy the verbal back-and-forth, the close calls, the funky soundtrack and Soderbergh's sexy '70's approach. Everything that worked in the previous two instalments (although there's no sign of Julia Roberts) makes a welcome comeback: Pitt and Clooney's 'going nowhere' dialogue is honed, Damon is given more room to manoeuvre and the male camaraderie is very much to the fore (Ellen Barkin's 'cougar' is the only femme on show). Even Pacino is reserved. The Ocean's trilogy is terrific and right-on perfect entertainment, but another one would be asking too much--never know????
B00005JNX0|2.0|OK, it's a fair story. There are lots of good-buddy moments, where friends do all they can to keep their friends happy, and even a sermonette about loving the people who matter even when they're very hard to love. There are wild personalities, inane hijinx and cute cuddly animals. You know, the usual.<br /><br />There are kids' movies that that reach out to the grownups too. Then there are kids' movies just for the kids, and maybe not for the brightest among them. This bit of fluff is one of the latter, unfortunately. There's nothing actually wrong with it - but there's nothing memorably right about it, either.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0486446859|5.0|As a child I was thrilled with Arthur Rackham's illustrations and I haven't lost my love for his work. They're timeless. He combines the real world with magical kingdoms, the almost-grotesque creatures with the unusually beautiful, the fairy creatures with the mortals, humor with terror. Rackham paints beautiful landscapes and beautiful people, yet we know to beware of the creatures who may lurk under the gnarly tree roots. His colors are subdued, but rich; and his detail is gracefully executed.<br /><br />His illustrations have been and still are an inspiration to artists who wish to delve into an imaginative realm. And for those who wish to delve in themselves, I highly recommend this excellent book. Thanks to Arthur Rackham, the fairy world is alive and well, and shall remain so.<br /><br />Denise Hillman Moynahan<br />The Great Cavern of the Winds: Tales from Backbone Mountain
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The Beatles will forever be legendary in the history of rock and roll music, their songs are unforgetable and their impact nothing less than amazing. Yet some how every now and again a new release from the Beatles comes to us that makes us look at the Fab Four in a whole new light.<br /><br />This time the Beatles come to us in the form of a brand new Cirque De Soleil show called 'Love'. Being in Vegas over the summer and completly missing that show really ticked me off. So when I was given this album for the holidays I crave a chance to go back to see the show. 'Love' is 26 tracks that span the whole history of the Beatles music. You really have to listen to the well put together flow. Listen for the blends of songs with a couple tracks as well as one of their songs played backwards and a bunch of other surprises that await you on this Magical Journey. Definitely take advantage of the two disc set with the audio dvd it is definitely a added treat and as a whole one amazing gift for the Beatles fan in your life. This piece once again shapes this band into a whole new animal eventhough they are no longer together this album was definitely made with their true style in mind.
B000002JSJ|4.0|( Written by Ted Buchanan-rabid Zep fan)     1976 was the beginning of the end of Led Zeppelin. In the wake of terrible reviews of their concert film,'The Song Remains the Same', Page, Plant, Bonzo, and Jones had to deal with the sudden rise of Punk Rock and New Wave which was oozing out of the cracks in the U.K. These young rebels resented Zeppelin calling them 'Bloated old farts.' Ironically, a very young Billy Idol had a verbal row with the band at that time  at a local studio. Zeppelin ignored these fools and released another landmark album: Presence. This was to be an epic, powerhouse recording that is somewhat misunderstood by fans and critics alike today. The freaky album art, complete with 'The Object' tripped out most people. The 10 min. plus \\"Achilles Last Stand' and the blistering 'Nobody's Fault but Mine' catipulted album sales and got America ready for Zeppelin's return after a  2 year absence. In 1977, the US Tour was zooming into middle-America and the fans went nuts, resulting in many skirmishes with police at some venues. The tour started with a 'heavy' vibe and unfortunately got alot worse from there. Peter Grant was having personal issues, Plant had recorded the album with his leg in a cast and was very nervous about returning to the states to perform. Bonzo and an assistant got involved in a brawl that involved a rival music industry security management employee which led to arrests. Page had to deal with a negative press and 'Satanic' rumours about 'bad karma' within the band. A close member of Zep's management declared later,\\"That tour never should have happened. It was just wrong.\\"  Persistent rumors spread regarding Jimmy's heroin addiction, underage girls,and even a 'curse' placed on the band. Toward the end of a successful US Tour, a bombshell: Robert Plant got a call that his young son had died from a freak virus. All remaning US dates were cancelled and the band un-officially broke up. Zeppelin would never play in America again.
B00007LTIL|5.0|Live performance aside, this could be the Grateful Dead at their best.  Every song is like a hymn- uplifting, almost spiritual in their own individual ways.  Timeless, restorative, at times celebratory, deeply personal music.

B00006CXSS|5.0|the best series I have ever seen bar none - Lewis is a great actor as are the others.
B00008DDXC|4.0|\\"Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets\\" is an excellent film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's book.  Having read the book, I was impressed by how recognizable the film was, very like the original.  Chris Columbus directed \\"Rent,\\" \\"Mrs. Doubtfire,\\" & \\"Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" as it was titled in the USA.  The young actors who are the leads fill the film well and seem to be growing in ability with each of the films. Daniel Radcliffe created a stir by taking off his clothes on the British stage for Equus and has appeared in \\"The Tailor of Panama.\\"  As Harry Potter, he does a good job of showing Harry's stubbornness, his loyalty and compassion.  Rupert Grint was in \\"Driving Lessons\\" in 2006.  As Ron Weasley he is the sidekick who can stand by Harry, even when he doesn't understand.  Emma Watson seems a perfect choice to play the brainy Hermione Granger.  I greatly enjoyed this film.  From Moaning Myrtle to Dobby to Lucius Malfoy's malevolent snicker to the visuals as Harry slides down into the chamber, Columbus kept the pacing building right to the climax.  Harry Potter unravels very much like a mystery story with the twist that the magical world events make the clues pure delightful fantasy.  Words like \\"muggles\\" seep into our vocabulary with perfectly clear understanding.  The bonus DVD is full of interesting cast interviews of the younger actors, the villains and the teachers.  This is one of my favorite rainy day films to watch again & again.  Enjoy!
0743455967|5.0|I didn't expect to love this book. Sure, I wanted to read the story behind Stephen King. I also wanted to pick his brain (the non-scary part anyway.)<br /><br />On Writing is far more than a how-to book. It is loaded with how-to and even why-to. But far more than the simple illustrations like the understandable tool box, and how to write first and edit later, the book is full of heart.<br /><br />King shares his personal and very colorful journey from boyhood to near death and then beyond to his recovery. He writes about his passion -- writing. And his even greater passion -- Tabby, his wife.<br /><br />Those who love good stories should consider reading On Writing for the story of Stephen King. Romance lovers will likely sigh at the beauty of the marriage in the midst of success, fame and tragedy.  Writers will gain permission to be writers with their own bent and be given help to shape that bent.<br /><br />King doesn't coddle or pull any punches. Some of what he says is hard to accept if you are still in your dreamy-eyed-writer-wannabe stage. But if you are ready to be realistic, King gives great advice.<br /><br />The man is also a maestro with language, including the queen mother of all curse words, so if you are offended by language, you might want to move down the shelf.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is by far the most enjoyable and engaging writing book I've read.
0385493622|5.0|If you don't think math can be sexy and exciting, then you ought to give Singh's book a read.<br /><br />By the time Pierre de Fermat - sometime civil servant and occasional brilliant mathematician - left this earth, he'd left an indelible mark on the 17th century.  His work with Pascal on \\"laws of chance\\" (considered by some an oxymoron) was groundbreaking and enduring, as was his contribution to proto-calculus.<br /><br />Fermat, though, was very often remembered for something he wrote in contrast with Pythaoreas' famous theorum (x squared plus y squared equals z squared).  Fermat posited that x to the n power plus y to the n power equals z to the n power where n is any whole number greater than two has no solutions.  He then wrote in his book \\"I have a truly marvelous proposition which this margin it too narrow to contain.\\"<br /><br />This entry - a margin note in Fermat's copy of a venerable math text - served as a nagging problem for the next several centuries.<br /><br />One of the beauties of Dr. Singh's book is the accessible and fascinating mathematical history provided as a context for the narrative of this striking journey up a mathematical Mt. Everest.  From the secrets of the ancient Greek Pythagorean Brotherhood through the tragic tale of 20th century Japanese number-cruncher Yutaka Taniyama, the story unfolds as a marked human tale complete with duels, contests, clashes of personality and numerous painful mathematical dead-ends.<br /><br />The backdrop for the entire story is the modern account of Andrew Wiles whose lifelong goal was to solve Fermat's riddle.  This quiet mathematician was thrust into the spotlight through his wrestling with the venerable problem, and this is in a great way his story.  Dr. Singh also produced the award winning documentary \\"The Proof\\" for PBS.

B000P0J0DI|5.0|Clint Eastwood revisits his movie cowboy roots one last time in 1992's highly acclaimed \\"Unforgiven.\\" Eastwood directs and stars as one William Munny, retired gunman and formerly notorious killer, now in unsuccessful retirement as a pig-farming widower with two small children. The opportunity to make some money comes in the person of the Schofield Kid, a young, cocky, and inexperienced gunman wanna-be headed to Wyoming to collect the bounty for a revenge killing in the small town of Big Whiskey. Munny goes along, and recruits his former side-kick Ned Logan (played by Morgan Freeman), also retired.<br /><br />Big Whiskey is run by its tough-talking, preening sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, played with smooth menace by Gene Hackman. For Little Bill, the free ranging gunmen of an earlier era are meant to be a dying breed, and he runs out of town the first man who shows up to collect the revenge killing bounty (Richard Harris in a nice cameo).<br /><br />Munny, Logan, and the Schofield Kid reach Big Whiskey and promptly run afoul of the sheriff.  The story is no dime novel, as Eastwood purposely deglamorizes the Western myth. Big Whiskey is barely a muddy wide spot in the road, easily run by a bullying sheriff with a big ego, who tolerates prostitution and the abuse of the prostitutes by ranch hands. Munny and Logan are well past their prime.  The final confrontation with Little Bill is fueled by whiskey and grief.<br /><br />Eastwood's direction is spare and straightforward. The dialogue is laconic but authentic to the period. The cast, beyond the headlining actors, does a nice job of portraying the dreams and struggles of people in a small place. This movie is highly recommended as a masterpiece of Eastwood's movie-making art and as perhaps his last look at the movie cowboy.

B0000026DJ|5.0|\\"Diesel and Dust\\" was Midnight Oil's perfect storm of an album. Peter Garret was still passionate (well, he always was), and the rest of the band, in particualr bassist Peter Gifford and drummer Rob Hirst, kicked up their best rock and roll A-game. The Oils shucked some of the artier motifs that bogged down [[ASIN:B0000025X6 10, 9, 8...]] and [[ASIN:B00000263U Red Sails in the Sunset]], and switched to dance floor propulsion. The result was the politcorock of \\"Beds are Burning\\" became an international smash both on rock radio and in the clubs. Yet it came with absolutely no condensation of the band's roots; the songs were as fiery and as socially spiked as ever.<br /><br />In fact, this may have been Midnight Oil's most homeland-centric album. Everything from the single to the closing \\"Sometimes\\" addresses issues in some form or another. Some are blatant (\\"Beds are Burning's\\" pointed look at aboriginal rights, \\"The Dead Heart's\\" anti-mining rant) to oblique (the plea to not sell out on \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Arctic World\\"). Even the weaker material (\\"Whoah\\") would be great on a lesser album. It's a shame that few bands have ever tried to follow where Midnight Oil tread...it's been a long time since a band so forcefully took a stand AND made a successful commercial run at it.<br /><br />Given the timing of their breakthrough, \\"Diesel and Dust\\" may have been at a moment when being socially and politically actionable was acceptable. 1987-88 were also the years [[ASIN:B000WZB944 Joshua Tree]] ruled the world and artists like [[ASIN:B000002H35 The Call]], [[ASIN:B000065VA1 Peter Gabriel]] and [[ASIN:B0000793ZB Simple Minds]] were making anthemic rock chart-worthy. But no-one mixed it up quite like Midnight Oil, and \\"Diesel and Dust\\" was the peak of their curve.
B000V7O0H6|4.0|This was a good movie in my opinion. I am not even a Superman fan. But the HD in this movie was fantastic. I have only been watching movies in HD for about two months now and I rank this one on the top of my list with Transformers and Shrek 3. This is a must have for HD-DVD fans!
B000P46QTA|5.0|This movie is so well made and with such depth of character and depiction of a totalitarian system, that it gives the viewer much to contemplate. It shows a ponerized society in it's final stages, when creativity is completely stifled. I liked the way the Stasi captain was depicted, who was ideologically driven and the process he underwent. It would be hard to write more without revealing too much of the plot. In light of the way Western society is marching in a fascist direction with surveillance and torture becoming the norm this movie is a must see. To understand about ponerology, I can recommend a book I recently read called [[ASIN:1897244258 Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)]], as it compliments this film nicely.

B000VI70WM|3.0|I was really anticipating this album, although I had qualms when I learned Andy left the band and they scrapped the work they had done, and started over with Timbaland (bleh!).   I worried that the guitar would leave with Andy, and I was right.  There is some interesting stuff on here, but the mix is all wrong.  I will download most of the tracks into my iPOD and will occasionally listen, unlike the one and only track I downloaded from DD's Pop Trash. However,  I will not be listening to the entire album over and over and over like I did with Astronaut.  I have to say, I'm a little disappointed.  But overall, for any DD fans, this album is one you should have.

B00005JLWN|2.0|This is a B-Movie plot that doesnt know its a B-Movie plot. It tries too hard to be relevant and serious, when its all a bit silly. You cant help but be knocked over the head by the intellectual points the film tries to make. So in the end all the plot and seriousness does is take you out of the film and make the whole thing seem a bit silly.   The visuals are great, and action is great. If a bit too derivative of the Matrix.   Really what is action though if you cant get into the movie? Its all a bit empty.   And at final blush this movie doesnt capture you, so its all a bit of a wasted effort.
0316067598|4.0|This true story is extremely compelling. It's a U.S. Navy SEAL combat story of a failed military operation in Afghanistan during 2005 - one of high courage and extraordinary endurance under the most difficult circumstances imaginable.    It is fairly well written in both content and style, but numerous \\"facts\\" are suspect, giving the impression that the author's purpose is to persuade rather than report. I assume content is from Luttrell and style is from Robinson, a professional author.    At least a half-dozen places in the story were so touching and emotional that I almost had tears welling up in my eyes.    Exceptionally rigorous training of America's warriors for extraordinary combat assignments is clearly revealed and demonstrated.    Personal toughness is extolled in the extreme - both mental and physical -to the exclusion of other important but softer attributes, such as broad vision, diverse cultural understanding, and compassion.     The fact that Luttrell is from Texas, as if that is supposed to bestow some special ability or competence is annoyingly belabored. (I suppose I may be overly sensitized to this type of bombast, bravado and bulls__t, coming from Texas myself, as well as being a U.S. Navy veteran of the Korean War.)    Numerous potshots at the \\"liberal media\\" cross over the line: they are unsubstantiated, out of place, and distracting.    The authors have clearly bought into the \\"greatness\\" of President Bush, despite him taking the Nation to war in Iraq under false pretenses and his general fiscal irresponsibility.        Attacks on the propriety of the U.S. military Rules of Engagement (as well as the Geneva Conventions) are alarming. The author seems to want to be allowed to commit deliberate murder of non-combatant civilians.  Amazingly, he even tried to excuse torture at Abu Ghraib. This is a feral slip into the mentality and morality of the animal kingdom.    The U.S. Navy SEALS admirable tradition (code) of not leaving one behind is profoundly reported in this book at great cost in additional lives; the Afghan Pashtun's admirable tradition (code) of harboring a stranger despite the great potential cost of death to the tribe is also profoundly reported. It's disappointing, even inexplicable, to read that someone who had enjoyed the benefit of both high traditions doesn't recognize the propriety of a parallel restraint on human barbarism - the official U.S. military Rules of Engagement (code), which is imposed on American warriors to prevent reprehensible misconduct and National dishonor.    The root of all three traditions (codes) seems to be honorable and dignified conduct in the face of great adversity and potentially at great cost. Nothing less than honorable and dignified conduct should be expected of warriors of the United States of America.    Grasp of the bigger picture, of what's truly important in one's own life, as well as that of the larger community, Nation, and the rest of the World seems somewhat limited and fairly shallow on the author's part. Surly he doesn't represent most of America's warriors in this respect.    He should be made mindful that America's warriors, currently being all volunteers, have the option of NOT serving, especially in an elite branch, if he feels the cost of NOT dishonoring the Country is too great.    Finally, a great Nation truly needs its warriors in untold combat situations. And, if I were going into battle against a formidable enemy I don't know of anyone I'd rather have on my side than a U.S. Navy SEAL, such as Marcus Luttrell. His great strengths in taking war to an enemy outweigh his shortcomings in civilized and humane concepts.
0345350472|5.0|I bought this book because I am planning on buying the completely massive and awesome collection of Blade Runner movies. I saw this at the bookstore for $5 (This exact edition) and so I bought it and read it in two days, finishing it yesterday.    As an introduction to the world of the movie (Which I haven't seen yet) it is simply awesome and astounding. The world of the book is so expertly crafted with what really amoutns to a small amount of description and detail. The characters and story are well thought out, and it fits the form that I have come to expect from Philip K. Dick even though I've only read this and The Man in the High Castle-no real ending, just an odd one.    The book is really just truly brilliant, and even after only one read-through I can honestly say that it is one of my favorite books ever. Also, it is much easier to read than some of his other books. I struggled through The Man in the High Castle for awhile until I got used to it and then I kind of got it and understood it and kept going, but this was one that I could just pick up and read an it's just awesome.    I highly recommend it to anyone interested in science fiction at all, as it is a true classic as well as one of the few Philip K. Dick books still available fairly widely.
0143038419|2.0|with the intriguing title and description of this book, i felt the actual prose fell short of delivery.  annoying rhetoric kept me skipping through the book hoping to get to the better part.
B000Z8KAUM|3.0|It was wonderful renting and watching the movie without leaving the house (especially for a price of $1.99), but the Tivo rental download does not include any of the extras.  This is the first time we used Amazon Unboxed, so I don't know if this is standard, but we were disapointed.  We especially like the subtitles, so we don't miss anything and they were not availabe.  None of the extras were.  So I will end up purchaseing the DVD after all to get the full product.
0553804677|5.0|This is Scott's first book, but he does such a good job; head and shoulders above other first books that I've read.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is set in a dark, urban fantasy world. It is a tale of thievery, double-crossing, and magic. It reminded me of a dark Dickensian London with imagery alluding to Gotham City. The story was very engrossing. It was a page-turner the likes of which I hadn't read since a Song of Ice and Fire. The other notable bright spot of the novel is the dialog; it is very witty yet believable. There were many times when I found myself laughing or cheering or otherwise physically reacting to something a character said. There are many twists and unexpected surprises, but done with a purpose, not just in an attempt to throw off the readers, which ends up making the story nonsensical like so many other \\"twisty\\" stories end up doing. I was very impressed.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great story about thieves, burglars, and confidence men, this is definitely right up your alley. If one were going to run a thieves campaign in D&D, this is how you would want to do it!

B000XA5K48|1.0|Like the other reviewers on here. This movie is just fun in your face violence.There is definetly not storyline.I did I was watching Clive Owen character from sin city with out the red chucks. It was like a pre-quel to Sin City. But without the writing of Frank Miller.This will bost Clive Owen into the next action star.When your too tired or having a good drinking party this is the movie. Makes you want watch the fight scenes again knowing it's just as fake as the Matrix.
0753820250|4.0|This book started so well I thought I had found a masterpiece, however, it got rather boring in the middle and finished quite well.<br />It was a good story and the characters were very well-drawn. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone with a good imagination
B000VSBX34|5.0|I saw the movie \\"Help\\" when it first came out in the sixties and liked it then, so I had to get the DVD. It was so much more than I remember! And the music is fantastic! The quality of the DVD brings out the best of the whole movie. I would highly recommend it.
B000NDDHG8|4.0|This is the original 1974 High Voltage release. Only released in Australia, you may notice its tracks resemble that of 74 Jail break released years later in 198something after Bon Scotts death.    AC/DC released this and an album called T.N.T in Oz, and when releasing there first international release, they combined the best of the two albums... pretty much two tracks from this, and the rest where from TNT.    However, this is still the only album you can hear \\"love song\\" and \\"stick around\\" or is that \\"you ain't got a hold on me?\\" ..whichever...    now, completely ignore amazons sellers asking 170 bucks for this? BUWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA the album is still in print in Australia and it will cost you under 30 bucks to import it from here... god, what a rip off.
B000WCDI64|5.0|This live performance is proof of what an original and gifted artist Amy Winehouse truly is.  It's amazing to think what an impact she's made at such a young age.  The documentary is a wonderful bonus.  The scene of her singing \\"(There Is) No Greater Love\\" for the record company in 2002 is unforgettable.  This is a must have for any Amy Winehouse fan.  You'll love her even more after seeing it.
B000G73UEU|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this.  The singer, Antony, singing, \\"If It Be Your Will,\\" stopped me in my tracks.  I haven't gotten his voice and this song out of my head for three weeks.  This is a beautiful collection of Cohen's songs, done beautifully.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This album shows that MEGADETH could make a album that musically is as good if not better than Metallica's Black album, or any other metal album that came out at that time.<br />This is DAVE's best of technical metal and didn't sellout to make it.<br />Even though this is a very good album I still say \\"Rust in Peace\\" is the best MEGADETH album!!<br />I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!

Well, he is: so was Tom Paine. The important thing is, he not only hits the nail on the head, but does so over and over again.<br /><br />Until every citizen is covered with health insurance of the same caliber as that accorded to our legislators, wwe cannot hold our heads up as a democracy.
B000002J1L|5.0|This is an overlooked gem, but if you love Genesis or Peter Gabriel, search Youtube for \\"The Musical Box\\" Genesis live in Belgium.  You are in for an amazing treat.  I've owned this on 8-Track, Vinyl, Cassette, and Digital versions; it's one I find hard to live without.
B00005KB9R|5.0|This is one of, if not my favorite Wailers/Marley CD.  Right from the get-go, 'Get up, Stand up' sets the mood for the album.  Followed by 'Hallelujah Time' then 'I Shot the Sheriff'  and then just amazing.  I have a hard time picking a favorite track, 'Small Axe' and 'Pass it on' are just amazing, as is Tosh's 'One Foundation'.  My least favorite song on the album is Bob's most famous song, 'I Shot the Sheriff', which I feel lacks the same  qualities that the rest of the tracks contain.  Though it is still a good song, it doesn't come close to any of the other tracks on the album.       If you're new to the Wailers, this album is a great starting point, if you're familiar with their music, then this album will do nothing but bolster your appreciation for this phenomenal group of artists.
B000WQW988|5.0|I've been hoping for this DVD since I first learned that the Audio CD was going to be released.  This show is unique - nothing else in the Unplugged series could match it and was a huge departure from other Nirvana live performances. Nirvana never conformed to anyone else's standards, and their MTV Unplugged performance is another example.  In the \\"Bare Witness\\" segment, MTV producers admit to being worried about how it would turn out because Nirvana didn't follow the show's formula for success.  They didn't play their best-known hits, they played a lot of cover tunes, they didn't invite a high-profile celebrity artist to be their guest performer and they didn't even do retakes - they just let it stand.  But those very things are what makes this performance so special, so real and so timeless.

B000E1MTZE|4.0|What can be said about the Matrix trilogy that hasn't been repeated ad nausea um so far? Since you have already heard the love/hate argument of the trilogy, i will comment on the quality of the product.  The high def rip of these films is excellent. You do notice an improvement on the detail and although it's not a vast difference, due to the quality of the standard def transfers, it is an improved experience.  The color palate is where you notice the high def difference. It seemed on the matrix ultimate collection the green overtones were a bit more distracting and washed out the other colors. Here in the high def realm, the  green tint is more of a subtle overtone and the other palates are sharp and enhance the story instead of distract from whats going on.    The pip and interactive menus are such a sweet treat. I love being able to switch between audio tracks and scenes without having to default back to the main menu. The list of extras are almost the same, but the big additional extra is the audio commentary from the psychologists that loved the series and the movie reviewers that hated it, quite a different experience watching it with those opinions piping in, I learned to appreciate the series a bit more after listening to the opposing views.    All in all this collection is a must have for any HD DVD owner and film fan
1932100660|5.0|This book will change your life.<br /><br />It is highly scientific, yet amazingly readable and enjoyable.  First, Dr. Campbell depicts his journey from a meat and milk eater who disdained vegetarians to a vegan who, at 70, still runs miles in a day.  He  outlines his studies, first on rats and then on humans, which led him to this change.  Even a non-scientist (like me!) will find this riveting and convincing.  I appreciated the thorough nature of his research.<br /><br />Second, Dr. Campbell sets forth the optimum diet for health and longevity.  It amazed me how easy it is to understand and follow - he lists vegetable, grain, legumes, meat and processed foods, and puts them into catagories of eat the amount you want, minimize and avoid.  It is far easier than counting carbs, calories, fat grams, or any of the myriad diets I formerly pursued.  Even if (like me) you don't follow his plan perfectly, following it 80-90 percent of the time will make a huge difference in your health.<br /><br />He then details \\"the dark side of science\\" - how the government, pharmaceutical companies, meat and dairy companies and others are practicing deception in order to fatten their wallets at the expense of our health.  This section of the book is chilling.<br /><br />For me, the gradual move from dairy two or three times per day and meat two times per day and tons of \\"bad carbs\\" and processed foods to lots of soy, graines, legumes and veggies (with a little of the rest thrown in occasionally and a \\"cheat day\\" on Sundays and holidays, when I allow myself to eat bad carbs) has been great.  I went from a size eighteen (tight) to a size six (and in some things a four).  Combined with exercise, this was amazingly pleasant and easy - and in the past, dieting for me has always been a grueling struggle.  I now run, do the stairmaster and lift weights, while before I got breathless on one flight of stairs.  I am at a weight I haven't seen since my twenties.<br /><br />So try it out, and see for yourself.  And for some humorous inspiration, check out the paragraph in the diabetes chapter that advises readers to think of their bodies as an airport parking lot.  Ouch.  Reminds me of the line from the movie Thelma and Louise, \\"You can park a truck in the shade of Darrel's butt.\\"inspiration, check out the paragraph in the diabetes chapter that advises readers to think of their bodies as an airport parking lot.

B000YPUF9W|3.0|Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice in this latest installment of the RESIDENT EVIL franchise. The disaster of the Raccoon City experiment by the Umbrella Corporation has caused a worldwide outbreak of the deadly T-Virus. Those who haven't been infected find themselves constantly on the go moving from one location to another. Alice moves and works alone. That is until she rescues a caravan of survivors under attack from a swarm of mutated crows in the deserts of Nevada not far from Las Vegas. The group includes former friends of Alice's, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps) and the leader of the group Claire Redfield (Ali Carter). Alice has evidence of a possible safe haven in Alaska and convinces the group to go there. But first they have to get gas in Las Vegas and the things in Vegas don't necessarily just stay in Vegas anymore.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed by RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION. I was looking forward to an epic battle between the survivors and the zombies or at least between those at the Umbrella Corporation. Actually, I would have settled for just a bunch of cool action sequences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of that going on. There are a few minor skirmishes here and there. There's also a lot of build-up to what's supposed to be a huge battle, but it never happens.<br /><br />I had assumed that RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION was going to be the final film in this video-game based trilogy, but the movie is so heavy on character development and ends with such a strange twist that at least one other film must be planned. The film does have a decent amount of blood and gore for those who like those things, but it isn't as excessive as it is in the video games or previous movies (there's violence, but not just as much).<br /><br />Those who have seen the previous RESIDENT EVIL films will probably at least want to watch RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION. Also, even though she doesn't have too much screen time, the movie is worth watching for Ali Carter. Of course, there's also Milla Jovovich, too.ng for Ali Carter. Of course, there's also Milla Jovovich, too.

B000VR824S|5.0|Well first of all, this is a fantastic show, and it's in Chicago. The line up is stellar and everyone is having a great time. Yes there could have been others there as we all know- Larry Carlton, Robben Ford, Steve Vai and maybe even Les Paul--and with Blues folk Otis Rush -who has been sick and of course Bo Diddley (who had a tune dedicated to him by Robbie Robertson and had suffered a stroke earlier this year) Chuck Berry (he lives close!) Jody Williams maybe a lot of others...<br /><br />But you can't please everyone and I thought the show was a nice mix. Very entertaining and the various combinations which played together (the real highlight of this DVD) seem to work well. I am a Blues enthusiast and the Blues in this show is fantastic. Hubert Sumilin plays great as does Robert Cray-who usually has no effects, but pulls off a little delay in \\"Poor Johnny\\". And Johnny Winter, who is also ill, brings back the fire in \\"Highway 61\\" as noted his slide playing is still phenomenal, and he gets applause from Derek Trucks!<br /><br />B.B. King is very charming as usual at 82 and does well with Jimmie Vaughan, Hubert and Robert Cray. Well presented and touching with Eric in the wings. In Disc 2 we have John Mayer and the charismatic Los Lobos who start it off. Then the masterful Jeff Beck always amazing as he was when I first saw him with Rod Stewart on vocals at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1968. His quartet with Tal Wilkenfeld on bass, originally an Aussie from Sydney (Bondi) now based in the US-she is a stunner she may be the next Jaco Pastorius or Charlie Mingus and sexy too! I agree with other reviewers this band should tour now! Maybe Tal can sing?<br /><br />Eric's set is great of course. I saw it in Australia this year (twice). Great selection of not the usual E.C. classics--well Doyle Bramhall II does \\"Outside Women Blues\\" on Disc 1. He does things from early in his solo career and of course a tribute to George Harrison. The highlight is his sub-set of Blind Faith tunes with Stevie Winwood. I haven't heard \\"Presence of the Lord\\"  since I was 19 years old!!! Just superb. \\"Had to Cry Today\\" with Winwood and Clapton playing double lead is also excellent. This was worth the whole price of the DVD.<br /><br />Yes, everyone has the items and artists they would wish for. This set does include Jeff Beck thankfully, but the whole show is well presented.<br />I am a Blues person but can appreciate Albert Lee and Vince Gill, too. This DVD will satisfy most musical tastes. The end with Buddy Guy, after ZZ Top in Texas, was also appropriate and proper even if Buddy did not have his incredible Sax player with him on the night. Buddy is a Chicago Blues icon and you could not have had a guitar show in Chicago without him. The final jam of the day \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" with Buddy, John Mayer, Johnny Winter, Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan, Hubert Sumlin and Eric was a perfect end to the show.<br /><br />This DVD is a must for guitar fans of all genres. The extras include snippets of performances of Tab Benoit, with his 72 Telecaster Thinline, playing with Skunk Baxter, Harvey Mandel (a native of Chicago of Canned Heat fame) with his strange custom axe and a very attractive young woman \\"Orianthi\\" getting an interesting Blues sound out of a PRS.<br /><br />It is commendable that this show is different and varied and is a great companion volume to the first Crossroads DVD. And this Chicago edition has the comic wit of Bill Murray--I loved his intro of Eric Clapton while he was dressed up like the Clapton of '68 with perm and painted Gibson SG- wow! Lastly, it was very interesting and touching to 58 year olds like me, who have played guitar all of our lives, when Bill came out at the start of the show and played \\"Gloria\\" (\\"the only song I can play\\") I am sure many many folks out there had a tear in their eye with that memory!wood.

140120306X|1.0|Alan Moore has managed to jump the shark with this book.  I have never read such a self-indulgent piece of crap in my life and never thought I would read something by Alan Moore that was this bad.       Here's the major problem: it's fine to include characters that the reader has never heard of as long as not knowing who the character is hampers the story.  I have reread this book twice and I STILL have no idea who the bad guys were or why the good characters were looking for the Black Dossier.       I know what you are thinking: the first two trades were so great this one has to be at least marginally good, right?  WRONG!  Save your money and find something else and believe me when I say I wish Amazon would let us give negative stars as well.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove appeared on a channel last Saturday and Sunday that I rarely view.  I had never seen this movie before--and was immediately transfixed by the epic Western landscape, the authentic costumes of the time, the vivid color, all reminding me of the paintings of that great artist of the Old West Frederick Remington. I wonder if its director and photographer had Remngton in mind when they shot both the scenes and the cowboys (and Indians). I was relieved to see that a \\"half-breed\\" Blue Duck (?) were not drawn in politically correct colors, to keep from offending Native Americans. There were bad Indians, as there were bad white hombres. Witness that sergeant of cavalry who tried to commandeer a kid's horse--and gor his comeuppance fo his pains. Duval and his buddy were peerless! I am surpised that none of the other knowledgeble reviewers didn't mention Remington--a great American painter and depicter of the Old West. There are several available website links to the artist along with repros of many of his paintings with subjects ranging from cattle drives to attacks on wagon trains. Also reminescent of Texas cattle drives as recorded in the works of Frank Dobie.
0385483821|3.0|I had wanted to read this book for some time because I was intrigued by the title.  This book does provided some good insight into how to anticipate and manage the natural boom-bust cycles that affect all businesses.  However, the stories about the emergence of GUI based computing and the Internet, as examples of strategic inflection points for Intel, were not particularly enlightening for me.  I suppose the material is too familiar given my background in the tech industry and as an investor in Intel.      I was more interested in Grove's exploration of the internal organizational dynamics that can accompany strategic change and chaos.  His insights into the challenges of keeping focused, leading by strategic actions (vs. plans) and balancing the competing dangers of too much focus vs. too much hedging thru periods of crisis were particularly relevant.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is not your normal action-packed Pixar movie. It's rather the opposite of The Incredibles, for example. It's a sweet coming-of-age story about a rat who finds his unique place in the world. Don't expect action, and you will not be disappointed.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This movie is great!  Demo worthy picture for Blu-Ray.  A must have for all collections.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I happened to catch this masterpiece again and was struck by how well it holds up. Although it has majestic sweep, and it is everything that an epic should be, it is in the small details that it proves faultless. One example stands out. Duvall is looking out over the plains at a herd of buffalo. He goes to chasing the herd and then comes racing back followed by a band of Indians. Just in this sequence, we go from the big dreams of the frontier to the tragic injuries that will take his life. The movie is filled with moments like this; actually, there are dozens of them given the length of the piece. So tied to this role is Duvall in my mind that I have trouble now enjoying him in anything else. He has those mannerisms - his way of sucking in air to control his emotions - that I associate with his part in this series and not with him as an actor. I can't think of a dramatic epic as well made. It was in fact both the best and the last of these mini-series. After \\"Lonesome Dove\\" the only great television has been the Ken Burns docudramas such as his recent \\"War.\\"

0425200450|4.0|\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a clean, fast, invigorating reading experience, just as enjoyable as its most famous adaptation: the 1974 film by Sidney Lumet starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot.  Interestingly, the elegance of the \\"Orient Express\\" experience was a thematic addition to the film.  Here, the now famous traveling experience is described as little more than a long train ride laced with the usual inconveniences of an extended trip.  Either the Orient Express wasn't in reality all that sumptuous or such richness was taken for granted when Christie wrote her book.<br /><br />The details and resolution more or less play out as they do in the movie, though the book has a few extra layers of detail and a few small differences in the murder's solution, though there's nothing hugely different in either case.  The book, in fact, makes one appreciate the movie even more, in that was it able to faithfully tell the book's story with only a minimum of simplification and consolidation.<br /><br />As the years go by, however, the book has gained one added literary benefit beyond the pleasures of its mystery story: with its dozen or so characters who represent many nationalities and political positions, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" presents to the modern reader a sharp snapshot of the world stage just prior to the outbreak of World War II.  Sometimes the best time capsules are those that never aspired to be such, and that's certainly the case here.  So, while modern readers will certainly enjoy the mystery story on hand, I think many will also be fascinated with the journey back to a period when the clouds of war were still somewhat in the distance, but- as personified by the uneasy comments and offhand worries of one character about another- were nevertheless slowly creeping closer.

0385512058|3.0|Why do rich and priviledged people who have never had to work hard for anything feel a need to justify their priviledge by focusing on a past that most of us have to go through anyway? That is a major flaw with this book - the author is an egomaniac and instead of coming off as vulnerable and authentic, his life narrative is just a rationalization of who he is. Certainly, establishing relationships is fun, if you like people and have the time and resources to work on them. But if you are looking for substance, value and meaning (things you can only establish by knowing yourself first), this book may not be for you.    Like a lot of Ivy League graduates, the author is all style and little substance. (These \\"higher learning\\" institutions, after all, don't really add value or help students learn; they just don't mess them up). Still, this book is not a total waste of time and at times it is sentimental and endearing, just don't make it a priority. Save it for when you are stuck in an airport.

I bought this book in my 8th monthe and read in in 2 days.  I listed to the cd every night.  I ended up having a c-section and the whole time I was in a beautiful, happy place!  I had hypotised myself into that place and therefore have a beautiful story of my birthing experience.  GREAT BUY!!!
B000VLE3IS|2.0|I really got into Led Zeppelin last year when I bought their \\"Untitled Four Album\\" which is sometimes called Led Zeppelin IV or Zoso. When I saw \\"Mothership\\" in the store I was pretty excited, since I enjoyed LZIV/Zoso so much I figured why not.  There are 24 songs (4 of which were on the album I already had) and a DVD with all sorts of live performances.<br /><br />The reason for my review only being 2 stars has nothing to do with the music of Led Zeppelin or the DVD.  It has to do with the packaging.  This is some of the worst schlock packaging I have ever seen.  All three disks (2 CD and 1 DVD) come in these cardboard paper sleeves that are so bound so tightly together it would take an act of God to get them out.  Therefore the disks have to be handled rather roughly to get the disks out.  So while you are getting your disk out, they get scuffed/scratched by the paper cardboard or get fingerprint marks all over them.  WTF?<br /><br />I returned my set TWICE, yes TWICE and both times the disks were still scratched (all three of them) from this shoddy cardboard casing.  That means six disks destroyed in all.  I finally gave up on this set and attained the version without the DVD.  The case used for that set is the good old plastic standard jewel case that protects CDs well.<br /><br />I really hate when record companies try to get all fancy with packaging and miss the boat.  Also what if the packaging is damaged?  Since this is cardboard you can't fit it into a normal jewel case if this issue happens.<br /><br />Overall the music on the CDs are great, I personally like CD 1 better than 2.  The DVD from what little of it I watched was good too.  It is really sad that production value can't be better for this sort of thing.  It is even funnier that the 2 CD no DVD is cheaper and more durable than the 2 CD and DVD combo.<br /><br />Perfect example of when a great idea for a product is poorly executed.
0525950079|5.0|One of the best reads I have had for some time. So good that I did not want to finish it. The problem with such exquisite novels is that when you come to the end, you find it difficult to read another book that offers you the same reading pleasure.     Highly recommended.
B00005JPRZ|5.0|For a long time, I thought about writing a review for Death at a funeral. It is one of the best films I've seen this year. It is infact the funniest film I've seen in the last 2-3 years. The story is based on the happenings at a funeral, there are several characters and they all are English. There is something about the English which seems more tolerable, maybe it's their accent or that particular side of their personalities to choose to be a bit lowkey about. Whatever it is, it works alarmingly well. I think I had tears in my eyes laughing. I've made all my good friends see this and they all loved it. My sister just finished watching it and she thought it was the best film ever. I thought it was an instant cult classic (Whether that's true or not, who cares)<br /><br />Strengths of the film - No boring characters, it's only 1hour 26 mins and ridiculously funny, character growth, druggy behaviour, old people, irritation and more irritation. Jerry Seinfeld recently said on Conan O Brien that \\"irritation\\" is the single funniest thing in humor. He was right. Death at a Funeral will not irritate you but seeing how irritated the characters are becoming, you will fall of your chair or couch or  seat. Some people said this film was predictable. I think the same people should go and watch Scary Movies.
B00004TJKI|1.0|The original aspect ratio of this film is 1:85:1 (see IMDB).    The US DVD box from Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment contradicts this, saying:  \\"This film is presented in a FULL SCREEN VERSION which preserves the original theatrical aspect ratio, approximately 1:33:1.\\"    In civil society, this may be called false advertising.  The box does not contain what the box says it contains.    The DVD itself warns as it begins playing that the film \\"has been modified to fit your TV\\".  In other words, it was re-edited in the 80s or 90s by another (anonymous) director/editor using the notorious 'pan and scan' technique, which cuts off the right and left edges of widescreen films, and adds new camera movements and re-scales some images to make certain that the action remains on screen in the new, square-ish ratio.    Amazon's Internet Movie Database correctly identifies the aspect ratio.  Columbia distributes THAT version in Europe (which is why when you search for this film on Amazon, the European release comes up too).  If you buy that version in the US, you'll pay a little more, and you'll have to use a region-free dvd player to view it.  Here's the link for that version:    [[ASIN:B00005LO7M Anatomy of a Murder European DVD]]    Your second option is to buy this movie from Amazon Unbox, which presents it in its correct aspect ratio:    [[ASIN:B000MDHJFE Anatomy Of A Murder from Amazon Unbox]]    Your third option is to wait on buying this until they release the original.
0307275639|4.0|Again,another great book.  If this is a true story I would love to meet someone like him. I wouldn't want to lose a friend like that. How hard that would be to hear a mans life and grow to be friends like that and then watch him go like that. It would be a blessing to know that you would have a friend to stay with you through it all and God bless you for that.     Thanks for sharing that with us, what a wonderful story.  I can't wait to hear some more.  Sherrie
B00005JO20|4.0|Great special effects but most big movies do these days. Nothing special about the story and there's really nothing to recommend it over the original but it is a good evening's entertainment.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|There are many wonderfully helpful reviews already posted here, but I couldn't help praising this mesmerizing CD.  My brother gave it to me for a birthday present, and I hadn't even touched it (sometimes it's hard to latch on to something new). Then one bus trip \\"In A Graveyard\\" started playing on shuffle, and I had tears in my eyes in seconds. More than anything else, Rufus's voice will get under your skin and move you in spite of yourself. Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk was also an instant love affair. The other songs took more time, but that is what I want to stress most of all: this CD will get better with each listen. The songs are like those private people who you can never figure out...but when you do, they're the most worth while friends you've ever had.  My favorites are \\"In a Graveyard,\\" \\"Poses,\\" \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,\\" and \\"California.\\" I don't have much experience with Rufus, but no one so unfamiliar has ever entranced me so well he can.  P.S. For a music tastes match, some of my other favorite artists include Ben Folds, Simon & Garfunkel, The Decemberists, Death Cab, Coldplay, etc.  If you like them or any other Rufus Wainwright, please purchase this CD!
B000001DTM|5.0|Produced at the peak of U2's intellectual, musical, emotional and technical maturity and creativity.  A dark, intense, sensual masterpiece.
0751529818|4.0|[[ASIN:1432716514 Lost Pallies: The Afterlife has found it's voice and now it won't stop talking!]]<br />What I loved most about this book is the quality and quantity of knowledge shared by an old dying man, and its effects on the younger one. You cannot put this put down until you are finished and at the back cover.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|I had my original copy, on CD, the VERY day this was released in the fall of 1987.  Some recordings bring back vivid memories of a specific time and this record is a case in point.  The good news is that is has aged VERY well and the band have done a tremendous job with this re release.  I always knew a day would come when all of the Bsides would come together.  I can only hope they give the same treatement to ALL of the back catalog.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This was the best series on TV and watching the trailer for season 4 that was rejected breaks my heart.  What a cool show it would've been having Veronica as an FBI agent.  While its hard to top the 1st season's perfection, season 3 was great.  Veronica will live on in my repeated viewings of my 3 season dvd collection!
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Although I felt the music was anything but Trekkish, the series followed in the vain that Roddenberry started with the first Trek series. One of the better ones it turned out. I think of all the series the original, DS-9, and Enterprise are probably the best when it comes to replayability. I never seem to tire of rewatching them. The timeline is before the original but obviously we have come along way in special effects so this will seem far less cheesy than the original in the props department. I recommend this series for the whole family. A number of issues are covered that it would do a family good to discuss, just like the original series. The DVD quality is good, the boxes are cheap, and the Paramount price is outragious as usual. When they hit around fifty a season I will buy them, afterall about every other TV series on the planet is in that range. Just because Trekkies are spending all the money they made buiding Cray super computers or working at some retail chain doesn't give Paramount a right to be so greedy. BTW, this Trekkie isn't buying at this price so there!<br /><br />Addendum: Well about time they knocked the price down to reasonable. I ordered this for under one-hundred ninety elsewhere so shop around. if you don't get it here check deepdiscount.com.
0143038419|5.0|I started reading an excerpt of this book on Oprah.com and I immediately decided to buy it - I couldn't wait for it to arrive! I NEVER do this. I liked the book so much that I recommended it to both of my parents... and despite some initial \\"we don't want to read self-help books\\" reactions (it is NOT a self help book, but may seem that way if you just read the synopsis), they both read it.  All I had to say was: read the first five pages. if you don't like it, don't read it.  Needless to say, I couldn't finish it until they finished it! My mother has bought her own copy now, and I recommend it to everyone. The book has something for everyone. I will read it again and again!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|My cello teacher recommended this recording.  She plays first cello in the chamber orchestra, and, sometimes, in the symphony orchestra, and she has played everything.  But when she just needs \\"sublime,\\" this is what she listens to.  Great melodies, in the soulful voice of the cello.  I love it.
B0007P0XNC|1.0|DO NOT waste money on this item. This is a transfer made directly from a videotape. The quality is very poor. The image is soft and its colors bleed. Contrary to the item's description for the DVD as having subtitles, the DVD has an English voice over dubbed on top of the Italian soundtrack which makes it extremely annoying to listen to. The DVD is not subtitled.
B000VAPZM2|1.0|I have watched both, the first and second movie.   In my opinion they are a disgrace to the title, \\"musical.\\"     I don't understand how anyone could watch them more than once, let alone buy them.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I've bought 3 of these for my 2 daughters and myself and we all love it.  It will not replace your heavy duty vacuum but you wil be glad to have it handy to use for quick daily cleanups. It's surprisingly effective,it does get into the corners and edges like the big machine can't.
0783232039|3.0|Let's all thank Don Mancini. Seven years after the near bore and near death of the Child's Play franchise, Mancini breathed new life into his child. Taken in a completely different way than the previous sequels, Bride of Chucky finally makes Chucky the star. The storyline is now all his, but not just him. Jennifer Tilly gives the series an extra boost as Chucky's ex-lover who revives him in doll-form only to have Chucky put her in her own doll body.     What ensues is spousal hilarity, and a lot more blood than the series has seen. There's also Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile as our main protaginists, but do we really care about them? Actually, I never did. Like I said, this is all Chucky's movie. John Ritter's cameo was actually the next best thing to the villians in the film.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Simply amazing video footage that I find myself watching over and over again. This is the most comprehensive documentary that I've ever seen and definitely the most compelling. Every episode will reward you with breath taking scenery from exotic locations featuring animals from around the globe.    The video crew is no doubt the best in the world. They have rewritten the book on how to make the best shot.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This is worth buying just for Echoes and the On An Island tracks get better every time that I play them. I agree that it would have been nice if he had played some of the songs from his first two solo albums, but all in all this is a must have for all fans of good rock music.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|The album comprising of two remastered CD's and a DVD containing some of the best songs produced by this legendary band is a must have for all Led Zepplin lovers. The CD quality is excellent The DVD contains some rare live footage that was very exhilarating. A very good buy.[[ASIN:B000VLE3IS Mothership 2CD/1DVD]]
B000JJSRNY|5.0|These three superstars of opera are spectacular - this is one of Placido Domingo's last big public appearances as he moves more into conducting, and leaves the singing to the younger folks.  But he is still in fine form, and holds up his end beautifully in duets with Anna and Rolando alike.  Buy it - you'll have no regrets!
B0006J28BO|5.0|This was a great movie, I just wish there was another one, I didn't want it to end!
B00005LK95|4.0|I haven't seen this movie yet, but how could it not be as good as the first movie? I love Johnny Five!! (Number Five)
B000MRAAJM|5.0|We watched the Planet Earth series on Discovery HD and had to have a copy of the the DVD series on Blu-ray disc.  The difference is that David Attenborough is the narrator vs. Sigourney Weaver.  The scenery of the various aspects of Planet Earth including the oceans, mountains and deserts are spectacular.  Animal life in these venues are equally amazing and informative.  There is no other documentary like this and well worth the money, especially when viewed on a 1080 HD set and on a Blu-ray disc player.  Turn out the lights, sit back and enjoy a terrific series.  Highly recommended.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This was the first Miyazaki film I had ever seen, and it got me hooked!! This is still my absolute favorite of his movies...But I have yet to see one of his films that I didn't like. Spirited Away is a great movie!!
0375842209|5.0|I bought The Book Thief a few months ago because I'd heard a lot about it and had actually visited this page a few times to see whether it was really any good. I was excited to read it -- the idea of Death narrating a book fascinated me, and from an excerpt I'd read, I loved the author's style -- but not excited enough, it would seem.<br /><br />I finished it in four days, and my reading span was a sort of cross between fevered obsessive can't-put-it-down and chewing-it-over-slowly-and-thoughtfully. And my only thought is: Wow.<br /><br />This is a once-in-a-year book. No, that's not right -- it's a once-in-a-lifetime book. It's a truly fantastic, beautiful, complex story, narrated by an omniscient character who finds himself unable to stay as detached from human life as he'd like -- even though his job is to end it. It's about a girl named Liesel who loves books with a passion and steals them from burnings and her neighbor's library. It's about Liesel's friend Rudy, the daredevil boy who's in love with her. It's about Nazi Germany in World war II. It's about the power of words, the bonds between people, and the utter impossibility of human love and hate -- from Adolf Hitler to Liesel Meminger to Rosa Hubermann, the tough-shelled, kind-hearted, frequently-swearing adoptive mother of Liesel.<br /><br />Aside from the beautiful story and perfect, flawed, sometimes kind, sometimes cruel, never predictable and always sympathetic characters, there's the writing. Oh, the writing.<br /><br />Well, I never knew Death was such an eloquent writer, is all I can say. From his deceptively simple but truly very profound remarks scattered through the book, to his last haunting and thought-provoking words: \\"I am haunted by humans\\", Markus Zusak never once made me feel that the narrator was a manipulation. His casual mentions of being very busy that year because of all the bombs dropped, souls to be carried, were sobering and powerfully dark and deep. The imagery used -- a deep chocolate sky, handing souls to the conveyor belt of eternity -- was impossibly dark and moving for humble description. And finally, the one thing I was sure would ruin the book -- the spoiler Death himself gives about midway through the story -- ended up fitting it perfectly. Rather than ruining the ending, our pre-knowledge of it made it come as no shock, no reverse-deux-ex-machina, but rather a sad but inevitable loss.<br /><br />This book is perfect, and one of my new all-time favorites -- if not my #1 favorite. It's amazing. Buy it, read it, love it as it deserves. It's wonderful.<br /><br />Rating: Masterpiececonveyor belt of eternity -- was impossibly dark and moving for humble description.

B00005N5S5|4.0|I love the terminator movies, and even though this one is kinda bad with the specail effects, its awsome. I mean, you can't really blame the special effects for not being great, it is an older movie. I am glad I bought it.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I can only compare this edition with what I have seen before  a) the original TV series  b) the VHS version which came out 2000ish    My verdict:  The best Twin Peaks ever! This is a whole new way of discovering Twin Peaks. I watched all 29 episodes almost back-to-back. This way it is much easier to follow and therefore it beats alternative a)  And the quality improved by light years. I remember the rubbish sound and picture of the VHS videos but this is re-mastered. Really re-mastered, not like the remastered Star Wars from 1995. Therefore it beats alternative b)  too. And if you buy that DVD box set, you can still see the quality difference if you watch the log lady intros.     What else does this DVD offer? Great extras! A very long making of. And best of all a piece called 'Slice of Lynch' a discussion session with Kyle M., Mädchen A., David L. and a 4th guy I forgot about.      This is the TV series which changed the way I watched TV. You have to own it!
B0006L0LNY|4.0|You could really see the special effects, like the computer images that took over for the characters when they couldn't really have done something. Other than that, it was a good movie.

1594489505|5.0|A friend recommended that I read this. I admit that I generally read \\"lighter\\" books and am guilty of re-reading books written more than a century ago rather than picking up a new novel.<br /><br />I am traveling this week and threw the book in my bag. Started it last night in the hotel, and hardly able to wait to get off work, just finished it this evening.<br /><br />I find Hosseini's writing style nimble and descriptive. If his picture had not been on the inner dustcover, I would have sworn this was written by a woman. I could identify with Mariam and Laila, and was horrified for them. It's poignant and sad.<br /><br />while reading this, I was constantly reminding myself of how lucky I am to be an American woman rather than a woman in the middle east. We take so much for granted here in the USA.
B000AP04EW|5.0|The most important skill in spying is typing--four hours of typing for every hour of meeting, more if you have to the transcripts of a meeting with a terrorist yourself.<br /><br />I say that up front so that in saying I am a former spy that loves this movie, and pull it out every couple of months for a repeat viewing (confession, I do the same the Captain Hornblower DVDs), I am not putting on airs.<br /><br />This is just a great movie in every respect.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|I do not agree with those saying season seven was so much changed.  It is just hard to see the show be over.  Never cared for Chris, sorry.  The Knitting day was the most dead silence in 7 years. Here is what I wish for this Christmas:  Lane's Life to be the spin off. She is still there and her life will bloom there.  Paris.  Wow.  Wouldn't one DVD with her moments be too fun  from the constuction braids to the ... every bit needs a best-of DVD. In my opinion Logan's independence was a thread to watch maybe he could buy lane's band in Lane's Life series.  Here's to hoping. When you miss the show just remember bopit and be glad you don't have to play.
0143036556|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I have always been interested in how and why diffrent societies throughout history have collapsed and failed.  This book gives you a brief synopsis of how diffrent societies have failed in the past and then backs it up with stories of real failed socities.      This book will make you think diffrently about environmental issues. I have not read anyting or heard anything which comes at the environmental debate from this angle (reducing impacts on the environment which we depend on for our civilization in order to be able to continue our civilization).    Highly recommend this book.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I think every person in this country should view this documentary.  Maybe it would open their eyes to the wool our illustrious leaders have pulled over our collective eyes for far too many years/decades.  It's time to wake up and make them accountable for the harm they have done....just so they could line the pockets of themselves and pharmaceutical houses, and all their cronies.  Thank you Michael Moore for having the fortitude to go where no man has gone before......and I don't mean into the far reaches of outer space with Captain Kirk.
B000AXWV40|5.0|Great record.    Has some really funny opening lines.    \\"Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time   For y'all have knocked her up.   I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe   I was not offended   For I knew I had to rise above it all   Or drown in my own sh**.\\"    George Clinton is funny.    And \\"You and your folks, Me and my folks\\" has an awesome bassline. Sharp and too the point. That's probably my favorite song on the record. Whole thing is great. Highly recommended.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I cut my teeth listening to the Beatles - literally. I was raised on it.  I then became a recording engineer because of their music and the works of Sir George Martin and Geoff Emerick and I was very reticent about the \\"remixing and remastering\\" of such hallowed compositions into a new collage of sound.  The first time I heard these pieces was at the Cirque Du Soleil show in Vegas.  I won't be long-winded or philosophical.  I will simply say this:  If you have ever been a Beatles fan, LOVE is FUN to listen to and the sound is phenomenal.  Remember all of the allegedly \\"hidden meanings\\" in the Beatles' songs?  Well, if you like puzzles, here is an aural puzzle that will delight you.  My kids, 11 and 13, did not see the show but they (and I) have had a blast listening to this \\"new\\" work and then seeking out the original pieces.  I am proud to say that they are part of the new generation of Beatles lovers.  Buy it and have a great time. Well Done, George and son!
0321344758|4.0|This book has a no nonsense approach to web usability. Krug puts into words what we take for granted when both using AND designing web pages.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Sean Penn, who has proven himself to be an accomplished and intense actor, takes the director helm just as seriously. His vision of Chris McCandless's life (via Jon Krakauer's book `Into the Wild') is simply stunning. While most pictures that go outdoors give you some breathtaking scenes, this film makes the close shots of formidable and forbidding nature a staple element throughout the movie. Having just watched the movie at a local cinema with a smaller screen, I was content, not needing a big screen TV or a visit to the I-Max. To sustain a story and an outdoor adventure for nearly two and a half hours is a feat unto itself, but the characters and reflections are satisfying enough to take the audience to its destination.     Besides Penn's perfectionism, we have a fine story told well. Starting with Chris's real life journal, we go back and forth from his well-to-do family back to his destination on the outskirts of Fairbanks, and then trace back his journey along the way until he reached his destination. Chris had all the trappings of success. An \\"A\\" student with a wealthy family to help him along the way, something was, nevertheless, missing. To fill in the gaps, his sister (Jena Malone) narrates part of the story, telling us about the family he left behind. Then, he encounters all kinds of people from the working class farmers of South Dakota, to a latent hippie couple in Arizona, to a retired military man in California. Like road stories from films like `Easy Rider' [[ASIN:B000022TSY Easy Rider]] to books like Kerouac's `On the Road,' [[ASIN:0140283293 On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)]]this is a high caliber road movie, even if the destination is off the beaten path. With all its grandeur and absorbing development, this movie reminded me of the truly excellent 'Never Cry Wolf,' [[ASIN:B000069HYH Never Cry Wolf (Full Screen Edition)]]which this film has easily trumped.     Trouble is Chris's problems don't resolve themselves with nature. Inhis journal, he expresses his thoughts well and quotes the works of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Pasternak who help him share his vision of happiness that can't be bought. Nature can be quite unforgiving, but the wisdom Chris picks up along the way make his uncompromising attempt to live life on his own terms both laudably courageous and a cautionary tale told to the rest of us.     All of the performances are as true to life as the footage. Including William Hurt who gives us another laudable performance as Chris's driven father, Walt, a successful space engineer. Emile Hirsch captures all the spirit and naivete' of Chris, and Marcia Gay Harden is perfect as the worried, doting mom. But the real master is Penn who is able to share Chris's vision. Meaningful, poetic, colorful, eventful, and magnificent in grandeur, `Into the Wild' is simply a cinematic Odyssey taken by a careful hand who wanted to make both the man and his journey unforgettable.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|...but Incubus cannot fail. I have yet to find a person who hates Incubus. Who could? They are undeniably one of the greatest \\"metal\\" bands of all time. K, that's unfair. They are a metal band, completely. But on Light Grenades it's hard to classify it that way. There are so many ideas poured onto the album that it gets lost in it's own exploration.   Where LG shines, it really shines. Dig is still one of my absolute favorite songs of all time. And i get so much crap for it. But no other band can churn out hit after hit like Incubus can. Anna-Molly, Love Hurts, and Diamonds and Coal are other true classics. But after that things get murky. Most diehard Incubus fans ate up this album like a KFC chicen bowl. Or something. I, however, did not fall for it. There are too many weak points. Both ETB songs are awful. Brandon Boyd always shines, he's one of the best lead men of all time. That's why people love Incubus. But oftentimes I have to find myself a social anebriant to be able to enjoy their material. Even the great songs on the album begin to wear thin after enough time. That's why I was thoroughly disappointed by their concert at Red Rocks, which was so much Light Grenades and not a whole lot else. At the same time, there were at least songs from Morning View and ACLOTM there.  Point is, this album is pretty darn good. Morning View and A Crow Left of the Murder are so much better. It's because Brandon Boyd and co. are seemingly now the new romantics of the rock world. Great for any Incubus fan. But if your on the edge about them, start elsewhere. Incubus was a band that took me forever to appreciate, and i now consider them to be one of the greatest bands ever.
0375847227|1.0|Pro:<br />Philip Pullman shows glimmers of brilliance as a writer. His characters are engaging, his worlds are vivid, his prose is delightful at times, and he occasionally produces lush and beautifully drawn descriptive paragraphs. His \\"science\\" is goofy but inventive, and without it his story couldn't work. He also demonstrates a good understanding of what appeals to an adolescent reader. I enjoyed the first volume, though my interest plateaued in the second volume and dropped like a stone in the third.<br /><br />Con:<br />Philip Pullman is one of a growing group of authors who market their own controversial adult ideas and themes as juvenile fiction/fantasy. While I affirm his right to have, and to express his view of the world, Mr. Pullman's method of garnering an uncritical and captive audience for his message is despicable. Pullman is a skillful and sometimes powerful writer who understands his audience well; sadly he uses that skill and knowledge to entice, seduce, and manipulate the immature reader.<br /><br />Here is a summary of how the Pullman method works:<br /><br />The Golden Compass is a compelling action adventure of a young, smart, defiant, and spirited pre-adolescent (12-year old) girl. There are dark characters, ugly episodes and wicked happenings in this volume, but spunky Lyra is up to the challenge. And, she has cool friends (noble gypsies and armored bears, among others) to help her.<br /><br />In The Subtle Knife we meet Lyra's male counterpart Will. By the end of this also dark and rather convoluted part of the story we like Will a lot, too. And we hate the bad guys, although sometimes it's hard to tell just who the bad guys are. Will finds himself possessing a knife that only he can use; a knife that allows him to open windows into other, sometimes parallel, worlds.<br /><br />Now that Mr. Pullman has set his stage (and the child has a significant investment in the story), he force-feeds the unsuspecting reader his world view in The Amber Spyglass. Yes, there is some foreshadowing of what's coming in the first volumes, but until we get to the third volume we keep hoping that these are literary red herrings thrown in just to keep us off balance. Alas, no such luck.<br /><br />In short order Mr. Pullman informs us that:<br /><br />- The God of Judaism and Christianity is a fake, a liar, a dictatorial despot, a draconian authoritarian intent on making everybody miserable. Mr. Pullman's definition of \\"god, the Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father the Almighty\\" is that he is the source of everything that's wrong with the world.<br />- The church is run by self-serving, power-hungry dupes and mercenaries who ensure God's tyranny is carried out. Everyone else of faith is a discounted as a closed-minded simpleton who wouldn't know what to do without being told.<br />- The health of this world and all of Pullman's \\"billions and billions\\" of other worlds is dependent on invisible, sentient dust, reminiscent of the Mitichlorians behind The Force of Star Wars lore. This dust is the product of man's gaining wisdom, a \\"natural\\" process that Pullman places in direct opposition to man's knowledge of God.<br />- The \\"good guys\\" in this world are the secular naturalists, the amoral, the animals, the witches, and the rebellious angels who have set out to help overthrow and destroy God, and<br />- Elite, self-actualized young men and women of character (like the reader, of course) possess the power to destroy God, and should destroy God because, after all, it's the right thing to do. With the assurance of Lyra's and Will's feelings that if we do destroy God then all will be well with the world and we will be happy.<br /><br />Harry Potter, meet Bertrand Russell and Ayn Rand. And don't forget Jean Genet, for flavor.<br /><br />Along the way Pullman gives lectures on:<br /><br />- The moral relativism of infanticide (it's bad to kill children if you are aligned with God, but its O.K. to kill childrenwhen necessary to further a \\"good\\" cause (i.e. deposing God, or whatever)),<br />- The nature of homosexuality (though angels are nonphysical spirit beings that doesn't prevent them from being, and stereotypically behaving like, homosexuals), and<br />- The pervasiveness of the supernatural (pretty much all of us have some kind of \\"spirit being/guide\\" counterpart that can help us do magical things, assuming we are just \\"special\\" enough, by virtue of birth and fate, to tap into this other self)<br />In other words, Pullman uses the first two books to build a platform from which to deliver his elitist-humanist/post-modern/New Age message.<br /><br />There are several passages in the volumes when Lyra or Will actually ask a tough question (What happens when we die? Where do we go? Why are we here?). To these questions a more mature, more worldly adult character always sagely answers: \\"it's not time for you to know that now.\\" Pullman glosses over his answers to these questions as he finishes his story. As it turns out, Mr. Pullman subscribes to the philosophy of despair: we have no purpose other than to do what we think best, and when we die we're just dead. End of story. Which is fine from Pullman's perspective because with God in power Mr. Pullman's future is likely to be, well . . . . . Hell.<br /><br />Spoiler Warning (though if you are a parent you will definitely want to know this): The long-anticipated climax of this 1,200-page book never materializes. In the end, it turns out that destroying God isn't such a big thing after all, and certainly doesn't solve all of the worlds' problems. Only when God is gone does Pullman come clean that the real reason the worlds are dying is because of what men have done to the universe, and now the children will have to devote their lives to fixing the mess. In this unexpected extension of the story, Pullman now has our two (now newly adolescent) heroes take a big step in repairing the world by falling in love, immediately followed by a carefree afternoon of sensual intimacy. Pullman omits a clinical account of what happens that afternoon, but whatever it is, it is magic: suddenly the relentless decay in the worlds is halted. Does this make any sense? No. But it helps to tie off a major loose end in the story, and provides Pullman a way to repeat an earlier theme to his young readers: that without God we are free to engage in sex without any restraint or guilt. Because with the death of God we are now free to be our own God. We can define our own morality, or lack of it, constrained only by what an open-minded society sets as limits in the new Republic of Heaven.<br /><br />Once finished with the books I went online; perhaps I was reading too much into this children's book.

Perhaps. C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories are allegories of good and evil, principles and the lack of them, the nature of man and the nature of God, love, forgiveness, sacrifice, pride and humility. Pullman offers nothing more than shades of evil, ego, and seduction; God is dead, and man has no need for forgiveness, for Pullman's superman is intrinsically good and there is nothing to forgive. On the other hand, one could argue Pullman simply has a vendetta against God in general and against the Church of England in particular, and uses a book marketed at children to further his goal of revenge.<br /><br />In interviews, Mr. Pullman has claimed neither he nor his book is anti-religious. This is as an odd and dishonest position to take; akin to as if Lewis had said his Chronicles of Narnia has nothing to do with Christianity. True, Pullman is careful not to say anything about Allah in his primer on atheism, but one suspects that this Englishman's reason for the omission has somewhat more to do with cowardice and less to do with tolerance. Pullman assumes that in a politically correct publishing world he can get away with being anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Leaving one to wonder: if a public speaker boldly and loudly teaches that the Judeo-Christian faith is responsible for all that is wrong and hurtful and evil in the world, and that the only way to solve the problem is to destroy what it stands for (and destroy most of the believers in the process), what more is necessary to classify the ranting as hate speech? If the speaker substituted any other group (Muslims, homosexuals, persons of color) in the sentence above, would society be so tolerant?<br /><br />His Dark Materials is unabashed humanist propaganda written to delight a child's mind. But just as devious is the way the author chooses to misrepresent faith. Mr. Pullman uses the traditional images, phrases, words, and symbols of the Jewish and Christian faiths in his book, but infuses his own meanings into them to twist them into serving his purpose. He trusts that his target audience doesn't know enough to spot his deceptions, or is insecure enough to accept his definitions as plausible. Further, he makes several outrageous and false claims in the process; at one point Pullman casually purports Calvin to be an advocate for child killing, as if there were some documented and widely recognized historical basis for his comment.

0307237702|4.0|This book really gave me mixed feelings.  I read it because Barack Obama is my favourite candidate for the presidency.  I thought he would make a really good `leader of the free world'.     I was not expecting that I would disagree so strongly with many of his ideas and his understanding of history.  Especially his distain for `laze faire economics' and `market failures' while being blind to the failures of government policy.  Obama calls the great depression a market failure for example, when it is clear that poor monetary policy played a very important part.   He discusses the need for the government to intervene in poor black areas of Chicago, for example, to end the poverty cycle.  He talks of how these problems are caused by the free market, ignoring the enormous effects of the government's war on drugs.  I could go on...    Having said that, at the end of the book I still like him and he is still my favourite to be president.  Obama is a good person, he has good intentions and he has empathy for others.  He tells many stories of average people that he has met while campaigning, and it is clear that he actually listens to them and feels for them.  That counts for a lot.

His characters are engaging, his worlds are vivid, his prose is delightful at times, and he occasionally produces lush and beautifully drawn descriptive paragraphs. His \\"science\\" is goofy but inventive, and without it his story couldn't work. He also demonstrates a good understanding of what appeals to an adolescent reader. I enjoyed the first volume, though my interest plateaued in the second volume and dropped like a stone in the third.<br /><br />Con:<br />Philip Pullman is one of a growing group of authors who market their own controversial adult ideas and themes as juvenile fiction/fantasy. While I affirm his right to have, and to express his view of the world, Mr. Pullman's method of garnering an uncritical and captive audience for his message is despicable. Pullman is a skillful and sometimes powerful writer who understands his audience well; sadly he uses that skill and knowledge to entice, seduce, and manipulate the immature reader.<br /><br />Here is a summary of how the Pullman method works:<br /><br />The Golden Compass is a compelling action adventure of a young, smart, defiant, and spirited pre-adolescent (12-year old) girl. There are dark characters, ugly episodes and wicked happenings in this volume, but spunky Lyra is up to the challenge. And, she has cool friends (noble gypsies and armored bears, among others) to help her.<br /><br />In The Subtle Knife we meet Lyra's male counterpart Will. By the end of this also dark and rather convoluted part of the story we like Will a lot, too. And we hate the bad guys, although sometimes it's hard to tell just who the bad guys are. Will finds himself possessing a knife that only he can use; a knife that allows him to open windows into other, sometimes parallel, worlds.<br /><br />Now that Mr. Pullman has set his stage (and the child has a significant investment in the story), he force-feeds the unsuspecting reader his world view in The Amber Spyglass. Yes, there is some foreshadowing of what's coming in the first volumes, but until we get to the third volume we keep hoping that these are literary red herrings thrown in just to keep us off balance. Alas, no such luck.<br /><br />In short order Mr. Pullman informs us that:<br /><br />- The God of Judaism and Christianity is a fake, a liar, a dictatorial despot, a draconian authoritarian intent on making everybody miserable. Mr. Pullman's definition of \\"god, the Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father the Almighty\\" is that he is the source of everything that's wrong with the world.<br />- The church is run by self-serving, power-hungry dupes and mercenaries who ensure God's tyranny is carried out. Everyone else of faith is a discounted as a closed-minded simpleton who wouldn't know what to do without being told.<br />- The health of this world and all of Pullman's \\"billions and billions\\" of other worlds is dependent on invisible, sentient dust, reminiscent of the Mitichlorians behind The Force of Star Wars lore. This dust is the product of man's gaining wisdom, a \\"natural\\" process that Pullman places in direct opposition to man's knowledge of God.<br />- The \\"good guys\\" in this world are the secular naturalists, the amoral, the animals, the witches, and the rebellious angels who have set out to help overthrow and destroy God, and<br />- Elite, self-actualized young men and women of character (like the reader, of course) possess the power to destroy God, and should destroy God because, after all, it's the right thing to do. With the assurance of Lyra's and Will's feelings that if we do destroy God then all will be well with the world and we will be happy.<br /><br />Harry Potter, meet Bertrand Russell and Ayn Rand. And don't forget Jean Genet, for flavor.<br /><br />Along the way Pullman gives lectures on:<br /><br />- The moral relativism of infanticide (it's bad to kill children if you are aligned with God, but its O.K. to kill childrenwhen necessary to further a \\"good\\" cause (i.e. deposing God, or whatever)),<br />- The nature of homosexuality (though angels are nonphysical spirit beings that doesn't prevent them from being, and stereotypically behaving like, homosexuals), and<br />- The pervasiveness of the supernatural (pretty much all of us have some kind of \\"spirit being/guide\\" counterpart that can help us do magical things, assuming we are just \\"special\\" enough, by virtue of birth and fate, to tap into this other self)<br />In other words, Pullman uses the first two books to build a platform from which to deliver his elitist-humanist/post-modern/New Age message.<br /><br />There are several passages in the volumes when Lyra or Will actually ask a tough question (What happens when we die? Where do we go? Why are we here?). To these questions a more mature, more worldly adult character always sagely answers: \\"it's not time for you to know that now.\\" Pullman glosses over his answers to these questions as he finishes his story. As it turns out, Mr. Pullman subscribes to the philosophy of despair: we have no purpose other than to do what we think best, and when we die we're just dead. End of story. Which is fine from Pullman's perspective because with God in power Mr. Pullman's future is likely to be, well . . . . . Hell.<br /><br />Spoiler Warning (though if you are a parent you will definitely want to know this): The long-anticipated climax of this 1,200-page book never materializes. In the end, it turns out that destroying God isn't such a big thing after all, and certainly doesn't solve all of the worlds' problems. Only when God is gone does Pullman come clean that the real reason the worlds are dying is because of what men have done to the universe, and now the children will have to devote their lives to fixing the mess. In this unexpected extension of the story, Pullman now has our two (now newly adolescent) heroes take a big step in repairing the world by falling in love, immediately followed by a carefree afternoon of sensual intimacy. Pullman omits a clinical account of what happens that afternoon, but whatever it is, it is magic: suddenly the relentless decay in the worlds is halted. Does this make any sense? No. But it helps to tie off a major loose end in the story, and provides Pullman a way to repeat an earlier theme to his young readers: that without God we are free to engage in sex without any restraint or guilt. Because with the death of God we are now free to be our own God. We can define our own morality, or lack of it, constrained only by what an open-minded society sets as limits in the new Republic of Heaven.<br /><br />Once finished with the books I went online; perhaps I was reading too much into this children's book. I wasn't surprised by what I learned.<br /><br />Mr. Pullman:<br /><br />- Is a self-described atheist.<br /><br />- Is listed as a member of the British Humanist Association (the goal of which is \\"an end to the privileged position of religion in law, education, broadcasting and wherever else it occurs\\")<br /><br />- Is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society (The society campaigns for: 1) the disestablishment of the Church of England, 2) the withdrawal of state subsidies to religious schools, 3) the end of tax exemptions for churches, 4) the abolition of the blasphemy law, 5) an end to the public funding of chaplains in prisons, hospitals and the armed services)<br /><br />Is His Dark Materials simply the anti-Narnia tome that Pullman says he set out to write? Perhaps. C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories are allegories of good and evil, principles and the lack of them, the nature of man and the nature of God, love, forgiveness, sacrifice, pride and humility. Pullman offers nothing more than shades of evil, ego, and seduction; God is dead, and man has no need for forgiveness, for Pullman's superman is intrinsically good and there is nothing to forgive. On the other hand, one could argue Pullman simply has a vendetta against God in general and against the Church of England in particular, and uses a book marketed at children to further his goal of revenge.<br /><br />In interviews, Mr. Pullman has claimed neither he nor his book is anti-religious. This is as an odd and dishonest position to take; akin to as if Lewis had said his Chronicles of Narnia has nothing to do with Christianity. True, Pullman is careful not to say anything about Allah in his primer on atheism, but one suspects that this Englishman's reason for the omission has somewhat more to do with cowardice and less to do with tolerance. Pullman assumes that in a politically correct publishing world he can get away with being anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Leaving one to wonder: if a public speaker boldly and loudly teaches that the Judeo-Christian faith is responsible for all that is wrong and hurtful and evil in the world, and that the only way to solve the problem is to destroy what it stands for (and destroy most of the believers in the process), what more is necessary to classify the ranting as hate speech? If the speaker substituted any other group (Muslims, homosexuals, persons of color) in the sentence above, would society be so tolerant?<br /><br />His Dark Materials is unabashed humanist propaganda written to delight a child's mind. But just as devious is the way the author chooses to misrepresent faith. Mr. Pullman uses the traditional images, phrases, words, and symbols of the Jewish and Christian faiths in his book, but infuses his own meanings into them to twist them into serving his purpose. He trusts that his target audience doesn't know enough to spot his deceptions, or is insecure enough to accept his definitions as plausible. Further, he makes several outrageous and false claims in the process; at one point Pullman casually purports Calvin to be an advocate for child killing, as if there were some documented and widely recognized historical basis for his comment. Just speculation on my part, but perhaps Mr. Pullman does these things and says these things because he assumes few will ever call him on them. And that if he tells his lies enough times in enough ways, the populace he so despises will eventually repeat his mantra as truth.<br /><br />While I cannot respect Mr. Pullman's condemnation of those who are aware of an authority higher than themselves, I could advocate a discussion of his thoughts on the subject if I believed he actually understood what he was talking about. Unfortunately, his own stunted and malignant grasp of the world view he opposes appears to have atrophied at about the age of his target audience.

0060751967|4.0|I have read six light read vampire books, this one included in the last few days. Other than Bitten and Smitten, this is the only book that was really worth my time. The author has a good sense of how to make funny natural in each of the characters reactions. The characters are very individual and there is no real need to identify who is speaking. I found the two main characters fights believable and a relief. I don't enjoy books where the \\"love birds\\" never get truely upset or lose their temper with one another. The plot moves forward quickly. I was interested enough that I had a hard time putting the book down. I finished the book in about five hours...somewhat interupted and dealing with some dislexia. Overall, this book is definately worth checking out. It's a rare gem in a sea full of time wasting wastes of paper.

B000UVT3OI|5.0|This CD is great.  I like it because I recently (within the last 3-4 years) became a country fan.  It has all of Garth's great hits on it.  Its a must have with the new songs and videos!
0751532711|4.0|I chose this book for a school project and I really enjoyed it! Robert Kiyosaki guides the reader through a series of lectures that were given to him as a child. As Kiyosaki learns about the power of money, we too learn and benefit from his advice. This book was very inspirational and I recommend it to annyone who is interested in making a little money.  ps mr.J this is julia!!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This is to be listed as one of my favorite CD's.  Prior to purchasing this CD I did not know who Brandi Carlile was.  I heard her song Turpentine on CNN-Live via my computer.  I was so impressed just with that song that I purchased her CD the Story.  Listening to all the tracks, I am impressed.  How wonderful it is to have another singer song writer come along to join the ranks of Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris and Melissa Etheridge.  I hope to see more of her music in years to come.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is the Zeppelin album that tops all other Zeppelin albums.  It opens with 'Custard Pie' - a song that manages to be even sleazier, raw, dirty and mean than the opener on Led Zeppelin IV - 'Black Dog'. Listen to the rhythym section on 'Custard Pie' and hear how tight as a unit this band is.  Fuelled by years of touring, the confidence that they could virtually do no wrong, being on the right side of 30, being able to lord it over all the other groups when it came down to it - this was a band about as satisfied as they come. But excessive? Well, not quite.  Not on record at least.  This was before the Spinal Tapp-ish letdown of 'The Song Remains The Same'. They always manage to stay on the right side of taste.  Song two, 'The Rover' picks up the pace with an even sleazier, darker riff beneath Plant's hippy-dream lyrics. It is an outtake from sessions for Led Zeppelin IV yet on Physical Graffitti it is no filler. Indeed, quite a few of the songs on this album are outtakes from previous albums but on here, and this is the key, they fit in perfectly. If there is a concept to this record, it is to demonstrate to the fore the versatility and ambitions of this talented four piece and to highlight the many musical styles that fall into the Led Zep canon.  It shows for once that there is really little point in attempting to harness the group into one musical category: they excel at whatever they try.  So, we've already looked at the funky opener 'Custard Pie' and the almost-quintessentially Zeppelinesque 'The Rover'. What of the other songs? 'In my time of dying' continues the descent into the dark side of Zeppelin, the black magic and Aliester Crowley side of Jimmy Page, which carries on the theme from Robert Johnson of selling his soul at the crossroads in exchange for the ability to play the guitar brilliantly.  The performance is an opus - around the 11 minute mark and it never drags. There are times when you want to marvel at the sheer audacity of the band to attempt such an adrenalised version of the blues but they pull it off. The stop-start structure slowly builds up with swampy slide guitar, Robert Plant's banshee wail and the powerhouse that was John Bonham on drums. I can't emphasise enough again - just how incredibly tight the band is, and they know it: you can hear them revelling in it.  Asked over the years which music from Led Zep they're most proud of, the surviving members often answer - 'In my time of dying' and such tracks as 'Kashmir' from this record.  Side two of the original record begins with 'Houses of the Holy' - another riff laden song indebted also to funk. Subject matter here like much of the record: problably something to do with mortality, sex, women, the general cultural scene surrounding Zeppelin at the time. But they don't let up. They take us to probably their most danceable tune - the heavily funked 'Trampled underfoot' with Page and Jones propelling the tune via wah-wah laden guitar and keyboards in another song heavily using innuendo about - you guessed it - sex. if it sounds a little at times like Stevie Wonder or general jazz/funk/rock of that era then that's probably because it is from that era! Finally, the first half of the album ends with 'Kashmir'.  So much has been written on 'Kashmir' that it seems trite to say any more.  Needless to say, it is this album's tour-de-force performance: virtuosic, enormous in sound and feel and Zeppelin are about the only band who could have written such a tune and pulled it off so well. John Paul Jones weaves an aural tapestry of Indian-lite sounds over the climbing, terse riff of Page. Lyrically too, Plant ascends new heights, something he has proudly admitted too. The mood really is of an odyssey to 'Kashmir' but it's more than that - it's a paen to the eastern influences that are evident on all their albums - whether in Zep I's 'Black mountain side', Zep II's 'Friends' or Houses of the Holy's 'Dancing Days'. Zeppelin seem to be at their happiest whentheir mired, positively yearning to be mired in the very roots of their influences and yet adding their own heavy touch to the equation.  The second half of Physical Graffitti opens with 'In the light', another opus - and arguably Zeppelin's natural musical progression after Zep Iv and Houses. It begins with a very mystical, slightly menacing piece on keys by John Paul Jones again. For me personally, this is the most spine-tingling moment in Zeppelin's canon. What follows is another stop-start structure of impassioned vocals, 'guitar-army' guitars from Page, a very uplifting tune and a descending baroque piece on a harpsichord sounding keyboard, which would not be out of place if written by someone like Purcell or Bach! Yet delightfully, it does all work together very well. This is followed by 'Bron-yr-aur', a hynmal, autumnal acoustic guitar piece by Page, with added echo (I think) which harks back to the heady days of Zep III in 1970, when the band retreated to a Welsh cottage to do their Crosby, Stills and Nash thing and bash out some fine acoustic numbers. Another song from this era crops up next - 'Down by the seaside' - dealing with charming thoughts of bliss in the countryside, such as I'm sure many of us have encountered (it wouldn't be so out of place with Proust)..And then, the final epic of the album 'Ten years gone'. Like its' natural predecessors ' 'Stairway to heaven', 'The song remains the same' and so on, this is a multi-layered song of regret and remorse, very affecting and delivering possibly the most impassioned vocal delivery and performance on the album - as would perhaps befit a song of such meaning. It ventures a little into prog-rock territory guitar-wise but doesn't sound contrived.  The final part commences with 'Night Flight' - jangly but in a Zep way of course that, well ' flies'. Plant and co sound unrestrained and relaxed - by now on the record they know that we should probably be fairly involved and so oddly enough, this performance sounds relaxed, but appropriately. On to 'the wanton song' now - perhaps Zeppelin's most heavy riff yet. Alike to 'Custard Pie' also, but much harder, hinting at their next album - the underrated 'Presence'. And then on to 'Boogie with Stu', which is in fact ''Oo! My head' by Richie Valens but re-worked. Zeppelin were always a brilliant covers band too, utilising covers from their encyclopaedic knowledge of blues, pop, soul and so on into live performance.  Here, the performance is charmingly lo-fi in sound, with boogie woogie piano by Jones and Plant is obviously having a good time.  'Black country woman' harks back again to Zep III and reminds listeners that Zep were also always a great acoustic rock band.  The final song 'Sick again' reverts back to side one mode: sleazy, swaggering, sexy and menacing rock music. This one's about the joy of groupies and touring, also pointing ahead to 'Presence'. It ends this album on a dark note in the way 'When the levee breaks' ends Zep IV.So, a leviathan of an album but well worth the money.

'The Club Dumas' is a great example of his engrossing & entertaining no-nonsense style. It centers around a book dealer who finds rare volumes for wealthy clients. In this case, a book that is very old and said to contain a spell for summoning the devil. Problem is, everyone who he encounters that owns it winds up dead in some ritualistic occult way! The book gallops along at a very exciting pace until it reaches a very unexpected climax.

0743455967|5.0|What can I say about this book that, I'm sure, has not been said before? Ah, but the answer to that question lies in advice often given by successfully published writers to prospective writers... to borrow/paraphrase from a piece written for the Horror Writers Association by Michael Marano, does the world need \\"just another\\" review of this book? No. Does the world need a review of this book that only I can write, based on my unique experiences and observations? Yes. Desperately. Well, ok, I don't know how desperately anyone needs my review of Stephen King's wonderful memoir, but I digress....     First of all, this book is a truly wonderful story. The insights into the life that has made Stephen King one of the most influential and certainly most read authors of our day are worth your time. And the tragedy he experiences while writing this particular book and how it shaped 'and still shapes' his life and his writing puts him on such a personal level that you get the very real feeling he is actually there with you as you read his story, encouraging you the best he can. You see, this is a book of encouragement and inspiration. It's also a lesson in telepathy 'read the book!!!' that may just be the best description of writing and the relationship between writer and reader ever put into words.     Second, Stephen King has filled half this book with honest insights, advice, and guidance to aspiring writers. There is common advice: Read, read, read a lot! Oh yeah, and write, write, write a lot! But there are many more subtle insights and personal experiences you should find invaluable. He has opened his Door to you, the Reader, and given you a look at his own creative process. His tips, and encouragement come across as genuine and I'd be lying if I said this book didn't inspire me. Thank you Stephen King, I can't believe I didn't read this a long time ago. If you're a writer or an aspiring writer, or even just a Reader of Stephen King's fiction, I highly suggest this book. In fact, if you arejust a Reader, I think you will enjoy his fiction more for having read this book.    -=R=-
0316067598|2.0|Having read Ricard Marcinko's corpus and enjoyed it immensely, I picked this up on a whim expecting a similar level of writing and professional expose. While the two share some similarities, ghost writers, SEAL experience etc - that is about all. Since Luttrell has decided to put this work to the public forum, then it is fair that one can pass some judgement upon it.    This is both an easy and a difficult book to read. Its writing and style is simple and straightforward and you will finish the book in an afternoon, so it's easy from that point of view. But it is the character of the book that makes it more of a challenge. Luttrell is something of a braggart and a simpleton, with a large chip on his shoulder. The clever and complex articulation of the liberal is lost on him and his simple solutions to things is grating over the course of the work. If one can get past how great Marcus thinks he is, his juvenile political ideals and his simplistic and unsophisticated view of the enemy, then there is something redeemable here.     I found his portrayal of the BUD/S training to be really interesting and overall his story of the rescue and homecoming to be entertaining. Furthermore one feels for the men and can share in the heroic effort by sensing the loss of the men and the grief wrecked upon their respective families. There is a great and moving story in here.     However the book has some serious deficiencies that leave me unsure as what to make of this effort. The vague writing and naive political rambling give the impression that these guys really didn't quite know what they were doing (but then that would seem to be a good subtext for America's war on terror in general). Luttrell's claim that it is the liberals that brought about the mission failure is difficult to believe and his ramblings on this are inconsistent and incoherent. Easier to believe is that the mission was doomed from the start from either bad planning/intel, inexperience, unfamiliarity with the strategy of the enemy or lack of training. But that would put the blame at least partly on Luttrell's shoulders - and he is having none of that. Unlike Marcinko's writing which comes across as believable and very informed, Luttrell seems out of place up in the mountains and seems oblivious to the capacity of his enemy and uninformed as to the history of their conflict. It would be unfair to expect Luttrell to have contemplated Plato's `Republic', but one would think that if you weere going to fight then you would at least make some effort to understand the political ramifications. Once again vis-a-vis Marcinko, Lutterull comes across as the school boy who thinks that he has graduated after passing a difficult exam (BUD/S), as opposed to the scholarly application to his craft that Marcinko portrays - that of a warrior always learning.     Nevertheless this is Luttrell's story to tell, and who am I to say he cannot tell it this way, but in comparison to Black Hawk Down or Rogue Warrior it is difficult to recommend this one. Why did the mission fail? What really went wrong? - these are the really interesting questions and the book leaves you deeply dissatisfied in this respect. Listening to Marcus waxing lyrical about his God given mission and his diatribe against the liberals is nauseating, so much so that one has to ask that if Luttrell's voice represents the best of America's armed forces, then it is difficult to be optimistic about a victory.

B000Q67DEO|4.0|It's worth noting that the CD-only version of this album ([[ASIN:B00005MNP7 Eat To The Beat]]) has four tracks that aren't on this one. You can buy them individually from Amazon for $0.89 each, but you may want to just get the much cheaper CD version and live without the videos.    My favorite songs from this album are reproduced on the 2000 [[ASIN:B00069A60E Live]] album, and at least one of them (\\"Dreaming\\") sounds much better in its later incarnation. Just my opinion, of course. Incidentally, the audio on the DVD is LPCM stereo.

The edition itself is excellent, with a fine introduction, authoritative text, maps, notes, and bibliography.

0671688782|5.0|I have been using Holding Time with my children for two and a half years and find, as the author also found, that my children go through the stages of resistence, submission and tenderness.  I find it is a way to enable my children to find and process their feelings and to give me an opportunity to counsel them in issues that they are having trouble with.  My children are happy and rested after holding time sessions, and though they have cried and resisted, they come to a new point in their trust of me and in their ability to recognize their own feelings.<br /><br />People often tell me that I have very well-behaved children, and I firmly believe it is a combination of these four parenting books we have used: [[ASIN:0671688782 Holding Time]], [[ASIN:1576839540 Parenting With Love And Logic (Updated and Expanded Edition)]],[[ASIN:1930429002 Love and Logic Magic for Early Childhood: Practical Parenting from Birth to Six Years]], and [[ASIN:0449004023 Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child]].<br /><br />As far as one customer's comments about kids \\"being shouted at\\" during holding time, that is not based on Martha Welch's theory.  In her theory the parent is to be holding the child and talking calmly, expressing oneself, affirming love, etc.  I recommend reading the book itself and not books \\"about the book\\".<br /><br />I know that Martha Welch began her research in autism, and later transferred the theory to attachment disorders.  My use was to form a bond due to toddler adoption.  For me it worked.  But I read the book through all the way before using it, and it was recommended to me by other adoptive parents.  In our situation, which was not a particularly abuse-oriented or neurological withdrawal but a plain emotional/ adoption trauma-type withdrawal, it worked and is working for us.<br /><br />I heed the directive to not \\"let go\\" during the anger stage of holding time but to bring it to resolution within the children, and can plainly see how it would affect them if I let them go while they were upset with me.  And like a miracle, the children get to the point where they are touching my face, relaxed in body, and don't want to leave me.  A special bonding experience.<br /><br />As far as the woman who had holding therapy as a child, \\"Who wants to be yelled at and told to look at somebody while being subdued by force?!\\" she said.  I agree.  In Welch's book there is no part that encourages yelling at the child.  The parent crying sometimes happens, spontaneously.  In fact for me something happened in my toddler son's heart when I cried during a holding time.  He got quiet, watched me crying, and from that day his attachment to me was phenomenally closer.<br /><br />My holding time is a great way to spend time counseling my children, it makes me aware of their needs and hurts, and it changes the way I relate to them as well.  I understand them better, and they get in touch with their feelings.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book, particularly to adoptive parents.pset with me.

B000I2J0W4|3.0|When I first saw this film I was disappointed that it didn't follow the original Stephen King novel, however, between Nicholson's performance and the grand scale of the setting inside and out of the \\"Overlook Hotel\\" and Stanley Kubrick's unique story telling, it has grown on me over the years.  The transfer looks great on HD, even if the film itself seems a little dated after 25 years (more so because of clothing styles, hair, etc., than the film itself).  Not my favorite Kubrick film, but a pretty good spook flick nevertheless.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|[[ASIN:B000OYC7A8 David Gilmour: Remember That Night - Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]<br />Short of being there, I can't imagine a better experience than I had with this DVD. Most live performances are a disappointment compared to studio recordings. This performance was not a disappointment! David Gilmour was in top form vocally and instrumentally. His guitar playing was searing and scintillating. He plays with more depth than anybody else. The addition of D. Crosby and G. Nash on some of the vocals elevated them beyond anything I have heard from Pink Floyd and that is hard to do. Richard Wright was prominent throughout and the other musicians were outstanding in every way. He performed \\"On an Island\\" plus many other tunes from earlier incarnations. I was a little disappointed in the previous live David Gilmour DVD I purchased but this one washed away any pangs I had. I don't have any live Pink Floyd DVDs so I can't compare this with any of those but I don't think I need to buy any now that I have this one. The light show was effective considering the concert hall. I can only advise you to spin this disk, dim the lights and let the outside in.

0316067598|4.0|This is a very remarkable and very detailed account of both SEAL training and Operation Redwing in Hindu Kush.  There is also some very interesting information about the Afghani people of the area.  The book is pretty well written, fairly riveting, and definitely powerful.  There are a few annoying things about the book.  It is a little over the top with machismo and bravado.  Halfway through the book it is very clear that we are reading about patriotic people who will willingly give their lives for their country, but the authors continue to hammer that point over and over.  The book calls President George W. Bush a great man and a great President.  That is debatable as is the operation in Iraq.  Finally, the book repeatedly slams liberals, which is probably fair considering the circumstances of the story.  At any rate, I highly recommend reading the book to see a firsthand account of what is going on in Afghanistan, why we need more resources there, and also an inside look at SEAL training and how remarkable it is to become a SEAL.  If you're not open minded, pro-war, a conservative, or a Republican, you might not like the book.

B00004WOI3|5.0|nirvana (noun) - a place or state characterized by freedom from or oblivion to pain, worry, and the external world.    grunge (noun) - dirt, filth, rubbish; something of inferior quality; trash.    The 1980s were one big, immoral popularity contest.  Never mind the quality - if it was \\"in,\\" people wanted it.  While hard rock had dominated most of the 1970s, the 80s were all about pop: artists like Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Lionel Ritchie, and Whitney Houston.  By 1980, punk rock, which began in the mid-70s, had evolved into \\"new wave,\\" spawning groups like Tears for Fears and A Flock of Seagulls.  Meanwhile, rock titans like Neil Young seemed to have lost all the edginess that made them so attractive; Bob Dylan stumbled through the decade, fashioning a couple great albums and releasing a much greater number of duds.  Music aficionados were forced to ponder the direst of ponderings: was rock dead?    Whether rock was dead or alive, Nirvana rejuvenated it and brought it back to the forefront, nearly stopping pop in its place.  The world hadn't heard anything so ferocious and reeling with pained awareness since the days of the Sex Pistols, and for a world still feeling hungover from the superficial craze of the 1980s, it was a welcome wake-up call.  Nirvana actually emerged at the end of the 80s, led by lead vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and also featuring Krist Novoselic on bass and, initially, Chad Channing on the drums.  They released their debut, \\"Bleach,\\" in 1989, produced and recorded for a mere $600 on the Sub Pop label.  It sold roughly 6,000 copies.  When the band heard that Sub Pop was going to become a subsidiary for a major label, they decided to \\"cut out the middleman\\" and were signed to Geffen Records.  \\"Grunge\\" music, the murky indie-alternative rock played by groups like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or, more famously, Pearl Jam, was on the verge of becoming popular.  Geffen executives hoped Nirvana could find some fame as one of the better grunge bands.  They hoped to sell 250,000 copies of Nirvana's second effort, 1991's \\"Nevermind,\\" earning a \\"Gold\\" certification from the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).  The band themselves didn't really care.    When the record was released in late 1991, MTV's late night music video showcase \\"120 Minutes\\" began playing \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" the album's lead single.  Soon it became so popular that the network began playing it during the day.  The album appeared on the Billboard 200 at #144, and in November of '91 it entered the Billboard Top 40 at #35.  Half of the initial U.S. pressings went to the northwest, where the album quickly sold out and was unavailable for days.  Around the rest of the country, the album began selling so quickly that none of Geffen's marketing strategies could be enacted.  Finally, in January of 1992, Nevermind hit #1 on the Billboard Top 40.  At that time, it was selling roughly 300,000 copies per week.    Critical response to the album was decidedly mixed.  Rolling Stone gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying, \\"If Nirvana isn't onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio's high-octane hits.\\"  On the other hand, Robert Christgau, the so-called \\"Dean of American Rock Critics,\\" gave the album an A.  \\"This is hard rock as the term was understood before metal moved in - the kind of loud, slovenly, tuneful music you think no one will ever work a change on again until the next time it happens,\\" Christgau wrote.    That's exactly what \\"Nevermind\\" is: a hard rock, post-punk album picking up where the punk groups of the 1970s left off.  It's harder now to understand just what an impact it had upon its release. Nirvana's sound has been imitated countless times by countless groups (Nickelback, Creed, etc. etc.), resulting in a new form of rock: grunge.  When Nevermind was released at the beginning of the 90s, despite its cover artdepicting a baby pursuing a dollar bill on a fishing hook underwater, it was like a generation coming up for air after being drowned in commercial, spiritless noise for a decade.  Nirvana defined its generation like no other, and \\"Nevermind\\" was the crucial album of the 1990s.    To really understand the album or the band, one must be familiar with its leader: the legendary, quasi-infamous Kurt Cobain.  Most people are very familiar with him, due in no small part to his untimely and much-discussed death in 1994.  He was born in Aberdeen, Washington, a small coastal town that looks like something out of \\"The Fog.\\"  Friends and family have said that he was the sweetest of children, but his teenage years were a horse of a different color. Cobain hated athletics (despite his father signing him up for the local wrestling and baseball teams, on which Cobain did quite well) and befriended a gay student, leading to taunts and bullying from Cobain's peers.  He focused mostly on drawing, and kept a personal journal, in which he at one point wrote, \\"I am not gay, although I wish I were, just to piss off homophobes.\\"    Cobain is a rock god.  He was named the greatest rock n' roll hero of all time by \\"NME\\" readers in 2006, and he remains one of the most enigmatic and fascinating personalities in the history of popular music.  On the outside, he was a good-looking, hostile, roughly-dressed twenty-something; on the inside, he was fighting an endless battle against his own inner demons.  The thing that separated Cobain from his similarly rude, rebellious peers was this: he cared about the world.  He really did, and he wasn't afraid to admit it.  Much of the immense pain in his life came from his own terror at the state of the world and, in particular, the people in it.  It's evident not only from his many, many quotes, but from his songs themselves.  Rough numbers like the mocking \\"In Bloom\\" or the woeful \\"Lithium\\" sound angry and reckless on top, but beneath all the anger there'simmense sorrow at the state of things.  The trademark punk madness, juxtaposed with sincere humanism, was one of the most appealing things about Nirvana.    Then there's the lyrics themselves, penned by Cobain.  While rival group Pearl Jam sang, \\"I take a walk outside/I'm surrounded by some kids at play/I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?\\", Nirvana grumbled lines like, \\"When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions,\\" or such refrains as, \\"Give an inch, take a smile/Fashion shifts, fashion style/Throw it out and keep it in/Have to have poison skin.\\"  Cobain seemed to be almost rambling as he spewed out line after line of surreal poetry, and though all of it may not mean much - his bandmates attest that most of the lyrics were written within five minutes of their first performance - there sure appeared to be some sort of deeper meaning.  Cobain seemed to be on to something which the rest of the public couldn't quite grasp.    His lyrics wouldn't have been nearly as powerful without the music to back them up.  Songs like \\"On a Plain\\" were simple enough to catch the public ear, but at the same time, the arrangement of the music added a new and very appealing depth to them.  Despite his aim to wipe the earth clean of the shiny, soulless tunes of the 80s, Cobain loved pop music.  In fact, \\"Nevermind\\"'s most famous song, the inescapable \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" (voted the 9th best song of all time by \\"Rolling Stone\\"), was Cobain's attempt to write the perfect song.  While crafting \\"Nevermind,\\" he aimed to create the ultimate pop album in the vein of his heroes, the Beatles, one which was modern and catchy enough to obliterate records like Michael Jackson's \\"Dangerous\\" (number 1 on the charts at that time) but meaningful and spirited enough that the public would grow from listening to it, not step back as they had in the 80s.  Of course, he wanted it to rock, too.    The result was a manic, pounding, rollicking rush of intense rock music.  Bassist Krist Novoselic added an oily murkiness to the tracks, keeping Cobain's edgy, buzzing guitars from taking off, much like Cobain's own darkness prevented him from ever soaring as a public figure (until his death - more on that later).  The band's original drummer, Chad Channing, was fired and replaced with Dave Grohl.  Where Channing just sort of rolled through each song, Grohl was like a hurricane and an earthquake in one thunderous package.  When he drummed, he drummed.  He didn't have the versatility or sheer prowess of drummers like Rush's Neil Peart or Stewart Copeland of the Police, but he could and did pound the hell out of those things, much like the Who's Keith Moon.  In the public eye, Kurt Cobain was Nirvana, but any fan will tell you that Novoselic and Grohl were equally important, the firm, high-velocity support for Cobain's meandering surrealism.    Of Nirvana's three albums, \\"Nevermind\\" is widely regarded as their masterpiece.  Each of its 12 tracks are gems.  It may be a testament to the album that its lead single, the aforementioned \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" is probably its weakest track.  That song, with others like the rambunctious \\"Breed,\\" or the purposefully abysmal \\"Territorial Pissings,\\"are pure hard-rocking delights.  The watery guitar on the almost ethereal \\"Come As You Are\\" is irresistible, while the surprisingly melodic chorus of \\"On a Plain,\\" or the woeful breeziness of \\"Something in the Way,\\" are downright ghostly.  While the record may have retained that ghostliness since its release, it's certainly more haunting considering the dark circumstances of Cobain's death.    There is no underlying theme on \\"Nevermind.\\"  It's not conceptually dense or extraodinarily creative, like \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\"  And all these years later, the abundance of Nirvana-wannabes on popular radio have numbed our ears.  But if at first \\"Nevermind\\" doesn't seem particularly amazing, listen to it again, and then again, and perhaps even again, and to your surprise, you will forget about all those other \\"post-grunge\\" groups out there and hear the album as the world heard it back in `91 and `92.  What makes \\"Nevermind\\" so wonderful is, in part, its story: after all, Cobain and his crew had no intentions of blowing the world away when they released the album.  Then there's the music.  \\"Nevermind\\" is the sound of a band that had something to say, said it, and had a pretty good time saying it too.  It's rowdy, but aware (painfully so, at times); visceral, but sophisticated.  It's amazing that a genre so inherently ugly, punk, can turn out to be so wise and beautiful.  And punk was never more beautiful than Nirvana.    Truly, Nirvana could have been the best and biggest band since the Beatles.  Although the Beatles' debut was a piece of pop perfection, it took them five more albums to craft a genuinely brilliant record.  Nirvana's debut, on the other-hand, was a nasty, black snake of a record, far from brilliant, but certainly promising.  It took them only one more album to generate a masterpiece, though, and their next album, \\"In Utero,\\" was similarly great.  \\"In Utero\\" is, perhaps, structurally and conceptually deeper than \\"Nevermind,\\" and it sounds more like the rough, vomitific rock of \\"Bleach\\" than the shiny yet slimey rock of \\"Nevermind\\" (a sound which the band often expressed their disapproval with).  But \\"Nevermind\\" was their masterpiece, a perfect rock record that spoke to millions of people.  If one considers that all this was done within the course of three albums, it's breathtaking to think what the group may have done had not Cobain been killed.      So if the band could've been so great, what happened?  Well, although Nirvana was the pride and joy of American listeners around 1992, when \\"In Utero\\" was released in 1993, the public was losing interest.  \\"In Utero\\" was an album that intentionally challenged its listeners, and considering that most listeners were just getting familiar with its predecessors, that wasa challenge they weren't willing to accept.  On top of that, the public was getting sick of Cobain's seemingly incessant depression and disregard for his fans.  He was becoming more and more alienated by the band's sudden popularity, too.  1994 found Cobain seeking a divorce from his wife, Courtney Love (the public frequently called \\"Cobain & Love\\" the new \\"Lennon & Ono\\"), and even planning to disband Nirvana.      Then he was killed.  The public went mad.  Suddenly everyone loved Nirvana again, and everybody always had.  They were brilliant.  Cobain was immortalized, trapped forever as the dark, troubled 27-year-old lead of one of the greatest bands of all time.  A nation grieved for one of its most promising and talented youth.  How did he die?  Suicide, officially.  The most popular rock music conspiracy is that Cobain didn't kill himself: he was murdered.  He and his band are still discussed in this day, and truthfully, if he hadn't died such a sudden and shocking death, they might not have been remembered so fondly.    Regardless of the history, Nevermind is one hell of an album.  \\"Rolling Stone\\" ranked it #17 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums, commenting, \\"His [Cobain's] slashing riffs, corrosive singing and deviously oblique writing, rammed home by the Pixies-via-Zeppelin might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, put the warrior purity back in rock & roll.\\"  It was ranked the second best album ever on VH1's list (behind the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\"), and has ranked toward the top of countless other \\"all-time best\\" lists.  Deservedly so.  This is truly one of the finest records ever cut, so fine that it almost single-handedly murdered our nation's obsession with pop.  Unfortunately, Nirvana ended too soon to complete their mission, and so we remain a nation terrifyingly conscious of trashy pop and sickeningly unaware of the good stuff, the real music - stuff like this.
B00006DEF9|4.0|\\"Singing in the Rain\\" is often referred to as the best musical ever; yes, the energy and enthusiasm are infectious, the production values superb, the colour spectacular and the story amusing but there are some negatives. Donald O'Connor mugs in every scene, Gene Kelly turns on his charm with knowing cunning (that big cheesy grin), Debbie Reynolds has a shrill and unattractive singing voice and a few of the numbers are dreary, notably the cursory \\"You were Meant for Me\\" and the pretentious ballet inserted within the \\"Broadway Melody\\" number.  For me, the standouts are the dancing duets between Kelly and O'Connor, every moment on screen of Jean Hagen who is hilarious and Cyd Charisse as a moll in the Broadway Melody number. Kelly becomes invisible.    What is really special about this Two Disc Edition are the extras. We get 2 comprehensive documentaries on MGM musicals and the Freed unit which produced the film with lots of footage of those involved in its production. We learn of the idea to build a film around the songbook of Arthur Freed himself. Also included are earlier versions of the songs, taken from excerpts of thirties films where they may have originated. We see, among others, the spectacular Eleanor Powell, the bluesy Frances Langford and a pre-code Bing Crosby singing \\"Temptation\\" with some surprising visuals. Some of these outtakes confirm that \\"Singing in the Rain\\" is a dancer's musical because Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor were mediocre singers.    The commentary attached to the film is hosted by Reynolds herself but much of it is repeated more entertainingly in a documentary made about the film. Reynolds is careful to avoid mentioning the misery she apparantly suffered due to Kelly's ruthless pursuit of perfection, couching it in the observation that he taught her a life lesson in professionalism. Baz Luhrmann is one of the commentators and his comments are irrelevant. However, Cyd Charisse, Donald O'Connor, Comden and Green (the writers), Stanley Donen(co-director) and Kathleen Freeman (Lina Lamont's voice coach) all speak so we really get first hand information about the production and the famous Freed Unit.    Other extras include the original trailer, original stills, audio tracks  and even an outtake of Reynolds screeching \\"You are my Lucky Star\\". She tries for poignant and fails miserably with that slightly toneless voice of hers. No wonder it was left out.    All in all, this is a great package and you could not fail to become an expert on the film once you have absorbed all the information.
B000001GF9|4.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I have listened to it many times since I bought it and have enjoyed and appreciated it more with every listening.  Arleen Auger's 'Kyrie' solo is gorgeous, and anything with the amazing Frederica Von Stade has my stamp of approval.<br />  Strangely enough, I didn't care for Auger's \\"Exaltate Jubilate\\". I'm trying to decide if it's just me or not. I've changed my mind before, but I just didn't find it appealing.<br /><br />BUT - one can always buy another recording of \\"Exaltate\\". Go ahead and buy this disc if you want a nice recording of the Mass in c-min, I think you will not be disappointed.
B000I0QK74|2.0|I have always loved James Taylor.  I found warmth in the folksy sound of his music and his voice.  But recently, everything he records seems to have more of a jazz feel, and it sounds like he may have taken voice lessons and his voice is more polished.  I miss the old JT style.<br /><br />I was disappointed in this cd.
140120306X|4.0|Alan Moore returns to his LOEG universe in true form this time out. The Black Dossier serves as a link between Volume Two and the up coming Volume Three, and also as a means of fleshing out the history of the League's literary universe.    Moore and his cohorts seem to have used this book to experiment with multiple formats of storytelling. One segment is printed on card stock, while one takes the form of a Tijuana style insert. Of course there's the 3D segment, which reminds one of Grant Morrison's comic book opus The Invisibles at points and is an interesting diversion.    Many people seem to think that this is meant to be the third volume in the series, and complain that the narrative is too unstructured. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this review, it is merely an analogue to the League's comic adventures and not a traditional entry in the series. But for my money it's still a very compelling and entertaining piece of work.     Ignore the detractors. If you're a fan of Moore and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, or you know somebody who is, I suggest you pick up a copy of the Black Dossier. It doesn't disappoint.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|As season two of the show ended, the \\"Others\\" had capture Jack (Matthew Fox), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly).  While they keep Jack isolated from his friends, they force Sawyer and Kate to work for them, keeping them locked in cages at night.  But they soon tell Jack what they want from him.  Their leader Ben (Michael Emerson) has a tumor, and they want Jack to remove it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the beach camp, the rest of the survivors of flight 815 are recovering from the explosion of the hatch.  Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) lost all his clothes when things went boom, but he seems to have gained a new power.  Hurly (Jorge Garcia) returns with news of the capture of Jack, Sawyer, and Kate, and various parties set out to rescue them.  But this season has plenty of surprises in store for the castaways.  What will they learn next?<br /><br />This season can pretty much be divided into two parts.  The first part was slow, with the story only moving forward at a snail's pace.  After it return from its hiatus, the pace improved dramatically.  I'm not sure that we got that many answers, but I at least feel that the story moved forward.  What these revelations mean to the show and the cast aways remains to be seen, but I am once again confident that the show will bring us resolution.<br /><br />And that leaves out the cliffhanger ending.  That had to be one of the best shocks of the season.  I never saw it coming, and it left my mouth hanging open.  Yes, it truly was a rattlesnake in a mailbox.<br /><br />This set will certainly wet your appetite for season 4 (and hopefully we'll get that sooner rather then later).  If you want to get caught up in a show with plenty of twists and mysteries, get Lost.
B00005JLPK|5.0|An incredibly beautiful movie that is well-acted, portraying the often tragic life of Frida Kahlo. While her romantic entanglements may be a bit stylized for Hollywood's sake, the voice of her remarkable talent and contribution to twentieth century art comes across clearly. I highly recommend this movie to any budding artist, those of mexican heritage, and any who have an interest in studying the evolution of women in the fine arts. Sexuality, including some homosexuality, is a part of the plot and may be offensive to some viewers. Adult supervision is recommended.
B000VAPZM2|4.0|Its summer vacation and the Wildcats (otherwise known as East High students) are counting down the seconds until they are free.  Of course, most of them are hoping to find summer jobs and so far having no luck.<br /><br />All that changes when Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) gets offered a job at Lava Springs, the local country club.  He quickly gets jobs for all his friends, including his girlfriend Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens).<br /><br />There's one thing they hadn't counted on, however.  Lava Springs is owned by the parents of Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) and Ryan (Lucas Grabeel).  Sharpay had arranged for Troy to get a job so she could steel him away from Gabriella.  So, naturally, she is furious to see the whole gang show up.<br /><br />Even more important to her is the talent show.  After losing out in the winter musical at school, she wants to retain her crown in the talent show.  And the presence of her rivals just might upset that.<br /><br />So Sharpay sets out to destroy her classmates by separating Troy from everyone else.  And as more great things happen to him, he begins to grow distant.  Will he remember what is truly important?  Who will win the talent show?  And will Troy ever kiss Gabriella?<br /><br />I'll admit, as much as I loved the first, I didn't like this one right away.  But I watched it a second time and enjoyed it more.<br /><br />This movie falls into the same trap many sequels do, the retread.  Many of the plot points feel like they were lifted from the first movie.  Now I know that movie wasn't original, but I would have preferred to see the characters make different mistakes this go around.  Additionally, the climax felt rushed, like something was cut to make everything make sense.  I liked it, but it just wasn't logical enough for me.<br /><br />I loved so many of the background characters.  While they are all back, they get pushed even more into the background.  Frankly, I would have liked to see more of them.<br /><br />The soundtrack this time gets a heavy pop push, with most of the songs sounding like polished pop tracks.  That makes it even more obvious that the actors are lip synching by the time they filmed the musical numbers.  In fact, some of the songs come across more as music videos then songs in a musical.  I'm sure the tween intended audience won't mind, but it did bug me.<br /><br />Okay, if the movie has all these flaws, why am I giving it 4 stars?  Because, once again, the movie is fun.<br /><br />While the songs are overproduced for a musical, they are still good songs.  They're fun to sing along with, and the dance numbers are great.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's a reason over 4,000 people have taken the time to come to Amazon.com to write reviews of Firefly.  It's simply the best written, most involving, most perfectly cast TV show ever produced.    I've watched literally hundreds of TV shows over the span of my 25 years and never, not once, have I ever enjoyed a show or movie (the follow up Serenity) as much as Firefly.  If you've never seen this show, you're really missing an incredibly good, although brief, ride.      It's true that it's not for everyone in the world.  But I'd be willing to bet that the VAST majority of people who watch the pilot \\"Serenity\\" through at least \\"Shindig\\" will really enjoy the show.  If you make it to \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds,\\" I guarantee you'll never regret your 7 hour time investment.    I've had such an emotional connection with TV characters until this show.  They're written with such depth, humor and most of all reality, that they really do feel alive at times.  Joss's hope that it seems like a \\"found\\" show is fully realized.  The dynamic of each of the 9 characters playing off one another works absolutely perfectly.  Without any one of them, it would be a totally different show.    There is really no reason not to buy and enjoy this too-good-for-Fox-anyway DVD set.  I've seen all the episodes at least 5 times, and will keep watching them over and over.  It simply never gets old.
0765315246|5.0|I have seen too darn many authors hyped as the new Heinlein, but had OLD MAN'S WAR been labeled as a newly-discovered 'lost' novel by Heinlein, I would have believed it.  It is not only that good, but also that full of the flavor of Heinlein's writing.  I have put the sequels to OLD MAN'S WAR and others by Scalzi on my wish list, and most definitely look forward to reading them.    What more is there to say?    watziznaym@gmail.com
0440238609|5.0|One of the things I love about this series is that it is so multifaceted. It is not a typical fantasy story of good versus evil. There are a myriad of characters, each with their own agendas, their own realities. The narrative voice doesn't push the reader into rooting for any one side. The focus is on Lyra throughout the books, because the books are about her journey to adulthood. The further I got into the series the more delighted I was to find that characters I once thought to be evil weren't predictable.   Take Mrs. Coulter for instance. Evil? No doubt. But does she serve the agenda of any other character or cause in the book? No, she'll switch sides whenever it's to her advantage, and just because she's ruthlessly evil doesn't mean she lacks soft spots (Albeit she does know how to use her soft spots to her own advantage).     This is an intelligent series, one that is sometimes misunderstood if you  try to see the books as saying anything about religion. The books aren't trying to say anything about religion, they're trying to talk about humanity and growing up, using a multi-faceted and complex universe in which to set the cosmic intrigue and machinations of the various characters.
1400063515|4.0|Sorry to say, we are \\"probably\\" not in Kansas anymore. Taleb is a modern day Renaissance man. No, not the Hedge Fund run by Dr. Simons. I enjoy catastrophy, chaos and complexity theory. I have read and enjoyed his prior book Fooled by Randomness. Mandelbrotian fractal geometry has some fascinating self-affine insights for market analysis. Name something manmade which we have more quantitative data on and understand so unpredictably as the stock market. Except that, over time, it trends upward. Ideas, innovation, new technology and bounded rational actors   are prime drivers into the unknown. But what about the unknown-unknown shocks, these are the nongaussian Black Swans. Not impossible but not anticipated either.    Interestingly, he is of Greek Orthodox descent, from the Levant in Lebanon, with exposure to polymath Jesuits. After 9/11 he was called upon to conference about asymmetric threats and found military brass had a better grasp of wild randomness than pedantic-academics.     Risk is often inaccurately assessed or quantified and at times is unknowable. Current gaussian models exclude outliers: crashes and exponential breakouts to the upside. The best example for me is HOLX, Hologic. What Peter Lynch would call my 24 bagger. Who knew? Taleb warns me of success bias leading to the belief that I can pick another like it. After reading Taleb, I was just lucky. Upside reward is not accurately represented by the gaussian nor is downside risk.    Study the Subprime effect on supposedly uncorrelated markets. The debate over liquidity, credit, risk transference, gaussian mathematical models, tight coupling of financial vehicles (SIV and CDO) is apt. Events like this probably not only make Taleb smile, but wealthy. Read Bookstaber on the hedge funds role in this.    But, even \\"simple minded\\" investors like Warren Buffet (positive outlier that he is) can make money, slowly, and in the worst of markets. Ultimately, I think, that is Doctor Taleb's (grey) swan song.     Nassim Taleb may at times wax tangential, but, I am pleased to have added this book to my collection on stocks, markets and risk in general.  As a student of biology I like his reference to the black (and grey) swans with their popperian implications.    All in all a good read, worth the risk of capital. Check out Fooled By Randomness first.
0743201140|5.0|Arguing strongly and persuasively for the uniqueness of the individual in the face of the sameness of basic human nature, The Gallup Organization continues its assault on traditional management practices, particularly those based upon uniformity of approach and improvement by focusing on identified weaknesses. In this follow-up book to \\"First, Break All the Rules\\", the authors re-present the logic for their application of this Positive Psychology approach in the workplace and introduce their 34 themes of Talent. Although the accompanying web based assessment tool is labeled the StrengthsFinder, it is built to understand yearnings, rapid learning, and satisfactions in order to detect a person's 5 dominant Talents. Talents, while enduring and unique, are only a part of Strengths, as these must be combined with Knowledge and Skills to develop our Strengths.<br /><br />As was the case with \\"First, Break All the Rules\\", this book is well researched, well written, and easy to comprehend. It superbly weaves stories and examples into the narrative to bring the points to life, making it also an enjoyable read. Although Part III is titled, Put Strengths to Work, this book is not nearly as helpful in that regard as Buckingham's more recent book, \\"Go Put Your Strengths to Work\\". And, with the upgraded version of this book, \\"StrengthFinder 2.0\\" now on the Amazon market for $11.97 (and qualifying for free shipping), one might ask, why buy this one?  I can better answer that question after my copy of 2.0 arrives next week!<br /><br />Dennis DeWilde, author of<br />\\"The Performance Connection\\"

I love WWII and this book talks about this time, but has enough drama, adventure, and love for those who just like good books. The characters were fantastic, the book kept you enthralled! I could not put it down, and I get it out and read it over ever once in a while because it is that good! I completely recommend it!!

B000P12LWY|4.0|The Tudors has been raked over the coals for not being historically exact, but why?    Often, costume drama loses people because the language isn't what they're used to and it creates a barrier between them and the characters. So what does Showtime do? They try to update the language and the attitudes of the characters into something we can relate to while leaving the historical setting intact.     Sure, some of us would've been fine with historically-accurate dialogue and love to nitpick costume errors. But Showtime's trying to get a modern TV audience interested in the British history they probably didn't learn in high school.     The Tudors did inspire me to read Antonia Fraser's excellent book on the wives of Henry VIII, and that's where I got my history lesson. Like Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, this show was more about turning an old storied character into someone we can relate to. and, yes, making it sexy.
0525950079|5.0|Pillars of the Earth was one of my favorite books when I read it years ago.  Mr. Follet has recaptured that time in history with a spell-bounding tale centered around one town and the people who live there.  There's no \\"been there, read that,\\" feeling you get from some authors who follow one successful book with another of the same genre.  I was so sad when the 1,014 page saga came to an end.  It is truly a book you will want to savor every word.

What is supposed to be a brilliant and well crafted allegory comes across as flat and downright idiotic.  I also diliked the main character so that probably didn't help.  Overall, this book confirmed my dislike for contemporary fiction.
0194001016|5.0|there you are! this standard single language dictionary meets almost all expectations you anticipate from a comprehensive word-explaining-book.  As for me, a user with a different native tongue and a student of the English language this selection is at least sufficient up to highly useful, practical, and understandable.    I ´d like to recommend this updated version to every learner of the English language, whereas various other dictionary provide comparable quality. Worth mentioning is the Longman´s dictionary-series which does sometimes better than this Oxford-edition.

B00023B1LC|3.0|First, the good news.  Matt Damon makes a great Bourne, even better than Richard Chamberlain, whom I really liked in the prior version.<br /><br />The bad news is the departures from the book.  I suppose I could get past the stock \\"CIA-assassination-team\\" theme, but what I can't get over is the way they turned Bourne from a good guy who lost his memory into a bad guy who lost his memory.  Ludlum (or his family agent) was executive producer, so there's no excuse.  Shame on them for doing that.  Actually, shame on them for underutilizing Julia Stiles too.
B0000640VO|5.0|I know she is just a fictional character, but I have to say that I absolutely fell in love with the person of Amelie, yet not necessarily in the romantic sense.  One cannot help, at the very least, finding someone like Amelie very likable.  The expressions she gets on her face alone  would make even the hardest of hearts melt.  I have always found it a great joy in my own life to come across someone who truly inspires you and makes you feel rejuvenated like the elderly men of the film \\"Cocoon\\" after they went swimming in the aliens' \\"Fountain of Youth\\".  Amelie is such a person.  When you feel old and ancient, she can make you feel young and refreshed and ready to take on the world.    I particularly enjoyed how well this film dealt with her awakening to the fact that the greatest joy can be found in helping others and reaching out in order to touch people's lives in such a positive way.  Perhaps my favorite scene of all is when she takes the lonely blind man by the hand and guides him down the street, explaining everything that is going amid the French hussle and bussle of town.  Just that one act alone was enough to make that poor man's day and it is probably something that he would cherish for the rest of his life.    Also, after viewing this film, it made me think of a certain personal development guru by the name of Bill Reidler I heard on a cassette not to long ago and how he talked about focusing on \\"Interest Out\\"--where you make it your entire goal in life to focus your interest outward towards others and not focusing so much on yourself.  I think that Mr. Reidler would really enjoy \\"Amelie\\", in that it demonstrates \\"Interest Out\\" to the max.    In conclusion I have to say that, if I was a father, I would be very proud to have a daughter like Amelie.  One who visits me every weekend (even if I were a little nutty like her father in the film and tinkering with a giant garden gnome) and shows me genuine respect--just as I would show her, and not just shoving me into a retirement home when I got old.  I would also be proud of the fact that she spent her life doing the best to rectify the lives of others which would give me bragging rights that I think would be quite justified.    \\"Amelie\\" is much more than a cute, romantic comedy.  It is a film that offers valuable life lessons, that, unfortunatly, are not often respected in today's selfish society.
6304779607|4.0|\\"Dirty Harry\\" started the genre of \\"the maverick cop willing to break a few rules and trample a few constitutional rights to get the job done\\" genre, and \\"Cobra\\" is the genre's logical endpoint.  It's fitting that two of the principal actors in Dirty Harry also appear in Cobra (Andy Robinson and Reni Santoni).  I believe that was no accident of casting.<br /><br />Cobra is reductivist in its storyline, with every character, every scene boiled down to the essentials.  The troubled, violent cop.  The maniac bad guy.  The interesting weaponry.  The violation of due process.  The ethnic sidekick/partner.  The damsel in distress.  They're all here, performing their exact functions, no more, no less.
0446577391|5.0|David Baldacci creates fiction that feels real, that leaves you breathless and always wanting more for each of his characters---as well as leaving you (the reader) wanting the next book. Baldacci's characters becomne your concerns, your friends and invade your thoughts---it is as though his work is living, not fiction. Totally outstanding writing--and so intelligently phrased---He IS what writers are supposed to be--brilliant!
1600240526|5.0|David Baldacci's Camel Club has become my favorite reading material..or audiobook.<br />Stone Cold is fast paced, well written, believable and likeable characters. The plot is plausible and full of anticipation. I listened to this audiobook in ONE day. It is not full of \\"page filler\\" as I call it when an author takes 5 pages to describe how the subject is feeling as he/she arises from bed in the morning. If you like extended descriptive words, move on. This book gives the readers..if they are new..just enough background to understand the characters,without overkill. Can't wait for the next book, David.

I don't regret following thier musical careers, and watching movies like, \\"Help\\", and \\"A Hard Days Night\\" remind me of a kinder day. The songs were all hits, and even watching these movies today, you can be young again for a little while.
1567184855|5.0|For those interested in the metaphysical, this is a fascinating book.  Gives a different perspective on the after-life than some other books I have read on the subject.  I'm hoping that not all of it is true, especially the part where souls are described as \\"fireflies!\\".  Who wants to be a firefly after death?  Anyhow, you need to read it with an open mind and consider that it just might be true. I plan to read the author's follow-up book to see what other ideas are presented.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|My little one loved the  video. We havent watched the specials yet, but the movie and songs caught her attention for sure!
B00007AJGH|5.0|\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is one of the most important milestones in movie history.  The first thing that blew me away was the unprecedented coorporation of the two biggest rivals in animation, Disney and Warner Brothers.  Until this movie came out, no one but no one ever dared to dream that Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse would appear in the same frames.  Also included were characters from Max Fleischer (Betty Boop), Walter Lantz (Woody Woodpecker) and others.  Great technical strides had been taken since Jerry Mouse danced with Gene Kelly.  The interaction between live and animated characters was convincing and lifelike all the way through the movie.  The film was loaded with innuendos and inside jokes, which only added to the pleasure of watching it.  I thought the casting was perfect, too.  Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom was spot-on.  If I could give this movie seven stars, I would.       Now about the DVD format itself.  The clarity of transfer is outstanding.  However I do have one little beef about the formatting of the menu.  I would have greatly preferred being able to go straight to a menu instead of having to wait for Benny the cab to go all over the place and then having to go three layers deep before being able to select from the menu.  That old rather fast.  I'm not going to knock off a star for that, though.  On its own the formatting would be two stars out of five.       I highly recommend this movie for anyone who has any kind of a sense of humor.  For those who don't, I recommend this movie to develop one.

0143038419|5.0|Can't say enough good about this book!    First off, I love the way Miss Gilbert writes. She not only FINDS the phrase, but turns it in such a wonderful way, I have no trouble understanding and getting her point of view.  As I've told my husband, it's just like when we watch really good acting. No matter how foreign the emotion may be to you personally, you just get it due to the actors gift. She's got that as a writer. SUMMARY:  If you like good writing style (and not just a good plot) this book will not disappoint!    Secondly, the premise is a fantasy for many of us. Who wouldnt want to take a year off to find themselves? Not many of us can afford to tho, either time-wise, money-wise, or commitment/family-wise. I'm so glad I got to take this journey as an armchair participant!! Her struggle with letting go of her ex's was particularly well done. I'm sure many people will find useful insights that may help in their own struggles.  Other reviewers think it's pretentious and unfounded. huh? Clearly, empathy is NOT one of their strengths. (kinda like the Ex?)  Thankfully must of us do not have to answer to people like this. And if we do, well, this book might just be the best place to turn for advice and suggestions on how to fix your life!  SUMMARY: This is the authors story!  She substantiates everything, and you don't HAVE to agree. Just listen and enjoy it for what it is! And if you DO agree, well, you've just been enriched!    I find myself constantly adding to my list of friends and family for whom I'd like to give a copy of this book. I've actually got highlighting in my copy. (particularly the India section! SO much insight!!) It will not get loaned out! I'd rather purchase copies for people!    READ THIS BOOK!! You will NOT be disappointed!!

0452282152|5.0|Girl With A Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier is a haunting story about the woman who is seen in Johannes Vermeer's painting of the same name.  It is about more than just the history behind the painting though, it tells the story of a teenage girl who becomes a woman, in the most realistic way possible. Though the story is set in 17th century Holland its themes transcend time and are still relevant in today's world. The author's objective to show not only the story behind the famous painting, but also the life of a developing woman who is falling in love for the first time, from the inside out is clearly seen. The author argues that love does not have to be physically acted out to be felt and understood. She also shows that strength that one does not know that they have can be found in the most unexpected of circumstances.    A brief summarization of the plot is that Griet, a lower class peasant girl in 17th century Holland is placed as a maid in the well to do household of Johannes Vermeer. She soon discovers that her place among the family is to neither be seen nor heard, her only escape is cleaning the studio of the painter. It is here that she falls into a fantasy world of colors and paintings. Vermeer takes notice of the girl and asks her to be his assistant. The two began to understand each other on a higher level and Griet falls in love with him. She secretly assists him on a daily basis, in time the mistress of the house finds out but allows it to continue because she feels that the family will benefit from it. Eventually he paints a picture of her to acquiesce to an affluent friend's wish, he asks her to wear his wife's pearl earrings for the painting and in doing so Griet seals her fate in the household. The climax of the story occurs when Vermeer's wife sees the painting and becomes livid. Griet leaves the home and marries a butcher who had been courting her, though she never forgets Vermeer. At the end of the story she is summoned back to the home after Vermeer's death and revives the earrings that she wore in the picture because he left them to her in his will.    Chevalier uses many things to show her objectives in the book. Such as scenes where Griet is grinding up paint for him carefully or thinking about how she would make his paintings better by changing things. Or by showing the way she deals with the chaos that surrounds her in the household. She holds herself together, never showing the weakness that she feels. She successfully shows the thoughts and feelings of the girl in the most simplistic and raw way possible. In support of her argument that love does not need to be physical to be felt there are more blatant scenes where the two are alone together in the studio. The most moving of these is when he is about to begin painting Griet and she tells him that she doesn't want to wear his wife's pearl earrings. This is the first time that she has ever defied him and he is not happy with her because of it. When she is in the storeroom changing and putting on the turban that she uses to cover her hair he walks in behind her and sees her hair for the first time. This is a very intimate moment for them because no one ever sees her hair. They stare at each other and everything is right between them again. It is here that the relationship between the two is reveled, the moment is so private and solemn that you feel intrusive reading it. Though they do not touch, they connect.    The book will definitely change the way that you view Vermeer's painting forever because it is so realistic. When looking into the mystery girls eyes you can't help but see Griet and her story. Chevalier is very persuasive in telling the story. The story transports you to a different time and place, it is amazingly engaging. My only criticism is that halfway through the book you know how it will end. But this does not make you want to stop reading, because even though you know how it ends, you want to experience it along with Griet. Theintended audience for the book is very vast because the story is so timeless. The story is also very historically accurate in regards to the time period and area. I would recommend this to everyone who is not only interested in Vermeer or history, but who has ever loved and lost.

B000TQAF8M|5.0|Amazing Album - if you truely love music, buy this album.    This is quite possibly the best album I have bought in some time. Unlike so many bands, Oceansize have not let the walls of the commercial music box confine them. Rather, they have created music as music should be. An expression - whether that be of emotion, musical/technical ability and knowledge or whatever.... just not a product to feed the mindless masses.    Oceansize are one of the few bands I have heard in the last few years that are trying something truely fresh. Why stick to 4/4 timing? Why not make a song go for as long needed to build suspense, amplifying the tremendous climaxes?    The daunting minimalized first 5 minutes of \\"Only Twin\\" are almost spine-chilling. Then the song erupts into a winding melody underpinned by a highly syncopated riff taking around 12 bars to repeat itself.    The drumming itself is a work of art in this album. Every stroke of Heron's sticks is planned, precise and appropriate - yet never coming across as boringly routine. The sheer complexity of their music, and thus Heron's drumming, could never allow it.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|In an era that was dominated by English racism Wilberforce has the faith and tenacity to bring about the end of the slave trade.  The movie title indicates his inspiration by referring to the beloved hymn written at that time.  This is a drama you won't want to miss.  One story of how God chooses to work through us in the world.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a sly, clever animation movie full of heart and intelligence. I usually do not like CGI animation as the story and characters are often sacrificed to the special effects but this is a wonderful script full of wit and enough conceptual humor to keep you entranced. I loved it.

B000HWZ5VU|5.0|A terrific first album by Plant.  Followed by many other outstanding recordings, the song on this CD, 'Moonlight in Samosa,' is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. The remastered CD contains an excellent live version of 'Like I've Never Been Gone.' The musicianship is solid all the way through.  Plant's vocals are, of course, under control filled with passion and power and the lyrics are interesting on each song.  What more could you ask for?
B000059XUO|4.0|I saw this move years ago when it first came out.  It is a very good story if you have never seen it and you like movies that are on the dark side you owe it to yourself to see this one. The story will have you from the start.    Justice has been served!    Sadly this is the last move that the leading man \\"Brandon Lee\\" ever made.
0440238609|4.0|I just got finished reading this series and I have to say that at some points it was really enjoyable, but at others I think the writer stretched himself a bit too thin in regards to plot and detail. The first book is great - the best of the series in my opinion. I really enjoyed the entire storyline throughout the first part of the series.  Also Lyra and her adventures are very interesting. Then you get to the second and third books and Will - who I happen not to be too crazy about. It's not that I don't like Will, but it almost seemed like the writer changed what the first book seemed to be about and added in so many crazy details to accommodate Will's storyline, which I didn't really see what point he actually served. Yes, he served a point of course, but I would have been fine without him even entering the series - and for the books to continue focusing on Lyra and her family. Also all the information about Molly was not really needed in the third book, and I was a bit disappointed with how the Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter aspect of the story was resolved.  Still, this series is highly enjoyable. It's dark, intelligent, and there are so many wacky things the author comes up with. And I don't mean wacky in a negative way.
B000XB5WHW|3.0|Pink's Re-issue of \\"I'm not dead\\" is a decent re-issue. It's great that she added some songs which were on the international editions of the album. I always thought \\"fingers\\" was on the best album tracks and it didn't make the US edition, until now with this re-issue. I was expecting Zomba Label Group to make this a clean album like they did with Justin Timberlake's [[ASIN:B000X8NHC2 Futuresex/Lovesounds - Deluxe Edition]]. I'm glad they didn't. And The DVD is a lot better than the dvd side of the [[ASIN:B000EGCIU0 original Dual Disc version]]. But still, I find that if you own the original, this is a total waste of money.  My Top 5 songs off the album  1. Fingers  2. [[ASIN:B000EHRYJE Stupid Girls]]  3. Heartbreaker  4. [[ASIN:B000PC6FHK Dear Mr. President]]  5. [[ASIN:B000OPOC8C Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)]]
B000VL9XNI|4.0|I've been waiting for years for a comprehensive live video from AC/DC and Plug Me In mostly delivers.  The Bon Scott years footage is fantastic, with some seriously enlightening early performances as well as the band at their height.  I felt the Brian Johnson years lacked something.  Perhaps it's the emphasis on later performances, rather than more stuff from Back In Black - For Those About To Rock years.  But perhaps there just wasn't much available.  Most tragically, whoever ok'd the publishing of the \\"jam session\\" with the Stones was perhaps a bit blinded by the idea of it because the execution is embarrassing.  Terrible soloing from everyone, terrible mix, and somehow they decided to carry on after the first attempt to end the song, as if by doing so they could perhaps make up for the mess they'd already made.  This clip should have been relegated to YouTube.

0451191153|5.0|Based on recommendations of several friends, I picked up Atlas Shrugged - but also Ayn Rand's earlier book, The Fountainhead.  In the interest of easing into these large books, I picked the shorter, earlier work.  A few weeks after finishing the book, I am still turning the ideas over in the back of my mind.  As The Fountainhead is a novel written by Rand to explain her philosophy of objectivism, it is both entertaining and thought-provoking.  All the while one reads this book, it helps to remember the historical setting.  Published in 1943,  socialism/collectivism as a philosophy of government and society were ascendant; capitalism/individualism was unfashionable in the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War I, and in the turmoil the ongoing Second World War.  To those without the experience of collectivism and  seeking to make sense of the tumultuous 20th century, this new philosophy had a broad appeal.  Rand had a first hand taste of collectivism when her family's St. Petersburg pharmacy was confiscated by the Bolsheviks around 1920.  She arrived in New York in 1926, having already developed a lifelong hatred of collectivism in all its forms.    The Fountainhead was written by Rand to explain her philosophy of objectivism.  So while it is a good story, it is also (primarily) a book of ideas.  The story centers around four main characters: Howard Roark & Peter Keating who travel dramatically different roads to grow from architecture students to become very different men; Ellsworth Toohey, a cynical and scheming leader/manipulater of men whose life goal is to further the cause of socialism/collectivism in the United States with himself as leader; Gail Wynand, a seedy newspaper mogul who possesses a surprisingly strong conscience and intellect in contrast to his flagship tabloid publication.      Roark is Rand's ideal: a man equally unbending in his principles in the face of vicious public criticism or lavish support, moreover he is almost entirely unaffected by his detractors.  Keating is precisely the opposite, a man who only lives to beg, borrow or steal the affections and praise of others.  Keating manages to be highly successful in a leading architectural firm, while secretly turning to Roark for help on his greatest projects.  The inner conflict that naturally arises from his double life makes him a lackey (friend in Keating's mind) of Toohey.  Toohey makes Keating feel good about himself while lavishly praising his mediocre architectural achievements in an influential column that Toohey writes in Wynand's newspaper.  Toohey purposely supports the mediocrity of Keating and others because he aims to deny - even destroy - the existence of surpassing individual achievements that are the antithesis of a collectivist society.  Toohey masterfully uses Wynand's newspaper as a platform for his views, yet in such a manner that few realize the eventual implications before it's too late - least of all Wynand.  Finally, Dominique Francon is a singularly beautiful and brilliant woman who plays her own critical role in the lives of each of these men.  Dominique's character experiences the most changes of any of the characters in the story.  Her complicated relationships with each of them are variously based on love and hate, principle and expediency.    All aspects of The Fountainhead serve to illuminate ideas; as a result, readers may note the lack of change and growth in main characters whose largely static identities are necessary to the story.  Further, these ideas are presented forcefully in black and white, leaving little room for real world shades of gray.  The treatment of love and sex in the story will strike many readers as cynical or even offensive, while Rand's atheism is particularly strong.  Readers who can set aside personal differences (such as they exist) with the author, however,  will enjoy a book that inspires through its praise of achievement over mediocrity, and will also have an opportunity to reexaminetheir own beliefs on relationships, culture and society.  The Fountainhead is an American literary classic, as relevant to our lives today as it was almost 65 years ago.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|This is the best Bruce album since Human Touch. The songs are well written and the pacing is good. Living In the Future can be a bit annoying as it sounds too much like 10th Ave Freeze Out. But he makes up for it with alot of solid music, in fact among his best. Unfortunately, the sound production is awful. In fact, this is one of the worst sounding cds I own (over 1,000) even including those made during the first few years of the medium's existence. This cd sounds bad on an Ipod, pretty bad on a car cd player and awful on a high end audio system. Brendan O'Brien should be shot for the way he miked and mixed the instruments. Also, the compression is so great it has squeezed all nuance from the music. The leading edge, the bloom and the decay of notes is nowhere to be found. Most of Bruce's audience are adults that know how to use a volume switch---we don't need the sound so compressed that we lose the joy of being able to follow each band member's musical path.  Everyone from Bob Ludwig to Bruce should be ashamed for letting this really good music sound so bad. Not as engaging as wall of sound and not as cool as purposeful lo-fi. In fact, even though Brendan O'Brien has been Bruce's worst enemy of late, Bruce has not made a well recorded album since Darkness (Jimmy Iovine, Thom Panunzio). The instruments there had beauty, depth, impact and were set against a pitch black landscape of silence. While I realize that the sound there fit hand and glove with the theme of that particular album and would not necessarily be appropriate for his other albums, Bruce has not melded sound with emotional impact as well since then. The last well recorded albums were Human Touch/Lucky Town. As with Tunnel of Love (all Toby Scott and Bob Clearmountain) the sound was merely good. It is a tribute to Bruce and the band that even though the sound of band's records since then (Rising, Devils and Magic) have been variously truncated, wooden, empty, hollowed out, screechy and flat out nonanalogue, the music has generally prevailed.   Bruce should be more careful in the future. Try an analogue production a la Ben Harper's latest or sling a cassette deck over your shoulder (which in the case of Nebraska actually worked very well), but lose the tin ear. Stop engineering the sound of your music for MP3 players that will not distinguish good sound from bad no matter what you do. We who listen carefully beg you.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|All the reviews talk about how the writing isn't as good in this season. It might not be, but it was certainly good enough for fans of the Lorelei and Rory. The series-ender was perfect. It ends with a bow...it just might not be tidy! I loved it.
0143038419|1.0|I really tried to like this book and literally gave up half way through. Although the author is a decent *writer*, her insights were like reading the thoughts of a college student. Maybe it was because I read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" immediately after reading \\"Three Cups of Tea\\", but I couldn't suppress my irritation over someone who had a great life, some problems, and presented her story as if it was an epic journey. I guess you either identify with the author and love the book, or find her whiny and self-absorbed and dislike the book.
0684833395|2.0|Though I have posted dialogue from the book, it DOES NOT contain spoilers!    Obviously I am in the minority when it comes to rating this book, but I guess I'll add my opinion to Amazon's hard drive in the hopes that it will help someone to make a decision on this book:    I really tried to read Catch-22.  I have wanted to read it for about three years now, and have always heard good things about it.  I went in knowing only what the term 'catch-22' meant, but nothing else.    The first thing that struck me about the book was the humor.  I was laughing and giggling for the first few chapters during the humorous dialogue that is rampant throughout that section.  I cannot define the humor as deep, as it all seemed just a bit silly.  That would be fine for me if it were in small doses - I get plenty of silly humor from my friends - but the book just beats it to death.  I'll even demonstrate an example:    There are no spoilers:    ********    ***********************************************************       \\"In sixty days you'll be fighting Billy Petrolle,\\" the colonel with the big fat mustache roared. \\"And you think it's a big fat joke.\\"       \\"I don't think it's a joke, sir,\\" Clevinger replied.       \\"Don't interupt.\\"       \\"Yes, sir.\\"       \\"And say 'sir' when you do,\\" ordered Major Metcalf.       \\"Yes, sir.\\"       \\"Weren't you just ordered not to interrupt?\\" Major Metcalf inquired coldly.       \\"But I didn't interrupt, sir,\\" Clevinger protested.       \\"No. And you didn't say 'sir,' either...\\"  ******************************************************    Ok, maybe Mr. Heller is trying to show that commanders aren't listening to the soldiers or maybe he's trying to demonstrate that the commanders are stupid, I don't know.  Regardless, what I know is that this type of humor is repeated continuously through the first 80 pages and by that time it is completely overused.    Ergo, my recommendations for the prospective reader therefore is this:  If you think you can handle the described type of humor in large quantities, purchase this book.  If you are unsure, rent it from the library.  If the above dialogue seems disinteresting, I would search elsewhere for your next book.

B00006ADD5|5.0|Not much more needs to be said - 5 stars and the title of this review says it all. This is a movie I have seen numerous times since I was a young child and am thrilled to have it in my DVD collection!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This is a really funny show.<br />Well written.<br />They could have come up with a better<br />name for the show. Only down.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Death Proof is Quentin Tarantino's contribution to the Grindhouse double feature, an unapologetic embrace of low budget exploitation films that played in drive-ins throughout the 60s and 70s.  Heavy on \\"royal with cheese\\" dialogue and chalked full of some of Hollywood's best eye candy, Death Proof unmistakenly wears the fingerprints of its creator.   Taking his homage as far as he can go, Tarantino also recreates the hisses, pops, cigarette burns, missing/repeated frames and audio inconsistencies common during the drive-in era.      Despite the dozen or so scream queen roles that Tarantino no doubt wrote into the script so he could fill them with a casting couch, Death Proof's star is Kurt Russell, the mysterious Stunt Man Mike, an ageing scarred Elvis Man who drives around in a stunt car built to survive any accident.  Since Stunt Man Mike knows he can live though any crash with this \\"Death Proof\\" car, he uses his automobile as a weapon to mow down Tarantino's titillating temptresses.  Death Proof does not explain why Stuntman Mike does what he does, instead relying on the audience to accept the simplistic, one dimensional nature of classic exploitation horror films.  Stunt Man Mike kills people...enough said.     After what appears to have been a long life of automobile decapitations and mutilations, Stunt Man Mike seems to meet his match when he targets a car full of female stunt drivers, a duel which manifests into a car war that would make James Dean, Gene Hackman and The Dukes of Hazzard all jealous.  The last half of Death Proof features some of the most unbelievable stunt work ever captured on screen, highlighted by Zoe Bell (real life stuntwoman playing herself) slipping and spinning on her car's hood at terrifying speeds.      As with most of his work in the last decade and a half, Tarantino is more concerned with having fun than with recreating the brilliance of his early films.  Nothing in Death Proof is meant to challenge the White/Pink bantering from Reservoir Dogs or the Christopher Walken scenes from True Romance or Pulp Fiction.   He's not making those kind of movies anymore.    Instead, Tarantino is like a Senior who only needs a few electives to graduate and spends his last semester taking swimming and ballroom dancing.  He's done all the hard work and now just wants to have a good time.  With Death Proof, Tarantino clearly achieves that goal...and audiences who understand his intentions will enjoy the ride.
B000MM1F5A|5.0|Wonderful CD and DVD with some video features and a fantastic concert in Lisbon. I sing all the days the famous song: Fado meu Fado!!  Go Mariza! Go!  Kisses from Italy!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother's movie collection.  This movie is a must see, but it came in a little cardboard case!  Not a plastic case, like all other movies come in.  Now, I am as close to a \\"tree hugger\\" as they reasonably come, but this is even a little silly to me.  My mom will just throw away/recycle the case it came in & go buy a case that will fit on her shelf.  I was disappointed that it still cost $20 with no case.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|The item was shipped very quickly, and I got it at a great price.  Much cheaper than anywhere else, including shipping.  The DVD set was purchased as a Christmas gift, so I don't know what the recipeient thinks yet, but I am sure she will be pleased!
B00005JOHC|5.0|This show is so funny. Its not for kids.<br />But one of the better comdey show on today.
0061122416|2.0|I picked up \\"The Alchemist\\" on a beaming recommendation from a friend and I disliked it intensely. Granted, it is an eloquent tale about following your 'Personal Legend,' but does every single theme have to be spelled out in caps so I'm getting hit on the head constantly? Does the message of the book have to be repeated every two pages? And why does the tale turn from a boy following his dreams to a philosophical spiel? This is \\"literature\\" for dummies. Even though Coehlo said in an interview he writes for adults, this is just a packaged tale of magical realism to coat a fluffy tale that everyone already knows. Don't waste your time. It won't change your life.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara Bareilles is not going to be a little voice in music! Her music is wonderful! I love her original and new sound, her voice is soulful and fun, and the fact that she writes all her music and plays the piano just puts it over the top. To me you truly have talent if you can write your own stuff. I absolutely love this cd!! :)
B00005JO20|1.0|This is just not acceptable from Amazon. Why are the DVD's I just bought all looked like they've been used?? I bought 300 for DVD and it has a bunch of fingerprints on it. This one has smears like if it was washed by a dish washer. I bought this brand new (Suppose) I guess not! There's no mention in the description that this is a refurblished product. Just NOT ACCEPTABLE! DO NOT BUY DVD'S from Amazon.
B00004YB9Y|2.0|I am a huge fan of ALL of these guys  ie; The Three Tenors. I am not a snob when it comes to music, I sit back and relax and enjoy.  But man oh man, this was woeful ! Singing out of synch with the orchestra, exceptionally poor english, the wrong words even to one of the songs.  No, sorry boys but this was a boo boo CD !!!!
0743486285|5.0|This book is intense and hard to read at times, but it is well worth the investment.  Nikki Sixx turned from heroin junkie to super hero.  It took him twenty years and more experience than most people have ever had, but the result is a man who has seen it, done it (more than once), and miraculously lived to tell others about it and hopefully save some of their sanity.  This book is required reading.  Get it, read it, read it again.  It's worth it.
B00003CXBH|3.0|This movie is accurate for showing the culture of the Jesuits, for example; their lack of material possessions. The Jesuits taught a great example of repentance in the way which  Mendoza took upon himself the task of carrying a bag of armor up the mountain to be forgiven and receive the privilege of being a Jesuit.      Altamirano`s way of teaching was through love. He showed that the culture and ways of the Guarani was not important to receive the message which he carried. He wasn't willing to fight against the government because they were his brothers. He had such a love for his church that he was not going to break the laws of the Jesuits and fight.  He was killed as a priest, showing his faithfulness to God.       This movie portrays the misuse of government power. Governments are to serve the people. The people  of the Church have to follow the counsel of the Government. In some cases it`s appropriate for church to resist the government. A great conflict  in many countries, as shown in this movie, was the governments lies, and misuse of power to obtain what they wanted; control over the church.    The movie developed very slowly. It took a while to build up the characters and theme to show the plot. The themes shown in this movie were: love of man, wars between church and government, and religious protection. The actors of this film did a great job of portraying the emotions of the Jesuits, Guarani, and government officials. When the Guarani child sings you can see: the fear in the Guarani's faces, anger of governmental officials, and peacemaking of the Jesuits. A striking scene is when the Guarani mothers were forced to abandon their children.
B00005JPLW|1.0|This has nothing to do with the movie. The movie itself is Great!  I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault but when I receive the movie it has fingerprints on it. I originally bought this on black friday and I bought it as brand new but when I received the DVD it is clearly used and has a lot of  fingerprints and scratches. Just HORRIBLE!!! NOT ACCEPTABLE!!! BUYERS BEWARE!
B000I0QK74|5.0|Wonderful Christmas album!  \\"Taylor-made\\" quiet renditions of favorites.  I especially enjoyed \\"Jingle Bells.\\"
B00005JPRD|5.0|I saw \\"Across the Universe\\" last night.  I was almost afraid to go; it's been getting some really bad press.  But it was beautiful.  The music by the Beatles is, of course, alone worth the price of admission, but then to have it performed by such a capable (mostly unknown) singing cast, not to mention some surprise turns by the likes of Joe Cocker and Bono, is just frosting on the cake.  The movie had me hooked when a beautiful Asian-looking actress who, dressed as a cheerleader, starts singing \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" in an achingly pure voice.  She appears to be looking at a boy in a football uniform, but just as she sings the word \\"man\\" (as in \\"You'll let me be your man\\"), you realize it's not him, but the girl he's talking to, also in a cheerleader's outfit, that the Asian girl is singing to.  It's a spine-tingling moment.  The rest of the songs are also used in fresh and innovative ways; sometimes this works (the seldom-heard \\"Girl\\" sets the stage nicely)--sometimes it doesn't (\\"Revolution\\" was always problematic, even in its day).  Also, the main character, Jude, is a bit underdrawn (his buddy Max takes the acting honors, especially for his flawless American accent), but I'm glad I saw the film, and I am eternally indebted to scripters Clement and La Frenais for reminding younger audiences that, yes, there was once a time when young men were drafted into the army and that Americans were asked to sacrifice in times of war.  I've been a huge Beatles fan for over forty years.  I own all their albums.  I am now looking forward to buying the soundtrack album to this film.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|If you like Garth Brooks, or even think you MIGHT like Garth Brooks, buy this CD/DVD.  It is one of the BEST compilations of music I have heard in a long time.  He is one great performer.  Having never seen him live makes the included DVD an added plus!  Definately worth the investment.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|as a long time garth brooks fan, this is a great cd. it has all his old songs plus some new ones...it is just great!!!
031286504X|5.0|I decided to read \\"I am Legend\\" before I saw the new movie with Will Smith, opening on Friday. On the back cover, we read Stephen King and Brian Lumley crediting author Richard Matheson with being a profound influence on their own work. After reading the book, I can see why. Modern horror writers, as well as makers of the post-apocalyptic horror film, are deeply in Matheson's debt.<br /><br />\\"I am Legend\\" concerns Robert Neville, the last man on earth living in a world of vampires. We follow Neville as he struggles through his daily survival routine, which involves him looking for supplies and getting home before dark, when the vampires come and surround his house. Among other things, Neville must gather garlic from his greenhouse to put around his house at least twice a week, keep the house boarded up, and make stakes to kill the vampires with during the day. In the end (and I won't reveal too much), Neville realizes that he may have a much bigger problem on his hand than the vampires.<br /><br />Despite what you may think, \\"I am Legend\\" is far more complex than the typical horror story. Neville struggles in his isolation to find a meaning in his life, and nearly goes crazy when the vampire women do things like lift up their dresses to get him to come out of the house at night. In addition, there's a bit of humor in the vampire character Ben Cortman, who perennially shouts \\"Come out, Neville!\\" Another interesting aspect to \\"I am Legend\\" is that of scientific discovery. Through intense reading and research, he finds that a germ, which he names \\"vampiris,\\" caused people to turn into vampires. The germ was spread by mutant insects and dust storms after an implied nuclear war.<br /><br />Besides \\"I am Legend,\\" which turns out to be a novella of about 170 pages, there are other short stories by the author included. One of the most memorable is \\"Prey,\\" about a cursed Zuni fetish doll attacking a woman in her apartment. The story was memorably brought to life in the movie \\"Trilogy of Terror,\\" and arguably inspired the \\"Chucky\\" movies and the whole \\"killer doll\\" genre. \\"Person to Person,\\" about a man who has a telephone ringing in his head every morning at 3:00 a.m. and finally decides to answer it, is quite memorable.<br /><br />If you're a horror fan, or even if you're not and just looking for a thrilling page-turner, you can't do much better than this.\\" and arguably inspired the \\"Chucky\\" movies and the whole \\"killer doll\\" genre. \\"Person to Person,\\" about a man who has a telephone ringing in his head every morning at 3:00 a.m. and finally decides to answer it, is quite memorable.

B000Y179KO|5.0|I saw the interview on 60 minutes and I agree with Henly that this is better than \\"When Hell Freezes Over\\"!  I also apprecitate that it was only $13.00 at Wal Mart!
B000000OQY|4.0|If you can get through the harsh lyrics side two displays some of Slash's best guitar playing. If you want more I suggest finding his track \\"Obsession Confession\\" found on Gypsy Soul New Flamenco Narada.
0753513005|4.0|This is one very good book for young people who are searching for the entrepreneur in themselves. He explains and describes in detail what he was going through and how his mind worked in his early years when he was building his businesses. And also, how he enjoyed his life while doing all these things. He illustrates few unique qualities... having fun while working, taking risks like a maniac... and most importantly, fearlessness.    I assume the story here is genuine and there are so many things that the reader will learn. Basically, this book changed my life.    One limiting thing in this book is that there is not enough details about his recent achievements and businesses. They are all explained in a hurry. The people who want to know every thing up to the point of the writing this book will be little disappointed. Thats why I've given one star less.
0763619612|5.0|I loved this book and can use it in my library all the time.<br />Thank You
B000TSIK14|5.0|This is, bar none, the best album of 2007. You will love it and so will your kids.     '321' , 'Humanity', and 'Hour 1' are as good as any hard rocking head banging songs in the last 25 years. 'The Cross' is a wonderful, angry, rock attack on clergy using Theological cliches (\\"take up your cross..\\") as the method. 'Love Will Keep Us Alive' is a lovely old school ballad.     Its truly sad that mainsteam music in the US has become so poor that this album will not have a chance to rise to the popular level it deserves. But do yourself a favor and get it.     Klaus Meine is flawless vocally.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Just got Region 2 5 disc ultimate collector's edition from amazon.co.uk.  It comes in a tin case with all the goodies that this version does, except for the unicorn and spinner car replicas or suitcase. seems its only available in europe and not in the US. It's 17.98 pounds plus 3.08 pounds shipping, which converts to about $42.00. So, if you just want the movie in the 4 different editions plus the work print and don't care about the chintzy twinkets or cheap suitcase and have a region free DVD player, this is the way to go. oh, and it came out in the UK on December 3, two weeks earlier than it does in the US. still might pick up the US edition if its on sale or the price comes down, but the Region 2 edition is all you really need.
055358894X|5.0|This book was far more than I ever expected! The Lies that Locke Lamora weaves throughout the entire story will leave you guessing until the very end. There are more plt twists and turns than I can even remember and I just fininshed the book. One of the most creative and engrossing writers I've read in my life.   Very great new artist, whose book will keep your spell-bound and reading all night. At first the book may be a little slow and hard to understand. Just note that some of the chapters are about the young Locke and some are about the older Locke and that they alternate and feed into each other in a way that is very clever and very engaging.   Recommend this to anyone (although the long page count does take a toll after a while). For it's length, the book did not ever really seem to drag. BUY this book! I went on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad that I did! Can't wait to get my hands on the sequel!
0143058525|5.0|Its read by the author, and is absolutly the best Ive ever heard. I look forward to listening to this agian and again.
