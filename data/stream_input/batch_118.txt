B00OTV8TN6|5|nice.<br />But KTM should deliver their bike with it (that's another story though...)
B00029WRKA|5|Works well.
B00M78820I|5|LOVE.LOVE.LOVE this product. Easy to use.  Has its own case. Cost effective.
B0019891NO|5|This is awsome . Worth every penny
B001TFE38A|5|Great results of you follow the directions
B00MHUINWS|5|absolutely love it!  Fits perfect and looks great.
B00IS93AGG|1|Don't even bother getting it they're not good don't get it  doesn't work
B00BCOH3M6|5|Good stuff! One week in and I feel bigger and fuller already!
B0013FSUD0|5|Exactly as described, perfect fit OEM, and with low price.
B005EJGSQ2|1|Didn't work. Had to send it back.
B0014BBFVM|1|Does not fit 87 300ZX turbo as advertised.
B00EZWQIJ6|5|Love it!
B006ZOGYUU|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Generator project. all my connections are made with SAE connectors. Sturdy and efficient
B00NNGJO4Q|5|White and really bright.<br />I'm very happy...!!!!
B000R2MT82|3|I been sick ,but now ready to have it programmed to my Kia spectra .My friend was going to do it now you say Must be done by Kia ,cnt afford that.Is there a way can do it myself...that's why give it a three.
B0002Q81WG|4|Good product and worked well with received plug
B00FGKGI2I|4|I am a a car guy and do my share of buying, selling, swapping. Like most men of &#34;my nature&#34; I keep my vehicles detailed as a hobby. I &#34;like&#34; this product, but do recommend you dilute it and use sparingly. I say dilute as it is &#34;strong&#34; and a little goes a LONG way.<br /><br />And even though I change cars more frequently than average, I do have a 17 year old pick-up which I have owned since it was new (actually ordered it to my specs!) and it has seen very few days when it was &#34;dirty.&#34; I recently noticed the headliner was &#34;sticky&#34; to touch and after some thought, have concluded the Chemical Guys &#34;New Car Smell&#34; is likely the culprit. So, using Griot's &#34;Interior Cleaner&#34; and a micro fiber I was able to get it clean, but I am now cautious when using the Chemical Guy's &#34;smell&#34; product sprayed directly onto fabric. Also, others have warned this product can &#34;spot&#34; hard plastics.<br /><br />Taking advice from a fellow reviewer of this product, I recently sprayed a few pieces of paper towel with this product ...

B007VWYJS4|5|Cheapest anywhere!!!!
B003CJAMFY|5|Chain works well just stretching little more than I like
B009R8QSKC|4|Installed easily on my 2002 Bandit 1200.  It had all of the caps I needed for installation.  I didn't use the bolts, just kept the studs in and reused the existing nuts.
B001GRN4J0|5|Every thing I expected.
B00EVFEBKU|5|Light and compact. Works as advertised.
B008HKOYDO|3|A
B00CPL926K|5|Have used it on my 2003 BMW 330i for 5 years, and I love it.
B007YH8C9S|5|When I couldn't locate one locally, Amazon was my next bet.<br />The bearing is accurate and fit perfectly. Longevity, we'll see.
B00068WNZG|3|I tried this on a new but badly spotted nickel faucet.  I had to rub and reapply a lot.  I don't know how much the faucet is at fault, but I was expecting better results, based on the reviews.
B00BBGMT7Y|5|This is amazing stuff! I never had use for this before last week when I bought my first ATV and first I bought something from my local motorsport shop and it was OK. This stuff knocks the Arctic Cat cleaner out. Will definitely buy again
B000WEOSNY|5|Excellent fit and great quality!
B00KCXMCTM|5|As described.  Ordered at noon and was at my doorstep 7 hours later.  Awesome!!!!
B006U44KU6|5|Fit prefect !! Got here so fast !!!
B000CNNGLK|5|As expected.
B0052FRRIG|5|Fast install, only wish they would include the screws needed. Toyota just screws into plastic, these handles need machined screws. The plus side is these handles will hold better, than the factory parts.
B0055PD1H4|5|works great
B0052FRX9E|5|Had no problem with install. Good sturdy handle, love it.
B0002FU44K|4|Works great, but runs out FAST
B000BQY82E|5|these things work great.  I dont know why they discontinued making it.  Gotta buy them while you still can
B003TQAQBK|5|fast and cheap.
B006YVTL04|5|As described and identical match to factory.
B000LUYLDQ|5|Fit perfect on my 2011 Audi A3
B00N2DKCIW|5|Wonder full
B003WZX7UA|5|Handy and durable clamps that I use every day and never let me down.
B001U8QP8W|2|this would be fine in the newer vehicles with smaller seats but not good for the truck that we are putting them in  ripped out at the bottom
B00RDMBTNA|5|I have a lot of tree sap I used thease to clean with and they came in handy it came right off I will recommend thease to anyone they are made with great material and they work very well and uses with all types of cleaners
B0055FFMGM|5|Thanks , my boyfriend loves them.
B00GD8CMDQ|3|The filter I received had hard plastic, not rubber, ends as other reviewers have stated. The washer didn't seal on my 2010 Mini Cooper S. I changed my oil and later noticed a large puddle of oil on my garage floor. The drain plug has a slight step between the threads and the sealing face and the washer wasn't able to fit/seal like the oem washer.
B00355MW0I|3|It DOES do the job once on the wall, but it is difficult to get it up there because the car roof hangs on the release handles and they do not want to stay in the proper position when you hold it vertical.
B006TMOP5E|4|good
B001J8OXL4|5|Love em.
B00DQ480NQ|5|I'm satisfied and help me to secure  my whls.
B00QMVKIEO|5|So far so good! Nice product! Easy to install! Follow directions and you'll be fine!
B003ESOAIS|4|I was a little hesitant reading all of the people saying these thing are easily defeated. Now that I have it, I must say that it will keep out all but the determined people who aren't afraid to make a lot of noise. You'd have to have a serious cutting tool and make noise for a while before you can cut this. If a thief wants something bad enough, they will get it. Think about it...if you are a determined house thief you could just simply smash someone's glass sliding door with a baseball bat. Same thing here...you'd have to be willing to take a risk to defeat this thing.
B000C560S4|4|good product, but it does not say it is a complete set, you are only getting the stuff for one side, so make sure you order two!
B00CJJ1YD2|2|Did not fit for a Lexus 93 300 gs
B002UNATVA|5|Ordered for a 1999 Toyota Avalon 3.0L V6.  Installation fairly easy.  Did not notice a difference on the power bill.  Thoroughly enjoy the speed at which my interior becomes warm (end of 1/4 mile driveway instead of 4+ miles down the road!)
B000UIY5TO|3|TYC HAS A QUALITY PROBLEM WITH VIABRATION WHEN BLOWER IS IN HIGH SPEED . THIS BLWOER # 2 HAS A VERY PRESENT NOISE  THE FIRST ONS HAD TO BE WARRANTIED ! I GOT THAT ONE ON EBAY. I DID GET A PROMPT REFUND.
B0007VM87K|5|Rear mounting brackets do not align exactly for '97 F250 crew cab.  Drilled more holes and works fine.  This set replaced an identical set that was used for 9 years with no problems but one side was damaged in a crash.  The 9yr old set still looked and performed well until crash.
B00BGH3UGC|3|Don't last very long on my dirt bike. I'm guessing more than 3 rides but they do have good feel
B00BUZC2C8|1|This product came cracked in two spots. Didnt know until installed cuz oul started dripping out a little. Very bad craftsmanship. Please send new one 1 day air as ill need it as soon as possible. Frigging oil is leaking out of pan and my car will seize up if this isn't resolved.
B00II5YADC|5|This is the fourth one I've bought and works the best out of any I've owned.  Can use it to get water off when washing your car and works great on the windows on dewy mornings.  The silicone blade works much better than those rubber or plastic blades.  Would highly recommend it.
B00GSAUHB8|4|This shade does work really well.  It is lighter and more maneuverable than others I've used and is easy to re-fold.  I like the soft material around the circles, as it is easy to tuck under the mirror and sun visors.
B00S0UWU7I|5|Fit my 05 Explorer perfectly. Fast shipping!
B00VEW34LU|4|Arrived on time and works well.
B00SAFQ0DI|1|They advertise as error free but as soon as I plugged them in my 2008 BMW 535i I got errors.
B00DSD58DA|5|This is the decal I was hoping for.  It is the permanent peel and stick decals.  Great size and vibrant color.  It stuck really well to the car with no air bubbles or signs of peeling right off.
B011Q18D14|4|This is a great tool for someone who wants the ability to diagnose common error codes without having to go out to the dealership. The main problem is that a lot of the time, this tool won't give you a description of the code. It will tell you what the code is, and the ability to clear it, but the research on the code is left up to you. Still, for the price, it is a very capable scanner, and is a must have in any home auto mechanics toolbox.
B000N9OE1E|5|Great price! Exactly what I needed.
B00BFE620M|4|bought for my nissan sentra but didn´t fit, my bad
B000HBNUDQ|5|Not used will update.
B002CMQZP8|5|Perfect fit. Just like the original.
B00KVVBEWQ|1|UPDATE: The unit has completely FAILED. It displays the name then turns blue and never starts.<br />This has to be the worst item I have ever purchased!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />It often can't find basic addresses that my Garmin finds with ease. It will route you around most useful roads to keep you only on the largest roads. The mount often falls because of the unit size/weight. You may have to buy another mount because of this and the plug location.<br /><br />It often changes routes in the middle of travel to side roads and then back to the main route for no reason.<br /><br />This unit is barely usable. It will frustrate you every time you use it.
B00RW4LNOE|1|Do not buy. They are not durable. Flimsy plastic. They refused to give me a prepaid shipping label to return their product. Would not recommend this for anybody.
B00VAVT1C6|5|great product for the price!
B00029X5WY|5|Excellent wiper at great price.
B0043AV4NK|5|Sounds great on my 99 nissan altima. So glad I purchased this item at a great price. Took the silencer off and it gave me the sound i wanted.
B00GXRJLOK|4|Great fit and look. Pressed in place for 45 secs after cleaning with isopropyl alcohol. No instructions in package so follow mine😉<br />I will buy some 3m transparent tape to protect the finish on the mirror caps that will inevitably take a rock hit and peel the finish off these plastic parts.  Manufacturer should include a small piece of film but hey, pretty cheap parts as is.  I like the look on my dark grey tundy!
B001FAI9PM|5|Perfect replacement for my old fenders. Exact fit without any problems.
B001EOWPOA|5|Just as described. Not much to comment on. I bought to replace my existing connector that had one bad lead. The markings on the connector made it for easy installation and prevention of connecting the wrong colored wires. No comments on durability yet but looks just as good as the one that was on there already.
B002ONTBMO|5|Nice.  Distinctive.  I label my work van and truck and Dads Taxi with my military history.  This way a thief will figure out that I'm not some whitebread hiding behind the bedroom curtain calling the cops; rather I am most likely right behind him with an aluminum baseball bat.
B007HH71GU|5|Radio reception seems similar in the city to the stock antenna which broke off in a car wash.<br /><br />The antenna really flexes when driving at highway speeds but seems solid.
B00N463T2I|5|Works as described and allowed the fitment of a Nardi style wheel to my Grant column adapter.
B00BLPOT0A|5|Put it on my 2009 Goldwing 1800 with new tires.  If you don't put this on your Goldwing you don't know what your missing.  Great handling, no vibration and better millage.  Note I also put a Superbrace on my forks.  Worth the price!
B000IG3JJA|1|You get what you pay for.  Cheaply made - only  lasted about 2 months.  inferior product.
B0031CFJUU|5|Fits perfectly---very easy to install!
B0000AXNMO|5|Works good for a couple months!
B002WSNHMQ|5|Great!
B000VU9D1G|5|good
B00DEQOQVG|1|Do not order these if you plan on receiving a complete set of 8
B00155MF1Q|5|Good quality
B00FFL82VS|5|A+++
B0049GHU2W|5|Awesome product and fits perfect.
B008GBBPY0|5|BMW, yeah
B008BR6UKI|3|This review is not directed towards the product itself, which appears to be of good quality and solid construction, but rather the fact that Amazon checks it as able to fit in my 2011 Infiniti G37, when in fact it didn't. Mind you, Amazon doesn't distinguish between the 4 door and 2 door version of this car, and I have the 2 door so that may be the problem. I don't have a 4 door 2011 G37 to try this out in for comparison. The dealership attempted to install these and simply found that the lights didn't fit snugly in the socket, so I promptly returned them. That's too bad, because they seemed like they'd do the job and are significantly cheaper than the factory replacements. If only they'd fit, and the list of compatible vehicles was accurate before I bought them!
B00M9NGDBQ|5|So, I wanted 12&#34; apes on my '15 Iron 883, but I certainly didn't want to pay the dealer to do it ($1000+!!). After finding all the info I could from Internet forums and YouTube, I decided I could do it myself. I'm no mechanic. It took me a whole weekend to do it, but I got it done and everything works. This kit made everything really simple and the instructions helped a ton. I didn't know how to solder, but YouTube and some practice wire taught me how. Beyond soldering those few wires, everything else is very straightforward. I purchased both the cable kit and Burly 12&#34; narrow bottom apes. I'm super happy with both and this kit was WELL worth the money.
B00UEVIYNK|5|Great siren for the price.  Wail and Mech. settings don't sound that great, but the others are good.
B006N957UK|5|Fit my 99 blazer, solved all my steering issues. I did all the steering and alignment myself. too easy and the shop wanted over $800 for less than $100 in parts and about 4 hours of work. I will never pay a mechanic to work on my vehicles.
B00L1EKGBM|4|Good fit and easy install. The only complaint is the wires sent were not long enough to pull through so I fused another piece of wire and went smoothly
B006QME5XE|5|Installation was simple with no problems.  Finished results look really sharp!
B00WW87PVK|5|Work great so far.  Easy to install
B005SB6S3Y|5|Worth every penny and fast shipping. Used ones are as expensive and not complete sets like this one is.
B00FWOKJYG|4|Is so good the light.
B003YJJHI0|5|very well made
B000MHNDSM|4|I can see the light,so I,m not sure this product are OK
B00DDMQDT4|5|Good thank you cheaper than BV oil products
B004SMGAJ6|5|Very heavy duty adjustable mount.  I think the truck will break before this mount would.  Can't wait to give it a try. I am using on a Silverado 1500 and is likely more capacity than I will ever need, but at some point I will upgrade the vehicle.  I also bought the Trimax TH43 lock set to lock the ball to the mount and the mount to the truck.  Fits well (meaning the locks are long enough) and is also a available at a great price like this Curt mount.  With the Curt 45900 you will have a very heavy duty mount that will likely last forever, just don't drop it on your foot - it is a very heavy piece of steel (25-30 lbs)!
B00H1NI8GC|5|Love it!  Nice and sturdy for something foldable!
B003DMFDM2|5|Solid sturdy rack. Installed and unistalled easily.  Took about an hour to install, 1o minutes to unistall.  Using it primarily to haul kayaks and canoes. It was a good buy.
B007S0FI8O|1|Terrible quality. After a few weeks outside the color went from black to a light caramel brown. Apparently parts for an outside vehicle that is meant for outside use can't stand more than a couple weeks of sunshine. Unsurprisingly, all my Rizoma parts (which are much older) are still completely black. $35 for two tiny bits of aluminum should grant you a little better anodizing and protection. Think SSR will stand behind the quality of their product? Nope.
B00GJI6Y3E|4|Product is good, but was not shipped safely which caused denting on the tire cover body.
B005H13BR6|5|The padding bulges a little, but it is so great to have a functional mirror again!
B005BTBEWI|4|Like it
B000LOLX2E|5|This was way heavier than I needed for my warn 3500# winch. It was also larger than the one that came with it.  That said, it seems sturdy and the extra size makes it easy to attach
B009DJXOZC|5|works good fit good now if it lasts
B00A6GHZ42|1|didnt fit as described
B0055PD1H4|5|Great stuff. Really helped my room mates van look a lot better
B0001L0DFA|5|Great!  Use it to water my lawn.  Thanks!
B001TD3NGU|5|An outstanding meter, just what I needed for my  outboard shop. Very easy to use.
B003L33Q0O|5|I bought this oil to use on my Makita chain mortiser.  Works great and keeps the chain nice and cool; dust and chips don't seem to stick to it, and it doesn't stain the wood.  I spray it down when I clean and put the mortiser up at the end of the day, and about half way through each day of operation.<br /><br />Also works great on the drive chain on my Woodmizer LT-40 sawmill.  Stays nice and clean and lasts all day!
B000C9H5DO|5|Works as stated
B001SGI7SM|2|Installed easy but not exact length of oem socket where connect meets. In order for it to work I had to half-connect headlight bulb into it which resulted in having to readjust every couple days. Ordered different kind & had no issues.
B00029WT0I|4|I bought this so that I could see when co-workers enter my cube. It's pretty much perfect, except for the fact that I doubt I'll be able to remove it from my monitor without damaging one or the other. But it definitely serves it's purpose and I would buy it again.
B008427D88|5|excellent value for the money, fast delivery
B007TQJTFK|5|Very Nice , Works Well<br />Great for seniors
B003BKRYTQ|5|He loved it and none of the lights have gone out yet as some of the reviews stated........but he sealed it real good
B00CGGCQXU|5|Exact repair part, reasonable price.  My mower was stuck going in circles because the cable on one side broke and the default brake position was on.  This part was a simple replacement and solved the problem.
B004K2FSXI|5|Well made and nice case. Had a Harbor Freight compression tester I used after rebuilding my snowmobile motor. Readings kept showing much lower than what they should for a rebuild. Not wanting to tear the motor apart to see if I did something wrong I decided to try a different tester. Found this one for a good price and had good reviews. Compression readings are all within spec now. Love this tester. It should last a long time.
B000ANOUHQ|5|The wife loved it.
B00PGQDYNI|5|Mounted easily on my handlebars and stay just where they were mounted, no movement or loosening at all. Others have asked if they were a factory mount because they look like they were built right on.<br /><br />Very pleased!!!
B00LNEZTCG|1|Front blinker Part # 264134BK  are a PIA and I still have hyper flash after re-installing by their directions and 3 different calls to their tech support telling me to cut my factory wires and swap colors around. I now have a rats nest of wires that looks like crap and they still have hyper flash. The install video on the website is for the 2 wire fender lights and has nothing to do with these. They suck 100%! I took mine out and trashed them, put the factory ones back in and still unhappy with all the splicing I did due to their sucky customer service rep telling me all the crap to cut and splice around.
B007PLZ5RA|5|I love this decal. I have gotten so many comments on it, and I make sure to park beside anyone with a stick figure family, or get in front of a vehicle with a stick figure family.
B00AZJYDQI|2|I carry a small compressor on my RV to keep the tires properly inflated so I figured this chuck would save me the effort of holding an air chuck onto the stem but it doesn't bite onto the steel stems on my tires...slips right off.  It probably clamps onto brass or plastic stems better.
B00HUG0JB2|5|Unbelievable, these actually work in my truck with WeatherTech rubber mats. The heavier the box the better they stay in place.
B001S80ZE4|5|Showed up in two days and I had it installed and working in minutes. works great.
B00TVUVCI4|4|Quality is acceptable. But since I am not a pro I can say it improved my dent but a trained eye can still find it.
B000C9WL6A|5|It filters oil likeafilter
B00KZJQ2L2|5|I bought this sun shade for my husband, he wanted one for his truck.  He absolutely loves it, and he didn't have any trouble at all folding it up.  I would recomment this sun shade to anybody that hates getting into a hot vehicle.
B003TY8WO0|5|The landyard looks fantastic. I wear it at work to hold my ID and I love it. I usually don't like anything hanging around my neck but anything for Inter and this is wonderful. Shipping was quick too.
B000CDAEAQ|5|These are perfect other than the white Valeo logo on them.  I don't deal with snow and hate the look of the single beam style wipers...these work as well as the more expensive Bosch brand I had been using prior to reading a review about these and taking the chance on ordering a pair.
B001TMAC42|5|fits perfectly
B00SWE2O6E|2|The quality of the product was fine but i mainly wanted this to slide in a 2inch reciever with ball to move my trailer around but since its the same size i had to weld a reciever on top of the other tube
B00CP8XXU4|5|Great
B0022ZN68Y|5|I paired this with Uni's foam air filter for my Yamaha XT. The aerosol is very easy to use, sprays evenly, and it seems to work great. No issues so far! The whole process of removing the old air filter, spraying and installing the new one took about 15 minutes. Awesome.
B0006H8P1S|5|Works Great!
B0055DNFMW|5|Works great, the only issue I had is the hook end was separated by about 3/8ths of an inch or so.  Might be so you can undo the strap but I have multiples of these and this is the only one with that issue.  Nothing a bit of spot welding didn't fix
B000V8WGIA|5|Fit very well. There before estimated delivery time. Very pleased.
B00HXC6M00|4|This thing is great when it works, which is most of the time. I am sure updates to the software continue to improve. The instructions are simple, but it is a bit complicated to get more than two riders connected at the same time. Things are quite a bit easier if you use the Cardo SmartSet app. If your headsets are already paired, it is pretty easy to add them to the group.<br /><br />If you are travelling with only two riders, there isn't much to mess up and it works great...as long as you can figure out how to get from intercom to music. I tend to use the voice commands rather than the buttons...that works most of the time, but not always.<br /><br />Overall, I like the G9x. I just hope the bugs continue to get worked out.
B002IX4M42|5|Love it
B00JAKN922|5|Good product , easy install
B000VTKUJ6|5|This jacket is awesome.  My fellow riders love it as well.
B00ZQ4X1CY|5|Feels great i recomend it .
B00OTVTDFO|5|Good quality and speedy service.  Much better looking than the stock. Perfect for my black cae.
B00AAXKQME|1|The carburetor was great, however I did not get my air filter and spark plug. What's up with that?
B00NGIE1TE|5|This works just as good as the OEM ford one. Now i can rest easy knowing that no one has access to my gas tank. Thanks!
B00ZHXAQAY|5|Very quick shipping! Excellent product. Exactly what I needed. Thanks!
B0002YVIDC|5|Great product for the price! Great seller!
B005UP39BC|5|Covers nice on my Honda 8hp, with the tiller. Seems to be good quality.
B00N0IHMXM|5|Handy little tool.  Makes adjusting trailer jacks a breeze.
B00IMMEX9W|1|THESE ARE NOT FOR THE REAR ROTOR'S as described!!!  Possibly for the front???
B000F5HUUI|5|Works great for most STANDARD valve spring setups also works well on small engine valve springs
B004HLWPO2|5|Just like new again
B00KSDSYAW|1|Terry cloth is extremely thin ... not particularly protective or absorbant
B004Z1JHZY|5|Fit great no adjustment needed
B00VVWZ9JI|5|Loved it
B00282YGA8|1|This wiper is too long for my 2013 Toyota RAV 4. I purchased it because the guide on the ordering page confirmed that it would fit. I discarded the packing material before installing it. I didn't have the car at my house as it was in the repair shop. When I got the car back I installed the blade and it hits the top of the back door overhang (rear brake light). Toyota wants $30 for the wiper. I guess I will have to pay that as all of the blades that Amazon says fit are 12&#34; and that is too long.
B000B68C0S|4|It fits OK I had one that looked like this one that only lasted 18 months - hope the name dorman means good however they are all made in Taiwan
B001E3GMAE|5|My husband loves them.
B0081HO96U|1|Nope it did not.  I haven't affixed it yet and probably won't because the adhesive is on the back of the decal so I cannot stick it on the inside of the car.  The adhesion should be on the front so one can place on the inside of the window.  Having to place it on the outside of the car will leave it to elements possibly leading to it falling off.
B001TZBQ0S|5|Works very well for drying vehicles without scratching.
B000VLHCA4|5|Great, but fit too long
B001PY9D2Q|5|Easy to install
B009DJMAZ2|4|Great price perfect fit little too heavy for box. Box tore and lost one of the clips.
B000C9JSBG|5|Perfect fit , works great
B00OTMIGEM|5|Great fit and finish, louder than stock but easy to live with daily. Unfortunately my 2002 Focus was totaled 3 weeks after I installed this exhaust, so my dad put the system on his 2005 zx4. This exhaust fit perfectly on my xz3, however the rear mount is too short on 05 and up Focus sedans, so a custom bracket was needed and the bumper needed trimming for a clean install. Works great, great price. UPDATE: I reinstalled the secondary catalytic convertor in place of the center pipe/ resonator assembly and lowered the exhaust slightly. This required using a bolt on 2 bolt adapter flange and cutting the catalytic convertor pipe to the same length as the center pipe. I also replaced the previously damaged flex pipe/ exhaust manifold/ primary catalytic convertor and upgraded the rearmost exhaust mount to lower the exhaust tip 2 inches, It sits too close to the bumper for my taste at stock hieght and I was concerned about possible heat damage. I also installed a silencer in the tip (required drilling 3 holes, easily done with exhaust off car in a vice), this lowered the tone to a nice deep purr, and it looks unique. It also passed emissions and inspection. MPG has remained high 20s and it feels a bit faster especially when merging onto interstates. With the new mount, the top 1/4&#34; of the tip is inline with the bottom of the bumper, and with the silencer exhaust gases are not aimed directly at the bottom of the bumper. The exhaust is much lighter than stock and fits firmly in the mounts.The tip sits 3&#34; lower than stock but has not bottomed out.  Listed below are links to additional products I used, total investment was less than $200 and it fits better than many $$$ exhausts ive seen. http://www.amazon.com/Pypes-Exhaust-HVH11S-Stainless-Universal/dp/B007ICD7GM/ref=sr_1_5?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1441134873&sr=1-5&keywords=muffler+hanger http://www.amazon.com/Inches-Muffler-Removable-Silencer-Exhaust/dp/B005CT935W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441135600&sr=8-1&keywords=4%22+exhaust+tip+silencer http://www.amazon.com/Exhaust-Collectors-Flange-Clamps-Replacement/dp/B00ZBEH058/ref=pd_sim_sbs_263_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=1FA0X6XJFAA22Q5V72QJ http://www.amazon.com/Pacesetter-752044-Direct-Fit-Catalytic-Converter/dp/B0094G31HK/ref=sr_1_17?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1441136132&vehicle=2005-54-679-------------0&sr=1-17&ymm=2005%3Aford%3Afocus&keywords=2005+ford+focus+exhaust+manifold
B000VKTUD2|1|It fit and was easy to install, but when the fan was on there was a vibrating/thumping noise from the filter. I think it was because the filter was more flimsy and with thinner edges than the one I replaced so the air passing through it caused it to vibrate.  The noise was unbearable with the fan on full and exceptionally annoying with it on medium speed.  I had to go to Pep Boys to buy a different filter for 2 1/2 times the cost of this one but no annoying noises. I would not buy this one again.
B00NIUQ5FI|2|This may be the right approach for relatively small scratches, but the youtube video on this product claimed that a bumper cover for a minivan could have full coverage with only 2 cans of paint.  Not even close my friend.  I ended up having to outsource the paint/clearcoat job for my car for another 200 smackers.  It turns out that the filler used in the spray cans makes the application very slow with a transparent end result.  If you are serious about refurbishing something on the scale of a bumper cover then you need to invest in a decent spray gun and air compressor.  Just another hard lesson learned in the land of &#34;Lie to make a buck off of the unsuspecting&#34;.
B008YFTNQA|5|Is good product
B00UM4VWW4|5|Loved this! Easy to use and looks great.
B007OX6E3S|5|I bought this product not sure if it will work on my old floor pump or not. I'm pleased to write that it worked great, and has allowed me to use my old floor pump on my presta tubes for my road bike. You just screw the valve onto the presta valve and then shove your old pump over the top of the adapter, and lock your pump into place. This product saved me from having to try to find a new tip for my pump, or get a whole new pump all together. I can now pump my tires up to a good psi without having to use my CO2 cartridges. I love this product.
B003NI6NTS|5|Changing the supports made a huge difference. The old supports were pretty much dead and I had to lift the very heavy and dangerous trunk that would decided to just slam down on me if I moved things around my trunk. I changed the supports (delayed delivery due to USPS not the seller) and the trunk pretty much lifts itself up now.
B0002JN2F4|4|This stuff is amazing. I used it in my 2001 Honda Accord Transmission and it definitely helps if you feel your gears are getting clunky. I'd say each can gives 2 applications.
B00GJKXW8M|2|5/12/16 I have three of these.  One mounted as a backup light on my truck and the other two as backup lights on my trailer.  One on the truck held up a few weeks then ½ the LEDs went out.  One of the two on the trailer got water in it within days of just sitting in the driveway (not I did not submerge it, or even drive with it at all and it was right-side up).  I was able to take the two on the trailer apart (removed the clear lens) and silicone it back on.  So far no water in them.  Note that you will do some damage to the finish when trying out the lens to remove it….but not too bad if you are careful. Build quality LOOKS good and they are quite heavy and feel sturdy.  At 6500k they are quite bluish – bright white in color as you would expect from 6500k…personally I don’t see that as a selling point. If you get them at the right price then it may be worth the aggravation to seal them up…..but that still does not explain only 3 out of 6 LEDS working on the one that has not shown signs of water in it….  UPDATE 6/10/17 One of the ones on the trailer has water in it again, despite silicone sealing the lenses on!  Only thing i can think of is infiltration where the wire goes in.  Took the lens off and dried it thoroughly.  Siliconed lens back on and did the best i could to seal the wire entry.  Lets see what happens....
B0015S2EY6|5|Bought these pads for '08 Nissan Pathfinder SE. Product was exactly as described. Perfect fit. Easy installation. Included hardware is as good as original. Brake grease package was a bit small, but I use different brand anyway, so to me the size of brake grease package is totally irrelevant. Performed proper brake burnishing after the installation, as per vehicle manufacturer's recommendation (50 km/h for 1 minute, then full stop in 3-5 seconds, repeated 10 times). It's been a few weeks since installation, no issues encountered with the brakes so far. I am not seeing any significant amount of brake dust on the rims, and I am not hearing squealing or any other sound coming from the brakes. I installed these pads on the original rotors with approx. 120k km on them. Judging by the looks of braking surface after a few weeks, I suspect that these pads are likely to wear out the rotors sooner than the original pads, however this is not something that concerns me, since I replace rotors after two sets of brake pads have been spent on them (we're talking 220k-240k km on two sets of brake pads). All in all, I am super happy with these brake pads. In my opinion, these pads are superior to Wagner Thermoquiet, and significantly better than Monroe Premium that I used on my other vehicle.
B00S0MRU9O|5|Im Happy
B0074BQY30|5|Arrived two days early and fit my 2005 dodge Magnum perfectly. You have to wire the halo rings and LEDs to the running lights manually it's not completely plug and play but isn't difficult even if you don't know what your doing!
B0002JN2EU|5|This stuff makes my scooter happy.
B000GV3CLC|5|Item is beautiful but unfortunately had to return due to actions beyond the sellers or my control
B000VAW728|5|Perfect replacement for the OEM part at a much better price.
B0022YBW40|4|Like all Kuryakyn products, these running lights are just what the doctor ordered. I wish I had known when I bought them that they would not match my Daymaker headlight. That is not Kuryakyn's fault; just wished I had known. Once I ordered the LED upgrade for the running lights and the LED turn signal lights, they setup it phenomenal. Only issue, and the reason for 4 stars is the bezels are a pain in the a$$ to remove and the tabs break very easily. Now I have to order another bezel. Would I recommend? You bet. Nice product.
B009EJ3JTW|1|DOES NOT WORK IN 2000 MERC VILLAGER. THE LINER IS TOO SHORT. I HAD ONE IN MY OLD VAN 18 YEARS AGO THAT I LEFT IN WINDOW FOR YEARS, THIS NEW ONE SAID IT HAS TO BE REMOVED EVERY TIME IT IS IN MOTION OR IT RAINS/ THAT ISN'T AN IMPROVEMENT. I RETURNED IT
B00NN2R74E|5|Fit awesome

B005SSJ712|2|The slam open the trunk too harsh
B00I9GPAT8|5|Easy to install, instructions are great, very straight forward. They said 3.5 hours, I did it in 2 hours (after studying manual and having all proper tools).
B0029XLN1Q|5|On a White Vehicle it's an Iconic standout, looks soooo good!
B00FPGJH7G|5|This item was delivered way ahead of schedule. They were very easy to install. Love them!!!
B009SPKUXK|5|Installed in my living quarters horse trailer.  Great faucet stem, very easy to install.
B005AU61HG|5|three months in no problems easy install
B007KPX68Q|5|Put this on a custom Bobber. Instructions could use some work. Product works great!
B00MT4F1DG|5|It survived the Cleveland weather! Just be careful with that scraper on the 6&#34; of ice. I did modify it and took run off. And still looks perfect. Thank you for making this! CLE
B000XY6XMM|5|nice
B000C2SBG6|1|This hose was about 2 inches short. It did not fit my 04 Dodge Dakota 4.7 liter pickup. Very disappointed. Had to buy an OEM hose for twice the price plus s&h. You get what you pay for.
B000BKC25K|5|ive liked it before now I'm hoping it last like it used to .
B00DCNOGCK|1|I ordered this because Amazon said it would fit my 96 accord, not even close. This axle is way too long
B00MB3IZWE|4|This is a well put together tarp!!
B00IUGFZE2|5|Works great
B0051VMIC6|1|So I was reading the description again to see if I could find the warranty since I've only used it for about a month but bought it late last year...  My bike wouldn't start again today and had to be jumped both this morning and after work.  As I'm reading some comments the freakin thing blew up while charging!  (It was on trickle charge and the gel battery setting like every gel battery I've ever had).  The inside plastic cap was moist when I took it out today and the core could be seen in all the cells...  Looks like I step up in price to something else...as should you :(
B00G70KGKQ|2|The Bumper it self does look incredible, however it does not &#34;come ready&#34; when it arrived, the packaging was damaged, there were multiple scratches, and despite the fact that it is for a 350Z, my shop told me that they had a lot of problems installing it. Adding a lot to the labor.
B00BER8Y42|5|perfect for, way easer to use with the tabs. excellent price
B00009W5HX|5|great
B00EFFZ8GC|5|Great product and price
B00186NGHO|5|really dressed up my new jeep
B00E1SN1FS|5|Put these on my brothers car 2 months ago.  I was surprised at how thick the rotors are, they seem to be better then the OEM rotors but time will tell.
B009VK4LFK|5|Fast and just as description. Easy to use.
B000WJX4BQ|5|Great battery and so glad that I didn't go with knock-off version.
B00IUWM59O|5|Fits my 2006 Hayabusa perfect even though it says it won't fit.
B008YU5REM|5|Omg! I just put the Gibson Exhaust in my 2015 Wrangler Altitude.  If you have a Jeep I highly recommend it. Easy install, really pull the old muffler off, and slide the Gibson on. The sound of this exhaust is the balls, nice and deep low growl. It really set you apart from the rest. I also got the Banks Air Intake, this really makes it a beast! I don't know how much the horse power increased, but you can feel the difference. When your talking about horsepower who cares about MPG lol.
B007V2B5AY|5|Bought this for my dad as a gift for his new 2015 Toyota Tacoma and he really likes it. This sun shade definitely makes a difference when it's up and when it's not... saves the inside of your car from being a ltitle less hotter than an oven when it's been sitting out in the sun all day.
B010UQI6CC|5|Great product.
B00AB2PBU6|5|Really great seat covers for the price. They fit my '14 hyundai elantra good. Pics included for reference. I already washed them once since a drink was spilled and they are still great.
B00F6GKKQC|5|Great Set - Works well.
B0041TOQ7E|5|Installed in 10 minutes, works and looks great
B00II5YADC|5|I bought one of these at Costco years ago and mine was getting old and wanted another one. Was so happy that Amazon.com had it. I use in my shower and it works awesome. Love it!!
B000IEVL10|5|Fits perfectly!
B007KCXUI0|1|This looks good but when I drove up behind my car at night the reflector does not shine like the OEM . Took off and trashed bought OEM..
B00MJ401WW|5|Fits my 04 expidition great!
B00QM0VDPS|5|Looks like it came with the bike. Great color matching and great price.
B00VB2OE9O|5|Great product and best price.cover fits like a champ. Fast delivery, good vendor
B0040MGZV2|5|Did whatever this thing does! Was probably the easiest thing to change on my entire truck. Don't pay anyone to put this on. (Unless it's me...then you can pay me of course!)
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great value
B00RTZPDDI|5|Exactly as the picture shows...... Comfortable!!!
B00GT3KEJE|5|Perfect, saved me a lot of money.
B008900BRU|4|In the end, this product does what it is supposed to do, but there are issues with the product and installing it.  First and foremost, the spacers themselves are good quality stainless steel construction that seal completely and do not leak once you get them in and tightened up.  They move the exhaust crossover to the rear by about an inch and a half, and lower it down about 3/4 inch.  The net effect is to allow the driveshaft to drop down to the point that it is limited by the stock constant velocity joint boot before the driveshaft ever touches the exhaust.  So, the product does what it is intended to do.<br /><br />The bolts that are supplied with it are not threaded far enough down their length to tighten up the exhaust connections,  I had to cut an additional 1/4 inch of threads on the right side bolts to get the spacer to tighten up and seal right.  If you don't have a tap and die set, you'll have to buy replacement bolts, or stack 3 or 4 washers on the heads of the supplied ones.  Don't see any reason the included bolts are only threaded for 1/3 of their length.<br /><br />The instructions say to slide the Y pipe further into the tailpipe to install the spacer; however, there is no room in the expanded section of the tailpipe to do this.  I had to cut about 1 inch off the back of the Y pipe to give it enough room to slide far enough into the tailpipe.<br /><br />Overall, a useful product at a great price point that is not all that well thought out.
B001CW4HOU|5|All components fit,worked as it said,and made job so look easy.
B0002JMF98|5|Great.
B003BGYRPO|5|Worked good
B0080JEKIG|5|Works perfect and saved money by dyi....
B00V6F023S|4|Smaller than expected but still VERY cute :)
B0002JMAKW|5|I have been using Castrol GTLMA for over 20 years in my cars and motorcycles. Excellent at reducing corrosion in the brake system. Since I started using it, I have never had a brake component fail due to corrosion or seal failure. Can I give it six stars?
B007AAZKDA|3|Solid helmet and well vented but a lot of wind noise.
B00AYCLB70|5|Good replacement clips for a 2010 Subaru Legacy GT.
B00NT5U52Q|5|Love love love love
B003RQBKLC|5|Product received was as described.
B000E3V9R6|5|Fit great in the cut out for my old power inlet.  I was afraid I might have to do some modification but this worked great.
B00WVGB834|5|Easy to install and look great, there may be need to adjust the lights before hitting the road. The grill fits good and also easy to install.
B0080KN7RU|5|:)
B009DJVY3Q|5|fits perfectly and my car rides really smooth again!! Absolutely love it!! Thank you
B00PS69DYA|1|not worth the money. broke the first time I tried to unlock it. JUNK.
B00I4L8LJO|5|Fast and good price,thanks!
B0002SRL20|5|Great heavy duty air chuck. second one I own for multiple locations You will not be disappointed if you purchase one of these
B002IV8TJ8|5|Nice product
B00KXHG19O|5|Fit like a charm!
B000CM3I2S|4|Fit Great!  Plastic shipping housing was opened upon arrival and the sticky tape that held the mirror to the cardboard backing was removed but luckily the mirror was still in one piece.  Cheap easy fix
B00CS407GS|5|Looks sharp on my Maxima.  You don't know they are there unless you look though.
B000UOC38S|5|Worked great on my 2008 highlander
B0041RPGQ6|3|Was as described but the bands to secure the seats broke not long after setting up.
B000ETQMIQ|4|I expected an XL trash can to be larger. It is about the size of a shoe box. Having 3 kids 4 and under we make a lot of trash so I was worried it would be to small. So far it has worked perfectly. I don't want to stick Velcro to the car so thankfully the weight has held it in place well enough. Thinking about buying another one to keep in the back so we don't have to pass trash around the van.
B008N68HLW|5|Great and Cheaper
B00275JKCK|2|Brackets don't fit in hitch, had to grind away material.  Disappointing.
B0002NIJOO|5|Looks awesome in my cowgirl truck
B00U6G8ICA|5|For the $$$$ spent, this is a five star item.  Keep in mind it is not a $500 ladder rack, it is a $100 ladder rack and an excellent value.  The design allows for flexibility of installation and once bolted together is very solid.  Yes, there will be some paint scuffs and scratches but they are easily fixed if that really bothers you.  You will still save lots of $$$$ by purchasing this rack.
B009CYB2YS|4|Awesome helmet would highly recommend it to anyone! I wish it came with a tinted visor!
B007JSGR9Y|5|It does what it is support to do helped me out a lot
B00AQ2OHFG|5|Makes a big difference is pedal feel. I don't ever want to to go back to a traditional line.
B00KSXW124|5|I haven’t had any issues. Same type of quality that came with my kit. These bulbs were better quality then some other online places I have purchased from before. Overall I am satisfied. The price was also good.
B002KS5GBS|5|For setting intake and exhaust valves on a URAL motorcycle... these are like having a third hand. Speeds up the process especially when leaning over between the valves and the side car. Good value
B00EPA7CZC|2|I don't want to retire the less I just want you to know all them but 4 work
B007VBJ6ME|5|Great price! Direct replacement for 06 jetta gli.
B00LD8PJ86|5|Love shopping here.  All the &#34;good&#34; things for your car.
B000CQOIVO|4|Very easy to install works great. Only down fall is the wheel swivels poorly. I used this item on my 12 foot fishing boat.
B00157TGXY|4|I like Valterra V23128 &#34;Pure Power Blue&#34; liquid but these are good &#34;snacks&#34; for the duration of the season.. I might just stick with the jug of liquid though.. The jury is still out.
B004AH4O9W|5|Works.
B007ZGBLNW|5|I Bought these for a guy at work. We drive tow trucks. the one I drive already has LED lights on it, His did not. We replaced one on my truck for over $100. We were worried these wouldn't work good but to our surprise they work very well. Just as good of light at a fraction of the price.
B000DINKPQ|5|This horn is exactly what I was looking for! Perfect
B006EGAIJ2|5|work for VW and truck  backup and forward
B00N5PLPD8|3|Daughter doesn't like it. Works alright though
B00KB8BREO|3|Difficult to use.  I bought to change the oil in my lawn mower. No instructions provided (not a big deal for me, but could be an issue for others).  Had trouble getting it to actually pump the oil as the tubing provided is quite long.  I cut about 75% of it off and it worked much better, but still not as well as expected.
B004I9XYIE|4|works great.
B0001WTY0E|4|Need magnets to hold it onto car in places or you will have bugs inside<br />Used on rav 4 2014<br />Worked well
B006PPM6BA|2|A decent product. Should be made from a heavier guage steel. Mine is bent a little but not enough to bother returning. It does look good.
B000VKTUD2|5|Save yourself some money and buy these filters. They are the same as the store ones but cheaper. I own three toyotas and use these with no issues.
B004HMBK5G|1|Not worth purchasing the clip will not stay snapped together keeps coming open
B00BL17A28|1|Mirrors did not fit 2009 Kawasaki KLR 650 as advertised. VIP did not offer to send the correct product, only a refund. What a waste of my time
B003FPF22I|5|Fast service - lights exceeded my expectations.  Thanks!!!

B0093XZDS4|5|Reduce friction by 90% on any mechanical device.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-bU6SByP0Y<br /><br />I sold the same formula years ago and found this reciently<br />on Amazon. Use sparingly. It works just as good.
B00BC1GL2M|5|working fantastic after 1 year in my volt. I have no complaints
B001KS6FPK|5|Save me at least 20 dollars to replace the rear wiper blade in dealer shop. Perfect fit.
B000UVUAFO|3|Be careful with this item. You’ll need a steady hand and not too much appliction because it will be hard to blend in and match with the rest of the paint.
B00HZB7DGQ|1|It was not trimmed evenly.
B0009IQWVE|4|works as expected
B00NBOSI0G|3|I've had mine for a year now, but I haven't used it much due to my former work schedule and now family obligations.  I bought mine directly from ProGo early last year 2015.  It was shipped to me in Guam via USPS.  The box had visible damages and some oil spilled inside.  The scooter sustained no damage.  Mine had persistent tuning issues initially.  After a thorough inspection, I discovered a defective air filter housing which I had ProGo send me a replacement.  The performance has much to be desired for a guy my stature(5ft.10, 235lbs.).  I always have to start out with a few kicks if I want it to accelerate quickly.  I wish it had more low end torque.  I was told many months ago of a seat kit in the works, but have yet to see that on ProGo's website progoscooters.com  It's built pretty well for the price point.  Just be sure to do a very thorough inspection of your ProGo before you even try to start it up.  Put engine oil as per manual's instructions, lube chain, air up your tires to indicated pressure rating, check chain tension, brakes, all bolts and screws, install propane tank(not supplied), and then proceed with a patient and careful test & tune.  Make sure you don't run the engine hard either during the break-in period.  Mine still runs fine, but again, for me, the jury is still out in terms of long-term durability due to my very occasional outings with it thus far.  I'll be sure to plug in more helpful info here as it comes. ACCESSORIES ADDED: Husky Round Toolbag from Home Depot(to hold extra propane) Nite Ize S-biner Latch from Home Depot(to attach toolbag to handlebar) Prefilled 16.4 ounce Propane Tanks from Home Depot Matching Green Safety Blinkers
B001CF53WW|5|Great
B008EJPHES|3|they worked
B001NZM6NU|5|Had an ongoing problem with a 2003 Ford Ranger, the vehicle would go over 2700 RPM before it started to skip really bad. This part seemed to fix the problem.
B00BAZCUZC|1|Update, Oct 2015: One of the bulb's went and I thought I'll replace it with a new one. I installed a new one but it didn't work. the old bulb was fine too. Apparently, it caused some sort of short circuit. I was told that it has to reset via software and the cost is $120. Just be aware that something like this can happen.  I guess to get what you pay for.
B0066TQEIG|5|Product works and is a fair price.
B006C9F33C|5|yes, perfect color match and fit.
B0002SR48G|5|Nice solid peace
B00L4QAEMI|5|I bought 2 of these, one for myself and one for my sister. We are both highly pleased with this decal. Looks just like the picture (our decals are white), and they look so nice on the window of the car. Definitely recommend this product!!
B008EEYTRE|5|I installed on a Odyessy van 2006 and it fit up very well and was good quality. It did have 5 blade pump instead of OEM 6 blade, but not sure that makes much difference. The parts seem good quality. The belt as was mentioned is not a Japan item, but it has worked and I trust the company hopefully to make a good product. The cam seals rarely need replacing, save yourself the hassle! If needed go get them at Honda.
B00L9F3FW0|5|The light is extremely bright and it works very well with nice patterns, it was very easy to run the wire to my liking. I recommend this product.
B0058ECLPK|4|These cutter work pretty good for cutting off the washers off a straight razor. I have another pair that work a little bit better but these are just fine.
B00H7MNXBW|4|Was OK,,,,& Liked,,by Person sent to!
B008HZMH1A|5|Perfect replacement at $33 as opposed to $154 at all of the local parts stores.
B00ERXG4TM|5|very simple but well made & works great on my fz09
B00KT1BH1Q|5|I got these for my 2001 Nissan Maxima. They work very nicely for the front doors and the marker lights. They do not fit on the instrument panel.
B004AGC2WE|5|VERY happy with purchase! High quality, smooth ride, great buy! Highly recommend!
B00JAHCGEC|3|Doesn't fit right...
B00U3O2HPE|5|Awesome' I'm loving it!
B0000AYFTH|5|A-ok
B000ZMWYFC|5|Works good, comes with two different strainers for different applications. I installed on a 99 f-250.
B003TKDOGA|5|Great as advertised.
B00N30R20U|4|S/M is too small for a regular person I would say. I play soccer and run, my legs are fir I guess...not gym muscles. Just didnt fit .
B008CIRJ9C|5|One of the best purchase for my truck. Keeps everything tight and snug for long travels. Just recently moved and the Bednet came in handy and worth the price.
B007USCM7E|1|I bought the A/C Pro Recharge kit as my 2010 F-150 just was not cooling as good as it<br />Once did.  The instructions were relatively clear; I did it 1st thing in the morning when the temperature was approximately 80 degrees; I paid strict attention to the pressure gauge and stopped when it was approximately between the lines.  It worked for a few days then quit, leading me to conclude that the problem was more involved than the refrigerant being low.  I took it to my mechanic, told him what I did and he told me that the “sealant” in the kit basically contaminates not only my a/c system, it also contaminates his equipment as well and that my entire ac system may have to be replaced as a result.  I looked online before using the product and saw nothing, leading me to conclude that this was a “safe” product to use….  Has anyone heard of this before?

B004JB0BSM|5|Definatly would buy again.
B002UC6VGS|1|We try to use this to clean our boat which had black streaks on the bow area which may have been caused from hitting the dock. This will not clean it
B004IYWGQU|5|Just did both the hot/cold blend door and the floor ceiling door on a 2003 Ford Expediation.  Both if you can believe it took just over an hour total.  No need to take all the molding off, just pulled back the piller trim and pulled out the cup and tray holders and pulled the molding out.  Tight space but with a small wrench and my finders took off 4 screws on each, pulled them off and put on the new ones.  I had unhooked the power for both years ago, to get rid of the clicking.  Wish I would have spent the 47 bucks for both years ago. PRIME free shiping and two days had both in my hands.  Dealer wanted over $400 to diagnosis, remove and replace both.  Amazon, Dorman one hour and $47 bucks later up and running again.  Its day 1 so I hope they last
B00QK0NXIK|4|Very nice. Shipping was a little late but the quality of the goods was great.
B009X7V154|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B000VUEDYI|2|Doesn't really do any good without the custom spade terminals that would fit into it. (not included)
B00290UKEU|5|Perfect fit works great keeps the car cooler on hot days... And they look cool.
B007NLQO0O|5|You can't go wrong with OEM parts.

B008J0SJ42|5|These look identical to the original and appear to carry Volvo markings same as the original equipment. Have not installed them yet. Will install during next tire rotation.
B0065KKXL0|5|Great product!
B00DZ357ES|5|Great affordable product! Fast shipping!
B001VZL2MI|5|I purchased this primarily for the towing and performance modes, but the only way to test it objectively is using the mileage mode. I did just that, and was very impressed! I don't normally care about mileage, or I wouldn't drive an SUV and a sports coupe, BUT...I was able to measure a significant increase in mileage, from 17.9 mpg at 60 mph to 21.7 in my Buick Rainier with 5.3 liter V8 and AWD.  This was on fairly level roads using the cruise control, with temperatures in the 90s. Just as importantly, I can feel a real difference in the responsiveness and acceleration using the performance mode and running the required premium fuel. Shifts are firmer but smoother, and it is easy to chirp the tires when the light turns green if I forget it's in performance mode. I recently towed a U-Haul trailer 800 miles from Virginia to Michigan, through the mountains of Maryland and Pennsylvania using the tow mode and premium fuel, with no problems and none of the hunting for the right gear on long uphill sections that normally occurs with automatic transmissions. It pulled strong and I had no problem keeping up with traffic at speeds of anywhere from 60 to 80 mph on the Interstate, with no hesitation driving around town either.
B0086ZN7XI|4|Attaches to the post of a 2015 Subaru Forester OK.
B00YE5Q0Q0|5|Excellent product! Solidly built. This item incorporates more than 4 items in one compact unit.A jump starter, phone/laptop charger, flash light and hazard light. I have tested all the features except for the car jump starting capability.Hopefully I wont need it but just in case this is always in the trunk of my car.I made a more detailed unboxing video on my youtube channel (PNYprepper).
B00LAEEFCY|4|seems to be a good deal
B008BAAIP8|5|Love them. Perfect fit with easy install. Changed the look of the car
B003YLIGI0|5|The only gasket that fixed my leak...
B004VGAJOG|5|exellent
B00AFSX41Y|5|It's just what I ordered. It fits my two barrel Holley perfectly. No more fuel spraying all over the front of the engine which is always good.
B000E4SQIA|5|Very pleased with part,no more speeding tickets.
B00MBB9YWG|5|I was very impressed with the sound quality. Callers on the other end couldn't hear any background noise and heard me very clearly. Music playback is great even at highway speeds.
B000MIUHS0|4|These are good for the price, but if I ever need more I would opt to spend a little more for a bit higher quality. They haven't broken yet, but every single time I open one to put glasses in or take out it feel like I'm going to break it.
B00KV15KAS|5|my son is very happy with his gift.  it is as pictured.
B00DYXEP24|4|Great overall cleaner/protectant for just about everything!!
B00IGPMZB8|5|I LOVE this!! I bought 3,in different colors, for myself and two fine Arts teachers, as we begin our Lion King jr. Production.<br />The vinyl is great, easy to transfer, no problems!!
B00PTNUXRI|4|weird at first but fits great after wearing a couple times came fast I like it a lot
B00XBUK19Q|5|Good
B003POJ1DU|1|Arrived with one mitt damaged.  Griots CS agreed to replace the pads as long as I paid for shipping to them.  Lol.
B000AS3D3I|5|OEM what can you say?? worked as it should
B00DP7KYBU|4|Perfect fit on my 91 c1500 Chevy, safe and good timing with the shipping process
B000EH0ORI|4|This does work as described. HOWEVER, the hose gets stiff in the cold weather, so if it is stored &#34;coiled&#34; , It is difficult to work with.
B00FW1QVX2|5|Looks great and great quality. Summer and winter still looks new
B00LEBLI82|5|Perfect replacements for our RV. Provide warm light. LEDs last forever and they don't get hot like incandescent bulbs do. Will be great for summertime!

B00F4E1PU6|5|Amazing price
B00B1Z8XOS|5|Absolutely love it! Great quality! Looks great on the back of my Jeep window :)
B00D329DI2|5|very nice
B0091OE6K6|5|If you are a busty gal you need to but this product ASAP! Trust me, it will make being in the driver seat so much better. You know what I'm talking about. The way the seat belts ride up and strangles you. Its terrible! Cars are definitely designed by men! This is the second time I buy these. Great to always have an extra one. Sometimes they do snap off and break, but hey, for such a cheap price... being able to breath while you drive is worth much more, don't you think?!
B001RUJO72|5|Great way to help reducing swirl marks on your paint.  You need to buy two of these and use the two bucket system.  One for cleaning your sponge or rag with clear water, and one for soaping your sponge.  The grit guard helps by making it hard for your sponge to contact any grit that fell of your sponge and settles to the bottom of the bucket.
B005PK1EAK|1|How is the Velcro going to do anything in a crash? Worthless product.
B001ABPKUS|5|fit good serves the purpose
B008IXN4RW|5|First package got lost in the mail but the seller sent a prompt replacement.. Excellent service, and works just as described.. My father had been trying to clean some soft leather products and nothing else worked as well.. Thank you!
B0031GY3MQ|5|Part arrived pretty quick. My husband had no problems putting it on the car. Fit perfectly!
B00EHIPS9Y|5|ok
B003ZNXGKA|5|Very happy with this brand. I had another pair not purchased from Amazon and junk right of the box. Instillation on these is simple and the quality is as good as factory. They look good and fiction great.
B006765OL6|5|I was looking for an inverter to run a Keurig coffee maker, and some other less heavy loads, that wasn't a heavy draw on batteries when not in use. It only draws 0.3 amps with no load, so I can leave it on 24/7 without worry.  I use it with my Solar setup.  Of course, it has the draw backs that you would expect with any modified sine wave inverter, buzzing with some electronics, poor efficiency with motors and microwaves ect..... But it's quite efficient with loads like lights and coffee makers, that don't care how clean your sine wave is.  Know what your buying, and you'll love this inverter.  The fan rarely kicks on, and it's very quiet.  It's a great price and seemingly well built.  I've only had it a day, but if I do have trouble, I'll report it here.
B00C4B18JU|5|this product fit as i expected. it is Made In USA, so its a bonus. Fits my 2015 RX350 base model.<br /><br />the installation of the hitch itself is so simple. the part i hate the most about the installation of the hitch, any hitch for that matter, is to put back the plastic cover underneath the vehicle. i spent more time putting back the panel than the time it takes to install the hitch.
B00EOX2KZ2|4|Good quality product. Shipped with no packaging - arrived a little scuffed up but not damaged.
B0019M3FGY|5|we like it a lot. had one before and it wore out.
B00USU3XEM|5|Perfect! It put dept on my car. Highly recomended :)
B00V3MKZ18|5|I hung this outside my deck so people would know which door was ours!
B003VAUG5A|4|Difficult to seal for compartment install.
B0024ECJSQ|4|OK
B004X96DKK|3|really black but<br />didn't use it to cover scratches<br />it only car paint give very thin coat not a filler for any scratch
B009XZW0CY|5|I love these caps. Very cute and stylish.  Only problem is my husband took it for his car haha. I have to order same style again.They also fit perfectly.
B00DQJA5XO|1|bad signal strength
B002UD0GIG|3|Ehh, works alright at polishing but didn't take out big scratches.
B000O867R8|5|good
B009PAK75E|2|They are nice and soft however really hard to install on my Juke's seats and the head rest covers are huge for the size of the head rests. Price wise they're great but I wouldn't buy from them again. Sorry not a very good product at least for the Juke
B00GN31QGU|5|direct fit, works great
B0082365AQ|2|Tires won't stay inflated.
B00X2TUW1I|4|So far so good!  Love the idea no suction cups.  Wish it was a little bigger as I bought the SUV size and still does not fill the window as much as the package indicates.  However, not sure if I really need any better.  Will see how it holds up in super hot weather if stays stuck, but like it much better than the film or the pull down shades.
B00JIHC36K|5|My god these are bright. I love them. I've used LEDs from superbroghtleds.com and diode dynamics and that's blow them both away. Very very happy.
B00TPKKS3A|2|Ordered part at a exceptional price. $35 was a great deal but to good to be true. I got the starter installed and lawn mower started up. After roughly 20 starts the starter would not disengage quick enough. The gear is guided to the &#34;fly wheel&#34; on the mower. The gear stays in the engaged position and grinds on fly wheel. Replaced the starter no longer have the issue.
B006RW5NNY|1|The hardware to install this is shinny metal not flat black. I had to go buy flat spray paint so you would not see it thru the grill otherwise it looks tacky.
B001P2D9K0|4|No problems with product itself, delivery service was horrible in transportation however. Had to knock out 3-4 decent sized dents
B00N2X8ETQ|5|Heavy Duty! Love it!
B00AQAQI6E|5|Excellent product.
B00FHJZPEU|5|Great helmet!
B000OQHRZ6|5|everything was fine and timely
B00IG35KRG|5|I have 5 dogs. No &#34;biggie&#34; on the general wear and tear of a cargo cover.....except 3 of them are Great Danes, and have strong nails. This cover not only fits perfect, but extremely durable!
B00O97CWD8|5|Easy to put in, didn't smell like rubber. Keep my car clean and easy to clean.
B010AK81IM|1|do not buy its a scam.
B006JTU14Q|5|Simple and effective  The necessary parts can be bought at your local car store cheaper.<br /><br />Sure am glad I did not buy the fancy devices to do this
B000C57UQK|5|Great product
B00029JKC8|5|best one i bought so far. easy to install and works greart!
B00KTHYA1O|5|Worked perfectly the first time. Very happy.
B0002NYDZ8|5|Have another one of these. Use on the tractor.
B00FYX21SM|3|Bought for a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. There was a menu option to check if this was made to fit a specific vehicle. It came back saying &#34;yes this will fit your 2015 Grand Cherokee&#34;.  When it arrived it was nice clean and does not have a chemical smell. It does fit in the Grand Cherokee but is not fitted for the Grand Cherokee.<br />It requires a little trim on both right and left sides ( easy to do with the lines in the design of the mat). The issue I have is: the mat is too short depth wise.  It is wide enough to cover the cargo area but you will have to decide if you want the mat to start at the rear seat backrest and leave area exposed near the rear cargo door or vice versa.  (Area exposed about 6&#34;-8&#34;)<br />But it is what I expected for $26.
B00475X7F4|5|Love love love this helmet. Comfortable with good ventilation.  Replaced cheek pads with thinner ones just so it fit my face better.
B00YGBNIPI|5|This product is fantastic! It's exactly what I was looking for, a part to replace the worn out case of my 2007 Prius smart key. My smart key functions all worked, only the buttons had worn off and required some effort to press. A new smart key can range from $110 upwards of $200 depending on where you purchase it, plus reprogramming fees (if you can't figure out how to do the &#34;chicken dance&#34;) This is the far more practical and economical solution.<br /><br />I’ve included photos of what you receive in the bubble wrapped package, the 3 plastic parts plus (not in the photo) a small bag of replacement screws for the battery cover. There are no instructions with the case, just the parts.<br /><br />If you need to know how to open the cover to get to the internal parts follow this YouTube “how to” video, BUT BEFORE YOU START please read my notes below...<br /><br />Remote Control key (FOB) TEAR DOWN 2nd gen PRIUS 2004-2009 disassembly<br />https://youtu.be/LvjPG_a7Jyg<br /><br />You'll need a case-prying tool, and a small phillips screw driver (size 0) I used my NewerTech tool kit, which has these and plenty of other useful tools for these kinds of projects. You can get one here on Amazon at the following link:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00FPUGN2O NewerTech 14-Piece Portable Toolkit]]<br /><br />The YouTube video suggest the use of superglue, I would strongly recommend that you DON’T use any glue, the friction joints hold the shell together just fine without the use of glue. Also, instead of using a knife along the edge to open, using a case-prying tool is safer and it was sufficient to open my old shell. (a small flat head screwdriver will also do)<br /><br />Nothing about this operation requires great force, if you find yourself exerting force on this project, stop and watch the video again on how to open the case, being sure to note the need to slide the key release when removing the case cover. The prying of the case open was not very hard, I found the easiest entryto open the seam around the case was to place the prying tool into the slot where the key normal goes and applying light pressure upward, you should hear clicks and small cracks as the plastic friction clips separate.<br /><br />As noted by the seller you’ll need to transfer your electronic parts and battery from your old fob, making sure to note that you’ll need to remove the small grey sensor at the forward tip of the case (I included a close up photo) as it’s the SMART part of your key fob that is identified with your car. A simple tap on a tabletop was enough to get these parts to come out of the old case.<br /><br />Take your time, don't force it and best of luck!
B001JSYCDI|5|These are great. I also copied someone elses idea, to put the soft side of velcro on the metal. They did not scratch the window, but rattled a little.<br /> I have had shoulder surgeries to each shoulder, and this added support, really helps!!
B008GTKOU8|5|Great product from NRG, way better than a 2.0, I recommend this. This thing is beautiful in my car along with my NRG steering wheel
B00Q0TIGSS|4|MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE .  YOU CAN SEE THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS WELL AS STRAIGHT AHEAD.  WE ARE VERY PLEASED!
B004EIAADG|5|I purchased this to take my CPAP camping, and it worked exactly as I wanted it to. Ability to charge my phone is a pleasant bonus. I did purchase a separate DC adapter for my CPAP.
B006O0CJTK|5|Thanks, worked perfectly!
B004GCCKSI|5|Awesome product you guys are the best thank you
B001F0NNA8|5|Easy to install just had to paint
B000EW0KHW|5|works very good thanks.
B00AZAA1K4|4|It blows, like it should.  Great for filling ballons or drying the dogs ears.
B0006SH4NC|3|It's okay but doesn't seem as strong as a lubricant as what came with the Meguiar's clay bar kit
B0072ONV3K|3|Works okay.
B00GD8OL62|5|Bright and pair nicely with LED fog lamps on 14 silverado
B00029J3MA|5|Great flowing muffler with a loud aggressive tone.
B00164RJCG|5|Excellent fit perfect

B001JT34MW|5|Strong magnet, stays put, great product
B009VDURXW|5|Great, just as described, fast shipper
B000COMXI6|5|You want to get tire pressure readings from truck tires or RV , then this is the tool. Milton makes excellent equipment. It is good sized and would be overkill for cars and bikes. Works well on my motorcycles rear tire which is difficult to reach. Recommended where you need high pressure readings.
B000F5ECUY|5|This tool has a very good design, it is well constructed, and it feels solid. I used it to install the valve spring keepers and it worked great for that. The first few valves took a bit to get the hang of things, but by about the fourth or fifth one I was flying through them. To properly set it up I began with the clamp screws backed out to a safe distance, set it over the valve face and retainer, closed the handle, then took it off and adjusted it. I adjusted the two screws to have roughly the same amount of threads on either side. When the closed clamp just touches the valve retainer I found that 6-7 additional rotations of the valve face side screw was all the adjustment that was needed. With it set up, to use it position the valve face side first and hold it roughly in position. Then guide the cup portion while giving the handle a good squeeze. If you have trouble with the handle then back the screws out a bit further, lock the handle down, then screw the bottom screw if needed. To remove, back the bottom screw down slowly 6-7 rotations while being mindful of the keepers. With it off, re-position the screw and continue on with the next one. The one drawback is the rubberized handle. Mine kept sliding down while pressure was applied to the handle.
B004A2D4N4|5|Simple to install works great!
B000H6W42Y|5|If you have a Ford F-150 you definitely need this tool, works excellent.
B00A02FWOM|5|It's a water pump. It does include new bolts and a gasket which is nice. It seems well made. Some water pumps are made with plastic fins but this one has metal fins. It fits just as it should. No issues.
B002JBXD4I|5|Fit my wife's Mazda Tribute perfectly, gives the SUV a very good look.  I did have professionals install it.
B008KZKDYA|5|Exactly what we needed.
B0009H51MG|5|It does the job. The price is right. Even comes with photo instructions on the box... if you need that.
B007IVSJHU|4|Almost exactly what I was looking for. They fit the design for my truck, and are functional. It's nice to not have to worry about being stopped for not having side view mirrors. The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is due to the fact that they don't seem to rise up. In, out and down all seem to be within these mirror's range of motion, but I'm afraid I'll break them if I try too hard to move them up. It's a slight hindrance, and easily overcome by adjusting myself in my seat, though.
B008B91TWA|5|Fast delivery, lived up to my expectations, fit the bike great. Really nice addition to bike. I would highly recommend these.
B000KL742Q|5|Perfect fit in Rav4 2011 JPP.
B00CMP7S9W|5|Great product. Without all whistles and bells this booster worked on my truck when two othe more expensive 1150 units would not turn the starter
B00KY8E734|5|The cases fit perfectly.  After weeks of searching several auto shops to find the proper case for my CTS remote control key casing, I finally got the right one through an order with Amazon.
B0048ECMDM|4|I like it
B000CAINEI|3|OK
B00979N8FE|5|Great Product and great service..
B0002M9RH8|5|Yep Hella Good

B00E97OKC4|4|Nice
B00JN6JOI6|5|Replaces Sea-doo OEM part 204470464 and 278001431.  Used for my Sea-doo Challenger 2000.  Fits perfect.
B004W5TXKW|5|perfect match !
B0009H519Y|5|This stuff is magic! I used it to polish up all the parts to my Glock 23. While I worked on the each part it was amazing. As the felt tip on the dremel started buffing you could see it almost instantly change to a mirror finish. Now my gun cycles perfectly.
B00RC7X4HA|3|Ordered two - one was awesome, the other off-center. Thus, the 3-star rating
B00BTLEIIY|5|Fits perfectly in my wrangler 2015
B004NJIAPG|5|Nice quality, have only used once and it worked flawlessly. Hoping it is durable-looks like it should last. Fits perfectly in pouch on BMW jacket
B003YYW78W|5|I love this and think it's funny. Suits my driving.
B0088USCPO|5|Worked excellent
B00JVHLS3G|1|Don't waste your money
B0016IKXL6|5|Part arrived on the day it was scheduled to. It is also and exact replacement AC Delco part. Thanks,
B0002F66G0|5|Good Product Great fit, Shipping and packaged well.
B00CZD7QOS|3|it worked ok but , no miracle  on white paint anyway. was easy to apply.. and did help..may be better on other colors
B00V6R30LW|5|Worked just fine.
B003TQ9VNY|5|Fit well. Its a piece of exhaust, and does what it was designed to do, not much to review.
B00NGOY54E|4|easy to install but expensive.
B007SCPHL0|5|Great product. Fits perfectly
B00JRFPPCC|4|Good value for the price...
B00CTVN3DY|2|Keeps falling
B00WOY33EA|5|Excellent product. Fixed my doors in about 2 hours. Had to kind of figure out which one went where. An short diagram would have saved me about 20 minutes.
B005UGEB6S|5|This is absolutely one of the best made products made for your PWC.  I was blown aways with how good it was.<br /><br />Truly this is an A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ product<br /><br />Unfortunately, my trailer was several inches higher and I thought the length and width of the bunks wasn't suitable enough to secure my three seater ---2004 Yamaha Waverunner Cruiser HO...................so I returned it back to the seller.<br /><br />If this company offered buyers options to get the cart built to buyers requests and to the specs of their PWCs.....then this company in my mind will produce the best PWC stands and products in the world.
B000C2WF9A|5|Really works nice, locks and unlocks smoothly!
B00LW5ZAZM|5|Perfect !
B00JVWDWPS|5|Recently installed in my 2015 Sahara Unlimited Hardtop.  Love it.  Install was a peice of cake took about 10 minutes after piping the hardtop off and setting in to the side.  Top reinstalled with no issues.  Freedom panels come in and out with ease.  No more sunburn while sitting on the DC beltway and 95 south anymore.  Great product.
B007R6L89C|1|Doesn't fit and can't use the product without major modification, longer than factory length. 350$ paper weight
B00B4HWIRG|5|After my first ride the &#34;I'm Grumpy&#34; fell off. I sent the seller an email and after a photo of the frame they sent me a new one. No issues with the replacement frame, love it.
B0002NIJWG|5|Fantastic product. Thanks
B001GJ9JLA|5|Great for erasing chalkboards!
B00KQTH95E|5|Worked like a charm on my GS500, took me all of two minutes to install
B0022UP9V6|5|So far this has held up great over a month of use and met all of my expectations.  In the past I've had covers with multiple straps and they were a pain to put on.  I worried that this cover's since elastic band running around the perimeter combined with one strap wouldn't be enough to hold it on my bike securely.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this cover stays on my bike.  I have a WR250x and was a little unsure of what size to get.  The medium fits perfectly, but I think if I had the stock mirrors on it still it might not go down far enough over the wheels.
B00B1WBPDC|2|I have a 2007 AP2 Honda S2000. I know I hooked the kit up correctly as it's pretty straight forward. The results: I can have high beams but no DRL's and the DRL warning indicator on the dash will remain on; or I can have really nice DRL's but no use of high beams. iJDMTOY were helpful but the issue could not be resolved and they wanted me to send them a video of the problems which makes no sense to me. The kit should give you DRL's and the ability to use the high beams per iJDMTOY!
B000F6F99G|5|So glad I bought this to replace the hanging tennis balls.
B00J4P64CA|2|These are not the correct size.  Yes functional you do lose about 1/4 inch of the outer pad surface. they do function as a replacement, but if your seeking the proper fit you will be looking for the Size to be- 322x24mm (12.7&#34; x 0.9&#34;)
B00266F2K4|5|Can say anything bad... Fits perfect works great
B00BF8N6Q6|5|perfect fit!
B001DRHMMS|4|Fits BMW e90 model perfectly. Everything is similar to the OEM product. It only smells weird for a while when you just change the filter. I am not sure if it is the case for the OEM filter too.
B00JR3RYBE|4|It works. It's loud too. It does not come with bolts, washers or nuts
B00X5TM1Z0|5|This is a review of Smart Car Kit  Car Air Purifier provided by Ecomventures Global......<br /><br />Product Description<br />Size: Large<br />No matter indoors or outdoors, the air pollutants are threatening our health, weakening and damaging our lungs. Asthma prevalence raises year by year and more and more people are diagnosed with breathing-related issues. There are many ways to fight the air pollutants in your car, such as cleaning out the dust and spraying febreze. However, this is not enough for dealing with the invisible PM2.5 air pollutant particles, virus and bacteria, benzene and formaldehyde let out by the decoration materials. To guard your health against air pollution, Ionkini has invented such kind of car accessory that utilizes negative ion technology to improve the air quality without doing any harm to human body. Besides, negative ion which can activate cells, enhance immunity and relieve tiredness, is beneficial to drivers. It is not only a health protector for you, but also a great choice for gift.<br /><br />CAR IONIZER is an innovative patented product that begins its magic as soon as it is plugged into your car cigarette lighter, improving air quality and removing unwanted smoke, odors, pollen,air propulsion, dust and more. Known in many cases to benefit sufferers of the following: Allergic Bronchitis Allergic Sinusitis Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic respiratory tract allergies<br />PROTECT YOUR SMARTPHONE FROM Over-load, Over-voltage, Over-heated, over-current and short circuit protection.<br />Fashionable Unique Design Car Air Purifier with 4,000,000pcs/cm3 Negative Ion<br />Universal USB Car Charger keeps your important devices fully charged with an impressive 2.4A from each port (4.8 total amps)<br />Car-Ionizer uses an electrical charge to produce stream of negative ions which then remove microscopic particles from the air, improving the air quality in your car. An ion is simply a particle that is charged, either negatively or positively. The ionizer creates negative ions which seek out positively charged particles, such as dust, dander, bacteria, pollen, mould, smoke, chemical vapours, and other allergens. Once the positive and negative ions are bonded together, they become too heavy to float, and no longer affect the air quality of the surroundings.<br /><br />This is something that I have needed for awhile, I am a smoker and my husband is not and needless to say he hates the smell of smoke. So now I am able to use this purifier in my car so when he has to drive it to the shop or to clean it up the smoke smell is not so strong and he does not fuss as much about the nasty smell. This has made my life just a little easier and his time in my car not so over barring. Disclosure: Product was provided for review, thank youatively or positively.

B00HTP8N0I|5|nice straps came quick
B004MZ1O9U|5|I tried using a Ford Driveshaft tool for my Ford Ranger's drive shaft bolts but the damn thing broke.  I know this isn't advertised for that kind of use but it worked great with a 1/2&#34; to 3/8&#34; drop down adapter and a breaker bar.
B005CLLNM6|5|Fits like a glove!!
B009J7E5BA|1|DOES NOT FIT FORD GT Mustang.  Look at plug not even close to the right size.<br /><br />1 star is simply because it WILL NOT WORK on car advertised for. Fix this and delete
B000IYHTSE|1|The worst brake pads I have ever put on any of my vehicles. They have no bite and are very noisy. I know ceramics are usually not as grabby as conventional pads, but these are especially bad.
B00UZW4X24|5|Looks great and arrived three days before the arrival date. Applies easy and sticks really well.
B000C9WJ2Q|5|Fit my 03 Trailblazer EXT, it has a compartment for it that you can install both filters...
B00TQZK5ZA|1|looks cheap and has some quality issues with seams. Be careful. Shop Heroic places a misleading ad here. The Wetsuit Seat Covers they are selling are open box, but they don't explain it on their product web page.
B00DMA87BE|5|work perfect in maxima1998 se,it is more useful if has a install description.
B008VNSLWM|4|I bought this regulator a month ago it fixed my problem still working perfectly fine.
B000NVW1LM|1|I had a small leak at the timing chain cover on my 2003 Jaguar, S type.  After using AT-205 I now have a very large leak.  I am so very sorry I purchased and used this absolutely useless product.  Instead of a couple of drops of oil, I now have a puddle.
B00M9K3HYU|5|This is going to be PERFECT for when my son starts driving!!!! LOVE THIS!!!!
B002MESVUI|5|Perfect fit!
B00B2AFT2G|5|Work perfectly on my 1998 XJ, with a 6 inch lift
B001GEO0ZA|5|Perfect fit and good quality.
B007XXA5HA|5|Very nice quality, not cheap plastic or metal
B000VKZNVA|5|This muffler did fit my 2000 lw1 saturn perfectly the install took only about 45 minutes.  would have been less if the last owner hadn't welded the last one on. It is very quiet but I think the old one was going when I got the car so I can't compare it to the original. A little pricey but hopefully the stainless will make it last as long as the car does.
B00V3MA3ME|5|These look great on my new car!! Yankees Baseball Forever!!
B00HJS6HAI|5|Perfect fit.  With no hassle
B00SCG9TD8|1|one stopped work one day after I install it
B00MATU946|2|i got a dark grey color<br />And my hub caps are silver<br /><br />I don't like it<br />Makes my cabs look weird
B008427D88|5|love it
B00KTHY6TU|5|Works like the original. The fit isn't as perfect at the edges, but the price explained all that to me and it works!
B000CFME2A|5|Excellent buy, will purchase again
B00OXA2MDG|5|Been on my side mirror for a few months. Holding up great!
B0041DQ79U|5|perfect fit.
B0020KWCTA|5|I'm so pleased with my purchase.
B00KTIR1V4|5|Went to the dealership and they cut it for free.  Since I have a remote key and a valet key, I was able to program is key in less than a minute.  The instructions are in the manual, and if you need a manual you can download it from Dodge.  Excellent product so far.
B002IYBIR0|4|as described
B00LV2UQB4|5|Placed these on my moms Acadia they look nice and are made good.
B00FMPS7J4|5|This saddlebag works great for my dual sport motorcycle.  Installs easily and fits nicely.  The saddlebag works well in tight trails where trees and brush could snag on conventional saddlebags.  The weight distribution seems excellent as the bike does not feel heavy or sluggish and I haven't experienced any difficulties maneuvering the bike when avoiding obstacles on the trail.  Luckily, I haven't crashed yet, so no comments from that perspective.<br /><br />I found the Great Basin size to be just about perfect for a multi-day motorcycle camping trip.  I don't think the Coyote size would have been roomy enough for my needs.  The Great Basin is listed as 60 liters, the Coyote only 39 liters.  In comparison to backpacking expeditions this is to be expected, as 2400 cubic inch backpacks are typically only meant for a single day or a weekend at most, whereas 3400 cubic inches backpack is considered typical for multi-day outings.<br /><br />The saddlebag comes with three waterproof dry pods (dry bags) to put your clothes inside.  To me the saddlebag itself seems waterproof enough, but I have not yet encountered any severe rain to test this.  The three dry bags also work great to organize my clothing and food for the camping trip and make it easy to transport gear between the bike and tent.<br /><br />An unexpected cool feature about the saddlebag is what Giant Loop refers to as the &#34;BeaverTail&#34; strapping system.  Basically this is three embedded compression straps used to mount extra gear directly behind the bag.  I have used these straps to mount a tent, sleeping bag and sleeping mat.  Everything was held into place through a lot of rigorous off-road motorcycling.  Without this strapping system, I would have been hard pressed to figure out a secure method of mounting my extra gear.<br /><br />This saddlebag does make it a little harder to mount (climb on) a tall motorcycle as you have to swing your leg over the bag which I did not expect.  It's easy enough if you can stand on the foot peg, but climbing on from soft ground can be challenging when you can't stand on the peg.<br /><br />I also found that I could only wear a small backpack while riding, as larger backpacks seemed to bump into the saddlebag while riding and affect my riding posture.<br /><br />Also please note that the cable lock is an optional accessory (per the Giant Loop web site).
B00CHI89JW|5|5-star rating on all aspects of the transaction and product.
B00HS4A4NO|4|I can't tell you how much this helps me during my daily commutes. I live in a very hot sticky tropical country and having leather seats doesn't help. In spite of air conditioning the seats don't breath as well as cloth.<br /><br />The cooling system works really well and I no longer need to change my clothes mid day due to the accumulated sweat!!! The fan is a loud but it drowns out when you put the radio louder.
B0009JKI72|5|Met my expectations !
B002YCE5V2|5|As described.  So far it has made the service 4wd message go away.  Super easy fix
B00Z7KIZPA|4|Very pleased with the purse pouch.
B00496OI3Q|5|Perfect fit on my 2010 chevy equinox 4cy.
B001VLK0RA|5|If you have a grocery store that gives you money off gas and fill up gas cans , this is the pump for you.  I use a small table and put it next to the car and the lid of a plastic bin to keep any extra gas from spilling on the table.  One bit of advice:  Remove the batteries after use.  If you don't it will ruin the pump.  For some reason, gasoline will seep in to the battery compartment when you lay the pump down, so it's imperative that you take the batteries out.  I had one before that lasted a couple of months because I never took them out.  This one I've had almost for two years.
B008UR7J6I|5|Very good and quality OBD2 dongle
B00NIKN2G8|5|work perfectly
B005MVBCBI|1|Locking ball bearing fell out after two uses
B00B3O51GA|4|Once I like it.
B001T9G77Q|5|perfect fit
B00JJO1H46|5|I bought this helmet in a Medium.  The fit is snug going on and off, but the feeling once riding is that my head is safely encased in a roomy, well-ventilated protective device.  The many vents really work.  There is plenty of room with the shield down to wear sunglasses or glasses.  (I bought the dark smoke face shield as well, but I haven't installed it yet.)  I recently rode 130 miles on a summer day-night wearing this helmet.  More than once during the ride I thought &#34;I love this helmet!&#34;  When I reached my destination the face shield had several messy bug splatters on it. Although nothing on my Cruiser is yellow, I chose this color helmet because of the increased visibility.  Great helmet!
B000H6QWWC|5|Heavy duty and works well.
B000BGHYJS|5|works great!
B00UG52P7U|1|This is a poorly made product for the money. I was very disappointed.
B004NTOCQM|2|This pump did not fit my car like it was supposed to.  I had to modify it to make it work.
B0068EQ2E0|5|Like the seat. Installed onto my 2015 HD FLD. Looks good and more comfortable then I had envisioned.
B003IS3HV0|5|Works great! I bought some new leather booties but the leather seemed a little dull, so I went ahead and used the Leather Honey and the shoes soaked it right up! The leather looks much richer now (and darker, which is something I wanted). The leather also feels much softer now. It doesn't have a bad smell, and I was able to do it with my bare hands without any issues.
B0055DWMCG|5|Perfect match with my 1994 FZR 600. Buy with confidence.
B00029XC7M|5|excellent quality. Really sticks well and looks factory.
B000GU5MMA|5|works perfect on my 2007 Yamaha FJR1300.  I put one on each exhaust. No more melted shoes.
B00SS3TUT8|5|Great quality. However this is not the MARSOC Insignia.
B000IYR7R2|5|I didn't end up needing the product but they were very good about letting me return it
B004UBCKYY|1|No, no, no.  They didn't just cheapen and ruin a perfect tool.  No, they didn't ruin these tweezers.<br /><br />Yes, they did.  These new ones are worthless, nothing like the quality tweezers they used to be.  Of all the horrible things capitalism has done lately, this one in particular really angers me.<br /><br />These suck.  Stamped, not ground, and thinner, weak.  Horrible, tragic.
B00G247CZY|5|Great product,thanks
B000YMP1SA|5|Lots of stuff for not very much money. Perfect for cars without a spare tire.
B00IGZQT38|5|shipped fast and look great
B002B8NNLC|5|Worked for me.
B00LW4C5BU|4|Great product for the price.
B007HH7ARU|5|Fit perfectly (includes many adapters) and radio gets better reception than my friends newer cars!
B004C6OBBC|5|Does what it's supposed to do.  Solid, heavy, and perfect for the general use I needed it for.
B003XVJO1Y|5|Love this master cylinder. I intentionally went with an iver sized bore size to decrease clutch pedal travel. I love the feel and response.
B00T0TYZRQ|5|Arrived on time and I got more than I expected. One happy customer ;)
B003UM9GDM|3|The lift arms were not long enough to fit all the way under my motorcycle. Have to improvise.
B00W0GADNG|5|The truck light is really weak. Later on I will get a more heavy duty one. Overall the rest of them are nice and clear white light. They could be a little brighter but I rather they be a little less brighter than my threshold than a little more.
B00IFSGEUO|5|They fix great my GX200 Clone
B00JN0U4SQ|3|Great little antenna

B005MZWZQA|5|Nice sized &#34;bumper&#34; magnet at a great internet price.
B000JFHNG0|1|I bought this as a gift and my brother used it twice and it broke! Looks like it's well made but it's cheap crap!
B00GEE06D2|1|Would give 0 stars if I could. Bought this item because of blue jean stains on my white couch. Not much more to say other than it did not do the trick. Went by the instructions accordingly and videos on YouTube. Item does not work for what I needed it for.
B000C7TYX0|4|Good price
B004EIAADG|1|Just bought this in the spring time. Equipment that didn't work when I needed the most to jump start my car. Called the company and they wanted me to pay for shipping to send back, which they do not reimburse! DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!! You will be wasting your money- and then spending more to fix their crappy equipment!
B007KTIO02|5|I use this product on my cars and trucks and it works super great!  I recommend this product to any car person, show or everyday use!
B006JEO1YW|5|Just what I needed for my '92 Honda Accord. 👍🏾
B00P9OF04I|5|I was leary about this product because the instructions sounded so simple when compared with similar products. Followed the directions and thirty minutes after i started I was finished at the results were dramatic. Love the product and will use again.
B00RJUZY9Q|4|A good product.  I like the double sided clip style.
B00F6GKKQC|5|Great set. Bought another for a family member.
B00FELS070|5|A fun sign. I put it on my Jon boat motor.  A great seller.
B00642XMOO|4|Little difficult to aim nozzle<br />WD 40 style spray head needed here
B009AQS4IU|5|These are heavy stainless steel.  And the flowers were painted.  I don't know what those other people received.  They look great on my new white Tucson and I already recommended them to a few people!
B00IRWFQUW|3|Great product, even better price.
B00CIMSGSG|5|Just as described.....very easy to install on 2002 GMC Envoy!!!!
B00B2AF3LI|5|Great product and fast delivery.
B0024E70L2|1|Had to return, when we pluged in the smaller one, it shorted out the RV. Tried 3 different time and each time shorted out and lost all power. Not happy!! Will order again and hopefully nothing wrong with the next one
B00V7AW0ZA|1|I like the look of the product but have a problem with the installation it and their customer support is horrible. No answer after a week and no phone number or any additional information.
B0024NWWFC|5|Great product!! Simple install!
B00BCRM9RM|3|Material is very strong and durable.  Installation isn't too difficult, but there are no real instructions to go by.  Stripe on back seat cover is uneven, which is even more pronounced once the middle sections are removed.  They do the job, and aren't bad for the price.
B003WOZOUM|5|We drove from Baltimore, Md to Lewes Beach, DE.  On our Dodge Dakota quad cab. It was awesome. It poured down rain. everything stayed dry. This is a great product. Very sturdy.
B000A835AY|4|I received in quick time just what I ordered.  It works fine and was a great price.
B000JFHNEC|3|Works well once I tightened up the connector.  Seems the unit wasn't snug and cost me some r134a refrigerant as it leaked during the initial connection process.
B0052XFWCG|5|I never write reviews for products.  My 2003 F250 6.0 with a little over 200K miles on it stopped running and the mechanic informed me that 5 of my injectors were clogged and needed to be replaced for $3000.  Not having that kind of money, I figured trying this stuff couldn't hurt.  I changed my oil and put 2 quarts of this stuff in it.  I managed to get the truck started and idling rough.  She was smoking like a chimney for about 30 mins having to start her up ever so often.  Then like a dam breaking she revved up and smoothed out.  I then took her out for a spin for another 30 mins and she's running fine now.  Best $60 I ever spent.  Wish I could give this stuff 10 stars!
B00YY7M4AO|5|Really useful gadget to have. It is built well, easy to use and handy to have.<br />Personally I don't own an OBD 2 car but I use it to scan other peoples cars and point to the offending part. Most people do not realize that there are sensors that cars read from that affect the computers decisions to control the things that it does (IAC, EGR, Cam timing, Spark timing and stuff.)<br />Bottom line, change input sensors if they are faulty and set codes before you change things that the computer controls. A rich condition could be cause the Manifold Air Pressure Sensor is bad (input sensor)...not because all of the injectors are miraculously leaking at once (or are being commanded to be open longer resulting in a rich condition.)<br />But this tool coupled with an app from the market (Torque Lite, Torque Pro, or another scanner app.) will likely save you a large repair bill if diagnosis is applied correctly.
B00ABYVTZA|3|I guess it does the job, I just don't see it collecting any grit... ever... Now I feel like it's a gimmick.
B008BVQO0A|5|Great gift
B0022UOYTE|5|As Advertised.
B0031ZDU62|5|fit fine, worked great...good price!
B00480J4JG|5|These bulbs work as well as the OEM. I bought two since these things always seem to fail in pairs with the second failing after you've replaced the first one. Besides, having to remove the bumper AGAIN didn't exactly excite me. These were a good buy!
B00K1C1WC2|5|Perfect
B00737GY3U|5|worked as advertised
B000QUXYXE|4|Replaced the hinges on my 2001 Chevy Silverado.  They appear to be very close to the size and dimensions as the OEM parts. Quality?  Reckon time will tell. Installation quick & easy.  Highly recommend.
B003171ZCG|5|The mirrors themselves are a bit thin and after a couple years now are showing signs of weathering. Sadly I cannot find the same mirrors as replacements.
B00IPS4APU|4|This is one of the best reasonably priced windshield repair kits. It seals tightly and it works. Unless  you want to take it in for repair or pay hundreds to thousands for a professional kit this is one of the best options.
B000E4PW4Q|5|works perfectly. Fit is great. The color I wanted so I didn't have to have it painted. Great experience. Thank you.
B004QOK1VY|4|Great value for the price
B007Y3BKNC|2|the led light did not light up rocker works good tho
B0009IR0PQ|5|After a watermelon had broke inside the back of my pickup (inside the truck). . . during summer . . . the heat definitely added a raw stench that I felt could never leave my truck again. I was introduced to this cleaning product that I've never even heard of and gave it a shot after a few comments I had previously read. This spray comes out like foam and immediately goes to work right when it had touched the damaged areas of my trucks flooring. The cap on top is a wonderful easy gripping scrubbing tool which helped get those deep stains from the floor. I went over the area just twice before I noticed the smell had completely disappeared! I was impressed and continued scrubbing until the red stain from the watermelon had ceased to exist, great product! It was to my surprise that even after drying it with a towel, nothing came to the surface, no surprising leftover stains, no overpowering cleaning stench--it was magnificent! Also, because this is in a very compressed can you get A LOT for that price you pay for. This looks like moose coming out when you spray it and foams out like crazy to have the most coverage. I've used this product once and I've learned not to put anymore watermelons in the backseat of my car! BUT . . . if I do so happen to have another horrific stain, I have no need to take it to a professional when I already have it in a can. I do recommend that the company should soon add another scrubbing cap, or make the bristles a bit more durable for longer use. My plastic bristles are very much in tact, but it would be nice to have a scrubbing tool to come with the can that can last as long as the can. I will have to find out because I only used mine once and it is a dream so far! Get this while you can, great stuff, props to Blue Coral!!
B0002KL6TM|2|Expensive and doesn't do the job.  If you have tried everything else, try this, be disappointed about the time and money you have wasted, and send it back to Amazon for a refund.
B000VARXBS|5|seems to work good doesn't fall apart and fits perfect in my jeep grand cherokee
B00ODGDA9K|4|Awesome helmet real nice quality.
B000SOIRCG|4|some water does get through
B00C1ROSUI|5|Love it! anyone who is a pat fan should own one! looks great on my car and was exactly as described
B00K7X8IZE|5|Fits my Hyundai Sonata (2004) steering wheel perfectly. As some other reviewers mentioned, it can be a little difficult to stretch it over the wheel. To warm it up, I left it in the garage (summertime with about 95F outside) for a day. I was able to stretch it by holding it down with one knee and then stretching it with both hands. I like the grip - and it actually does not get as hot, so I can touch the steering wheel even though the car has been out in the sun all day. No odor, just like the description says. It makes the steering wheel a little thicker and easier to handle. Would definitely buy again.
B00NLP8MZ6|5|They look great and fit well. It took longer to figure out where the bolts go in which holes than it did to bolt the whole thing up.
B00MN7AIGE|5|This set is what it says, others say they have 2 48&#34; and 2 36&#34; but when you get them they actually have 2 24&#34; and 2 36&#34;, so I do recommend buying this set.. They work great too.
B00XV4W686|5|Used it for front turn signal on e39 euro style headlight and it is very bright and works flawlessly. Really happy with the product and quality and planning to buy for rear turn lights as well.
B003L358WI|5|Nice filter
B0051PJWQW|3|Contrary to the excellent results other people have had from this product, my personal experience with it hasn't satisfied me. Prior to using this headlight lens sealer, I wetsanded my headlights to remove the old oxidation. I sprayed this onto a towel and wiped onto both headlights and let it dry. The headlights do look excellent right after you apply it - probably because it is still wet - but that doesn't last very long. I wash my car every week and apply this sealer every 3-4 weeks, but even then my headlights had begun to yellow again at a rate I wouldn't expect with the use of this sealer. In the end I went with a more permanent solution and applied Xpel paint protection film on the headlights after I restored them again, which has held up well so far.
B00GZLMEN4|5|I just purchased my first bottle of Back to Black today- I am 100 percent satisfied with the outcome.  I even used it on some of the vinyl trim inside my truck.  My front bumper looks terrific.  I had to paint my rear bumber with trim paint, other than that Mothers brought my truck back to life!
B000E28CBS|5|So much easier than a filter wrench... K&N has a great reputation, and for good reason...
B002HP50GU|5|PRODUCT WORKED WELL FOR ME.WAS GLAD TO FIND IT IN GRAY.THANKS!
B000C9MKRK|5|ACDelco the official supplier of the GM who makes the awesome Corvette. Do I need to say more ?  The AC Delco products are normally moderately priced and excellent quality.  Hard to find a fault with their product.
B004Q8L894|4|The first one of these I got could not measure RPM.  I would press the Test button and see a very faint red laser dot on the target and the display would show 0 RPM with the low battery icon lit but the display was so dim it had to be viewed at an extreme angle or a flashlight had to be shone on it.  Pressing the Mem button would show the display at normal brightness.  I tried 3 different batteries measuring up to 9.67V and I also tried a 9.37V wall power supply.  I even kicked the wall power supply to 12V for a few seconds but it made no difference (probably not a safe thing to do even for a few seconds, but curiosity got the best of me).  A few of the other one star reviews reported similar problems.<br /><br />They shipped me a replacement for free before I returned the broken one and it arrived in two days and functions fine.  I used it to measure the speed of an AC blower motor as 1130 to 1132rpm, and the readings were the same when I double checked the next day.  The fan motor is supposed to run at 1075rpm so the tachometer may be reading fast, but it's close enough to prove the motor isn't failing and you can't expect high accuracy for $15.<br /><br />Be careful when inserting a 9V battery because it can be pressed in with the wrong polarity far enough to touch the contacts.  I did that on the broken unit and it makes me wonder if that's what caused it to fail.  It should have protection circuitry but that circuitry may be of low quality and it may have failed.  Then again, no other reviewers I could find reported it working until they put a battery in backwards, so it's probably not related.  Of course, if you're prone to putting batteries in backward, it may be a good idea to do it on purpose to test the protection circuit while you're still in the return window.<br /><br />The case is a nice touch and has a pocket for the instruction manual plus a holder for a length of reflective tape.  Only thing missing is a scissors.  Other reviewers say the tachometer burns through batteries even when not in use so I suggest storing it without a battery.when not in use so I suggest storing it without a battery.
B00DG3GXDG|1|These lights are very bright and look great. The only problem is I had the ballast replaced one time and now I had both ballasts go out one day after another. No more night driving for me because I have to take off my front end to change bulbs. BUYER BEWARE
B0087FSA70|5|Works exactly as stated...my 18 year old head lights look good as new...
B0013LJ218|5|perfect, great response and delivery. perfect part+++++
B00PW30ZPU|5|This product is so good that it is one of the most go to products in the automotive accessories part. The cover is silver in color with an inside part made up of cotton. This helps to prevent dust entry and also prevents minor and major scratches that can ruin the windshield.
B005RQWB18|5|They looked good, people compliment my car. The color is perfect.
B003XVHZCO|2|Is TOXIC Hexavalent Chromium Created in electrolysis process using Stainless Plates? See for your self.    [...]    \\"Also, in stainless steel applications, during the electrolysis process there is a discharge at the cathodes of a very toxic substance named hexavalent chromium. This is especially true if the stainless steel grade is less than 316L. Most companies want you to believe it is \\"just\\" rust. The truth is, this hexavalent chromium is brown in color and has been linked to cancer, birth defects and gene defects!! You might have seen this as brown colorized water and deposits in cheaper HHO generators.  WARNING: if you own a stainles ssteel hho gas generator and experience brownish water in the system you will have to discharge this water at a special toxic waste facility, otheriwse you are comitting a falony!

B00IO32VK2|5|Perfect fit for my 2009 Smartcar.
B001EAQTRI|1|junk same inside as the one with the rcas
B000E4NKEK|2|I bought this on April of 2013 and today it broke again on me. Not worth the trouble buying this, it only lasted 2 years and the original plastic lasted 12 years. I am now going to try a all metal one, should have done that the first time.
B0096BH8NQ|5|Fits perfectly, good quality, very easy to install, to me about 3 minutes to install front and back
B00NPQV06O|5|Great item
B00SQG8HN2|4|Good looking sticker.
B004SUO5QS|3|Front speakers are a total pain in the butt to install. Sound didn't seem any different than what I had
B001MU1178|5|Awesome
B00S5ZXC7A|5|gave  me the codes as needed<br />i am satisfied  with the purchase
B003LUPH2M|1|Burnt out in 2 months.  Cheap Chinese crap
B0087NB1IW|3|Nice
B008XNRENW|5|I had a totally disgusting reason for purchasing these, but here it is: we have two boys who are, for the most part, potty trained, but we're working on night training now, so there's a lot of clothes and sheets with pee on them that go into their hamper.  And they're not the only two people who live here, so I can't always get to their laundry immediately.  BUT if you have clothes with urine on them for more than one day in a hamper (one of those plastic hampers with the holes in the sides and the swinging lid), your bathroom starts to smell like a barn, and a dirty barn at that.  Since the kids' bathroom is the one that guests also use, you can probably see how this isn't an ideal setup. But adding a bathroom isn't an option right now, so I had to look for an alternative.  Traditional air fresheners just weren't cutting it.  When I used them, it smelled like someone had urinated on an air freshener--not what I was going for.  So I bought these.<br /><br /> Their hamper slides in under the counter in a space that, I imagine, the previous owvers who had the house built, used as a space for a vanity stool, as there is a large mirror over this section of counter as well.  In any case, I stuck the air freshener on the underside of the counter, opened it up all the way, and the farm animal smell was gone by the next day.  Voila!  I don't know how long they'll last--I imagine &#34;forever&#34; is not the response Ozium would give me if I wrote to them, so that's a little disappointing.  But it works, so I'll take it.
B0009IQXFO|5|Love this wash on my black truck.  Shines nicely.
B007XE5LTG|5|Great tool to have for your car. I was able to see the error codes of my car and friends cars. Helpful tool.
B00SVHPWZC|5|Awesome product it works great I love it . I buy it again
B00PGRGSH6|5|These bulbs are by far the brightest LED drop in replacement I've ever had. They're kinda on the whiter side of the spectrum but super bright. I tested them in my headlights and I'm tempted to buy another set for those but I'm hesitant because they're kind of blinding looking head on.
B00UAB7CK0|3|doesn't look like the picture.
B000NVW1LM|5|Stopped oil leaks in my Toyota V6 in the rear main seal and somewhere in the front of the motor too (had both cam seals and crank seal replaced) possibly the oil pump seal.  About 2 oz. of AT-205 seems to have stopped a power steering fluid leak at the pump too.  I'm not 100% sure yet because the leak was intermittent.  But it hasn't leaked a drop since.  And my power steering pump thanks you!  It's running a lot quieter now.  I think we saved its life.  Edit: It's been a while now since my review so I thought I'd give an update.   My power steering pump is still quiet, no leaking at all now.  It's time to flush the system and I'm going to add 2-3 oz of this in with the new fluid.  A very minor leak on the drivers side is still not leaking.  I do have some minor leakage in the front of the engine even after replacing the cam and crank seals and timing belt.  Hope it's not the oil pump.  I think synthetic oil has exposed a very tiny leak into something much worse.   I'm going to switch to Castrol conventional oil next oil change and use another full bottle of this.  Overall I'm still very impressed so I'll leave the title the same.
B000S2QLUI|5|Very good
B001CF5156|2|Looks cool but that's about it. Quickly falls apart I think I have one or two pouches left that some what work. Smittybilt has really gone cheap lately with materials. As this is now the third and final thing I buy with Smittybilt. The funny thing is I never stored anything in the pouches. Guess all the wind from driving did the damage?
B005DCKRP8|5|I luv it.
B00L1S0JU6|5|Best drying towel out there! I use this towel to dry my car and it leaves it shining streak free I love it. There are also many other uses for this towel which I look foward to buying more since they are high quality and are very absorbent.
B00062YK7G|5|great
B00WA1U7MS|5|Nice Product.  Does what it says it will do at a good price.
B00150T13G|5|This is great because I am able to cleanse the smell of filth my sister leaves behind in the car. She has some demon portal there that emits this foul stench, I swear.
B002NAQM4S|5|Very pleased with the part and delivery!
B00J002VQ2|5|PERFECT FIT, GOT THE RIGHT PART ON TIME
B000HS6OZK|5|Good fitment, shipped quick
B00192JGA8|4|Great product and works very well.
B003VCB3W8|5|Love that you can put two cups in for the day and microwave if needed.
B001J8J9PY|5|Happy with the price and the quick delivery. Also parts were well protect.
B00G2TV7OG|2|*** Update ***<br /><br />I have had these bulbs for more that 2 years.  They still work but they flash a lot.  They started doing that about 6 months after I purchased them.  I will replace them soon with another brand.  I did rate these 5 stars originally but now I'm revising my rating to 2 stars.<br /><br />***<br />Original review below:<br /><br />These bulbs are bright!  They will be excellent backup lights on my truck. If you want bright backup lights, you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />I installed one and then made the lights come on to conpare.  This LED bulb was very noticably twice as bright as the incandescent bulb on the other side.  As with my experience installing other LED bulbs, if they don't work at first, remove the bulb and turn it 180 degrees.  I had to do that on these and they were perfectly.<br /><br />Also, I didn't know whether my vehicle would have standard or CK sockets.  These bulbs are listed as standard and they work so I must have standard.  My vehicle is a 2007 GMC Sierra New Style.
B00P9AB4OC|5|easy to stick and looks really beautiful.
B005JCQ5LM|5|Great quality and strength, i use it to tie my jetski to the dock.
B007NIYA4Y|5|Other people wrote how difficult it was to put on, but honestly I had no difficulties. I replaced the old one because they were faded and they fit perfectly on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500
B001ZTDMDC|5|Tons of starting power, for my jetski and perfect fit.
B005CL1OPC|5|Bought this for my hubby and he loves it, I have used it several time myself.
B0045V070S|5|Easy on, so far so good
B00EFA1ZH8|5|Looks awesome, just as described. Very durable tough, thick plastic.
B00V5EJNF8|5|Great quality for an awesome price. Not flimsy at all.
B0001EFSTI|2|It's nice as a very compact and unobtrusive tool on my keychain, but it has some fatal flaws.<br /><br />1. There's no way to open it without it coming off the keyring.  This means you have to put it back on the ring every time you're done with it, which is fiddly and a bit of a pain.<br /><br />2. It's difficult to open.  The little fingernail grooves aren't really enough to grab it by, and they put your fingers very close to being on the sharp blade.<br /><br />3. It looks like it would lock in a 90-degree position, and it sort of sticks there a little, but it doesn't lock.  If you put any force on it, it'll fold.  Only the 180-degree position really locks.<br /><br />4. To use the screwdriver end, you have to, again, put your fingers very close to the blade.  There's a lot of risk of cutting yourself when you handle this thing.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's less convenient and less safe than just carrying an ordinary swiss army knife.
B00JW1X6ZE|5|As with most DORMAN products, they fit and perform as good or better than OEM. These bottles cloud easily and are hard to clean due to the baffle inside. This product will make it much easier to see the level of your coolant. The pressure cap and level sensor are included. This is for the version that clips in, not bolt in version. 06 Malibu Maxx SS, 3.9l
B008NA4PWS|5|Great finish for my Lazy Daze RV.
B001T6EKGY|5|ARP is number one in quality
B00061SGTK|3|Great set not snapon but good for the price cant complain
B00HQQR1W6|4|Great product, fits perfectly...makes a world of difference at night, super bright lighting with a cool custom look to the interior. Pry tool was sort of useless, if it would bring the cost down it could be omitted from the package.
B00HMG8QHE|5|excellent product , sturdy construction , and has an Industrial backup sound. I ordered two more for our service trucks
B00C5RB03W|5|Just what we needed for our camper! Fit well and was a great price!
B00MXBIIOE|5|easily worth price, above and beyond expectations. Rubber isn't thin like i imagined and will keep my new ford focus looking new.
B00029K20W|2|Tried to use this on my Envoy (with coil springs, not air-ride) and they were too small to fit in the gap.  I guess your springs have to be really sagging to use these.  They're not really made for SUVs.
B009DJRVW4|5|Fits perfect. And super fast shipping. And easy to install. Hardest part is drilling out the old rivets.
B0002KKJ1I|5|Taking care of our convertible top at a great price
B009E9J3NS|5|Excellent
B00JIIZCM6|5|Great product, my leather furnature feels better than when it was new!
B00CGCODVW|5|Bought this for my daughter who's in college & doesn't much care about the appearance of her vehicle it was handed down to her from my wife & I bought my wife a new car. It was an eye soar to see the front bumper with nothing attached to it so we kept it simple & since she drives a Nissan Altima this was perfect & looks great on her silver car
B00TUNSV2W|4|This is a perfectly good automotive cleaner and degreaser, effective and with a pleasant, light citrus scent. Don't get it on the upholstery, because it might stain. It's very bright orange. It did temporarily turn my fingers slightly orange.
B00LFL8J9C|5|great parts super fast shipping
B000LQMYZC|5|Remarkable improvement in my Sportster's throttle response. Make sure you properly gap to your motor's specs before installing. So far so good ...
B000BARFCK|5|Temp hovers right around 170-175 while driving without my electric fan on.. This is on a LT1 that has been bored and stroked to a 383 with aluminum heads, aggressive cam, headers and 12:1 compression ratio.  Very happy with how this works !!
B000BQW5LK|4|It is inexpensive but didn't leak or break when I changed oil out of front and rear axles of our truck. It helped a great deal as the fill holes are in really difficult to reach spots. Only downside is it takes about 100 pumps to put one quart through the system. I'm not complaining, just putting it out there. This is way, way, way better than spilling oil all over driveway using rigged up funnels or paper tubes and the price makes it a no brain-er. One bit of advice, try to find a kit that comes with the clips that keep output in the fill holes so you can use one hand to hold bottle and the other hand to pump.
B00JV59QR8|1|Not good couldn't get a refund and the product was damaged
B005DM5Y5Q|5|Perfect fit for my Jeep Wrangler Unlimited P255 / 75R17 tires.
B003LQU9DS|5|Love it

B00X4VX888|5|was here on time and was what  i expected it to be
B010EYQ60E|5|Hope he wins.
B0081SRZVU|4|IT fits, install was not overly difficult, jeep engine light went off, not much more I can see its only been in a few weeks.
B00N4RTGB0|5|The stuff is better than stinger roadkill, and better than dynamat as well...I plan to purchase some more and do my wife's car as well....
B0058DIDTY|5|This stuff is great and very moldable. Very easy to work with as well.
B008UX68OQ|5|Fits perfect

B004BTV7TO|5|On the car. fits good, looks good
B00P4S71KA|5|cool
B001LA18UO|4|Looks good. Stays stuck. Beware of neighborhood youths! Twice now I have gone out to my car and someone has drawn a penis on my window to look like it is pointing to the cat's rear end.
B002VVKHKE|5|Works as advertised!
B00IJF6OIA|5|I don't know why, but license plates are kind of boring on their own and I feel if you're going to take pride in your car, it should look nice.  This simple, clean and elegant license plate frame will help finish off an otherwise overlooked part of your car.  Oh yea, it's not made of some cheap metal that will rust on you, plastic will last forever.<br /><br />Disclaimer, I got a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and fair review.
B000FQ7L92|5|Solid steal construction.
B004J2GTI2|5|Easy installation
B00GTVPX5G|3|Did Not fit. Very Disappointing.
B001927PS8|5|Installed it myself after watching a Youtube video. Works perfectly.
B00FDBQZCS|5|Great product and fast delivery. Couldn't be happier.
B00XBUK19Q|5|Awesome stickers, variety of stickers. More than 20 came, it's kinda like a grab bag, you don't know what there gonna be but lots of cool ones.
B00WTPY8F2|3|They work okay, my only complaint is when brake is applied there is very little difference in light output from the tail lights.
B007O1XBHM|5|Good stuff
B00UJ5YL6U|5|Lights are well built and bright excellance product
B00LMHP89I|5|Cant live without them!!
B00HJK8DPI|5|great price for oil
B003IME3IW|5|These things were very well.  I was able to buff out a black Suburban with no swirl marks!
B00OWS4JNU|5|This is an excellent product.  Installation is simple and quick, less than 5 minutes.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat.  Locks in place and is secure and waterproof.
B00BPXN0CG|1|Didn't fit right and returned and refund is back thanks.
B000CIXMIC|4|Very good Quality for aftermarket part.
B00D7XNQHG|2|I don't like it
B00DJ5KE9A|3|works
B00GJK4X8U|5|ok
B0085XV9JA|3|The can is about right for the price paid, but the plastic holder of the can that attach it to the headrest was so stiff that when i tried to bend it to put it in place it BROKE, so now i can't use it
B00L9VWAUC|5|Great replacement coils for my 4.6 in my 2003 Ford E-250 van!
B00PA7S53C|5|Fits perfect and right on time!! Thanks!
B004S5NWTO|2|Adhesive does not stick well. Some of the side areas are raised, which makes them look obvious as 'stickers.'  Will likely remove and replace will real caps.
B002VMSJ8U|5|High quality vinyl sticker!!! Nice
B012HHJ7OS|5|Knob looks good in my 2004 Acura Tl. Neo chrome really stands out. I would buy this again. I recommend this knob if you like neo chrome things.
B00Y5N0BWK|5|good quality easy to install got here super fast!
B00EVY2SKG|5|Bought to clean electronics and appliances. They don't leave any fibers behind while cleaning!
B00II5YADC|5|Works well and the depth of the blade lets it pass over small protuberances, such as glass door hinges.
B00APSSPEA|3|multispeed &#34;gizmo&#34; was a joke. i wired it direct skipping that controller that did not attempt to work. it runs one speed: wide open, but boy does that thing move the air!
B012FRSR5A|2|The inside of this shifter is rusting. When I pulled it out of the box it shipped in, I noticed an odd discoloration on the clear plastic bag it was in. There was rust coming out from the inside off the shifter. Rust dust.
B00Q8DNV1I|5|ole lady loved it
B0068MZDP6|4|Slightly larger than original.
B00DR67P9I|5|This are very nice and super bright and durable. But they are to small for what I needed them for.
B005BNZ59M|3|not as good as the powder form
B000C5YD4M|5|Fit right with no issues on my '04 Subaru Forester, using an offset 7/8&#34; oxygen sensor socket.  Plugged into the factory harness just fine.  I re-used the tie strap from the original sensor to route the wiring around the axle shaft.  P0030 CEL code went away and has not returned; fuel economy back to normal.
B00GWFKSOK|3|The door sides don't sit flat, curl up.  I have to step over it to get out.
B00J0ABS5M|5|Lock sticks a little when new.
B000UK3RT6|5|Worked great in my Zuma 50cc Yahama. More pep and better gas mileage. Standard NGK would were out out every 1500 miles. Think these will last far beyond that. They are also cheaper to buy through Amazon than at Auto Zone. Couldn't get one there except a platinium and they were out of stock. This plug through Amazon was cheaper than the standard plug at Auto Zone. Really recommend buying this through Amazon. Also received in only a few days in the mail.
B000BYCS3M|5|Excellent, works great. Plug & play, about 20 min doing everything with calm.
B003VLBPJA|2|Took over a month to arrive.Comes from China. the metal hooks little plastic protectors fall off the moment you look at them. had to pinch them hooks down more so that wouldnt fall off
B000S2S4AS|5|Replaced the original as it had sprung a leak back in May 2015.  Installation went well and has been working great since then.  As a note though, you may need to order the gasket (ACDelco 22872387).  This part doesn't come with it, and ours needed to be replaced.
B0013FY2GO|3|this little solenoid was jammed so far into the car i had to lift the motor out of my car, and do a complete teardown just to reach it if your car is diagnosed with this part being the culprit just roll the car off a cliff and save some money
B00C6JJ4N2|1|This did not fit a 2005 Kia Sedona. It is way too big: the prongs to hold it in place are too long and the cap is much bigger than the opening of the reservoir.
B00XZ9OGTO|4|Keyfob worked great, shipped in ahead of schedule. easy to program. very happy with service and product.
B000NPXH3O|5|We got this for a 2015 Ranger EV. We use the Ranger to drive around our avocado grove. The seat is great but you do have to watch your head as other reviewers have pointed out. It was a bit tricky figuring out where we could drill through the bed of the Ranger and not hit one of the fins underneath. But it all worked out well. I like that the seat is covered in fabric so it's actually nicer to sit on than the plastic seats in the Ranger cab. Good purchase.  It does change the way the Ranger handles and since it's not a bench seat you have to adjust your driving for the weight on one side or the other. We are driving on pretty rough roads so it may be easier if it's a smoother road.
B007PLZGO2|3|Smaller pieces such as chainsaw began peeling after a couple months
B00KTIYZ5O|5|Great deal. Very happy with product
B001KS0M5O|2|Wiper is OK, not great.  The directions are not user oriented and certainly are not clear.  Removal instructions say to tilt the wiper as far as possible up.  That is not very far for my 2012 Buick Enclave.  Then put your left fingers between the wiper and the top of the assembly.  Then take your right hand and pull the wiper off of the mount.  With your left hand placed where shown it gets really squeezed.  So much so that it got bruised.  I don't like to use so much force for fear that I will break the wiper or the mount.  I grasped the blade on both sides of the pivot with my right hand and held the arm with my left further away from the pivot and pulled as hard as I could and it did not come off.  I finally decided to try and pull it off in different directions.  It came off when I pulled 45 degrees to the left of the arrow on the illustration.  It did not come off easily and was very hard to pus the replacement on.  At least one lost star belongs to Buick for the arm design.
B000MXZHUI|3|I got these to protect the chrome rim on my bike and found that though they work I really didn't need them.
B00D9GSY3C|4|easy to install and very functional, provides much needed back support for a more enjoyable ride
B00U1J1MCK|5|Install on my ford lightning great product
B008HZME3Q|2|Wasn't the right plug to the car. Not happy no way to send back.
B007Q1TN4A|5|Items arrived as specified. Installation was a bit tricky with vague instructions. Got the on and they look great. Will definitely recommend.
B0009IQZFM|5|Sucks up water and seems well made.
B00HFL9AK8|5|Thanks so much
B000BH5MAA|4|I was thinking I needed two but then I realized when I got mine they slide around the tire to lift & not need to be parked on like blocks
B005RGHPMI|1|Not sure if this is were im suppose to put this. Gave me the Wrong Stuff will not fit the corolla i got them for.
B00QZHXHIE|4|Great patch and fast delivery!
B001EAQTRI|4|Unfortunately the Input 3.5mm connector is female & the output is male,  That won't fit most audio outputs of desktops or anything else I can think of.  Better buy some 3.5mm gender changers also of a short nature so you won't become frustrated.  Otherwise the little guy does a good job electronically of stopping the hum.  Small amount of audio loss & hardly noticeable. Recommended.<br /><br />/
B00NXRXGO4|5|Fits perfectly on my car and has a low profile
B006WMTENO|5|Smells vanilla
B00H47ISS8|4|looks and works great so far
B006B28A94|5|as stated
B00SS3RM7U|4|A
B0007TQWJM|5|Beats a chunk of plywood. Well built, designed, thick & perfectly functional. Good stuff.
B002P3LLPS|5|Work great for me.
B008HRX1D6|3|Didn't fit flush like it should with my manifold. I had to tighten it up pretty tight. They don't seem to have good quality like they used to. Made in China though, what do you expect?
B007T138DO|5|GMC not Chevy, fit perfect. They look great.
B00V05LSZU|5|Great product for replacing old and worm retaining clips, cause they break when you touch your retaining clips trying fix something else and they just happing to be the way.
B00J04I4QE|2|So its four piece
B000RXNLK6|5|This stuff after a good wash and wax will keep your &#34;anything&#34; looking great. This is more of a sealer and lasts long. Makes dark paint pop. I just put it on my boat and will update.
B006WFJETA|5|A+A+A
B00KCR4A20|5|Better than i expected for the price. Very sturdy, wrapped around twice (2 layers) and keeps the heat in just fine for my bike.
B004KED8CO|5|Have been using the tool for 2-3 months, not an issue, very reliable and fits difference vehicles.
B0081LQEYG|5|Delivered just as promised. Just as good, if not better than the originals.
B00PQZPMYI|5|great
B000C2WDQ0|2|This hose allegedly fit my '02 Ford F250 7.3 liter diesel, but, in fact, it does not.  It is missing about 12&#34; length and a 90 degree turn at that end.  Gates is a great quality product, too bad it doesn't fit
B000CPCC4U|5|These things save a lot of work if you have a trailer. They need to go in straight
B00E5OUOCQ|4|The X-Shade is performing well in this season's hot summer sun. I can definitely feel a large difference in temperature when entering my car. While the steering wheel used to get too hot to touch, now I can enter my car, take off the shade, and start driving right away.<br /><br />My one criticism is that it takes some maneuvering of the vanity mirrors (visors) to get the shade to stay on. Because of the shade's design, it can fall easily if not secured by the mirrors and spread across the windshield as far as possible.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good buy. I recommend it to anyone who is sick of hot steering wheels and seats.
B00JR583VM|1|It says vent drink and your supposed to attached it by putting a screw in your dash. Wont use it.
B004SRRQ4O|5|works OK, fits like OEM
B00W8H4KH2|5|i really like it it so neat and easy to charge it it came with the organizer case really cool<br /> thanks
B000CBXNSI|5|Perfect fit & gives the car a totally different look. As far as bug protection, well I guess they had to call it something.
B001JI1WEA|4|great replacement has a groove for a gasket no silicon, ricky bobby dodge runs better!!
B0001EFSTI|5|I use this everywhere I go I don't even notice it on my keychain. You can sneak pass any high security entrance and they would not know. Surely would recommend.
B00YDDT9IO|5|It's nice high quality.  But is not fit my g37
B00O5EMDN4|1|Just used this weekend. The spray can did not provide an even spray pattern. Could not get an even coverage on the surface of my bumper.Color seemed close (matching a Jeep PBQ color code) but final finish was so uneven it is hard to tell for sure.  May have been a defective can however based on my experience I cannot recommend this product.
B000GASX9O|5|Product intact but shipping box was badly taped and plug was showing from product.
B003QVIXYU|4|Quite and smooth easy to install.
B00EZJL1FA|5|great fog lights. put them on my MGBgreat]\
B00P1RF494|5|Item arrived as described.  Have not installed yet.  Looks great when I test fit it.
B00D8RYGOI|5|Best light bar under $100 built very well and is waterproof had the bar on my truck for 2 months and been threw 2 flash floods the bar has been under a foot and half of water

B00KWJ5VRG|5|:-)
B0009IQZMK|5|great
B00XWK7SNC|5|Everyone should own one. I own 6
B00681BDXI|5|Instructions were easy to follow and it worked the first time I tired !
B00OPEFKBQ|3|not bright enough
B0046YMYH8|2|Happy with the transaction , shipping time was fast , If your looking for a add on to your  existing brake light for more  visibility then you should be ok but as a run alone brake light it would not be ideal , I was not happy with the  brightness in daytime  riding  visibility , its a reared  accident waiting to happen . Nighttime its much better but still not as bright as the stock brake light also it not flexible so it has to be mounted on a flat surface so be careful befor ordering , I will be removing it and throwing it into my junk  drawer  Till I have a need for it , there are cheaper Led strips online that are just as bright for 1/2 the price I would go that rout if you are looking for this size led strip. I have a single smd led that is crazy bright I will be looking for a new strip that has  multiple smd LEDs (super bright)
B00VVWIIS2|5|I saw this sticker with my boyfriend a few weeks ago. I decided to order it and it's exactly what I wanted. It looks great on his car!
B008IK7TSA|5|Fit my kids 110 Taotao atv perfect.... great Buy!!!!
B000EDOSKQ|5|If you're changing the skylight you will need this kit.
B00873J0YY|4|Can't beat the price, look decent and get the job done.
B00SISKX58|5|They are perfect & purchasing here saved me a lot of $$$.
B005HAYDR4|5|This was great.  Fit like a glove and looked tactical in my Jeep.  Only issue I ran into was placing these in the back seat area where the factory sound bar is mounted to top.  I couldn't get the handles strapped where they should  be
B00XB6HLG6|5|Great product, light and effective.
B000IG20RW|5|A
B00157TGXY|5|Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.
B004IQTV7K|4|Comes with all sorts of different things. Really good if your opening a body shop or just trying to get dents out of your own car.
B004SCIY6S|5|Product even has little rubber gaskets inside cap to help keep the air in tire.
B0031ZDU62|5|good product for the price
B0007WTE08|5|If you buy Dynamat you will definitely need this roller.  Works great!
B00597JZAA|5|My car is so cute with these mats in them.  They fit perfectly and add that pop of color and character that makes it the center of conversation for those who see it.  Made of thick rubber so it won't fall apart easy and it washes easily.
B0049DSVGY|3|Don't like how it attaches to your lighting control module, but what else can you do when the dealer can't get new LCM?
B010W2KZ9Q|5|I got into an accident and the dealership broke my light bulb, so I found a replacement for them online and it was a decent cheap price. These even include the male connectors unlike my original HID kid. I only replaced one bulb and there is no change in color and looks just like the other light.
B00DTDB5G8|5|I bought this for my '13 fat boy lo. Fits great, easy on or off if needed to put the passenger pillion back on.
B00I90IWOY|5|Took 15 min to install.  With YouTube, an easy do it yourself project
B0087NB0ZQ|5|These work great, bought the helmet clamp kits for ear buds to use on my half helmet, used the speaker and microphone that came with this set in my snowmobile helmet, very happy with the performance, convenient to use intercom, phone, of to listen to music while riding.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Quality shade. Well made. Does its job. Great for the affordable price !
B00ABW68PS|5|I should have gotten this a long time ago.
B0007XS06Q|5|Perfect fit for my water heater.  Nice to get a good price and shipped in two days without driving all over town to try to find one.
B000AME5GI|3|Hmmmm, burned out quickly.
B003BDW0TM|5|love it
B00EE6KIX0|3|I had to return it, the throat was to short
B0007XXTVC|5|Factory replacement parts without driving all over down trying to find them.  Works great and you get a spare!
B006M4AOCC|4|Work well
B001810SHA|5|It's very good item, good material , very useful,<br />It's saved the day,,<br />Advise you buy it.
B007ZDG6GW|4|The 1st set I bought as a gift & 2 caps would not screw on the stem all the way. I ordered another set because my husband liked them & all of those worked. The quality is very nice & they look good on chrome or polished rims!
B00YVQD4A2|5|Really easy to pop glasses in and out of and it stays in place unlike previous clips I've had.
B000O823YO|5|Awesome product, can't good wrong with this purchase. Replaced a lot of service valves on many makes and models, pays for it's self in 1 repair job.
B00UEMH5L6|5|Good quality.. Hard plastic..Easy to install. Looks great!!
B008KWP6MC|5|Used it wit locktite and it works great you can't even tell it broke.
B001EY2RL6|4|They seem to slip down my nose  after I have them on for awhile.  But overall I would recommend them.
B002DLYR8A|3|The small plastic plugs on the side easily fall off and get lost.
B0065KKXL0|5|works well
B00VNBDWPK|5|2015 Honda Accord EX-L.<br /><br />Have two different OPT7 kits, the 55w 5000k Bolt series and now the LED kit. The LED is pure white, matches my other car that has factory LED headlights. I would say the output is brighter than the 35w kit but not as bright as the 55w kit from OPT7, the beam patter is very good with no dark spot. Install was very easy, if you can change normal bulbs you can do this, I had to use the reverse polarity adapter on my car but it was included in the kit, I did not use the capacitors because it was not needed.<br /><br />I love the color, the instant on and off, and overall kit is well made and I expect it to last for years to come.<br /><br />*update 1/21/2016. I have ordered 3 of these foe 3 different cars I own. 2016 camry XSE, 2015 Accord EXL, 2014 Avalon. All works great and looks perfect.<br /><br />I paid for the full kit and did not get any discount or incentive for this review.
B00YOQ0OBQ|5|This light system is impressive. The 17&#34; 108 watt version of this light bar is a perfect fit for the top of my golf cart. I use it only for non-public road use in my ranch community. You dont want to be shinning this thing into an oncomers's eyes. I like this because it creates a wide swath of very bright light in front of and to the sides of the vehicle. This is great for spotting wildlife before it jumps in front of you.
B00ONDM07G|5|Fits perfectly in my 2014 JK Unlimited and holds my LG4 snugly.  As a bonus, I can also attach my GoPro on the flip side so that I have a 'dashcam'!  Material is good quality and matches up with the rest of the dash quite nicely.
B001RMCB7A|5|All as advertised
B001C90XQE|5|These are great pads, have good bite for OEM and from a repeatable manufacture which is why I purchased them. Used to use their Greens on my sports car and well don't have it anymore but still wanted something good and reliable this fits that bill.<br /><br />**side note** these will squeak and squeal till the red material is gone. Also USE the shims that come with them. In the past I have never had an issue not using the shims so I did not put them on, two days of my car sounding like a trash truck stopped as soon as I installed the shims that come with them.
B006G3CLUW|4|This product was hard to find locally and pricy once you found it. Great price on Amazon and it fit perfectly and easy to install.
B00NGKAJTI|5|it is so cute, I recommend it to any BTS fan.
B0097MWSVQ|5|Had no problems with it.
B009CXKI5S|5|Awesome!!
B00MOYJ0YW|4|It looks nice
B00BITKO1C|5|Perfect fit and easy to install!
B000NCS7GE|5|Fast delivery @ the lowest price!
B004J0YLSY|5|Shipped on time. perfect fit. Came with all necessary bolts to remount
B00594OIWS|5|A refined extra touch
B00CASDZKC|4|Easy to install and works wonderfully.  Wish it came in different colors to match the color of the seat, but other than that, it has done what I needed it to do!
B00ERFGYGI|5|Arrived quickly, easily applied! Love it. So worth the money!
B00IBOLYFC|5|Awesome coverage fit perfect and wash up back to black. Plus they feel really nice if driving barefoot with sandals
B007OUXGNC|5|Good
B00VFJDFL6|5|Quick shipping/delivery, part as stated in description, fits my Chevy sonic 2012 perfectly! One thing I was unable to figure out was how to install, so ended up keeping light fixtures from original part. Luckily I only needed the tail light not the actual bulbs/fixtures. Would definitely order again from this seller.
B005CRE2K0|1|It rip the day I put them on 😓
B00IIOG6K8|5|Nicely built gloves.  The leather took some time to stretch and take on my personal hand's structure, but overall they are well worth the money.
B00UNRUJ7E|5|Good quality and fit.
B00MFROGME|3|ok
B005TIPCJW|5|Have a whole bunch of these for a youth group.  Works great!
B0006JJ58I|5|I love this little plug.  I purchased my original one when I had an RV and used it to blow out all my lines before filling with Anti-freeze.  I sold my RV, but continued to use this plug for my backyard hoses.  I would blow out the water every year before putting them away.  This would prevent freezing and cracking of the hose and make them much lighter!  When I moved, I lost my plug so I am purchasing a new one.  Great little tool to have.
B002T65XPA|5|The plate was just the right thing to mount the antenna.
B00K1CRXF2|5|Worked great
B00J4PCUGE|5|Quality.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Love this item. Great price (2 for 12 bilucks), Fast shipping (ordered Saturday received Monday), works as advertised. At first i couldn't get my vehicle to learning mode, but after watching it on YouTube realized I was doing it too slow. Excellent...
B00MAQBPEM|5|Good product holds great ,but would buy from a different seller.
B00KTIY4ZA|4|Instructions were very easy to follow. Was successful on the first shot. I would recommend to anyone needing a replacement remote.  Great savings too....
B00KTIYXLU|5|Work perfectly with a Focus 2003
B000SL4A84|2|Everything worked as advertised, with the exception of the cold pack which was a dud. LUCKILY I had access to an excess of ice but had I not had that I could have suffered from serious swelling in my eye which would have required a trip to the ER to remove my contact lenses. You expect an emergency pack to work as the whole point of them is to be there when times are rough.
B0009V1WQQ|5|Keeps my atv safe in motel parking lots.
B00068YAR0|1|I ordered that key and didn't fit in my car, they told me that doesn't work to jdm cars, subaru is from japan so....
B00005OWK2|5|excellent and fast delivery
B008D5RXX6|5|Product as described, great quality!
B008YU5REM|5|Love it, easy to install and well made.
B0022ZL5DW|4|I learned the hard way.  Good stuff but a little goes a long way with this filter oil.
B007Y86RH6|5|Good  part  for a great price
B0050IRQHC|2|It never worked after I hooked it up to my sled.It got put on a shelf and I forgot about it.
B00O5FUJZM|5|This is my 2nd set of husky liners in 20 years... I only got new ones to fit the floor in my new vehicle.  My old ones have been passed down and still in great shape...  love this product STILL :)
B00HS0NOQM|4|good cheap oem replacements. does the job.
B00FW1VFAG|4|Worked well
B00DJG80YA|5|good product
B0006N5RYK|5|What can I say, its a sewer cap, works well.
B00F5MUB66|4|Works well enough with a good spray hardness and pattern. It does save on water but not as much as I hoped for.
B00514B5R2|3|Very Nice item and good price to boot and does the job better than stock lights
B008DM8MUW|5|it works
B002O30CMW|5|Nice extenders. Work well.
B00F2QPTK8|5|Perfect fit and looks good, loving the Velcro for easy roll up!
B0002KKHSS|5|Worked great! Made my boat look like new!!!
B0028NB1SM|5|did not know there was something this good
B00K1C1WC2|5|Get chocks at a very reasonable price. I added a rope to tether the two chocks together making it more convenient to remove.
B004A2YD8O|5|Fit and finish is as good as factory!
B0027UTJHQ|4|Perfect fit on the machine but the holes for the cable guide only fit one size width.  My rollers were a bit more narrow so I had to redrill the holes to fit.
B006VFWUTM|4|A good quality hitch but it took quite a bit longer to install than the directions said. Guess I just don't have the proper hydraulic lift mounted in the floor of my garage. I'm not a professional mechanic but I'm not a complete stranger to &#34;working on a car&#34;and this was an all day job for little old me so if that's how you plan on installing it you should try to find a helper.
B0049LWJ0K|4|Fit's my 2012 Nissan Altima 2.5 just fine, however.... you need to be a frigging Houdini to reach it. I see why my dealer gets $75 to replace one. Half the dash had to be disassembled, I won't be doing it again. Also, my vent fan on high, now seem a little noisier. This could be from a little denser filter material than stock, causing the air to be forced thru a tighter media. Possibly the non-carbon model would not do this...? In any case, if you're not handy, by all means just take your car to the dealer for this change-out, it was a bitch.
B00BVPU4J0|1|Broke after 5 minutes of installation.  Don't buy this!!
B005BNP7Z4|4|Good buy
B00POG2GSE|4|Only drawback is the threaded portion seems to fit a little loose. Does tighten up and seal when screwed all the way down.
B00HWZMC6Q|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 Ranger 570. Rugged and very little vibration. Great mirror.
B004VWJAF4|5|It worked without any issues
B004D5SUIC|5|Been using this for as long as I can recall. I feel the brand is outstanding on my Subaru.
B00KMZ72HW|5|the best i ever bought fit was spot on does what it was supposed to do this is my first for my self have installed other more expensive cat replacement units this is by far the best easy to install nice part
B00C4QMBZA|1|Looks great, easy install, seemed like a quality product, but not. Just installed the light and took the bike out for its fismrst ride since. Was only street riding for about an hour and noticed the lense as cover were missing. 1st ride and I need a new light! Who knows how long the rest of the setup will last.
B00KYWB2YW|5|works great
B00UEC87QS|4|They are easy to install, big end on the bottom, look good...Next time I going to Plastic-dip them first.....
B004ETGQKG|5|Exactly as expected and promised. Delivered in original packaging.
B00LIHVMR4|5|A more detailed decal than I have used previously. Be careful and take your time applying, nice quality love the look!
B007KPT23Y|4|Worked as they should.
B004ZF44DU|5|Awesome they work great on my 2015 Chevy Malibu
B000A8OW9M|5|Excellent
B0092ZWDNG|5|Easy to use and fits good.
B0068OBVN2|5|Fits BMW F800gs perfectly, hard to tell any difference from oem. No leaks or difficulties on install.
B003G0KCCM|5|Didn't fit feels and looks horrible. Like laying a stuff thin piece of rubber in truck! And you are!
B00A93SUWS|5|Awesome plate. I'm excited to put it on.
B002R61SWE|5|Good finish and fits as expected.
B00HS871FY|3|After reading the other reviews, I thought these would be more 'heavy-duty' and would hold up well against vibration.  Unfortunately, they're basically plastic...  I haven't mounted them yet, so I can't really speak about the resistance to vibration.  But I'm rather disappointed in the quality, especially considering the other reviews...
B000CGK3ZY|5|It is a MAP sensor, not too sure what to say other than it works as it should.
B00I9AE392|3|Installed last summer.  Already dry and cracked. Had to reinforce with mechanical tape.
B000CMHTUU|4|They didn't fit our truck.. Looked like a real nice product tho.
B005W3ZRXA|2|I have a 2002 Xterra. Each time I want to open the center console I need to remove this cover otherwise it wraps the lid and I cannot get it to close again.
B003ZJ2HMM|5|The product fit my 2015 Toyota 4Runner well. It was a snap to install. Less than 8 minutes. Only required a phillips screw driver. Believe me... anyone can easily assemble it.  You push in the 6 inserts into existing square holes under the hood. Then mount the hood protector and screw into the 6 inserts with provided plastic washer and metal thread screws.
B00PUOQRK8|3|The seat cover seemed to do its job in leaving the seat dry when I get in with wet cloths. But just after one month of use the entire rubber coating where the seat meets the back has totally ripped apart leaving the seat cover useless, as water runs down to this section. $45 down the drain. back to 2 cent garbage bags.
B002T3FTTI|4|Item not for me so I cannot not give it a review. Hasn't been sent back is all I can say.
B0012PCTJC|5|Absolutely awesome. Great product, easy installation. Very satisfied.
B006EH9WUC|3|the metal is cast crap and too thin at raised point just past terminal attach.
B00JKGJJL6|5|I'm not understanding where all these negative reviews are coming from.  This tool did the job just fine for me.  If you follow the instructions which are very descript and detailed you won't have any problems.  Make sure you grease the threads on everything too before use.  Even though it says not to break the master link it's not a problem if you grind the heads of the link down with a grinder or a dremmel. I did so because the chain I was replacing was not garbage.  It had plenty life left.  I just replaced to new rear sprocket and chain purely for aesthetic reasoning and slight performance gain. I even broke my new 525 chain down from 120 links to 118 without grinding down the link head and worked great.  No damage to the tool or pin at all.<br /><br />I used it twice to do 2 master link installs. Only minor complaint is that I wish the flare pin opened up the head of the master link a little more for better peace of mind but according to the instructions you only need to flare 0.155mm for an effective and safe flare. I think much of this depends on what kind of chain and master link you have to fare rather than this tool itself. My master was 5.34mm before flare and I have both master pins flared to 5.56mm at a nice even flare on my new EK 525 3D Chrome Chain.
B00EKTJOX6|1|The tailgate changed in 2014. The top cover comes down on the tailgate farther which means you have to cut about 1-12&#34; off the chrome piece on both sides at the top. The actual piece that covers the release handle is about 1/2&#34; too long. No way of cutting it unless you leave end with no chrome.  Couldn't use this piece at all.
B00Y5GGJB4|5|Got here before the date an A+, they look amazing on my Honda Civic Ex, extremely recommend this
B001B9SL50|5|Received in the mail it did take a while after I cancelled my other order, but I'm glad I received it.
B00JMXNCA6|1|The description matches my truck, and from the outside, the fob looks exactly like the originals, but the circuit board doesn't fit in the fob and the buttons don't have the metal contacts to complete the connections. They are completely useless and since the were shipped from over seas, I don't figure there's any point in trying to return them.
B000BYGGVC|5|Fit well!
B003BZD08U|4|Slightly on the higher side of 50 lbs - 51 to 53 by my gauge.  No where close to the 40 lbs low side.
B0016NBBQW|5|easy to install and a perfect fit.
B00WPHX6NY|5|looks like it will last for awhile on my truck bumper. Colorful and easy to apply.
B005NLQAHS|5|Feels a little lightweight, so I had my doubts when I first took it out of the box.  But it paired with my phone without an issue and has been completely dependable when I need it.
B00CP31446|5|Excellent craftsmanship solid mirror polished aluminum. Looks great in my 1987 Pontiac Fiero GT with the Getrag Muncie 5 speed. Only wish the lock nut were polished aluminum or stainless steel, Looks a bit dull underneath this beauty. Overall I love it over the stock stitched leather covered knob. My shift pattern display is on the console.
B007OPVMNI|5|excellent very happy purchase
B007NZ618U|4|Not a good fit but made it work.
B001G65IWW|3|Works fine, but pricey.
B00GAPLVI4|5|Another excellent product from Spicer.  Cured the &#34;angry sparrows&#34; front driveline chirp in my 1998 XJ Cherokee.  Be sure to replace the rubber &#34;slinger&#34; boot while you're at it!
B004A0TJ3A|5|Very Good Quaity,I have used these for years,Keeps all my motors Purring!! Thanks Again!!
B00WQ35SKG|5|Awesome
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Like the most Deltran products, this is done well.  Unlike too many of these mobile chargers, this one actually fits the USB cables properly.  I have mine mounted under the headlight nacelle where I can easily plug in my cell phone to keep it charged. I have a second one I can attach to the charging pigtail when necessary.
B001FAI8GM|5|Work as described. Solid build. Clean Powdercoat. What more can you ask of a piece of metal?
B0040CW2A0|5|They are what they are. Pretty much single use, but good OEM type replacement
B00BSKLSQQ|5|I cross referenced the part number on top of the piston in the motor on the Internet and found the part number I needed to replace the piston rings in the bike. They are good quality that were cut perfect as I didn't have to increase ring gap at all. No issues with these rings and they seller performed well on the transaction.
B001IA33V4|5|This is a sturdy robust set that did not disappoint in the rebuild of a boat trailer.
B000CB50MU|5|Excellent fit and finish . Fit just like OEM . Been told by many sources that Beck Arnley is dang near OEM. I believe it. Will purchase same brand for the other mounts when the go out. Note to the diy mechanics out there. The thru the center bolt is only a bolt. It removes from the side closest to the battery . The nut on the side closest to the exhaust manifold is part of the mount bracket that bolts to the engine block , it is not removable. I broke a ratchet and a cheater bar figuring that out.
B00GUN8K8K|5|Works great! My husband love these. Worth the money. Fast delivery.
B000QFDC5E|5|Great
B00J0ABS5M|5|Appears to be an EXCELLENT & VERY WELL MADE Product. Works EXACTLY as Described. I purchased this model over the T3 one as I prefer having the bit of extra length., just in case. It fits my Class 3 hitch on my 2014 Ram perfectly.
B000O3U2UQ|5|Good
B00BQ9KFOU|5|Fit great, looks great. I'm 5'11', XL was just right. Def recommended.
