B0067LGPJG|5|This was a great shirt, matched with a matching one for my husband and a adorable elf toddler costume for our son. Great for any christmas fun. nice fit and washes great as well.
B00U79ZP7M|3|I went into this order with low expectations, which worked out; the neckline is COMPLETELY different (crew instead of V) and there isn't nearly as much draping at the hips, plus there were a bunch of dangling strings and messy seams. That being said, I had always planned to pick it apart and use it as a pattern, so while this is disappointing as a GARMENT, it'll do what I want it for just fine.<br /><br />Incidentally, the subsequent photos of this product on the mannequin are the real item, it's the dazzlingly-assembled model's jumpsuit that's imaginary.
B00CDG9GZ4|5|Very comfortable. Fits perfectly love it will buy again
B00QWA87T8|5|My little dude is tall and thin, so I have to buy his clothes the next size up for height reasons.. these fit pretty well but he does have a little tension problem when he has a full diaper.. they wash easily, that helps because he's still a rookie with his utensils.. the colors are great too and sometimes we just leave him in just one of these when it's really hot. He likes them and doesn't put up too much of a fight when we put them on since the snaps make it easy for his somewhat large toddler melon to fit through..
B00ABGD33Y|5|Very nice.  Delivery was as promised.<br />Will use again
B0027E2474|5|Very professional. Item looks like it costs a fortune but it was very well priced. I have recommended it to several co-workers.
B00BT8WYFG|5|Great Tank top, fits well and nice material. Very happy with my purchase. I will be definitely buying more US Polo items of clothing.
B002B5TOAE|5|its very nice and fit good and looks good and i like it alot so thanks for the good deal and will not be the last
B00MW68XAY|4|Great quality as expected from Polo Ralph Lauren.  Bought as a gift, and the person loves it.  Product material, color, and fit are as described by the seller.
B00BERTXQA|2|I ordered XXL, the shirt has XXL printed on the inside of it, but it looks like a womens medium or girls XXL. It will be a decoration, although not meant to be!
B0019GNH40|5|I wore this shirt to a wedding in Florida, it was comfortable and everyone liked the parrots! Good quality shirt for the price.
B00RNT8S9G|4|Pants are a little short.  I love the feel of them....very soft!!!
B00AEY0XE0|5|Fits great
B004P2HPLQ|5|fits great . Glad i purchase it.  I would recommend to everyone.<br />Love the brand...and the color.  Feel nice a warm.
B00F59HJL4|4|Very Cute But A Little Small
B004UN2MQ8|3|Total dime-a-dozen beanie.  Cute, comfy, but so not worth 20 bucks.  Don't let the fancy description fool you - this is just a garden variety grey beanie.
B00O2FTTLA|5|it's very nice chooice...
B00A5YFSB2|5|Perfect timing too since the &#34;Battle of the 5 armies&#34; opens next week!
B00GZ998V2|5|Fits well. Rubber cover over the hinge is a nice touch. Just as I wanted.
B008NBXETW|5|They are good quality and they can actually be worn without breaking! The mustache hangs in the right place too.
B00FDSPVIK|4|It's a t-shirt. a little hard to read since it's black but people get a kick out of it.
B00ATZGHWG|3|Cute dress. A lot more green on it in person. Ordered the size 8 and it was way too small that is the size I normally wear. I have a medium to large bone frame so would be better for a smaller framed person
B0010VZAA8|4|These sarong are very good material nice and soft. I wear them as a dress with a cardigan on, and heels. I really like the sarong. I will be buying more.
B00D5SC4XU|5|The vest is beautiful and warm along with the shirt and leggings. I would recommend to order a bigger size. My daughter is 2 and wears 2t good thing i ordered a 3t fits perfect
B00V9D3F9K|5|This is a perfect, lightweight jacket. It has a small, cute, floral lining on the inside, and is thin enough to wear consistently while traveling. The fabric is also surprisingly soft and comfy. It's not quite as long as I expected it would be, but it didn't bother me. I'm really happy with this purchase - great product for such a good price!
B0052BQRQS|4|I've been exclusively wearing the 527 for over ten years now.  I've had 'em in a variety of colors and always in the same size, 33W x 32L.  This Fume-colored pair were made in Mexico and fit just the same as the others I've purchased over the years.  Locally, I can only find my size at a couple of Bon-Ton stores.  And they typically only have one or two pairs at a time, so I buy them immediately and wear them 'til they fall off.  This pair is great.  Not the same quality denim that I grew up with, but comparable to the ones I've been wearing for years now.  I wear jeans 7 days a week and I'm hard on 'em at work and at home.  A pair will last me anywhere from 9 months to 1 year, on average.  Were the denim a better quality--thicker, more durable--I'd rate these a 5 star.
B0098XQEZA|2|I'm very disappointed this product! Completely different colour,in this pic is light blue but the jeans what I got is dark blue and very ugly...! You can not trusth this companie,they do not sell what they show to the picture... I will return them!
B004Q7DRAI|5|I love this hat, just what I was looking for! Durable too.  Goes great with every suit I have.<br />It's the perfect sun hat.
B00OBON2RO|4|Great quality for the price.  My husband wears this on the coldest of days and we live in South Dakota where the wind is crazy.
B00GFMTH0Q|4|This is a very nice, flattering dress. I think it will be great to wear this spring/summer the material is not super heavy but you can tell it is good quality.
B00JE8YY0G|5|made good
B0029IQIRU|4|Fishing hat.  A better fit for a woman.
B00TQBMJZ8|5|This is no ordinary bottle opener / key chain medallion. On scale, it is as heavy duty as my Harley-Davidson and worthy of being attached to the Harley ignition key. It is well constructed, well designed, beefy and ready to the task...no beer bottle cap can give it any trouble...they all succumb effortlessly on the first attempt. It is definitely one of those products that exceeds its online appearance and is well worth the investment.
B00KRP61Q0|3|I had to return it because it was just a bit too tight. So much that I could not breathe and felt light headed. Oh well!
B001QVKU6G|5|Hello!  I would like to thank this company for their EXCELLENT service!  I ordered my son a size 7 suit, originally - and it was too big. I e-mailed the company and asked what I could do - they sent out a size 6 - and I received it in TWO days!! I am in the process of sending back the suit that was too large - and will definitely utilize this company in the future!  My son had rave reviews on his beautiful suit for First Holy Communion! My oldest daughter, who is age 15, had a guy friend say to her, &#34;Your brother's suit is TOTALLY legit!&#34;<br /><br />Thank you so very much for your incredible service and for making our son's First Holy Communion day extra special!
B008D65JYK|5|Not cheap - but lasts and so very comfortable - worth the cost.  Have purchased any other pairs.  Love the comfort and the design.
B00K98PP3U|5|High quality thick cotton...pricey but distinctive...classy colored polo pony logo
B0061YM0ES|5|I ordered on line thinking it was a good price. When the product arrived it looked even better, the quality was excellent. The shorts have all the features of adult shorts even the little net pocket inside. My 3 year old son is on the thin side and the shorts fit him perfectly.
B005QL8LQ8|2|I was SO excited to get these--my favorite two things are pajamas and jeans!  I just got them today, so I cannot comment on long-term wear.  I don't know what I'm going to do, but I don't think I could wear these in public--even just to the grocery.  These look look baggy bell bottoms on me!  All of the pictures are deceiving.  The pictures make them look straight or boot cut.  They are not at all like in the pictures.  They fit in the butt, and then they just go out from there.  My husband says he hates the way they look on him.  Considering I paid the hefty price tag, I wish I could have tried them on like normal jeans.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I normally wear a Large bottom or a size 12 pant.  The sizing chart says I should wear an XL. My first pair (as described above) was a Large.  I returned those and bought a Medium, which I can barely get up over my hips, but the Mediums actually look pretty normal on me.  The extreme bell-bottom shape of the Large was less noticeable on the Mediums.  Skinny pants are SO in and flared legs are SO out!  Why couldn't they try to make people look \\"in\\" in them??
B00MBHD804|5|I love these footed pajamas for winter. They fit great and wear well even after many washes.
B00BCYDTII|5|I was unsure of fit when I purchased this as some reviewers stated it was very large.  My son is 50th percentile for height and weight and the 12-18 fit loose, but acceptably on him at age 1.  The shorts were larger than the top, but since it doesn't say &#34;1&#34; on it anywhere, I think we will be able to use them again next year!  We do wear cloth diapers, so that might be the main reason we were able to get by with the shorts.
B00F3EUNY6|4|Great fit.
B00001W0J3|3|She still loved it.
B000CO9VZO|5|This is the only bra I will buy or wear again. It is so well made and actually holds up my large chest. The straps don't budge which is great. They have metal clasp in the front to adjust the length you prefer and then it snaps right into place and stays there. Thats not an easy task for some of us with large chests. I highly recommend this bra.
B00BNQVHH0|3|I took off one star considering that along the sides the two polos I purchased got small rips where the stitching was after about three months. This doesn't really bother me, since i can sew, but still a bit disappointing.  I took off the other because although it fits well everywhere else, this polo is a bit too short for me, which is a pain considering that pretty much all jeans these days are very low-cut. Other than that, a good polo, and I love the black!
B005LC3GIK|2|The product has the same flaws that all the other rolling backpacks I have had have, it falls over, the wheels are cheap, and it is NOISY. The handle sticks so bad that I have to leave it up or pry it back that way with a butter knife. However, the bag is very pretty, and the zippers work great. The mesh on the side pockets apparently can't handle water bottles, because the pockets on my bag, one side is ruined. I am NOT impressed with this product, and it is NOT a college student friendly bag. I have had this product for approximately one year.
B00DNO2QJS|3|The jacket itself is made well and my father loved the other ones because he gets cold easily but this color we have ordered twice now and it isnt the beautiful color that is advertised. All of the others are perfect and beautiful. I cant even explain what color this on is but maybe a wached out version of the color shown. Otherwise I would give it a 5 star.
B0062Y2VJQ|4|Feels like a women's size
B00CY3ZUTM|4|I like this shirt. It fits as it said it would...only now I have to go out and buy a pair of skinny black jeans so I it looks good. I will wear this with may things and enjoy it very much.
B0018OSCE8|5|The 527 fit is excellent for the slim guy or someone who has trimmed down and toned up from hours in the gym.  All the quality construction you would expect from Levi.  One caveat:  various jeans have different fabric weights - not like the good old days.  Weight depends on style and color.  Different colors in same style have different weights.  And some are quite thin.  For instance, a 514 in one color is 9.5 oz but can be 12 oz in another color.  Go to Levi web page and drill down on style and color to get the weight you want.
B0006I489K|3|These briefs are overall a bit large, the rise is to high for me (I am 5'5&#34;) and the fabric is more light weight than I would like.
B00I5TZRSI|4|Solidly made. its a long beanie.
B00QT1RKQ6|5|My daughter looks awesome in this.  It gives her room to move without being loose.
B000MCLNK2|5|My husband lQQks adorable in this & it is well made & sturdy & good for a man who.....eats.  :&#62;)
B00K5LPAZ4|5|This dress is adorable ! I am so in love with it, the fabric and the quality exceeded my expectations and fits perfectly ! I love it !
B00C2WQARG|2|I am 6' 4&#34;....The sleeve were even to long for me.  They came to the middle of my foream.  Bad sleeve cut.
B0006ITD6S|3|good- I really can't understand why All Cotton clothes have to be sewn with nylon thread. Doesn't make sense to me
B0094KFN9U|4|Ordered for part of Halloween costume.the quality was descrnt
B00S10W2V6|4|XXL is Not true to size I would say it's more like a large. I sent it back for a 3XL which is also too small...seems to be same size as the 2xl more or less.  I typically wear a size 18 pants and XL SHIRTS  the 3XL was definitely too tight for me. This is a bummer because it is beautiful and nice material,
B00C5WFXQ2|5|PERFFECT! Great color and quality! Very easy and comfortable to wear. LOTS of compliments on my costume! :)
B002ZTK9QE|1|This was the worst wallet i've ever used in my life.<br />It has enough slots for about 20 cards, but anymore than 5 and the wallet won't close properly. I strongly DO NOT reccomend this wallet to ANYONE. a wallet you find in a garbage bin will be ALOT BETTER.<br />i'd rate this 0 on a scale of 1-100
B00FYMBHD8|4|Muy buena calidad de producto.. Solo que la talla L equivale en realidad a una talla M y as&iacute; sucesivamente..
B004HFH4IA|5|he really likes these socks. they fit great and look great. and they are school colors and he can represent the fighting Irish.
B000ERFE78|4|For as cheap as it was I have no complaints. Doesnt look like the picture as the entire wig is a bright green but its actually what I wanted and was going to settle for the one in the picture.<br /><br />I would give 5 stars if it didn't shed so bad
B005FYNXBY|5|They shipped quickly and fit well.  The socks are a good quality for the price.  I will buy them again when these eventually wear out.
B006KC9ISW|2|Looks inexpensive. Not 100% linen as described (Only 55% is linen the rest is cotton).<br />Made in Sri lanka (my previous Stetson cap was made in USA and I paid almost double price for this one)
B00CG7ARPI|5|These are truly soft. I am somewhat allergic to synthetic materials, I was able to wear this for 8hours without so much as an itch.
B00EK5OBHO|5|I am a size 4 and wear smalls most of the time.  I'm a 36C and 28 inch waist.  I bought this shirt in a medium based on the size chart and it fits perfectly.<br />The fabric feels so good on my skin.  The V neck is not too low or revealing (which is important to me).  Really good fabric, not see through.<br />This is the third item I've purchased from Patty Boutik and am very pleased with them all.
B00SPJBEIA|5|Nice
B002P9KFXQ|4|I bought this costume for Halloween and it was a hit.  I think the color is a little different than it is in the show but everyone still knew who I was supposed to be and I ended up in a lot of pictures with strangers.  It is a little difficult to wear, however, mainly because if you need to use the restroom you basically have to take it off.  That usually involves someone helping with the zipper that goes from the back of your head to your lower back.  There are no pockets but I didn't expect there to be if it were to be like the costume from the show.  The suit does match the conditions on the show with its tightness in the \\"cash & prizes\\" area.  Overall, though, the response you get is worth a few struggles that may come with the costume.  GREENMAN!
B006LFJG2Q|1|These socks held up for approximately one minute, before they started disintegrating.<br /><br />They looked good/good images, but they just aren't good for anything but looking at in the closet now.  Very sad, not a very good gift, as it turns out.
B00OT054O4|1|Gave this one star too many. Product took almost 2 months to arrive and when it did come it was miniscule in size. I measured myself carefully and ordered the largest size available and it still wouldn't fit anyone more than a size 2. Im a size 6. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!
B00KXIP7QQ|5|Beautiful material, great price, great fit. Highly Recommend.
B007OVOKFE|4|I ordered a size small for my girlfriend (5'6\\" 140 lb) solely because of the reviews that said it runs much larger than expected. It did fit her body, as in she was able to put it on, but it was way too snug for pajamas and uncomfortable to stretch her hands above her head. She normally wears small to medium undershirts, and medium button-up shirts. Already ordered a Medium, will compare and update if necessary, before I return the Small.<br /><br />The product itself, fit aside, was really warm and soft, the zipper was not cheap like I read in another review, and the little grip pads on both footies were all present. Didn't detach the feet, but the zippers did not appear loose or cheaply made. Should have gone with my gut and gotten a Medium to begin with.<br /><br />Update: received the Medium, fits as expected. She is a size 6.
B00QZ9DEDA|4|I like the color, and it just fits my baby, better to design the snap-fastener in the middle, coz when baby moves his leg will reveal... maybe the design is for attaching picture on the cloth.
B00R18YHYY|5|Really good quality. Love how sparkly it is. I am always getting compliments.
B00PV865DC|1|This watch faded really fast . Very disappointed! !
B00I0XXRRW|4|Fun dress...not for over busty women.
B00LGS04RO|4|comfortable
B007G520NW|5|Brought this as a birthday gift for my best friend and she loved it !  it looks exactly like the picture and perfect sizing!
B00EVPPGU4|4|This dress is nice but what I didn't like is the color I have verse the color in the picture are totally different. I like the purple that's shown but mine looks like a deep plum. No beuno. Also, the fabric is very thin
B0077CLVYS|4|Love it, i was always forgetting my wallet at work after pulling it out of my back pocket. Now i keep it in my front pocket all day, very comfortable. It easily holds 5 cards, you can fit more but then it becomes hard to remove them.
B00XBZMQJO|4|Fitted in the thigh, but nice shorts.
B000VZ5SOC|4|The other reviews were true in that it does come much more vibrant than is shown in the picture (I think due to shine) and the model for the product picture is perfect when the wig is not perfect in actuality.  I am satisfied with the product even though it isn't perfectly straight and curly at the bottom as shown in the photo.
B00IX0YE2E|4|This did not fit as expected, pants are too big go down a size if ordering other than that a beautiful bathing suit!
B00OJPRPEQ|5|Love it
B00CJJ6AYA|3|These gloves are comfortable, snug, and just what they look like. The quality of fabric was lower than i was expecting, as was the stitching, which started to fray at my thumbs from using my hands while wearing them. Even so, they are quality, I just don't agree with their price. Overall, a little disappointed.
B0045SQVEW|5|Perfect fabric. Perfect shirt. Perfect SAM MERLOTTE. I am a big fan of True Blood and SAM MERLOTTE <3 very pleased with this fast shipping.
B001O49ZHK|5|I have been done with all these fake little garter belts from the porn stores that never hold up my nylons. I wanted the metal clasps and this thing is badass! it shapes your tummy and has the metal claps. I LOVE this item.... it's a must buy!
B00BWTGUUC|5|Very comfortable and fits great.
B00535QB9Q|5|I got this for my husband on his bday, he loved it!! The shirt is made of great material and it looks really cool. Also it got here just in time.
B00IN8XNGO|5|i like it.
B000BRL0LU|5|Originally bought this hat to be Cousteau for Halloween. I started wearing it everyday anyway. Its warm, fits well and you will never get lost.  It finally turned into a lumberjack costume. If you are looking for a long beanie/red, this is exactly what you are looking for.
B00EF585YY|4|Very cute poodle pants but they run small.  Will have to order a size larger for both of my girls.
B00BPFJU32|1|Not true to size
B004HCQ55Q|5|I purchased this buckle for my son and it is nice quality. Received the item quickly and as advertised. I would recommend this purchase.
B007GCPIW0|4|Ordered this item and received it within a good time frame. It is a little too big for me. I usually wear medium tops, so I think an extra small would have given a more perfect fit. However, it works for me. Quality is good.
B003M0TP9C|5|This cardholder is stylish, chic and durable. I use it for my business cards and my commuter transit card. I love the novelty of it!
B00JAPC9B4|1|Stepped on the belt while barefoot and broke just as other had described, way too fragile for any sort of practical use.
B00BJOGONI|4|Reviews said long and large. Mine were large, but too short. In all fairness, I am 5'6&#34;&#34; and all legs- 34 inseam. Otherwise, they are so comfy and just the right weight to wear to bed! Order one size smaller than your usual size.
B00H8JIIL4|4|ok
B0085VM2CU|5|This came just as expected. No surprises, no disappointments, it's just a silver tie bikini top! :) I recommend to anyone who likes metallic colors.
B000KGIE8O|1|first I didn't like the color and it felt too small for the size.  It broke the same dy and i always went to dinner so i was sitting most of the time.
B00O4FQGXW|5|Has a bit of a strange fit in the shoulder and chest area (most likely just because I am bustier than this shirt was made for), I feel like if I had gotten it a bit bigger it would fit perfect. Still diggin it!
B00MXYBH4E|4|It's really cute. I am 5ft 126lbs and I usually wear a small or medium and size 5 pants. I got this in XL to be safe and should have gotten a large. It still is cute though and the XL covers my butt so I can wear it with leggings. This inside is silk it has pockets and a single clip in the middle to keep it together. Best price for the quality and I looked a lot. However took about 3 weeks to ship.
B00Q1EG19I|2|Not the quality I expected
B00G3AN51W|4|Great service, product as described. I was going by measurements and tape said I needed 34 for band size. It is very tight. If I order again I will go up a size in the band. Cup size was perfect fit.
B00FT2SVGO|5|This is super sweet and a nice soft material.  It runs a little bit so baby will have room to grow, which is great with how fast infants size up.  I love it.
B00VANVJUG|3|Cheap material. Had a hole in it when it arrived which I had to fix. Fit was just as expected though.
B00A2XM7T2|5|These Jeans are great.  I love the way the look and fit and they are not expensive.  I would recommend these and dollhouse to anybody.
B003CIX7SY|3|Good
B0079TRA7Q|3|Too large in the girth.  But it would keep you warm!  I would order a size down.
B00R20GCEO|4|This shirt is super cute but runs very long and big. I would say size down. I ordered a medium which is what I normally wear but this looks way too big.
B00P633NPK|4|I love this product, but it's a bit large.
B00KTHO7AI|5|Very nice fit, not tight at all.
B0012QRQSK|5|I've been wearing the Barely There Breathe camisoles nearly every day for the last year.  I love them except the straps, which tend to curl under and cut into my shoulders.  I wear silicone bra strap cushions with them to correct the problem, so it wasnt' a deal breaker.  My camisoles are worn out now after so much wear so off I went to buy new ones.  I found the Got Your Back version and bought a couple.  These are even better....the straps are softer and don't dig in.  Great fit, very comfortable with excellent bust support.  And the coverage in the front is a bit better, which prevents any breast overspill.
B0085U339W|4|It doesn't give me as much smoothing as I liked but I bought a large.  Maybe I should try a medium.
B00DSTEMP4|3|My Dad LOVES this shirt! It fit him well and was one of the best surprises he ever got. However I noticed that after a few months of normal wear it has developed a large hole in the armpit. Otherwise I'd give it a 5 star rating.
B00Y5BNX2W|4|Very nice shirt
B00ZYG00Y6|5|Like it, my kids go ice skating and this overalls really helps keeps them warm and dry. Need to check in winters though .. Overall like the buy!
B002NSM3UC|3|Order a size bigger then you think you  need otherwise  perfect
B00EOHUGFY|1|These still show
B00OUVOCQI|2|Love it but was way too small
B00CSINARW|5|My man loves the way these fit and the double colors, and I love the way he looks in them.
B0012YNA6E|5|I love soooo much this t-shirt!!! fits perfectly and true to size. Love the colors and the print... love Rolling Stones too of course!! Definitely recommend it!
B008P7YHE0|5|The fit is great and very comfortable. I love it.  I think I'm going to order it in black also. Very happy with it.
B00A5TLSUW|5|I like classic fishnet and I also like the lace garter. Believe it or not, I can never find them in one like this! Certainly stocking up now that I know they fit true to size.
B00V63AF6E|3|Works great for about 3 hours then stopped sticking.  But if you have a short event - it works great, just not for all day if you have bigger boobs.
B004I3ZSF2|1|This is the most ridiculous idea I've ever seen for a shirt.  SWA you should be ashamed of yourself.  You might actually end up with someone's blood on your hands with this idea.  Congratulations loser.  Hope Karma comes for you.
B005CPL1QA|4|very good quality
B000J3RRZO|3|Good material but its definitely not one size fits all.
B0089H4R8W|3|I ordered them for my sister who isn't in a women's size so they fit well but were small for a size 7
B00A6M1HH2|1|I was very disappointed with this biker cap it is so small it hardly fits needless to say I won't be ordering anymore of them.
B00AHTK4VE|4|I wear 26 inch waist jeans and this fitted well. Not too tight or loose.<br />The fabric is not too thin and stretches well.
B0065L8OWO|5|Perfect fit upon receiving it. I love SAMCRO.
B006TF7134|3|Item listed as NEWBORN, but the size a of a toddler or older.  Good things I know how to do alterations because I was able to reduce the size myself, and not ruin the set I had purchased as w shower gift.
B0080S67EM|2|The lens are good and good quality but I thought they would be darker and different from the regular dark lens that come in the glasses.
B00JJYR6I2|1|Its too small
B00931VPYM|5|Yeah, probably a better Halloween present, but it was a big hit with my HS sophomore.  Very math. Thanks Finn and Jake.
B005CBQJ6G|5|I needed a variety of wraps for a cruise and didn't want to spend a ton of money. For the price paid I rated this wrap 5 stars. The colors were as advertised and the fabric was decent. Don't buy this expecting it to feel like a luxurious silk pashmina.
B00FAPNDRM|5|good
B00L1LHSDE|4|Good  socks
B007R8OULS|5|he loves them.  a staple in my hubbys closet
B00MVTU3IW|5|love them
B00PRW74XW|1|It as the same problem as the other one
B00ET7KZ1O|5|It fits larger than she expected but it will be taken easily, She is very happy with the quality of the fabric and the length.
B00M3SG3OY|5|The jeans fit just as I expected. I paid almost 50% less for these jeans than a major high end department store was selling them for in my area. Thanks for your awesome prices amazon.
B00N1TA7KK|1|The fit is absolutely TERRIBLE. The dress runs extremely small and it is VERY short. Not even black stockings make it appropriate. The fabric is comparable to tarp, so unless you like chaffing, I wouldn't suggest buying it. The only saving grace would be to buy the dress two sizes larger than your normal size. And that alone is reason enough not to buy it.
B00A13GNUM|4|I'm glad I bought this dress. It is super cute and sexy, fits true to size, and feels like an easy wear. The bust line is perfect, it doesn't reveal too much however, the underarm section is open so whichever bra you wear will be visible with any movement of your arm. But its workable. Also, the length is ok to me but the dress does ride up a bit. Other than those two things, this dress is beautiful. And you cant go wrong with this price. I'm thinking about getting either the blue or the taupe - not sure which one just yet.
B001E2NI3O|5|I purchased this for the family Christmas party and was impressed with the quality. If anyone has an old suit laying around purchase this and you have a nice santa outfit. Very pleased. Cant wait to see it used this Holiday season.
B000Z6S3HQ|2|Only for natural small breasts
B00DB28TJ8|5|Comfortable,good coverage, good looking, & decent price.  34C fits me perfectly, don't see why other sizes wouldn't fit those who need them.  Would love if the specialized colors were the same price.  Right now they aren't and cost considerably more.
B008KJF94U|3|it was ok I taught it was going to have more stress in it but it did not and I am a tall person so I taught I would of get it long but it okay for now.
B000MV2DOI|5|Excellent T-shirt and the logo seems pretty durable.  I definitely recommend it.
B008HUMX0A|5|I bought a medium, usually wear a small. It started off looking like I was going to have to return it, but after washing it and drying it it shrunk and is now perfect. As long as it doesn't shrink anymore I'm happy
B003NX87UQ|4|I wish I would have gotten the solid black.  I have the black one with the white panels.  It's still a great jacket.  When I got it, it smelled awful.  I don't know how to describe the smell except as a cat urine smell.  It took about 5 washes to get rid of it.  I gotta take a star off for that.
B001JTARBS|5|Gloves are great, keep your hands warm, and they fit great. I still don't know how it will be on a very low temperatures but so far (about 0 Celsius) it is good.
B00C3XMHQM|2|Not worthwhile
B001AEB7PC|4|My Wrangler white jeans are exactly what I expected them to be.  Wrangler jeans fit me the best and my experience has always been a positive one.
B00PE41WH2|5|Wonderful!!! Love how it feels!!! I'm normally 7-8 and the L fits great!!! :)
B00MYE469Q|5|Feel like a sock should, do not fall down and do not constrict my calf muscles.
B00L699WHG|2|Unless you plan on to Outer Space with this Jacket I wouldn't get it. This thing has a sheen that must be made from NASA Flight Suit material. The picture shows a Silver Grayish Blue but this jacket is SHINY SILVER. Other than that it seems like a Good Quality Jacket.
B00E9HUOKQ|5|This bra fits great and looks great. This is the first time I have found a low plunge bra with cups that hold everything in and keeps it there! The lace tee is attractive enough that if it shows, I won't care. I normally wear a 36DD but ordered one cup size larger, a DDD and it is perfect.
B00B6E8O9I|5|Hapoy
B00DM279P2|5|Cute costume! Perfect for our family Star Wars theme Halloween!
B00OBE0Q1Y|4|Adorable and planned for shrinkage!
B008CQKXAQ|5|Bought this hoodie for my boyfriend and he wears it all the time, its super easy to wash comfortable and warm. Plus, who doesn't love playboy?
B00CIZCID2|4|Very nice.  Used this to dress a mannequin for a victorian Christmas window scene.,
B00DFK48JG|1|First off, these are not real Genie Cami Shapers and do not feel or fit like the real ones. The fabric is much thinner than the real item. The fit isn't as good. I would definitely NOT buy these if I knew what I would get.
B00G43OKXA|5|Beautiful fit. I love this top.
B00AX7G8H4|5|Perfect for holding all the bows!
B00HLY2XFI|5|It is perfect looks very nice on.
B00LLIVQNU|5|Fit perfect, doesn't roll up like others!
B00K1Y5T6A|5|Great cowgirl classic
B006V76FUU|5|Love these shorts.  They arrived quickly and did not have white stitching which I prefer. They are long enough and fit nicely around my rump and waist and thighs (where I run thick).  I usually wear a 10.  I am 5'2&#34; over 50 and curvy. The size 8 fit perfect.  These are just what I need for the beach and for taking my grandson on the water slides.
B00BUKCZ6Q|4|I bought the brick colored ones. These pants are soft, nice and fit well. The only thing I didn't like was that the color from the picture and the description states they're \\" brick\\". When they arrived they were actually much closer to red salmon / pink. I wish there was an option to upload pictures, i put them beside my Andorra red chino's and there is a significant difference. From the sellers picture it seems like they would've been the same color.
B00V38IF2I|5|Very beautiful dress. I'll be keeping an eye out for more lilax dresses
B00CV45698|4|Very well made, good fit, and nice looking bra.  It is easy to put on and off.  I recommend this.
B0034KMVGO|2|I'm not a tall person. I usually wear 29 inch length pants. There pants are about 4 inches too long.
B000R205B0|5|Very classy scarf of muted gold, pink, and gray tones onn ivory.  Very soft & shiny.
B00BPW4L66|5|This dress was more than I imagined it would be. I actually feel that I couldn't have chosen a better dress for my little girl to wear in my wedding. Thank God this was available.
B00QLGPJT4|4|Warm and stylish.  The yarn is a bit flimsy but it doesn't take much of a beating the way it is worn.  Just pop it over your head and it keeps the cold off your neck.  It did the job for me, and I got lots of compliments on the color.
B00J3Z3168|5|This hat was perfect for my 4 year old this summer. It stayed on and protected very well. We used it in the Florida sun and on the beaches of NJ. I would buy again.
B002EW74BA|4|These pants are a great addition to your workout. no bunching up and plenty of movement allowed. worn for running and streching these pants do exactly as expected and seem to hold up well in the wash.
B00SMRN2DU|2|It seems other buyers are getting counterfeits, mine seems to be genuine.<br /><br />Cons<br />Fails to cover the sides and below your eyes<br />Under some conditions I can see the reflection of my own eyes, distracting.<br />They are very uncomfortable, the nose pad arm is a rough metal and the temple is quite long and puts to much pressure in my head.<br /><br />BTW: Duco offered me a US$5 coupon if I edit my review and increase from 2 to 5 starts.
B00EG2LFLQ|3|Length was good,waist size runs small
B00MNGNN76|5|good.
B00411Y47O|2|The arms and head didn't light up and the new batteries died out twice quickly . I'm gonna try and return.
B00KIL2WH0|5|Super cute!
B005UOKZ3I|1|Didn't fit right
B00DQZ7HPW|4|Was looking for a lightweight rain jacket / windbreaker.  This fits the bill nicely.  I'm 6'6&#34;, 260 and the 2XLT fits perfectly.  The arms are long enough (perfect) and the jacket itself is also long enough (several inches below belt level).  The hood is not detachable and does not fold into the collar, but it's not overly intrusive.  I was aware when I bought it of this limitation so it can hardly be a complaint.  A removable hood would have made this jacket five star material.  Oh, and it's not cheap, but it is well made and seems worth the money.
B00BFPU2UC|5|Best tie dye shirts ever!
B00L6JF8ME|4|I just received this and I'm very happy with the purchase. I could've gone and spent 3-4 times this amount on a site like Mr S Leather for a pretty similar product and have absolutely nothing to show for the markup.<br /><br />It's just as sexy as I pictured it would look, so far it sits comfortably on my skin, and I'm sure it'll be a big hit at the leather bar.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because there's not an add-on available that can convert it into a full-body harness like a lot of similar harnesses have. It also took 10 days to receive and tracking it was a huge pain. The range for expected delivery was too large and was hard to plan to be at home to receive it. Thankfully it was compact enough that the mailman could put it in the mailbox and there was no risk of it being taken if left on my front door.<br /><br />Outside of that, this is worth every penny and is every bit as good as anything you can get for $100+ dollars from your upscale leather brands. I highly recommend it.
B00I16I01Q|5|This is a really great skirt and the price is just fantastic.  Expected lower quality, but was pleasantly surprised. I'm 5'4&#34; and 110 and the small fit perfect with a little room for shrinkage in the dryer. It's not too short and looks great with tights and boots. I'll be ordering the other colors for sure.
B000C4WNEU|5|I've tried a lot of boxer briefs for big men, but Munsingwear is the best by far.  Great fit and durable.  I only with they were made in a color other than white.
B00M2C9V90|5|Bought them for a friend. They were perfect fit. As expected and I even got heat pressed logos put on them. Great price!
B004L0Z0QO|5|I truly love the slouchy Gold Toe socks.  They're thick, and yet, still very soft.  Will probably buy more very soon.
B00412DFTG|5|Very nice
B002WKOCXC|5|I like the way this vest look on me & feel, length & size were as expected, 4 Stars from me.<br />Very pleased, nice item
B00EK5OGI8|5|I love this t-shirt.  I love the material... after a few washes, it fits like the first time.
B002SHUU26|4|This costume is exactly what you want it to be--nice, soft but fairly thin fabric, the hood fits nicely so you know it's Tigger.  The elastic at the legs makes the extra length work.  Came quickly.  I was worried that it would look more like pajamas than a costume, but it's just perfect.
B0060M6KYC|5|This slip skirt is absolutely perfect for any trumpet or mermaid wedding dress. I really like that it has the inner lining fabric from the knees to the ground that protects your legs from the scracthy tecture of the touelle. It also has a spandex waistband so it acts as shape ware also. Highly recommend.
B002HRE65Y|4|This is a beautiful coat- very well-made with tailoring details usually found on much more expensive clothing. The princess seam details in front and back are very flattering and the sleeve cuff detailing adds a unique touch.  The style is very elegant and classic and should work for nearly any body type. My only comment is that this is a lighter weight wool than I had expected. It will serve me well in transitional weather but is not for the extreme cold winter months - at least not without a lot of layers underneath. (FYI - I tend to get cold easily anyway, but for reference, this coat is not warm enough for me when the temperature drops below around 40 degrees.)  But I am very happy with my purchase - I have the winter white coat and always receive many compliments when I wear it. The lighter weight does allow for a greater range of movement and is not bulky at all, which also makes it more comfortable to wear than a heavier weight wool.
B00KNB9E94|5|These socks are thin (which I love, living in a hot climate), comfy and delightful.  They also wash up really well. Blue Q makes stuff that puts a ginormous smile on my face.
B00J63CMSA|4|They fit well and I like the cut.  The material is so so.
B001ULD8IO|3|Shirt is not dirty white...its bright white...and the entire image is in Half-Tone (dots) ...which makes it look not original at all..I enjoy the shirt but was definately disappointed
B00KEHUJW8|3|Fits great, cheap material but durable and breathable. You get what you pay for with this.
B00HD6RMU0|5|Love these cargo shorts.<br />I'm a slim guy and they fit me quite well considering.<br />Very comfortable and look great.  Not to short at all.  Very glad that I found/purchased them.
B004159DIU|5|I bought this for my size 14 (youth) It fit perfectly for him. But I think it would be very small for a small man. My grandson is about 4'10 and weight 90 lbs.
B000I1Z1N2|5|Best jeans ever made. Very durable , last a long time. I switched to Carhartt years ago after having my Levi's fall apart in less than a year.
B002WQP3MK|4|A good product at a good price.  Our hot tub is on the north side of our house and there is often a cold breeze blowing when we go out.  These robes keep us warm ad wick away the moisture.  We've considered buying more for when guest come over.
B00NEOQ9VS|5|great product with great service
B00B7YI3EI|5|nice quality; soft, thick (warm) material
B00H1SIMS6|5|Sexy pants. This pants are making me feel gorgeous. I am 5,2 inch tall and 130 pounds the end of the second trimester and have short lags. This skinny pants are making me sexy even thoug my bally is big and notecible. Love them, made for me!
B006Z8GHYO|3|Fine for what it's intended purpose.
B004K04ZDE|5|The fit is great, the look of the mesh and colors is great.  My lady friend said it was very very comfortable too!
B00LUMF0HK|5|linen blend.. Not my favorite material but a very nice looking shirt.  My husband is 5'9&#34; and this is the PERFECT Length. Unline the Harriton M560 Barbados shirt, in case you are looking at those.  (For a tall guy, it is a very nice shirt  but probably two inches longer than this one)  Anyway, this shirt is very dressy and my husband likes it.  Dry clean is the only downfall.
B005YEVVHI|5|Excellent
B001MKBS7Q|5|Purchased for my grandson so that he could be a scarey politician for Halloween. It exceeded out expectations and will double as true formal wear should an event come up before he outgrows it. Well made for a great price!
B00BI4RMHQ|5|Very nice
B00PUWQUKW|5|I bought this T-shirt for my 15 year old niece.  She's a huge fan of Pit Bulls & Parolees and she absolutely LOVES it!  The T-shirt is a nice quality and the colors are very vibrant
B00ED7QB72|5|Fits great and hides everything I want to hide, yet still looks stylish, not &#34;old lady&#34;
B00N5XFJR8|4|Fits well and made well.
B00008ELTC|1|I have recently purchased 2 of these bra's and am returning one of them.  They are nothing like described.  I am a DD and have been told by doctors and chiropractors to wear a sports bra.  This is by far a &quot;sports bra&quot;.  It is just like a bra that I could purchase from a local department store with the difference of it being more bulky.  As for support; forget it, there is none!  It's uncomfortable to wear and doesn't help my back in any way!
B008UC7R7E|5|por ser excelente
B005U7BOIK|4|I bought this shirt for my 11 yr old son and it fits him kind of small. He's average size (not skinny but solid-not fat) and it would have been better a size larger. He loves it and wears it but I may order a size larger if available.
B00JC10ULM|5|So comfortable! My husband things I am sexy in this!
B003ZYDXHA|4|comfortable, light, great price
B00GWR2A3K|3|like the look, but haven't had it very long.
B00ATVS9MQ|1|When you wash the socks (gentle cycle) the tops come apart, cheaply made.  I returned product.
B00UMS8WUU|2|First off, this cover up is very big. Second, it is an off white color and not white like in the picture. It isn't the best quality either. I would probably not buy this item again or recommend it. However, I am going to use it anyway.
B0009GE3DK|5|I work in an environment where I must be neat but also do physical work quite a bit. I have bought 3 of these shirts and find they wash and where very well. A great value for the pricr.
B003B5YVKG|5|Got this for my son for Halloween. He is young, but we went with an adult one because he is very tall. the quality was great. You need to be careful with the velcro on the gold belt and wrists. It is just glued on. If you are gentle opening it, you will not have a problem. It worked great for us.
B00EIBIB4Y|1|Did not expect dress to have so much gold stitched throughout. Fit is good but the material is rough and stiff.
B00OOBD576|5|A little bigger than expected, at time find myself using this as a blanket but no complaints the material was soft and it kept me warm!
B008KCKA50|5|This jacket is perfectly sewn from high quality leather. It is warm and comfortable in the cold. I will be wearing this jacket for years to come. Definitely a great deal.
B0052R9CQO|4|I love the look of these gloves and the touch pads on the thumb and pointer finger work great on my touch screen iPhone. I do wish that the middle finger had a touch pad as well since I often use it to scroll or swipe. However, these are overall great gloves.
B00C6FKTEE|4|Really like these pants fits well .. I did notice In between the legs from rubbing the material was balling up a little . But other than that good fit and good for work .. Comfortable ..
B005IFK9TE|5|I had been looking for a large red wrap that was versatile and light in weight, but also a bit warm when needed.  This is exactly what I was looking for and very pleased with it.  This is perfect for throwing around you for any occasion.  So glad I bought it.
B00JJ4NYME|2|MY SON LOVED IT - UNTIL IT WAS WASHED ONE TIME AND THE LETTERS STARTED FALLING OFF.  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.  SON EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED, WASTE OF MONEY IF YOU CANT WASH IT WITHOUT THE LETTERING COMING OFF.
B00TJ4RXLW|3|THE COLOR AND MATERIAL ARE GOOD FOR THE PRICE, BUT SOMEWHAT LOOSE ONE.
B002U7T3D6|1|This hat sucks. Don't buy unless it's for a child. It's too small for an adult's head and the material is super cheap. I can see through it.
B008NCYBJ8|4|I bought two of this leggings in black and I`m happy with them. The look really small but they fit mi size 12/14 body just fine and they are really comfortable. I will say that they are a bit sheer so they should be worn under a dress or long shirt
B000B920UI|1|wow.... I wanna hire whomever took the picture of that mask up there because what you get is NOTHING like it... What you get is a piece of large foam like a frisbee painted kinda like a Jason mask and eye holes punched outta it...
B000PCXDLG|4|Quite comfortable, but it does not separate like I would like it too. I kept it though as it's comfortable and looks fine under clothing that does not have lower necklines. It's nice to not have an underwire, which really is the bra you want for separation.
B00HFJL72Y|4|Love it!!
B004M6UD46|5|Very happy with this wallet.  There's plenty of room for many cards. I've not found the credit card slots too tight - if you don't overpack the wallet.  Some reviewers complain of the wallet's odor. Goodness!  It's genuine lambskin and has that (pleasant) aroma, as if you were entering a fine leather or shoe shop.  Handsome, stitching is fine, and the quality/cost ratio can't be beat.
B007JYUUIC|5|Used it on a cruise.  Compact, easy to carry, the creases come out easily.
B00G9AWMXI|5|my only complaint is that the left sleeve has 2 inches open seam. poor QC otherwise it is great and warm
B00GXJEJCM|4|I find this suit runs a bit small but still fits ok.  material is strong, color is great would reccomend
B00RXZUNIE|3|Low cut on my daugter
B001J8GKD8|5|Ordered a size up for my very petite daughter. Fits great! They are very soft and help keep her warm without any bulk. Order arrived promptly without issues.
B00EDTLOCM|4|Sizing is a tad large and they are insanely long.  Only option is to have them hemmed.  I was worried that they might be small, because they are advertised as &#34;junior&#34;.  Ive been looking for some plus sized jeans with that bold stitching, but not too much bling.  At $25, I'm thrilled with this purchase.
B00B3WCV74|5|Person who got it likes it.  They said it got there on time and that it fits with no problems. .
B00M8BNNZ8|5|Sturdily built from quality material. Attractive. Very reasonable priced for wgat you get.
B00CSSAU9I|5|Love the shirt, but the size seems to run 1/2-1 size smaller than indicated, so had to order a larger one
B00PGW0K2A|5|Quality materials. Great for School and Church. My grandson loves it.
B00593G7L4|3|sizes are very tight, do not stay flannel is the regale my cousin
B00L5ZAQ0I|5|They were so adorable and just what I was looking for.
B002KBDWYS|5|These gloves arrived in good time.  They are wonderful - very comfortable.  I love them.
B001JT8M4M|4|Great for bartending in October
B000LUU6BM|3|Smaller than I expected.
B00I5ZA37W|3|I wear 7 for all mankind almost exclusively.  these were a little tight
B003AYUKE4|3|But it was the wrong size.  I would definitely buy this shirt again in the correct size, but they were sold out.  I will come back in the future to see if I can buy it in the correct size.  i would recommend.
B00KLYL0C2|5|*** ENCORE THANK YOU ALLWAYS ***
B00ACIFT7Y|4|Nothing fancy but they fit and have no obvious flaws.  Black matches everything, and tagless is nice.  Note these come slightly oversized and will shrink a tiny bit on the first wash & dry.
B00RWI8O5Q|1|Extremely short. If you have a big butt, do not buy. I bought an XL (which i normally fit a M) and it was extremely short and fit like a shirt almost. Very see through also. Not like the picture at all.
B00O40PBCY|5|A little tight, but I like it.
B00EVFQK6I|4|I purchased these pants when I was pregnant and my belly was showing, which was around the third trimester. They were comfortable during my pregnancy and still comfortable now over a year later. The great thing is that they have a stretchy waste band so it stretches perfectly to a full-term belly. Unfortunately, once you lose all of your pregnancy weight (and then some in my case) there is no drawstring to cinch them tighter. There are holes for a drawstring, but they are just part of the destroyed look that these pants have, which I like. In other words, there is no drawstring and even if you wanted to add your own, it's possible, but with a slight alteration. I made four holes on either side of the side seams. They have a pocket which I use to put my phone in while my hands are full holding my baby. The pants keep me warm during colder nights. And the hoodie that matches these pants is equally as warm and comfortable.<br /><br />Since they do have a destroyed look to them, you do have to be careful when washing them. Stick to the gentle cycle when washing to prevent additional destruction of the already destroyed pants. Or place them in a mesh bag as to avoid excess friction and agitation with these pants. They won't fall apart at the seams, but there are loose strings that are part of the destroyed look that could continue to loosen. I use biodegradable detergent from Costco and on occasion use OxiClean in the load just because I like to get my clothes extra clean on occasion. I dry them in a normal heat cycle in a silly attempt to shrink them, but they have not shrunk. They have held up well for me. And I expect them to be around for many years based on the way that I use them (around the house mainly or to bed) and wash them (with special attention).
B00KB33GAW|5|My son wears 24 months/2T and we bought the larger 4T based on reviews. They are a perfect fit. Super cute and he loves them.
B00O29V5SG|5|My husband loves the design of this vest, but although we ordered the XL (and he's a US Med) it was still snug.  Order larger sizes up from the usual.  My husband does have a broad chest, if that helps with sizing.
B00B3Q8T3A|5|This little jacket is thin, but really keeps my daughter dry.  She loves this coat so much.  We took a trip to Ireland and it did a fabulous job of keeping our 2 year old dry.  Just put a sweater under to keep her cozy.
B00Q81T8QC|4|These shorts look great - they have that nice combination of not being that baggy, but having stretch in them so they're not constricting. Unlike the photo, the shorts hit just below the knee, which is not my preference. When playing tennis, I just deal with it, and if I'm wearing them casually, I roll the waistband to hike them up a bit. Head makes a 7&#34; version, but not in white. If you prefer your shorts to hit above the knee and the color you want is available in the 7&#34;, I'd go with that.<br /><br />The zippered pocket is really nice. Easily holds some credit cards and cash securely.<br /><br />The white is a little see-through, so light colored underwear is a must!
B00BPAHL74|5|Finally found a nice mid-heavy weight Rugby shirt that fits as described!  Very Pleased with this purchase.  Tried the Polo shirt and it was way too thin and the neck opening was extremely small.
B00SIS6I02|5|I needed a medium although I usually take a large, but it is very well made and has understated style that is casually elegant. The pleat in the back still hangs completely closed when not in motion as intended. Fabric is great. Needs a little spray starch after laundering.
B00HY89PP2|5|I love these leggings so much! Fit as expected.
B00JJYMRN6|5|😊
B00F9T3H1G|4|Smooth material, loved to wear it
B00GYI0H14|4|Pleasantly surprised with how nice this shirt is.
B00F8K2GEK|5|Best of all I have ever owned,ever...
B0087OU97U|5|Soft, organic cotton keeps my baby warm and cozy at night. I love that these jammies are real quality material, not thin and cheaply made like most baby clothes out there today. I ordered one in 6months, then 9 months.. Getting ready for 12 months! Worth every penny.
B00L2LJA7A|4|Nice overall
B00NXWSWP2|4|A little large but warm in this cold weather. Glad I purchased them
B00ARDVIE2|5|I couldn't have picked a better dress for my daughter. It has all the colors in it that she loves. It is so easy to pair it with one of her bright colored t-shirts. I does fit a little tight in the shoulders, but other than that it's a great dress!!!
B000H6YQTS|4|The style is a little more urban than I am used to.   It seems to be well made and easy care.
B00GJ3IF4K|5|These are great for my daughter that will not wear bathing suits.<br />=)
B00D2WSSEI|4|love it
B00FTDH2JU|5|The dress fit perfectly!  I love the little black flare design, it helps to give you this hour glass figure. But I advise to wear a body shaper with it if u have a little fat in ur tummy area. I'm happy with it!
B00NHK07DA|4|Very nice dress for the money
B001GNCWKG|3|Go check out my other Dockers Pants reviews -> They all pretty much say the same thing: \\"Leave the pleats far behind and definitely stick with the flat front\\".  The D1's are much nicer too being more narrow for slim builds and a younger look.  They are much more flattering and fit way nicer - you'll get by far MORE COMPLIMENTS!!  We bought a TON of these and any exchanges were taken care of immediately at no charge to us!!  Beware of the color matching & sometimes they are sized correctly...I've had to make exchanges because of this.  Overall, we are very happy!! :) :)
B00KQY4LTG|5|This is really excellent quality and you even can consider it as a jegging .For me it is even better than the &#34;HUE&#34; one because it has more stretch.<br />For the size ,I am 5' 4&#34; and usually I wear 8 or 30 for the jeans.I bought size S/M and it fits me perfectly. The length is right at my ankle.
B004M4CTA4|5|These T-Shirts are so realistic and so special, I wish you had them in children sizes. My grandkids Loved them, and wanted me to get some for them. If you ever do please E-Mail me. I will need a few.
B002DW6Z7K|4|In my search for a tasteful business card holder that reflects my love for music, this one really caught my eye and was love at first sight. I was happy to receive my purchase within a reasonable amount of time, but the design is a little more yellow than shown in pictures. The material is also less sturdy than I had hoped - bends, dents and squishes easily with just a bit of pressure so I don't expect this will last more than a few years tops.    I still love the design and wouldn't discourage purchasing, but know you may be in the market for another one after a few years.
B00LMFI9F0|5|I love NYDJ they always fit. I have several pairs and really like them all.
B00080M1OU|5|I really like not having a big, thick wallet tempting me to put all kinds of useless crud in it. With the \\"Regatta\\", I have plenty of room for cash, drivers license, three credit cards in individual pockets, and a handy catch-all pocket for odds 'n ends. Odds 'n ends equals: business cards (mine or those I collect), coupons, receipts, scraps of paper and so on.<br /><br />It's really all I ever need, and it's about a quarter-to-a-fifth the size of a regular wallet.<br /><br />If you've never tried this type of wallet, it's worth considering. If you're looking for a good product of this type, this one is plenty good, with nice proportions, nice features and leather that feels like quality.
B004TXXE3Y|5|I bought this robe for my son who is 9.  It is the perfect size for him. I saw some robes at Target but they were  made of a synthetic material and I knew it would not absorb anything.  This robe is soft, and cottony.  I love it.  Wish I had one.  He is going to love it.
B00HNETJX0|5|My husband loves his Jimi Hendrix shirt...shipping and the fit and quality were perfect!!
B00VGXFTVA|5|It has a relaxed, feminine fit. No tight. Fits nicely.
B00CH1ND2M|5|The color and pattern are as advertised. Five stars for fit and feel. For durability we will have to wait and see.
B00CXRLBPQ|5|This wallet is perfect for organizing all your additional cards. I was able to replace my bulky all in one leather wallet with a combination of this wallet and a tiny leather wallet i got for keeping essential cards and some money. I use this wallet as the secondary wallet and use it only when required.  Now my jeans don't have a huge bump in the front. Product looks good and has good latch so it won't open accidentally.
B00FF09PSI|4|its a flattering fit. It's not easy to find fitted tops that lay like they are supposed to across my chest, so I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00QWRDBYW|1|Wow I am so sad brought this dress a month ago and just now trying it on because I have been so busy and it doesn't fit for my graduation tomorrow and I ordered red and black it is more of a peach color
B000ACCMGS|3|The tights are of good quality, but the waistband is very diggy, and cuts you off in the middle. I keep them as my spare tights.
B00JU55QMI|4|I really love CK'S dresses.  This dress has a strange kind of shape for someone who has no hips whatsoever.  I'm pretty straight, with no butt to speak of and no hips.  If you have hips and a butt, you will love this.  It has stretch and has an allotment for the hip, thigh and butt area.  It's not scratchy to me at all.  Lies really smooth, flat even with panty hose or tights under neath.  It definitely hits above the knee, which I like.  I purchased booties to go with (as in the photo) and got lots of compliments.
B00EK93AVI|4|This dress is beautiful, not short at all and very comfortable. I was expecting to receive it in about a month, but it came before that. I would definitely recommend it.
B003QNEZBI|3|Constantly had to keep pulling it down but did help out my back a lot.
B0011MYR1Y|4|Great bra. Worth the price if you want to avoid having 1 giant superboob. Keeps the girls separated & has a bead to keep track of which side you last nursed. I gave it 4 stars because the straps are gigantic so you can't really wear any sort of tank or sleeveless top with it.
B0084HTWYG|5|I have no idea how warm this scarf is, but according to my daughter, it's the coolest thing EVER.  It's not super soft, but it's thick.  My daughter is a tall 9 and it's not too big on her at all.
B000GJL84W|5|This was the cutest outfit and my daughter has been able to wear it to school.  It has held up in the washing machine and it was a great buy.  Product came in a timely manner which is much appreciated.  Highly recommend seller
B00EZ5MVDU|5|very comfortable, and as long as you know how to size kilts youll get a great one, looks amazing and i will definately be back if i need more, even arrived much sooner than the expected delivery date
B00CII3QLW|5|This is a very cute fashionable top. it is thin and cottony. Iam 5'7\\" 145 and it fits just a bit smaller than the model. Not much. forever 21 like quality and I received it in the mail in abut 17 days.
B00H8J0D2G|3|The cup is exactly my size, but for some reason the right side kept spilling out. Not the best so now I only wear it with form fitting clothes.
B00G5QUZ8U|5|Fit perfectly! Will be ordering again!
B004ZJZ462|5|Hatley make the fabulous PJs a boy can have. They are soft, fit in all the right places and wash well and come in fabulous designs. The dinosaur set are also a big hit. Not much more to say really.
B00BXQ4WRM|1|I have over a dozen Wallaroo Hats.  I love them, they are always a good fit and have a draw string in the hat which allows it to be made smaller if it is too big.  It is a great product.  In the past, I have purchased my many hats from Wallaroo directly.  They have always come in their own box and look exactly like the picture.<br /><br />Unfortunately when this hat arrived, it was folded in half 3 times and was the size of a check-book cover.  I was astonished.  Although these hats state that they are crushable, I think that is only for a short period of time, because I have never folded my dozen hats like that.  As I expected there were many crease lines in the hat.  I left the hat out on my screened in porch for over a week hoping the humidity would settle the creases out.  And again, as I expected it did not.<br /><br />The product is great....the packaging was TERRIBLE!!!!.  I cannot send this as a gift and will have to return it.  Now my gift will be late.  Very disappointed and will only order from Wallaroo directly in the future.
B00422M6FY|5|Good quality
B00COG9JUU|5|This is a very nice chambray shirt with lace.  I really like it.  It's a little fitted and I might have ordered a larger size if I didn't like it so much and wanted to wear it and not wait.  Good shirt!
B00I0M3XYA|4|No issues so far. Only used for gym. No binding or pulling. Good allowed range of motion for squats/deadlifts. Fabric isn't too heavy so no extra sweating issues.
B001H0FBUG|5|Wonderful gloves. What I expect to receive when I order Isotoner gloves. Leather sewn on the outside. Fits wonderfully. Smells like leather. Love, love these gloves.
B00422MCVM|5|Perfect!
B00H4SWMIO|5|Great dress.  Very elegant looking, good fit and proportion.  Colour same as show on the website.  Highly recommended for all.
B00AZGILSC|1|THIS FITTED VERY POORLY....  The stictches popped during the first use. The printings on some of the dress were faded . there was one particular  dress where the skeleton had  no ribs printing...... so emberassing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CQUI6BW|5|THESE ARE MOST DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE PAIR OF PANTS EVER.THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE & FLEXIBLE.NOT TOO TIGHT OR LOOSE FITTING.IVE HAD MULTIPLE PEOPLE ASK WHERE I GOT THEM FROM.I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ALMOST ANYONE TO GET.
B006ORG5RU|5|Got the light black, love the wash, looks great. The stitching is a bit weird on the coloring, but it still looks good and works well. Fits me perfectly. I have a weird body type so its hard to find jeans that fit well. I have very thick calves and theighs, but relatively skinny ankles. Unless there is a huge disparity between your theighs and ankles, don't buy these, just get 514s. I really don't get how the other people reviewing this didn't realize that a tapered fit is going to be alot skinnier in the lower calves area. Don't listen to their stupid reviews.
B00CLCW8AU|2|the quality is very poor, after first washing it became larger and lost shape, I wont recommend it to anyone
B00CHRK8GA|5|Very nice shirt. Fits as expected and well made.
B002YFX0JW|5|Very happy with purchase. Good quality ,very sturdy leather, and ample space for cards and bills. Can even hold passport.Would recommend anytime.
B00DSZMOIK|5|LOVE THIS BLOUSE! gorgeous. people love it too. I wear it often.  the beading is very nice. looks like a classy blouse. very inexpensive.
B00FM1DFP4|1|The material in these pants is so thin that it is not possible to wear them out of the house.  They are too thin for me to even wear them as pajamas.  I was very upset at the quality for the price.  They are also very small.  I wear a size 8 and I ordered a size large since I read from other reviews that they ran small.  The large was skin tight!  I hate false information!!
B009SPJ4X2|4|They were good quality for seamless socks.  I would like them to really have no seam at all, not even in the toe.
B005EVQ3EW|4|London Fog is a great brand and I like the overall design and feel.  The size is not exactly as expected as sleeves are longer and the middle is bulky.
B00028B4YG|3|Everything fits fine.  My problem was I thought they were going to be denim. It was my mistake
B0029NY9H6|5|Have worn this for three years. I get a new one each year due to wear and tear, but these wear better than other brands!  Like it a lot.
B000QWA2L4|5|I am a size 8 and can wear a M/L in clothing. I purchased a M which is a 8-10 and it fits perfect! tight enough to sweat and have my mid section looking firm and my curves looking amazing. I wore this at work all day then to a yoga class after and had no problems with it at all. It's very comfortable and I'm really really glad I bought this.
B006PI0IUI|5|Very durable
B00A5POI1M|4|My grandson loves it and I did not have to run around the mall looking for the color in his size. Wears well.
B00AZ6OJHE|4|fells good
B00WS9KV2I|5|Very pleased with the delivery time and product, will look nice on my alice pack.
B0007X1CQG|5|I love this shirt!! I had no idea how beautiful the color (buttercream) was until we purchased it and was able to see it up close. The feel is silky and we love it. This is worth the order....
B00GIC7FUM|4|I didn't read the sizing in detail until AFTER I made the purchase so the XL is definitely too large for my height and I'm 5'7&#34;. However, it's so dang cute and comfy soft that I'm keeping it anyway and wearing it for Halloween this year. It took approximately 10 business days to receive so keep that in mind when purchasing. So glad I got it in time when the expected arrival date was in November. The ONLY reason I am giving it 4 start is I wish it had a back panel to allow going to the bathroom as I've seen in some other onesies. In any case, it's freakin' awesome and I'm totally going to get others from this seller!
B0038MLM36|3|High quality shirt. Tight stitching and soft. The problem is that it made for giants. I always wear a large or medium. I'm a 16.5 with 34 sleeve length and the medium size was way too big.
B00LCRIR9G|2|small
B00AHAGI90|2|My daughter is winnie the pooh and this one is rabbit hole created to stuck
B00J9U4LVG|5|My daughter loved it!
B000V196NU|5|Just what I wanted. Thanks
B0045EPNB8|3|From below the chest to the neck , shoulder, is fit ok.<br />From stomack down to hip is too snug;my daughter is not a fat girl anyway My wife have to release the seam ( both side )<br /> to make it loose but don't have much left to loose.
B000JL8ZA2|5|I am so amazed by this! I got exactly what I had hoped for! It's comfortable to wear! Any adult or child cosplaying will have a blast wearing this fun accessory. I ordered one of these necklaces from a different company before but this company is way better than the other one. The beads are sleek and the claws have neat crackle designs to give it that oriental finesse.
B000W75X7G|5|I bought this backpack for my daughter when she started Kindergarten.  We are now halfway through first grade and it still looks like brand new.  It is extremely durable and holds everything she needs.  Despite the fact that it is made for smaller backs to carry, her folder for class fits perfectly plus all the other stuff she tots back and forth.  I like the separate pocket in the front to put extras as well.  The only thing it doesn't have is a compartment to put a water bottle.
B000IVGAAK|5|At the price I ordered mine, I bought another to give as a gift.  I really like this cardigan.  It's very lightweight and will go with many of my dress tops.  You can dress it up or down.
B00B6E8YXY|4|Fit good
B00GP626GY|1|Not was I was expecting.  Returned.
B00707SLDO|5|FEELS GOOD!
B00CRXPWLA|4|It fix perfect but the material aint tha good but people shouldnt expect better for the price so im not complaining, im 5.2  and 108lb
B00K8QL3JI|4|My son really likes them
B001MWRZ8U|5|I've been saved a few times by this shirt already.  I've hang up this shirt after unpacking from a cross country flight and by the time I need it the next morning, the wrinkles are gone.<br /><br />The shirt is comfortable and the collar has kept it's shape through my multiple cross country business trips the past 3 months.
B00DTH2N2O|3|I've always liked NYDJ.  These run small.  They also have the a raided look that is popular now with the younger set.  They will be more comfortable when I lose 5 pounds and will be fine for a walk to the neighborhood coffee shop or grocery store.
B00972GCYA|5|It is as preatty as you see in picture!!! I really love how it fits in my niece and the size is right
B00K4CJ6TA|1|The tie looks great but after wearing it only 4hrs the fibers are freying where I tired it together making it look fuzzy.
B00DEWVJ88|2|I red the reviews before ordering this shirt and since people recommended to go for one size bigger, I did so. Don't do it. I'm usually size M, in few cases S, so I ordered L, and it was huge. I could seriously put a sweater underneath. On the other hand, it is true that Levi's fits in a weird way many times, I have shirts in S, M and L....So, go figure,,, At least, the return was easy and I already got my money back!
B00JQQSV8C|4|excellent
B008CV679W|3|The dress is beautiful but it is somewhat small through the chest and shoulder area.I guess I should have gotten a bigger size even though I normaly wear a 16.
B00SKM4FHO|4|So far seems like a pretty good shirt. Washed & dryed them...shrunk just a bit, they fit better now.
B005LC303G|5|This fits great and is exactly what I expected from looking at the picture!  One of my new favorite dresses!
B00H8PMP9E|5|This dress is stunning and very well made! I wore it for my engagement pictures and am so happy I did! It is very figure flattering, the fabric is gorgeous, and the color is lovely.
B00JOAM8IE|5|This top can be dressed up to be glam or dressed down to look nice with a pair of jeans and sandals. I travel a lot, and it does well in a suitcase. I'd highly recommend it if you're looking for a versatile top that looks great.
B00KXOSP8C|1|Don't waste your money. This is not a compression shirt. The material is very thin and cheap. Wish I had not ordered this. I'm stationed overseas so it's not even worth it to pay to ship it back. Very disappointed.
B00BP61534|4|I like this belt for the most part. It has a great look and functions as easy as would be expected.  The material is durable but the surface does scuff fairly easily.  Overall it has served by well.
B00FW89THU|5|Fits well. Comfortable, soft and does not bind in any direction. Stays in place and washes easily.
B00CAA0L7U|5|Was a big hit at the party. Fit as described
B00AAQ11DY|1|I am well blessed in the chest area and ordered a XL accordingly. Very compressing and not flattering as seen in the photo
B006LX3JEY|4|I like this product still, I recommend to purchase.<br /><br />The price is too in keeping with.<br /><br />I will still purchase the product of this store later on.
B00P26ABEC|5|My normal size is large. Sleeves were a bit tight, but I was fortunate to select (L- inside tag said XXXL). Next shirt I select will be (L- inside tag XXXXL). Quality of material is excellent. Marian
B0006I46W4|5|I am very, very pleased with my purchase of these briefs.  I just wish I had bought more!  They fit perfectly, wash well, and feel good.
B007M684IK|5|Saw the reviews that said it was somewhat small so I ordered the large ( 5'7 150lbs) and it fits perfectly, doesn't shrink in the wash, comfy T.
B000T8D27Q|5|This bra is super easy to use at night and has just enough support to make you feel comfortable at night. True to size. I love it!!!
B00JVUO3NA|4|Purchased this for my boyfriend, and he loved it! It fit as expected, the material felt great and several washes later, it hasn't stretched out or lost its color. Good product. Well worth the price (even though I would not have minded if it was a bit less expensive. Lol).
B00I4WG3Y8|4|Fits snug, shows curves. Lots of complements
B007FCF5CY|1|No star cause it was not exact as the picture , came with parts removed or not included .
B00HF2P1BO|5|I got one pair of these as a gift. I decided to get another in a different color. These are very comfortable. I love the pouch in the front. It makes your package stick out a bit in tight pants (I'm not complaining, just warning you if you are conservative). The material is solid and good quality.
B00LGQ6EOI|1|I'm a big fan of Johnny Was.  I was excited to add this piece as a staple to my wardrobe.    The piece is way to big.  I always wear a large in this brand.  Too heavy.  I know this is long sleeved and crochet but was extremely disappointed because it was just overall to heavy.  My expectations of Johnny was...Chic. Beautiful material.    This was bulky and material not at all up to their standards.    Returning and will not repurchase.
B00RVMXG42|5|My daughter kept asking for Anna's coronation necklace and after looking around I decided to get this one. I am so pleased and excited to give it to her (birthday present) the black necklace is soft on both sides and very durable, the medallion is bigger than expected and has a nice weight to it, and the necklace length is adjustable. I ordered the smaller size as she is 3 (turning 4) and it seems to be the perfect fit (I compared to her other necklaces) and being adjustable it won't be outgrown anytime soon, certainly not before her costumes. Great product, worth the price, highly recommend!
B005WWZOK2|2|These jeans aren't meant for someone with a narrow waist. The waist is way too big for me, but if it were smaller, the jeans wouldn't fit over my hips. I was excited about the idea of pull on pants, but they just don't work for me.
B001H0F44O|5|I am 5'11\\", 170 pounds.  The medium size fits me.<br /><br />The shorts are very breathable.  Great for workouts.  They are just the right length, not too long, not too short.  I love them.
B0067T27KO|5|I had bought these slippers at a local shop a couple of years ago. I could not find them anymore, UNTIL I found them on Amazon.com!<br />They are exactly the same, I love them! They are so comfortable and they wash really nice. I will be ordering more of them soon.
B00EJXALU8|5|Nice and comfy
B00JREQQB2|4|Boyfriend loves it
B005149STO|1|Bleed dye when washed, none of them were 20x20. They were not even square! I ended up throwing them in the garbage.
B000J45N2W|4|Product is good--the snug fit is acceptable, however.  And the price is right.
B00997L6R6|4|I bought a small and I am 5'7&#34; at 125 pounds. The top is a little tight but its it still looks great and isn't too small. The length goes to my knees, a little longer than in the picture. This dress is great. Really comfortable. Highly recommend.
B00U5LAE7I|5|Great fabric, neat cut, I love it!
B00817KTZU|5|A really fun hat for the Mutant Turtle lover. And timely right now with the current movie.
B001PO6CT8|5|My son prefers these to jockey (regular and classic) because of their fit and feel.  I prefer them because they seem to stay white longer than other brands.
B003XY17DO|5|goo
B003JH8SSM|2|I don't like it, very small
B00BPFJIYI|5|Bra straps are a little long and my nipples are very visible through the bra, but overall the costume is perfect. It actually looked a lot better when I opened it and looked at it in the mail than whats shown in the picture. It sucks that the red stockings and the stethoscope aren't included, but I can't complain. I just wish there was a way where I could buy them separately. Oh but I love how the hat is like a headband on my head! Finally a lingerie costume that has a hat that won't fall off!
B00AW83GP6|4|I like it, don't love it. But I wore it often in chilly weather so that says something! Purchased a Small. I'm 5'2 and...uh, average weight. Yeah, let's say that.
B00KNXS6RS|5|Well priced, well fitting, true color thermal. My husband likes it and has worn it consistently. Softens with washing, which I expected. Good buy!
B0069CWQ8C|5|I love this mask, I bought it for my holiday event at work and it looks great. Really god quality and was delivered in perfect conditions.
B00QHUXCD4|4|The top fits nice but the bottoms are a little small. Good quality!
B001CL8J7W|2|This coat is really nice, except that it does NOT have circle snap closure.   It is a round traditional button front closure.   I wanted snap closure, so was very disappointed between the description and the actual garment received.   If you want a traditional button closure, this is a fine item.
B002GK3RMK|1|Could not work with the hair at all.  Would not part or put in ponytail.  Too still.  I would not recommend.
B00UXK9TQ8|1|The dress was not the advertised size. I would not recommend this product or company.
B00KI3VR1A|5|They fit perfect and you fell comfortable
B008JHO50W|5|it is very cute style and the colore very nice and i can weare any time in the morinig and very stylish very good
B00S4NUQN6|1|horrible material. looks like it cost .25 cents to make. Just awful.
B000HATYEG|5|great for the price
B00H86EWF8|5|Nice fit on abdomen
B005GSSBU2|4|Don't expect stylish from there... but for the price the comfort is all that matters.  Would be 5 stars if they weren't soooo long.
B00D4K3410|3|This dress is unexpectedly unflattering, I think because it's too long (the model in the photo must be extremely tall, as I'm 5'8\\" in bare feet). On me, the back hem was only about 3\\" above my ankles, and the front hem drooped to about 6\\" below my knees. This made the dress look matronly, which is too bad since the cut of the sleek top half is rather flattering -- low enough to look modern yet high enough for office-wear. I am a particular fan of Lilla P's \\"flame\\" modal-cotton blend material, as it has an attractive subtle horizontal texturing that makes it look like it'd be much less soft and comfortable than it really is. But this particular dress, which I'd hoped would be a go-anywhere everyday fall dress, was so unflattering it had to go back. The three stars are for quality of material, seams/workmanship, and cut of this dress's top half.
B00J4JAS4Q|5|Really lovely sweater, great spring weight that goes with jeans or black pants. Fits as expected, very nice quality. Feels like a neutral without being boring. Great price.
B005964T48|4|This is a very nice polo shirt. If only the collar was made a little bit smaller and less stiff.
B007XH6VLK|5|I gave this to my boss as a gift! She put it on as soon as she opened it and is now wearing it already 3 days later! Very HAPPY!
B00M6T664C|1|The zipper of tote broke the same day my 5 year old daughter use it to go to school and it was in the garbage. Few days later the backpack zipper did the same, the zipper broke my daughter was sooooo disappointed. I was so mad that I through out in the garbage. I am not buying from this buyer until the zipper is done with better quality.
B00FL0XRLS|4|I'm not a guy who is very clothing conscious. You'll see me wearing black because it always matches rather than for the poor and the beaten down. Needing a new belt I looked for something that looked nice but not flashy. In retrospect, I should have ordered the Matte Black. My only problem was the cutting instructions. What's my waist size? My Levi's are 36 but I know they're &#34;vanity&#34; sized. A measuring tape through my belt loops measures 44 so perhaps 46 is where to cut... I cut the Size to Fit 48&#34; down 2&#34; at a time to 40 and it fits great! Perhaps I'm being overly literal but the cutting instructions on the web sent me measuring and counting unnecessarily.<br />I like the ratchet mechanism. It's easy to adjust. Know that it's very loud to tighten and if you're trying to get dressed without waking someone you need to tighten it gently. Oops.
B00I0ZD180|5|Love this shirt, material was soft looked great!
B0076PGC1S|4|this hat kept my head warm on the mountain and can be worn as a slouch hat... the two things i was looking for when i bought it.
B005C2A5WY|3|Ordered the XS set and the pants were still very long so I have to get it fixed. The drawstring sometimes becomes lose my pants start to fall and I have to quickly tie it back.  The top as well is bigger than expected for an XS but i like the two front pockets for convenience.   The material is a bit hard but I believe with some washing it will soften.   Overall they are comfortable especially for long days, but if you are planning to use them in a non air conditioned environment prepare to sweat.
B00D2JD2X8|5|I'm an adult male of average height and kinda on the thin side; this shirt, purchased in large, fits me perfectly.  It wasn't the least bit snug, and it wasn't anywhere near too big.  PERFECTLY.  If anything, this &#34;large&#34; fit me better than many other large-sized tees I've purchased online (sometimes I have to shoot for medium to get a better fit - I'm by no means a bulky guy).<br /><br />Oh, and the shirt LOOKS amazing.  The art is colorful, detailed, and beautiful; easily one of my better looking shirts (and it's not like the rest of my wardrobe is all tattered rags).  I really enjoyed wearing it.  So much so, that my gaze often wandered down to my own chest / thereabouts.  It borders on distracting.  Does Rainbow Dash justice, even though the art style clearly deviates from &#34;show accurate.&#34;  Entirely pleased with my purchase.
B00LANLCDA|5|Great choice for a daily use
B008AI4MPS|4|The material is soft, nice and airy. It's light and comfortable for night wear. The price is affordable annd it's a good deal for the quality you get.
B00MF78G84|1|They were too big and they looked terrible.
B00AKSSLEO|3|I saw the pictures before I bought these but thought maybe there was an underlying layer which was actually compressing.  Unfortunately there is absolutely no compression in these pants, they are just pants and happen to hug your booty a little more than other pants.  My husband loves them so I kept them but was planning on sending them back because the title is definitely misleading.  You do have to love the back pockets though.  That's why I got them.  So many compression pants are not so forgiving in hiding your booty but these did :)  Anyways if you're looking for a pair of long, comfy, booty-tight pants then these are for you.  If you're looking for actual compression pants then move on.
B00F6NG9B0|3|a little tight in the waist
B00M6XA0VS|3|This is a pretty cover up for the price... Except that it ISN'T a cover up. I am 5'5 and it barely touches the top of my butt. It is the length of a tshirt. It's okay, but it clearly is advertised as being much longer. For the price, it isn't worth returning. But this is a shirt, NOT A DRESS
B006VR8E72|5|I used to buy the Barely There sport bras and thought that they were comfortable. I love these reversible bras because they fit well, have no hooks, and are very comfortable. These are my new &#34;favorite&#34; bras.
B00DF0CPVY|5|Love this shirt! Fit is great and feels awesome
B001OCMA06|5|The fit of these shorts is more relaxed/loose than other mesh athletic shorts, but it suits me fine. The length is also great for me since I am petite.
B002K43OB6|5|Ordered this shirt as a gift. It is excellent quality, and I received it promptly. Better than I expected. Would HIGHLY recommend this seller.
B00K5AKI02|5|I've been using this wallet for 2 years now and it is, without a doubt, the best wallet I've ever owned. It's exactly what I was looking for: super slim, easy to access cards, has a money clip, and looks great. I can't recommend this wallet enough. Stands the test of time!
B00AEH9938|5|These khakis look good, are high quality, and feel great. The only problem I have with them is they are a bit slimmer fitting then I usually expect on a straight fit. However, they still fit fine and I would buy again.
B0052OSWYU|5|Item was just as expected at a great price. Received in excellent condition, and just as promised.
B00OT23HLY|5|Fit well. My daughter loves the shirt. She wore it to the magic kingdom during her first ever visit.
B00HCMNI3K|5|Nice selection of colors. I went with red wine. It loops comfortably around my neck twice and provides needed warmth during a midwestern winter. It's nice not have to have scarf ends to deal with.
B0054SDA3M|5|I got this for my girlfriend and its her first items so it did take sometime for here to get use to them. She loves the way they make her feel sexy. This is not an everyday use item for all women so keep that in mind.
B00EE4FMOC|5|I purchased this to help get my postpartum tummy back into shape. I've only been using the product for two weeks & so far so good. It cinches up tight but doesn't constrict. I'll wear it for hours and forget I have it on, no sweating or parts that bite into my flesh. I've already lost 22 of the 37 lbs I gained during my pregnancy & my belly looks less jiggly than I thought it would at this stage. I still have a pooch but that's where sit-ups come into play.
B006QXUGRC|3|Was hoping for a more masculine fit and look but it's kinda gay and I can say that since I'm gay.  I don't mind it and I actually wear it to the pool and it's nice.  Not as versatile as I wanted it to be; I don't really wear it much in the gym but by the pool it works.
B00LT7AY1I|5|Jeans is nice pair of jeans. Just as described but one thing about this brand is no matter if it is the same you need to know your size because it all first differently. But overall I love the jeans and they are comfy and sexy looking on the body hugging the butt area
B003ZYEEXW|5|Very good looking shirt,but beware this is a very slim fitting shirt. I held on to it because i am in the process of losing weight and it will not be long before this will fit fine! A+
B00KVWIJ9Q|4|Very pretty, sexy and flimsy
B00896DPSG|5|VERY NICE WARM PRODUCT & EXCELLENT QLTY AND PRICE
B004M6UD46|5|Thanks..
B00C2XLLGA|4|I'm a leggings type of girl all day long! These are comfortable and the color is popping!  Can't wait to jump in these! I recommend ordering a larger size and wearing a thin pair of leggings underneath (a dark color) because the material is thin....to avoid seeing through them, double up using a thinner legging and you'll be alright! Works every time for me!
B00H7UPV1Y|5|Hard to find brass tips for web belts at the local surplus store--this item is exactly what I wanted.
B00OC35H04|4|It was great
B00HJCLR7M|3|Returned and got a bigger size. Recomend that you purchase two sizes beyond your normal with this product.
B002DGYA50|5|Beautiful and comfortable shawls used for formal wedding.  I bought 3 of them in different colors and the color was true to the picture.  My daughters loved them and can use them again and again.  Simple and elegant and at a much better price than department stores.
B00ALZAXBU|4|After reading numerous reviews, I agree with all that suggest you order a size much larger than you would expect.  I normally wear a women's 1x or standard XXL.  I ordered this in 3X and it fits great!  A little looser than a normal coat on the bottom but then you wear a sweatshirt underneath.  The arms are just long enough (I normally find more sleeves to be too short) and the shoulders fit great.  The material is a great wind blocker as well as a wonderful waterproof jacket. The green color is awesome and very vibrant.  Great jacket, just order much larger than you think you should.
B00OE80FGI|5|We loved this!
B00INA0S56|4|Awrsome
B00KV053B0|5|I am very slim but I had holes cut in by a leather worker. This belt is fantastic! One of my favorite accessories. I get compliments all the time and it is great for my work uniform. I wear it almost everyday and everywhere.
B008R6TT10|5|I have been using Haynes boxers for the past years and I have yet to be disappointed. I love these!!!
B00CN47HS4|3|It's a cute sweater, haven't found the right shirt to wear under it yet.  I kind of wish that I'd bought a different color, but it's still a cute sweater.
B004NHSKT4|5|Cute and colorful.  I used them in conjunction with other primary colored napkins and that made a nice and useful decoration..
B00Q5PVD6O|5|Love them
B008HSC32K|2|Not nearly as good as it looks in the picture. Sleeves way too tight and neck lower than pictured. Sad.
B00D695JU8|5|Beautiful scarf. Looks expensive but it wasn't. Feels like silk. Very nice.
B00JOT01SY|3|Product runs small, so get a size bigger.  I ordered 4 of these tanks in different colors, 2 showed up as ribbed style (not what I ordered), so I'll be returning those.  The other 2 tanks are nice.  Form fitting, but very comfy.
B005GVTCWU|2|Does not fit well
B00MAVI2NY|5|Fit as I expected, order my size 14, fit perfect, good jeans.
B00A8M2PTE|4|If you have a large neck, the chain for the small tie doesn't fit, however, you can use the regular tie which is included.  This is a very sharp set and an excellent value.
B00IK0SP1S|3|They were not as short as expected, I will have to take them up, which I was hoping to avoid.
B00Y1EU1J6|5|Very nice shirt. Looks great and can go with anything.
B00HWFCTBE|5|Nice fit, true to size but they run a little long - not a problem for me because I wear them around the house to lounge around in.
B00D04P65M|5|Bought these on sale.I wear between a 14 and 16 depending on the jean.  Tried these on in a 14 and man did they make my butt look great.  Love how they fit. Never even tried the 16s. I would buy this brand in a regular jean, (when they go down in price).  These fit so well that I convinced my cousin to get the same pair.  Her butt looks great also.
B00387EFVM|5|these can add a nice bit of unexpected color to a suit. comfortable and easy to adjust, but they stay put once you get them how you like them.
B000T38ZU0|5|Great fit, a slight bit tight but will loosen with use. The fit is Surprisingly comfortable. I recommend this product.
B00E3BDPAE|3|I bought the size 3x, and these are definitely not 3x, more like 2x. I can fit into them, but they are much smaller than the other fleece pj pants I have. The pants themselves are great! I love the feel, the warmth, and they are so cute!! Just wish they were truer to size.
B003TL4K1M|1|I bought the same jacket from overland directly and shipp it to Saudi Arabia online .<br />It's simply received with some scratches and the fur finishing from downside not equal to each other and not in one line as should be . Also the L size was bigger than and standard L size in the market .<br />I shipped this jacket from Us to other country before notice the damage .  When we asked for return back this jacket the overland management refused to take any responsibility for shipping charges .<br />I managed to sell out the jacket to some one .
B00NRC6X8G|4|Hubby loved the shirt and shipping was fast and easy! Thank you!
B00M0QNFZY|3|These pants rip really easily where the seams are (2/3 ripped on the inside thigh seams so far), but they're so cheap it's understandable ($&#60;10).<br /><br />I've bought 3 pairs of various styles and they look great and feel good, just very fragile.
B004302NG2|3|I bought these for my Fem/Spock cosplay and honestly expected something a little better.<br /><br />The product arrived on time. The right ear was in decent condition, but the left one was folded over it! This was easy enough to remedy once I found out that this was, in fact, an ear, and not some stray blob of latex. The left ear was underformed with almost no detail. Both the ears came in a sort of off-orangeish color, like cheap drugstore foundation orange.<br />Because I am an art student with no life, I had the time and resources to fix all this.<br />I mixed some acrylic paint and did a light wash over the ears to give a more believable skin color. I added some pinks to the edges and some shadows and such.<br />For the awkward left twin, I glued bits of cotton in the inside edges to reinforce them. Once I used spirit gum to attach them, I fit the ear around my natural folds and it actually turned out a bit more believable than the right one.<br />(You can see the difference between the ears in the photo. This is after I added the color. The look fairly shiny if I do say so myself.)<br />So... If you have the time, ability, and resources to make these ears look nice, I highly recommend this product.<br />If not...... try someplace else.
B00BP30W36|5|Nice jeans, solid and a bit stretchy fabric, not too thick. Love the geometric pattern. Fits true to size. Perfect length for me (I'm 5'5).
B00CLS5TLO|5|nothing from evil dead trilogy could disappoint.  love the heavy cotton
B004M6UDC8|5|I loved
B013FA9DKY|5|Loved the dress. Its beautiful and fits perfect.
B0076OEAS6|5|I love love love this dress I wore it to a wedding and got tons of compliments on it! The fit  perfect and it looks like a million bucks.
B005WS4FFG|5|Looks Good, feels good, and certainly best of all they had the 4x. True to size.<br />I live in these so I'll definitely be back.
B00GR9MJ70|3|it very small for the sizes, but is good
B00F6J7H0G|5|the wallet is protected by the OVP,right color,right size,it is ok
B00KH8SXH2|5|Bought it for my 5 year old for Christmas. He's going to go nuts when he sees it. Looks like its well made, but then anything that holds up for more than 6 months with a boy is well made in my opinion. Lol. The picture is nice and its perfect size for boys size 5-7.
B009TB1HIA|5|Very comfy hat...wouldn't mind having it in other colors.
B005NJXNUM|2|The product description has misleadding information. Very cheap material. If fits way above my ankles. It wasn't a good purchase at all...
B00QVZZ08U|1|Way to large more like a Mans extra large
B00ENF6NIG|5|Love How it fits will be purchasing more for my family and my daughter and myself...The price was not expensive either
B00BHRNK1Q|1|My grandson is over 6 feet tall and VERY skinny. His waist is 25&#34;.  I bought 26×32 inches pants and he could hardly get his legs in them. They not only fit below the waist, which would have been fine, but the rise was so short as to be uncomfortable. He couldn't even sit in them. If you have legs slimmer than sticks and like pants that fit half way down your rear end then these are for you.
B00IU6FUTC|5|I love this wrap. The one I bought at a very expensive Spa fell apart on the second washing. When I received this cover-up it was so soft and absorbent and even has a pocket large enough to hold my i-phone and book that I always carry out to the pool. I wish the company offered more colors, but I would recommend buying this cover-up.
B008R7FA1M|5|This shirt was order by my brother and it's a really good product, was delivered really fast and was the correct size that we ordered. Highly recommended to the comunity.
B004SWIUB2|4|its fine
B0043GTHFG|5|Perfect. In love with this. (: !😸
B005H0JHRK|5|My son was very happy with this shirt despite the fact that it doesn't glow in the dark very well.  Nice quality shirt though.
B00K6D4KR0|4|I was very pleased. I would recommend them to my friends. The pants were a little large but I wanted the legs a little longer because of some shoes that I recently ordered so I ordered regular instead of my usual petite  size. I love the color!
B00267ARLC|5|Enjoy!
B007308QIS|5|bought this as a christmas gift. it is warm and well made. this made a great gift - clever wording :)
B00K8Q0B2I|5|soft and comfy at a great price.
B00M8RG8IQ|2|The bra was too small the bottoms were perfect though
B005X5H49C|4|The bra is very well constructed and made of great, breathable material. I had very high expectations becuase of the price. You get what you pay for in when it comes to bras. The only thing i would say is go by the brands sizing chart. I measured myself and got a 36g. I thought, no freaking way! So i purchased a 36f. It is a bit on the small side. Fortunantly working out will probably help me lose that cup size. I recommend this bra for fellow big boobie babes. ☺
B00SW9WOT6|1|I'm 5'8 and 123 pounds, bottom is stuck on my hips, TOO SMALL!
B00CTUTXJI|1|Sizes run small.
B000JHFTT6|5|Very nice for working in cold temperatures. These things are reliable, and will keep you pretty warm.
B006VR8E72|5|Very comfortable bra w/ more support than 'leisure' bras and better separation and style than 'sport-type' bras. Decent support for a soft cup style.
B002LN44J2|4|I liked the duffle although for whatever reason I expected it to be a bit bigger. For us it wont work as a weekend bag but it will work as a small bag for toys when we travel.
B00FSFYLKC|5|Shirt size was perfect and quality was good
B00SBVQ4QE|5|Great
B00H72K0EU|1|i am disappointed with the quality. Didn't even bother to return it, just donate it to goodwill.
B00BQ7KA60|2|top is not great.  bottom is ok, but rather large coverage for the size/design.  cant complain for the price.<br /><br />my gf is 5'4&#34; 120lbs and it fit her pretty well.  if you like minimal coverage get something else
B0068EDHBQ|5|I bought this for a costume party. I'm a size 14 and it was a great fit for me. It stretched well and was not uncomfortable at all. The Velcro held up and did not come loose even while I helped clean up after the party.
B008KK1L6E|2|The top quality is very poor.
B0082BD9A2|5|I love these bras. they fit wonderfully and are exactly as described in the write up.the price is great and I received them very soon after ordering.
B005MQZK4I|4|It was kinda small and thin. I would buy it again a little larger.
B000V0706G|5|But the rest of the outfit is awesome!  The soft cape is a very nice touch, and it looks friggin' adorable.
B006L3V5ZO|2|These socks are really comfortable, and are nice and thick. If you're sitting down for most of the day.<br /><br />However, if you need to walk, at all ... I wouldn't recommend them. They are okay until about noon ... and then, they keep sliding off of my feet!  Anytime I walk anywhere - down the hall to the restroom, to pick up some papers from the printer ... pretty much anything, I can count on my socks sliding down under my heel. So annoying.
B007NVMRDC|5|*preliminary review*<br />Day 1- looks awesome, feels solid, hardware, pockets, and handle are very intuitive to being used. The leather grab handle is great to taking back on/off or for gripping onto a chair in order to hang.<br /><br />I went hiking and was caught in an extended down pour. my whole body was soaked, I actually emptied my pant pockets eventually and threw it all in bag. Even my feet were wet, I was wearing technical approach goretex salewa shoes. When I got back to my car, between 1-1.5 hr of heavy to light rain, my things I'm both internal pockets were completely dry.<br />The bag dried very quickly, somewhat instantly. I wore the bag where it rested behind me and sat on my back/but<br />This all I can say so far.
B002806UUY|4|This is a very flattering top and is as described. However, I read other reviews and ordered two sizes up as others said the fit was very small for size. I normally wear an xlarge or 1X and I ordered a 3X. It still fits ok but I should have ordered a 2X. So even though the size runs small I would say order just one size bigger than you normally wear.  Other than that no complaints. The shirt washes well, it is very comfortable yet very sexy and flattering to the larger figure.
B00XJX2JU4|1|My daughter loves Marshall  and rumble. Why do these have to be only girl characters
B00OZ9XRSE|5|Very nice
B006ZA7Z1Q|4|This is a great belt/buckle combination. The belt needs a loop for the tail. The price is right. It arrived quickly.
B0056WRDJS|5|Easy to put on and looks great.
B0009GAJ74|5|loved it
B00SLGO94S|4|Great
B002B84DGQ|5|Beautiful shirt - I will look for more colors
B00BP5BY54|5|This dress looks amazing! I am petite and a size 4 but do have nice curves. This accentuates every curve nicely and looks and feels great. I feel sexy in it. The material is a nice quality.
B00FFU7PZS|5|The process of ordering went smoothly.  The costume arrived and it fit my son perfectly which is good since they had requested all the measurements during the ordering process.  Good quality materials, my son loves it.
B00HEAQR4C|4|Love it!
B00KKVY7A8|5|Not too much to say.  In the past I've bought terry or flannel. So I wasn't sure how waffle would be. But stince I've gotten this one, I've used it many times.  Works perfect, whether I'm putting it over pajamas to get the papers in or by itself after the shower. So now I'm glad I bought the waffle fabric.
B007HBBXD8|4|The 2T we had last year seemed to last much longer than this last one. My son actually grew out of it and we handed it down. This one, the sleeves and sides are fine but the blue middle material is basically rotting away in less than 5 months! I rinse it out/soak it well after each use too. Other than that it fits well. Will look for a different one next-needs to last longer than 5 months.
B00CF3UGJ0|2|These are not 100% cotton as advertised, they have that polyester stretch feel to them, like wearing cotton and  plastic
B00LRZB1ZK|2|Its too small
B00DXPWGBA|5|Great buy for price. Nice comfortable material.
B002KV5GZ6|1|All this is is a piece of metal colored rubber that may or may not fit your nose. The one that I received was crooked on top of being small, the nostril part lopsided. Should be alot less than what it costs!
B001EINKLI|1|Do not waste your time with this wig. I was a geisha for Halloween and when I got this in the mail I took it out of the box and thought, &#34;Oh god, how am I going to make this work?&#34; Well I didn't. Into the trash it went and I ended up using my own hair and it came out awesome.
B00KRC3472|4|Coat is very comfortable,it is a little bigger than expected but overall a very nice coat for the price!
B005GYGEXM|5|Best for any kinda exercise .! Recommended
B00E9IWXXG|5|This is such a cute top, true to size and very comfy.  I like the silver embellishment around the neckline, you don't have to wear a necklace with it.  Throw on some silver hoop earrings and you're good to go.  Can be dressed up for work or down with jeans for going out.  The criss-cross design of the material is a nice touch.
B004DBPBTW|5|These socks are very comfotable and at cost less than $1 a pair.My husband loves them! Great value for a superior product.
B00ED7CNJW|4|My dermatologist tells me that I'm high risk, so I always have to either lather on a ton of sunblock or cover myself up.  I picked this up on Prime last minute before a trip, so I wouldn't say I had a lot of time to shop around.  The fit is a little large for what I think should generally be a somewhat fitted garment.  They only had my size in black, which was definitely not my first choice to wear all day in the direct sun.  But overall this was a good purchase.  The fabric dries out quickly once you're out of the water, way better than a cotton t-shirt.  Being a recognizable beachy logo, you won't look so out of place wearing long sleeves on the beach.
B00DXYI778|5|Nicely made, very large
B00G0472VU|5|The picture does not do justice to this dress.  What a find.  My great granddaughter is going to love this.  The service is outstanding.  Will be buying more from this company.  Richie House rocks.
B00FKTHFSQ|2|I feel like the way it looks makes me look fat. I know every woman says this but in all seriousness I'm a size 8 and I'm comfortable with my size. It's the sheen the leggings have. 8 and up beware. Not the legging for you.
B00K5I9A4O|2|It didn't fit well
B007XGO5XM|5|Looks great.
B00CIIK06Q|4|very well made  very cute
B004VSQE48|5|Great buy. Hat looks good and fits perfectly.
B0038JKJ2E|3|They are decent quality, but a Large is for a large boy, not a man.  These run very small.  I will end up giving them to one of my nephews instead of my boyfriend.
B008COZRRM|2|Way too short. They must be kidding. Im 5'9 ordered 1 size too big just in case and it's still too short.
B00AG41PYA|3|These are a little long, tight through the hips and loose through the legs.  The fabric is quite thick, but it doesn't seem too hot.  There is a lot of elastic-type fabric at the top,  Not sure how that will hold up after numerous washes.  If you are long-waist-ed, might not be the best fit.
B005G4ZUBO|3|I ordered this set, but instead received one plain pink and 2 floral pattern ones, one blue and one purple. I haven't worn the pattern ones because I had forgotten how much spare thread there is in patterned socks, just asking to snag on a toenail. The pink ones though are very nice, and I do plan on ordering more, though I hope this time it'll be the right set. I figure 3 stars is fair for this situation. Had it been the right set, this would probably be a 5 star review. As for why I didn't return them, I got caught up with life and a week later I figured it was too late and decided to just wear them.
B0084UAFWG|5|These look even better in person! They are well made and the silk is high quality. It has that wonderful sheen that really gives it an elegant look and the decorative stitching is a great contrast in texture and color. We chose this as the tie for the guys to wear in our wedding and it will be a nice gift for them to keep too. The gift box is a nice touch and presents it well. The handkerchief is lovely, although I'm not sold on the cuff links. That's minor though and it has more to do with my preference for metal cuff links than the cuff links themselves. We ordered one at first as a sample and knew immediately when we saw it that this was the one! It's also a great price for a quality silk tie set.
B00B9BPSS8|5|It was the perfect outfit for my daughter's second birthday party.  It fit comfortable and she was able to move easily in it without any restriction.
B00APLPPOU|5|Picked up this beauty in September. Figured I'd give it a good run before reviewing. I've had leather belts - some good, some downright awful that barely lasted a month before fraying or getting horribly warped. Serves me right for buying $10-$50 pieces with no real labeling of materials used or just a nice name brand (I'm looking at you, CK leather belts). The good leather ones that lasted never looked good, and the good-looking ones never lasted.<br /><br />Then came along Saddleback and said, &#34;We have the solution!&#34; They didn't actually, but after a lot of research, I decided to take the risk and pick one up. Worst case scenario, I could sell it, I figured. Then they announced phasing out the Carbon Black leather, and since I often find myself having to wear dress shoes, I figured I should take the risk, so I sprung for one as a birthday present.<br /><br />Don't let people tell you it's not appropriate for suits or slacks. It looks awesome with both. Granted, I've got the black l, so I can't say how it is with the other colors, but this thing is the secret weapon in my wardrobe - no matter what I'm wearing it looks great and gets the job done - and as a 5'10 145-pound size-30 male, finding a good belt that doesn't leave a foot of extra material is HARD.<br /><br />The size 32 is perfect even for us skinny folk, and their customer service is excellent. When I saw there was no size 30 I did a live chat on their website - don't recall who I talked with, but they were honest, helpful, and obviously more concerned that I find a good fit than that they made a sale.<br /><br />So buy this. Buy it for your dad, son, brother, or self. Heck, buy one for everyone, so they never have to waste their money on junk belts again. This belt holds shape, holds up, and probably could tow my truck out of a ditch, it's so well made.<br /><br />Did I mention it's beautiful? Because it is.
B000C5SE92|5|I received my Scully years ago as a gift. I have it with me daily in meetings, in my backpack, in my car, etc. I cannot believe how well it has held-up. It literally looks new. The leather looks and feels great. The stitching is tight. The zipper is like-new. I love it.<br /><br />The price point is a bit high. But the value is all there. It has proven its durability and superior craftsmanship. This would make a great gift for graduates, employees or business partners, parents, pastors, and many others.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B004M6UDF0|5|An excellent money clip plus all you have to do is turn it over and there is your drivers license.<br />You also have room for a couple of credit cards as well.
B0120BRL9E|4|I'm in love with it!!!!i ordered it on July 29,and just like the rest of the reviews it came quicker then expected,I got it today (August 3rd).its tight but enough to breathe and comfortable to wear.cant wait to see the process.will update for results.
B000078IXN|1|I just returned this jacket because it does not arrive as pictured.  Instead of the grey tipped shearling, it is lined in shiny ivory fake-fur looking stuff.  It might be okay with the tan color, but with the black it looks too santa-Clausy, and not in a good way!  It fit fine, and I liked the weight of it and the washability aspect, so was very sorry about the appearance of the lining. Luckily Nordstrom is great about returns! On the phone they told me that I was the second person to call and complain--I'm sure I won't be the last. I think they should pull this picture!
B00CHZYXAE|5|Is perfect
B00VFXYEY4|1|I was expecting a compression top but this top fits like a regular tank top. I was very disappointed as I was looking for some time for a form fitting compression tank top that would support the lower back and core area and thought that by the description that it was a true compression material. Very disappointed!!
B00K6NANRG|4|Perfect gift for a friend with a boat!
B00MQ58TTG|4|Great,  good looking shirt. My only complaint is you should go a size up if you have a bit of a belly.
B00FGH4FRQ|4|This is great for a walkabout shopping trip because it easily holds ID, credit cards cash and smartphone. A pen holder in side would have been a nice addition. Does not take the place of a wallet/pocketbook because I found myself missing restaurant and grocery store points/savings cards, etc.
B00RLUB394|5|Live the skirt!
B00NVNBJLW|1|These gloves are NOT lambskin. And the seller knows it.
B00EFT2DFM|5|Very light, fit snug at first but accommodated nicely after a few minutes of wear. Color was exactly like the picture!
B00IGQWFZ8|5|Soft cotton, generous well-made pockets, good looks... what more could you want in sleepwear? These have lasted a couple of months without signs of wear. I'd order again.
B00BYN0MUU|4|This dress fit perfectly!...I'm going to buy this in another color cause I received many compliments from my friends. It's true to size.
B000IIUMNY|5|This is a very nice undergarment for winter.    Excellent quality.  Really worth the money.
B00BCX5IWE|5|Got this for my dad (from my son) and he loves it
B008B5HEXM|5|I bought this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend. it fits true to size and he I both love this shirt. I love the way it fits his physique. Whether the sleeves are rolled up or down, its still a fantastic buy!!!
B00B93TSSC|3|I am 5'6, 135lbs a tad on the busty side and typically wear a size 4-6 so judging by the size chart a Small would have been fine.<br /><br />My husband got a giggle out of me trying it on as it was almost literally painful to do so.  I am returning for a different size and looking at the other reviews, I may go for the large.  The top felt pretty good but the waist down felt like one giant rubberband on my whole body.  All in all, I like it.  I should have watched the other reviews more closely.
B0085VEUK2|5|Well made, soft, washes easily and sized comfortably.<br />On a combined order, no shipping cost. So, less expensive than the ones at my big-box store.
B00NSAKJO6|5|Good
B0050CD8VG|1|Even though this product did not fit as described, the customer service at David's bridal were not at all helpful, would not work with me about what might be a better fit, nor would they pay for return shipping. I will not buy from David's again.
B0097FK15I|5|Wear them on the motorcycle and I don't need leathers. They are not bad in and around the house either.
B00Q8J571O|2|Too small. Not what I expected. The quality and craftsmanship will keep me from recommending this product.
B00L5YLQ76|5|Exactly what I needed to accommodate my increasing bust line due to breastfeeding. Soft and supportive with a wide band under the bust. I may sew in little nursing bra clips to make it perfect for right now.
B00IO3AFDC|4|Im a size 6p and this fit kinda snug.
B0055AEOS4|1|Didn't like design.
B005HPKRSI|3|Stance always makes good looking, comfortable socks in unique colors.  However, the socks that showed up at my house were not the color/design I thought they were going to be.  I'm fairly eccentric, so it didn't bother me too much.  If I were more anal retentive, or cared more, I would have sent them back.  As it stands, they were only ten bucks and I'll still wear them.
B00KM27SJC|5|What wardrobe would be complete without classics and staples? And what could be more classic that a white cotton tee? I have several Boxie tops and a few dresses that I absolutely love. The fabric is soft, the colors are beautiful and the fit is good and varied. There are many shapes and silhouettes, so there's something to fit every figure. One of my favorite things about Boxie is that they are made exclusively in Los Angeles, so you know your money is going to fairly paid, fairly treated workers, even if they are probably Dodgers fans.
B00NWX564M|5|Exactly what I wanted
B00GAZGK30|4|So far, so good.  But then again my expectation for SHORTS isn't that high...essentially as long as they fit and look like they do in the picture online, it's all good.  First time wearing camo, but so far no one is treating me as a pariah so I guess that's good.
B0041EFG9Q|5|The size ran a little large ,and did not shrink like i thought it would. This however is a great product..
B0071NPJLO|3|flare is super big!
B00BJYIVAM|5|Bought these for my teenage daughter to wear under white school uniform shirts - they are great quality at this price. When I bought them they were 5 for 20 bucks, a total steal, jump on it!
B000FBBST6|5|I love this bra, but they are hard to find and I'm glad Amazon carries this brand and style.  I am what you call a &#34;shallow cup fit&#34; for a 32C....basically meaning....not much volume on top.  With just a little bit of padding on the bottom of the cup, it lifts and rounds me out.  And I think the material is super comfy.
B008R6Z89M|3|Fits well and then shrinks considerably.
B008RS6URO|5|This duffle is really big, high quality and easy to maneuver with. I took this on a two week trip to Europe and it swallowed all of my clothes with room to spare. It was extremely durable and looks very stylish. I also liked the fact that you can basically zip off half of it to either cut down on the size or use one as an overhead bag if you wanted to.
B002GHCICS|5|Husband loves this coat! Warmest coat he owns. He is also very tall with a 38&#34; arm length and the XXL worked for him.
B003QSIMVM|3|I liked the look of this shirt when I wore it, but the fit is a little off.  Also, the necklace is not removable, so it made washing it more difficult.
B00MV66ZD2|5|Beautiful shirt  and great service. Thank you!
B00V4PW8AU|1|It was very cheaply made. Runs way too small. I didn't even bother returning it. I didn't feel like it was worth my time.
B00AZSUXZ4|5|The tapered boxer by Jockey is amazing.  The trimmer cut not only looks great on slimmer body types (I'm 5'10&#34;/150lbs) but allows them to be worn under more styles/fits of pant without the bunching and/or bulkiness of traditional boxers.  The material is soft, comfortable and easy to care for (machine wash/dry).  The navy holds its color well, dark and consistent after many, many washes.  The tartan plaids are great too, check them out.
B00968D9GO|4|It was fun to wear this to a wedding as a bridesmaid. We ended up using two petticoats underneath to get the fullness that the bride wanted. It took a while to ship to the US, but it made it. The dress definitely needed to be washed after being shipped, and it did shrink quite a bit in the wash. The belt really completed the look!
B00IJRITKY|1|First! If you are unsure if you like this dress, or if it will fit (because the sizing chart is ALL wrong) DO NOT ORDER IT! They will not let you return it stating:<br />&#34;to be honest, i really think it's not a wise choice for you to return it to us.<br />firstly, i have to tell you that we just refund you the price of the dress and won't refund you shipping fee because our dress is not free shipping, most importantly, we did make this dress in standard size you ordered and you didn't tell  us your actual height when you make an order; so please understand;<br />secondly, you also need to charge the expensive international shipping fee, as you known, we are in China.<br />thirdly,we are just allowed to refund you after we receive the dress which would cost much time.&#34;<br /><br />This is the actual response that I received.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of online ordering and will not stop. Just have to be sure to read the reviews of each different item.<br /><br />I had originally ordered a 3x after reading reviews that they are made too small. The color was a beautiful Dusty Rose, however, it was too small. (i wear an 18) I returned that, with no problem, received a refund, but it must have been a different seller.  I re-ordered a larger size and when I received it, the bust was definitely for a 4XL, the waist was for a XL and the length was 8 feet long. The bust area felt like it had cardboard inside and made a crinkly sound.  You would have to be a giant Mae West to wear this dress without alterations.<br /><br />I have advised this seller that I am not happy with their response and that I would be donating this dress to the needy.
B00C4YJV3M|4|they work!
B00JO47QAU|5|Bright and vibrant, this scarf was exactly what I was looking for.  It certainly grabs attention when I am in dancing costume!  Great price and fast shipping, too!  I am a very happy customer.
B007G11MHG|5|Very well constructed. The cut is perfect. Comfortable and make you look good! I would recommened them to a friend.
B00075ZWYC|1|These shirts used to be good but the manufacturer has made them thin and cheap now.  They also run smaller than they used to.  Very disappointing.  I will be looking for a different brand or making my own.
B00IOESAYW|5|Beautiful  dress,  I love this dress and such a great price. A great fit.Every one at the wedding were asking where did I find such a great looking and fitting dress. I let them know that I purchased it from Amazon.
B00F6CKXIQ|4|All this skirts fit fine and the length is as the picture shows the material is thin.
B00YAJVZLA|5|Love this swimsuit top!! It fits perfect and looks great!
B0011N3H7I|5|This bra is so great! I bought it when I was about 7 months along thinking I would need a good nursing bra soon...I had purchased several different ones from other manufacturer...this one was the best! The fit is fantastic, it is very comfortable, and for a larger chest it is perfect! The snaps are easy to do one handed and it is very soft. I highly recommend spending the money and buying this bra.
B00FGJFAX2|1|these could only be full length if you put them on a child. they are too short and are more spandex than legging
B00GRLVSGG|5|Very beautiful dress.  Fit is excellent.  Very unique styling at the back.
B00IE0ZFP8|2|The shirt is of good quality, but I ordered a size up as suggested by the site and I'm swimming in it.  It's also a much darker, slate-grey than what's pictured - almost as black as the buttons.  I was disappointed because I like the contrast between the buttons and the color grey that's pictured.  None of this would be a problem if I was able to return or exchange it easily.  The seller wrote me back requesting a picture of the item.  Am I to send a picture of myself wearing this circus tent?  The main problem is that it's too big.  With this coy delay in processing, the status of my return now states that the window for returns is closed.  I placed the order about a month ago, which means they allowed no time for shipping in this return window.  I would recommend measuring yourself honestly and going by the size chart the seller provides if you're dead-set on trying your luck.
B00D97SC7O|5|it is a gift
B00KGVHE20|5|Very soft fuzzy pjs.  My son LOVES them.
B007L4XD7K|5|Fits up to size 16, I am a 10-12 so it was a little too big, but with the tie string at the neck it is very adjustable. Sleeves were 3/4 style so, they were all right to. I am 5'1' so the length was at the ankles. It washed and dried beautifully! I am very happy with the purchase.
B00N2JJ9HG|1|Bought it for adult. Had to laugh when we saw it. It fit our ten year old. Bought adult 2x. Kept it was just to funny
B004LQGMP6|5|Ordered a size small, I'm 4'11 and wear a size 6 shoe. Fit perfectly. Not too long. form-fitting even at the top. Very pleased with purchase.
B007VU0EL2|5|Great for coming out of the shower on a cold day.  My wife loves it and the quality is great.
B00DNV1IJK|3|My bad as I didn't notice that it is an asian make and ordered my regular size.
B00FPYMLQW|5|It has only been cold enough to wear this once since buying it, but my daughter loves it.  Each time we have a visitor she takes them into the next room to show them her new coat!
B0057TB9DG|5|bought for partner, needed to be price conscious this year.<br /><br />Fit perfectly, look great he tried it on and was very pleased. Santa will look good on Dec 25th
B008NJU41U|5|I've purchased K. Bell socks over the last couple of years and they never disappoint.  They're warm, stretchy, and comfortable.  The cat face pair is particulary cute.
B00JAJCFBE|5|Comfortable material, well made. I am 5'4&#34; and about 125 lbs and purchased the large, it fits very comfortably and not too tight. I like the extra length of a junior's cut.
B003E6A8QI|4|I bought this as a costume piece for a play.  It was just what we needed, shipped sooner than expected.  Glad I found this.
B008P4EK2C|5|This is item a must have in any girl's summer wardrobe
B002JWF6OC|5|It appears to be sturdy enough for my needs. The many compartments allows me to carry many of my store cards. I would recommend to others.
B00CHWAB80|5|LOVELY
B008WNYEEA|5|Wallets of wonderful quality and the customer service is outstanding.  I will definitely be buying this wallet from this company again!
B009N8UEBU|1|I was not impressed with this shirt.  It's just an orange tee shirt with a pumpkin face on it.  It looks cute and stylish in the picture but in person is just another tee shirt.  Save the your money!  I saw better halloween shirts for less money.
B007G4VPSY|5|I love this wallet. It holds everything I need, It fits in my back pocket and it looks GREAT! in the light tan color!
B0070NTV3C|2|I have been wearing these socks for years now. This last package I bought fits very tight up at the top. It leaves a mark on my leg and they are very uncomfortable.
B007VIWGBK|3|These jeans are very high waisted.  They fit ok - I'm a standard 8 - but the waist is so high that they are uncomfortable to sit in.  The fabric is very thin.  The legs are not too tight and not too loose.  Good length for flats.  Won't buy more.
B00LZQ307I|5|my daughter loves it!! very cool!!
B009RA62Z6|2|I bought a small (I'm 5'3&#34; and 100pounds), the shoulders and chest fit small, can't pull closed across chest and the hem goes past my knees!
B000BJDPM0|5|Was purchased for my son for his birthday.  He loved it and I like to shop online.  It is so easy.
B000PQK0JA|2|I returned these, I found them and thought they were a good price and then found a similar pair at Walmart for a $1, for 2 pairs! Totally not worth the price!!
B0018VFGVI|5|These scrubs are awesome. Very comfortable and they do run kind of big so definitely get a size smaller than you would usually wear.
B0002I9VR8|5|Nice T-shirt <br />this one is my most worn t-shirt. the graphic is cool, and the shirt is all black. matches great with my black dickies and black vans. the two hands graphic is on the De-louse album booklet, it has a poem written with it. can't remember how the poem goes. pretty deep stuff man!
B00CCY05CK|5|My son is wearing this vest for homecoming. He is slim built, very artsy and very stylish. The vest looks GREAT on him. Coupled with a slim fitting white button-down, and a cool tie......he is definitely going to make a statement at his HS Homecoming!
B00I3X22DO|5|I love this! It looks so cute with a white cardigan.
B004XKQNA4|5|My new Bailey Western Guthrie size 7 1/8 hat was a perfect fit and totally as advertized.  Vendor was excellent to do business with and followed up to make sure I was happy with the product.  Excellent experience!
B00OK19B64|3|The bottom of the dress is not of a great material.
B004D7NVT8|5|This Robe is so cozy and warm. Perfect for Colorado weather. The material is soft and fits close to true to size.
B00KASYKAI|5|Bought this for our 11 year old daughter. Fit her very nicely. This dress is beautiful! Nice Christmas/party dress!!
B00L2JWGEG|2|Do you see how thin the model is?  Yes, this crop bandeau fits her beautifully.  I gave it two stars because the bandeau is very well made.  You will like it if you are as small as the model.  I measure 33&#34; below my breasts; I wear a 38B bra.  When I tried to put on this bandeau I needed to squeeze out all my breath!  And then I could hardly inhale.  Really tight!  One size fits all it isn't, even though the label states it is.  Really a one star product for me.
B003AIKKIG|2|I bought this shirt for my daughter to wear over the summer. It's a soft, thin material which is nice for the warmer weather, but it tore in the wash on the gentle cycle. I don't think she wore it more than five times.
B00D6BZQHW|1|Way too big, way too long, and horrible quality.
B0094U71JK|5|Great buy
B002OKRU52|5|Cool shirt. Arrived faster than expected. Thumbs up.
B00NNKQOLI|1|👎👎👎👎
B005HRNNG4|5|Awesome fit, no cotton so no worries to shrinkage. I will be buying a few more from this brand. If you want a great feel and fit get it, you cant beat the price and shipping was fast!
B0007GK0RU|5|They are amazing
B00OY4B4SU|5|Great quality price and fit. Snazzy.
B008AYJKYK|5|Got these for my son, who is a huge fan of the game, they have held up for three months now on the backpack of a 7 yr old, I call that a win!
B004NFRTBQ|4|Product fine for price.
B00CVT30AK|5|bought it for my son for a prom after party ..and he loved it. great material.. super fun print.  he was happy
B00JD9VR06|5|Great top if you have...shall I say... a belly that's larger in proportion to the rest of your body...lol.... Very flattering on, and covers my tummy well! We are always a work in progress 😍 I needed a top for an upcoming trip, packs well, and I love the fit, which is hard for me to find.
B003WXRX4I|5|Took a little long to receive however the product was good and what I expected
B005PK18O2|1|I ordered this sweater in S size and thought  it will be a bit bigger then my size but it would be casual style and would fit with skinny jeans. It was very very bad luck when I receved it 'cause this S was like L size! It's even big on my mom (she is M-L)!! Think twice before choose the size.
B000P0E1VO|5|Really nice looking belt buckle.. big enough to be noticed. Good detail in the boom box..(actually looks real)Recieved compliments..I recommend purchasing this.
B0091EGI6G|5|Took extra effort to locate this shirt as the one in the store was too small.  Requires ironing after washing, which is a hassle, but I'm still delighted that I found it and it is part of my collection.
B0054TDC70|5|This is a great costume! Got many compliments on it, soo cute!  Sizing is accurate, had a lot of fun on Halloween!
B004WNBPBO|5|The silverware held up very well! They went great with the Chocolate plates, cups, and napkin set that I purchased.
B006D26KTY|5|I love this top!  The angled seaming is very flattering & the longer length let's you wear it with leggings.  Wish it was machine  or hand washable though.
B00IMWX70I|5|A very pretty item, sexy and sultry, sheer and somewhat see thru, material is very delicate so be careful while wearing it, but it is so pretty.....I want more.
B00774HCMG|5|light and easy to wear when it's warm out
B00LGRTV2Y|3|i like it but i'm a 3x in woman's and usually men sizes i have to get one size took off  i thought this was going to be roomy and cozy but it fits snug i still like it but it also said it was southpole and its soooo not so &#34;buyer beware&#34; but other than false advertising its a okay sweat shirt  its not for a person with rolls because it fits to snug. and aside from sizing problem its a nice sweat shirt very warm
B00Y4HQ9TG|4|There was nothing wrong with the dress.  I am 5'10&#34; tall and it is just shorter than what I like to wear.  That is why I returned the item.  It is a cute dress, just not for me.
B001KFJZAU|5|this jacket is very warm, and also water resistant I will recommend this jacket to my friend'''
B00263Z072|1|Cheaply made and did not look good in the box or on me.  So, I returned it.  Too bad cause it looked like it would have been fun to wear.
B001IR2AG6|5|This is a fabulous coat.  It is very warm though it is light weight.  I highly recommend buying one.
B000ALWZ48|5|I bought this Tilly hat about 7 years ago and it's still in great shape and provides the best skin protection of any hat out there.  I have red hair and fair skin and I never go outside without my hat.
B00HQJYE5U|5|My daughter loved it!
B00V9PIV3S|3|I order the size the chart said would be good for me, but it was too small anyway.
B009OLG1TU|4|Great shirt for the minecraft lover.  Comfortable shirt that washes well and still looks great after a multitude of washings.
B00L66L5QK|5|Great
B000T6NU7A|5|I brought this for myself (6'2 210) and I love the way it fits...and it looks great! If you're into GI Joe, I definitely recommend this item.
B00FFKZAZU|5|I'm happy with my purchase. It's true it does run small so make sure you get one size bigger then your size. I'm glad I did. It fits great and it's great for working out. I recommend it.
B00N25U7Q2|2|These are comically baggy
B0079MK3V8|4|These tights are wonderful! They don‘t run very easily and they have a thin stretchy waistband. Excellent price for high quality tights.
B00C1Z2MCQ|5|LADIES PLEASE BUY THIS SPORT BRA YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I'm a true 34G but according to previous review I have order 36G and it fits perfectly. Order your true cup size but one size bigger cuz it runs small. I'm 5:5 185lbs Serena William type body very muscular but strong. I do fitness training/cross fit/jump/rope/bootcamp/running/bike and for the first time of my life I can say THANK YOU GLAMORISE FOR SAVING MY BREAST...I have try lululemon/champion and it doesnt compare to this...This bra is perfect for high impact and trust me when I say that it Hold everything down. So ladies take care of your body be healthy be curvy it's sexy. This sport bra is the best I will order a second pair before they run out...Now no excuses to do sport you have the best support :)
B00K59O0AM|5|Received in a timely manner, item as advertised, fits perfectly. Will order again from this vendor.
B00ND8JL56|5|Great jeans belt. True to size, high quality leather,  and tough enough to last a long time.
B00IIMFPMK|4|Love the color blue. Very comfy and light weight. Very long. Almost dress length
B0031CC7DM|4|My boyfriend absolutely loves this babydoll !!  It is cute, very sexy, most comfortable and easy to take off too !  Best of all it makes me feel perfect, even given my imperfections.  For the record I am 5' 6&#34;, 134 lbs 34C and the one size fits perfectly.  Washes up well, but look out - the color bleeds - so definitely hand wash on its own.  However, still definitely recommend.  Hope it works for you as well as it works for me :)
B00F1HL7ZO|4|good cover, looks good
B004BH7XXU|5|This dress (turquoise) is a beautiful color!  I get so many compliments when I wear it!  Very comfortable, but can dress it up, too.
B00BF22KK0|5|Big hit with people who actually watched the show
B003D7HA4G|5|Love this costume. It's adorable and fits well. It does run a little large, but it probably only matters if you're right on the edge of small/medium, medium/large. If that's you, I recommend going for the smaller size. The skirt is short, but it probably depends on your build whether you wear it without something under it or not. Personally, I don't have much &#34;junk in my trunk,&#34; which makes the skirt wearable alone. But a pair of leggings underneath would not detract from the costume overall. As other reviewers have stated, the gloves are not elbow length, but little glovettes that cover just a little more than the wrist. I don't think you're losing anything by them not being the long version. I highly recommend this costume.
B006T5306G|5|excellent article, very satisfied with the purchase and supplier Thanks
B004ZHQHWO|4|This was a good purchase I had no problems but I only give it four stars because It wouldn't let me track the package even though it got to my house fast I would of liked to know when it was shipped so I could of been home.
B00DGYGIQC|5|I absolutely love this top!  I normally wear large or extra large...I ordered the large and it fit perfect. It is so flattering, and great for work, or casual wear
B00B65XVLS|5|I am enjoying these earthy bronse and ivory colored elephants imported from South Africa with her trunk raised for good luck.  One was purchased for my own keychain and one will be a gift!
B001AX7IME|3|Let me start by saying the outfit is adorable. On that note, what I received is not what is pictured nor what was described. The picture and description both showed a spaghetti strapped top and I received a long sleeve top. It is still precious. I bought it big so my daughter could wear it when it was warm and now she will have to wait until the fall. I just wish the description would have been correct.
B002G9U4PE|4|Granted I'm missing some nuance and history (had to look up Dungarees), but for me these are basically nice lined jeans.  Fit is snug but not tight - tighter than my dockers fit at the same 36x32 size but not uncomfortable at all -  the lining is warm enough for cool fall weather.
B003GXFTV8|5|My wife got me this wallet for Christmas to replace a similar wallet that has seen much better days. She got it at a big retail store, but I wish she would have gotten it here on Amazon so she could have saved herself some money. This is a fine, well-made, good-looking wallet that will surely please anyone that you give it to as a gift, or, if you buy it for yourself, I'm sure you'll be as pleased as I was. Thanks, and Happy Holidays!
B00QR61TGK|5|These glove look nice, feel warm, and fit my average-size hands.
B00GTSE2G0|4|Fits great!
B001DXTD4M|5|I was worried this would not hold the change because it doesn't have any elastic or metal or anything keeping it closed. But to my surprise, even after months of use, the change stays in there and doesn't fall out loose into my pocket like other squeeze coin pouches made of rubber or with metal strips holding them closed. The rubber or metal would always wear out so the pouch wouldn't close. But, this one doesn't seem to be wearing out so fast & does stay closed enough to hold the change. It's the right size for me too.
B00NLU89E0|4|It fit me good.
B00KPZ16VC|4|GOOD
B004PEIES2|1|Rampage Womens 6pack striped NO Show socks, Striped Bright,One Size<br /><br />This is going be a negative review. I never did receive the womens socks. What was shipped to me was baby girl socks. I am saving them for my new great granddaughter who will be entering this world in September.
B00MVNSQV4|5|Perfect fit and very attractive.
B00DW4NC42|2|I would recommend this for a young girl, I order this thinking it would be big and that wasn't the case, ad you would have to wear another tank top under it, you can see threw it. But it's cute.
B005442A0K|5|The hat is very comfortable and keeps my head warm. I love the hat, its now my favorite hat to wear.
B00VAK91WW|2|Cute apron but it is way too small for an adult.
B00LPRY93Q|1|Got these shorts to skate in. First day I took them out, I pushed twice on my skateboard and they ripped all they way through the crotch. The entire seam ripped all the way around the shorts and through the middle of my right thigh. Very cheaply made shorts. Very thin material and cheap belt. I would not recommend these to anyone.
B00JY7K1X6|4|Stitching was a little thin where front flap is attached to hat. Had to fix it myself. Otherwise I love it. It's warm for wisconsin winters.
B00U8Q5TC0|5|Very cute.
B001PWK70K|5|love it
B004289XPE|5|Delivered on time and the dress is just lovely.  It was for a hippie party but it is so pretty I will wear it again this summer for evenings on the deck!  Great buy!
B0064RKLZC|5|Love this shirt!
B00AHRDKOO|2|I am only a 36 A with small 5'3&#34; 135 lbs.  The medium was way too small.  That's my main complaint. I am ordering a large. Ugh!
B007WPAWQI|4|This is a nice shirt.  Since the first item I've bought from this company, I've enjoyed their clothing and have ordered more and will keep ordering more.
B000LR3UMW|5|I only wish the hidden pocket could accept an iPhone 6 plus with case.  Otherwise a great trouser.
B0002MGS9S|4|I was afraid to purchase clothing online until I bought theses pants. I bought a pair of Kenneth Cole Reaction a few years back, eventually grew out of them by two sizes. Ordered one pair two size bigger and they fit as good as the first one I bought. I'm loving them.
B00EL3LSD0|4|I am not one of those guys that likes a tight fitting shirt. I wear an XL and I found this to be very tight around the back, chest, stomach and arms. Upon washing it was even tighter. 5'9'' and 210 lbs its a bit tight. I would have gone with a XXL instead.<br /><br />Saying that though, the quality on this is excellent which is surprising for the price. The ladies at work really, really like the look of it. Very snappy and classy. Will buy again.
B00DJ4995Q|4|If you have a Whovian child, this is how he will dress for Halloween.
B002TLTIMY|5|I love this shirt i wear it every day(just kidding) but i do love it
B00H97AS68|5|Great deal. Perfect fit!
B009MQB962|5|good fit, good fabric, good price.  it was a no-brainer, and pretty versatile if you throw a light jacket or sweater over it
B003DTMPJ4|5|Love this bra. Full coverage and fits well. Looks nice under fitted tees.
B00JH283AG|3|A bit small for a 36'' waste.  I have 34 and 36'' pants.  If I order a 36'' belt, it should fit the middle hole, not the very last hole, especially for $40 for a belt.
B00O7Y3BE2|5|Good quality
B008ARIW6O|5|Nice hat.  Bought it for my 15 year old son. He loves it and it looks great!
B00FYO6VMI|5|I loved there adjustable waist and the fullness of the skirt
B007P897UE|5|fit perfect
B002FZL4TO|5|Buying online without trying on in the store is not my thing. This dress was a definite winner. It fit perfectly, was very comfortable, and could be transitioned into informal daywear. I felt sexy and put together. I highly recommend this piece. It's the one you'll pull from your closet over and over again for year-round parties. I paired it with different pashminas and looked fantastic. Great for travel because it doesn't wrinkle. Trust me it's a winner.
B003WKAPBO|5|My son loves it and wore it to the recent Highland Games
B001QK9NE2|4|This product is well built. Solar works as advertised. Crank works well, but doesn't seem ready for serious abuse. Light is surprisingly bright and effective. Reception is pretty clear, but I had some issues tuning in to the NOAA weather band... probably a function of location rather than equipment shortcomings, but this was enough to prompt a 4-star rating instead of five. Also those with bad eyesight may have trouble reading the numbers on this very small radio. At approx 5.5\\"x3\\"x2.5\\" I will always have room for this in my emergency kit.
B002ITIGAW|4|I love these, they are lace so you have to careful as you pull them on if you have nails at all, but they are lovely, and dress up a costume over the holidays, or just for wearing with your own dress style.  I bought them because I liked them, and I love wearing them when Im dressed in all black. Just for fun!
B0057X9NRQ|4|This is a good quality tee shirt, unlike the new Hanes tee shirts, it fits correctly; after a wash. The material is good quality. My only dislike is the brand name written on the back of the neck.
B00AAQTK5A|4|Cool looking shirt! Got it on sale in red and seems to fit well. Minus one star for the logo being a bit blurry. Looks like two men on one horse at first
B008HLGP1W|3|This was the hit of Christmas for my little Niece, but you can tell it won't hold up very long.
B00805HOEC|5|This is the best scarf! It's easy and very stylish and goes with jeans or skirts. Boho sheek for sure!
B001H0FBUG|5|Who would have thought that this glove would be so hard to find?  I have found all of the variations, lined, fur-lined, even suede gloves, but not the classic; and I have been looking for two years.  These are perfect for driving and warm enough for most things which don't involve outside winter sports.  They even fit over my rings and don't make my fingers feel like stuffed sausages.  Glad I found them here.
B00NHK01F4|5|brought a Large could've worked a medium but still love it.
B00BF1PC5Q|5|arrived on time and as expected
B00420X6UK|4|NICE AND WARM, NOT AS LONG AS I EXPECTED BUT I LIKE THEM,  THEY DO SHED ALITTLE BIT IF FUZ ON UR COTHING BUT THEIR CUTE
B004QKOQSC|4|Love it but wasn't the material I expected. It is soft but not cottony soft. I prefer the cotton soft. But I still love it.
B008M10RMA|4|I bought this for my 2 year old so he could be Handy Manny for Halloween. It fit his head pretty well, kind of resting atop his ears. It would work as a costume, but not as an everyday hat. It is way too big for a 2 year old.
B00KGOQME8|5|Love how these fits comfortable
B007JVXPCS|4|I like these socks, they are super soft.  We've been wearing them for probably two months and quality seems good.<br /><br />BUT...two things to be aware of:<br /><br />(1) They are really thick...could be good, could be bad...just know before you order.<br /><br />(2) The polo logo is only one one side of the sock so you have to match up a left sock and a right sock in order to pair them up for wear or when folding laundry.  Huge pain in the butt.  I mean for a two year old's socks, I don't have time to be digging around in the laundry basket looking for a left sock...I get it stylistically, but for kids, they should just put it on both sides of the socks and call it a day.<br /><br />So while I really like the socks, due to (2) I won't be ordering again...but they are nice socks so if that doesn't bother you then order them!
B003YUNIEI|5|I really like them. The compression is great. It helps the pain in my ankles and feet.<br />I should have got the the next size smaller.<br />I recommend  these socks five stars.
B0011YUMG6|4|The Wacoal bra is comfortable and attractive.  It fits me well.  I'm very choosy about bras.  The color is perfect for me!  Thanks!
B005O2ZH9I|5|Great
B005PAILXI|5|This wig is the epitome of blonde!  I'm a brunette, so it's extreme for me. The wig will definitely need to be shaped once unpackaged, but it will serve its purpose for a costume. Good quality and fast shipping.
B0094VP67S|5|I can't believe this was so cheap!  It fits perfectly (sm/med for 5'3&#34; and 130 lbs) and it seems to be pretty well made.  I'm pleasantly surprised!
B00C5GNIFQ|5|This fit perfectly.  My husband loved it!
B00MFKGAKC|5|I really love this shirt!  I have ordered an item from this maker before and just about all their stuff is my style.  This shirt fit well.  It's long enough to wear with my leggings.  It's warm and soft and the sleeves are perfect for my 6'0&#34; frame.  I'm 150lbs and a 34B and the medium fits me great.  I will probably order a few of these in different colors.
B002JIO3R2|4|Wish it didn't have the money pocket, I wanted a thin wallet to carry credit cards and drivers license. But it is a nice wallet.
B0058YIJTW|5|I gave these to my Granddaughter and she has worn them a lot and loved them.  I will probably reorder them again.
B00LBXXV5G|1|FOR BEING XXXXLG IT FIR MY SIZE 10 NEICE TIGHT...
B00AXVAPL0|2|Tight across the back and in waist area. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large and it feels small
B000FGCSNQ|3|This hat is cute but it is very light weight and just seemed a bit cheaply made. The elastic in the back is not as nice looking as other hats I have seen.
B00HX6EFJ6|5|Love these. The picture on the leggings was clear and they fit great
B00I4D3XFO|4|Got it for my mom at the nursing home for the Valentine's Party.  When you are 89, little things matter....
B00OT6A6TG|5|great
B00DGM4ISY|5|It is a perfect coat for winter, will look great with jeans or with a skirt and boots.<br />Love the colour and the fit. Debbie.
B0094GB6LS|5|the blouse it fit so good. I think de flower its a little big the pearls are beautiful but is good
B006ZVYZOU|5|Ordered for a musical and they looked adorable, and lasted through five weeks of performances.  Recommended for quality and look.
B0038M1XSK|5|This leotard's material is definitely going to last!  Yet, a very dainty and soft looking style.  My daughter loved it!
B00NPX2RBO|5|I wore it for a song and dance routine then used it for Halloween, too. Nice snug fit, fuzzy, and warm. I was complimented wearing them.
B007SW58GO|5|good quality and looks good.
B00QV5C13C|3|ok
B0052B71XG|5|It's perfect for our family Alice in wonderland themed party!! I am a size 10 dress and its perfect fit! I can't wait! The white in the front is see through.
B00I3UJO2E|5|True to size and looks great
B00OHY8OCG|5|good service 10/10!
B008CV66J8|5|This is a beautiful dress- very flattering. In my opinion it runs large. The bust area is huge- I'm a 34 D. I had the top taken in. I also had the zipper fixed because there was too much material around the bust area and the zip sticks. The caps sleeves are gorgeous - the color is deep and beautiful. (Purple)<br />Highly recommended - well worth the price plus the alteration cost.<br />So many compliments while wearing this dress.
B00NC5E844|4|I ordered mine by mistake a size bigger but as I can tell, if you follow the chart, the size will be right for you. I have washed these and the fabric seems good . overall, comfy Henley to wear. Only down side is the waiting time to receive them ( ships from China). I ordered another with my correct size.
B004MTHH92|4|Nice shirt.  One of my favorite albums by pink floyd so this goes great accompanying it.  Thanks a lot guys.
B0016HGZ14|1|Pretty disappointed with this. It was cheap so I didn't expect it to be great, but it was pretty bad. If you have any boobs at all don't bother. The chest part isn't even in the right spot and the skirt is completely see through. The skirt was also very flat, not at all like the picture. I'll be returning it for sure.
B00GXVWSVO|3|Received as a gift, bulky but will be glad to have on those really cold days. However I could not find any cleaning directions, will chance a delicate wash in cold water and low dry.
B002FNZNYS|5|RE: B002FNZNYS ,  Mother of the Bride formal Evening Dress #27837<br /><br />I am interested to buy this pretty dress, based on the size chart, my size falls between size 12 to size 14.  I would like to know if I need to wide the waist area for about 1 inch to 1.5 inch, is there enough<br />material to do it? Thank you.<br /><br />sincerely,<br /><br />Grace Lee<br />gracehemet@yahoo.com<br /><br />P.s. Is this dress two pieces (top and skirt are the same piece)  or 3  pieces (top and skirt are separate)?  Thanks.
B004S94EHY|4|Bought this for my boyfriend - he is 6'3&#34;, roughly 200 lbs and muscular...not body builder but shoulders, biceps, pecs are certainly noticeable.<br /><br />Pros<br />He loves the fit, sleeves are long enough, it's snug in all the right areas.<br /><br />Cons<br />The only con is the hood is DEFINITELY not functional. It's more an extended neck with a bill. Doesn't look weird if you don't plan to use the hood, as he doesn't. It's only for show.
B000ZHGBU6|4|I'm pretty short...MAYBE 5'3&#34; and theyre a little long but they work
B00LIV0UCI|5|This is a really nice jacket. It fits exactly as expected. Not super bulky, fine with a sweater underneath.
B005IVZ2D6|1|Daughter loved the rock star jeans, good fit and design, attractive sequins on back. However they ripped badly at the back on the second wearing. On examination the denim appeared very thin and flimsy. Dont buy if you want to wear more than once!
B00Y1FVK3G|5|I have been looking for a good plus-sized sports bra for a long time. I seriously have bought at least 15 that I have either returned or that are collecting dust now. I really like this bra. It holds my ample breasts up and does not torture me in the process. I will be ordering more of these.
B003963KWC|5|Great quality T-shirt!!! Bought the same T-Shirt a few years ago and wore it out... I was very happy to find a replacement for sale at such a great price!
B003KWXQ88|5|These bows are the best for my baby with little hair!!! Everyone comments on how gorgeous they look and how well they stay in! I have bought in almost every color and is a great accessory for my little one!!  Terrific quality and Bitty Bows has great customer service!! Best part about these bows are now that her hair is growing in I can still use! Seems to work fine with even a bit of hair! Can't wait to buy more fun stuff!!
B00BSV1A0E|5|overall, id say this was great purchase. shirt looks awesome...it fits nicely. pretty good quality. Also, its an Eddie Van Halen shirt!...what else do you expect!?
B00J4TVVOM|5|Great item for the price.
B0029NJNTA|3|I ordered two of these wigs as costumes for the show I am working on and they were nothing like the photo. THE spikes were totally smooched and out of shape from packaging. There really was no way to make them go back to form. Fortunately I liked the messy look better for the show and they still worked. But if you are looking for that exact puck rock look you will be disappointed.
B009A4KEYY|4|Fit - I normally wear a size 8 - 10 in pants to accommodate my relatively large thighs and these leggings fit great.<br />Fabric - is a little thin for my liking.  I do not think I would wear these with anything TOO short in public, but they are very appropriate to wear with dresses of a normal length.  I also may not wear these to the gym without shorts over them.<br />Durability - so far they have held up with wash and hang dry - I suspect they'll make it just fine through the winter season.
B00LMKEIT6|5|I love the choice of colors and they all fit just as expected.  The price was well below most other products and these socks wash and dry well - no fading or shrinkage.  Definitely a great buy.
B002NPCIN2|5|Fits great!
B00EAT8V6W|5|Like this, the size run a little smaller, and the color is not what the picture looks, it is more on the green side.
B00C8BIMWC|5|High quality workmanship. Excellent customer service. I ordered a size to small and had to exchange for size larger. It was fast, efficient, and easy to make the exchange.
B00JFQ8SFE|5|Excellent fit just what I was looking for
B004M6XUI2|4|Newer model of this product is far better! In design and functionalty slits on credit card slots ate vastly improved!
B00K04PM36|4|Fit is pretty close to perfect. Arm bands way to tight for me. Had to take off the trim and elastic. Long enough for a tall person so I had to hem it.  All in all satisfied with costume.
B00OGV2PMU|5|Nice vest for summer riding.
B00AO2R7IW|2|While this was a beautiful shirt that my granddaughter loved, the paint began peeling off the first time she wore the shirt. It also is smaller than other size 5 shirts that she has. She is very slim and I would say that it runs small. She was sooo disappointed and so was I.
B000MXKMKI|5|These trousers are extremely well crafted and fit exactly as expected. No tailoring involved whatsoever. The pockets are not as deep as I would have liked but having said that, the comfort fit waist band is very well made and super comfy. Buy these with confidence.
B00NB74T8S|5|Great shirt.
B008O3DXYK|3|My grand-daughter was not comfortable in this swimsuit. It is very pretty but too snug. She is only 2 and most size 2Ts are loose on her. She will not want to use this much.
B008FB4LMO|3|shorts are longer than advertised, but good looking.
B007CRR7ZA|3|Overall, Gerber brand onesies are of good quality and a good price.  However, I have bought several packages for baby showers I have hosted (everyone decorates them with fabric markers) and more than half the packages come with a onesie that is unusable due to the adhesive packaging sticking to the onesie.  It does not come off with scrapping or in the wash.  The wash actually seems to make it worse - lint sticks to it and the damage is worse.<br /><br />This has happened both when I've ordered through Amazon and through Gerber directly.  Gerber needs to change their packaging and stop using tape to hold the onesies in place.
B00KDC898A|5|Shipped on time so thank you, And i love it. its well made and super cute. My waist  size is 30&#34; and i want to be a 24&#34; maybe 22 so i got a small and it works for me. Again im very happy
B000VO7468|3|This costume was not what I expected. It was cheaply made but guess you get what you pay for. I did like the color. I do not recommend buying this, unless it is last minute decision.
B00LS44G16|5|It's what the picture shows
B00D05UDCW|4|Fits good
B002QKAD6S|4|My daughter used these for Halloween and they were perfect. We watched the new movie The Hobbit in theaters in 3d and I swear these ears looked just like theirs on there. I wonder if they use the same ones LoL:)
B003WET11U|5|Perfect quality and fit
B0061YVZBM|4|I bought this as a birthday gift for my dad and he loves it.
B00LNIH6AA|5|Cute!  Colorful!  Comfortable!!  My 7 year old son loves them.  Appropriate size too.
B00GO39X2I|3|Shirt doesn't stretch much.
B005X1W0RC|4|Silky, a little small - feels strange when you first put them on... but then they fit okay.  No ride up.
B007JX7PE0|3|too thin. but the price is good.
B00B86B8B0|5|Perfect for sleeping. Easy access clasps ans a soft material that stretches easily for those longer spaces between feedings at night.
B004R1G6BA|3|Nice but sleeves were too small.  Not the size comparable to other men's shirts.
B00013J9J4|5|Ok, I admit, I own a lot of shoes. Ever since I bought this pair, however, I have worn nothing else. These sandals are so soft to the touch, and the foot bed has a surprising amount of &quot;give&quot;, considering they're made of plastic. Good arch support. The bottoms are well textured and very grippy. They are completely waterproof - I went wading in the ocean last week and then rinsed them off, they were as good as new. The orange and red ribbons shown in the picture are beautiful and bright, but I have yet to see how the colors stand up to the test of time.
B00CHI17PA|5|This is now one of the best dresses I own...  IT IS SO HOT!! It fits well, the material is stretchy and honestly not bad at all considering the price. The pattern made my shape POP! I received so many compliments and didn't want to share my secret find...  But if you're are here and considering this dress DO NOT PASS THIS UP. I'm 5'9, 145, 34DDD and I purchased the 8/10. The dress fit very well, like it was made for me!!
B002EVPSX2|5|Excelente producto.
B00JPNIADM|4|the 2diff materials end at a weird spot the print lands on high waisted part instead of having the black top go down a little further would be nice should of looked more carefully at picture its shown that way2. On model the top is shown as loose &baggy but on me it fits like a slight loose glove not baggy, (i have of course a thicker built, arms & C cup). Give u idea what to expect, but not bad just not my fav dress.
B00CHOUAC0|5|colorful and cost performance
B009LEG39S|4|I'm always hesitant to buy clothes online, especially tops but I'm so glad I ordered this! Its very figure flattering and has ties to adjust how much cleavage you want to show. Very flattering overall, I'm ordering the red one right now!!
B00DREH2X4|5|I got this mask today to complete my Batman costume for this Halloween, and I couldn't be more pleased about it. The materials are stronger than I anticipated, and it seems like it would take a bit of force to tear the vinyl. The mask actually fits snugly, but comfortable on my face, and the part that goes under the chin actually doesn't droop at all, but is just right. I was concerned that the mask would be permanently wrinkled because of the packaging, but the mask was sent in a bag mailer, so I didn't have any issues with it loosing it's shape or having odd wrinkles. I did notice some minor, and I mean minor detail flaws, but they are so small, I probably wouldn't have noticed them if I hadn't been staring at it while I was on the can. As mentioned, this is only a 3/4 mask, it still looks pretty cool, but I am going to wear a black hoodie under it, and it honestly looks awesome. For the price this is MUCH better than any of the other Batman masks I have seen this year! I actually ordered one of the cheap plastic ones thinking it would do ok for my cheap costume, but honestly the quality was horrible, and rather unrealistic. This mask is leaps and bounds better, and it was virtually the same cost. I will try and post a picture above for you to see me wearing it.  I was super skeptical about the mask and was expecting the worse, and I was greatly surprised! I will look awesome this Halloween.
B007W2R5OI|2|I ordered this skirt and one other. I was so excited when my package arrived. I ran upstairs to try it on and discovered it was not true to size. Maybe it was the spandex, I don't know. I ordered a size larger and it fits great.<br /><br />S.D., Ohio
B007BABW6I|3|It was a good price for FR's.  They do run a little smaller than what I'm used to wearing.  They fit, but they are a little snug.  It's not often that I have to wear FR's so it's something I can deal with.
B00F6PIJX4|5|Well, first of all, I love this pants they look great, fits as expected im glad I chose Dockers over other brands I'll definitely buy them again and again
B00509BMVW|5|I had previously bought these jeans and was eager to buy another pair. The jeans fit perfectly and are among my favorite. I would suggest going to the store to try on different sizes before purchasing online though. My Lucky jeans do have a tendency to be somewhat larger than other brands in the same size.
B00JEQV0VO|5|The weight of this dress was very surprising and the material used was very well made. The decorations were spot on also. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B003XT5JUQ|5|I didn't really know what I was ordering, but the minute I pulled this shirt out of the packing I was ready to order another.  I love it.
B000RPSW3A|1|The only reason it sucked cause I didnt even recieve it all , not even on holloween.
B00KHA0I2I|3|Long
B000A10Z0O|4|Excellent value and quality. Better than department store prices. I purchased several packages and various sizes for my new grandchild.
B00NO4GYU4|4|Don't listen to The comment who says its run small take size Up , its has to be small So take ur<br />waist inches right and take ur size ..
B005DLBCEY|4|Comfortable, fits great, and showed up earlier than expected. Didn't have to run to a store to purchase only to find out that they didn't have my size, or that the package had already been opened.
B00KQHITS2|5|Highly recommended the product is beautiful and good quality
B00XOWKGSM|5|Nice dress
B0002TOZ1O|5|I have been wearing Gold Toe socks for a couple of years now.  They are comfortable and do not disappoint me.  It usually takes around a year for me to feel like I need to order a new pack.  I am not rough on my feet, so besides normal walking I do not put a lot of wear and tear on my socks.  I have only had one pair develop holes in them.
B00DYOQFO4|4|Good material and construction . Fits a little big ,but can work with ,especially for the price.
B00387EEZY|5|very good product congratulations
B000TAADTO|3|These socks are very well made and seem to have plenty of cushioning and support.  My reason for only three stars is because they are listed as over the calf, however I cannot get them over mid calf without stretching.  As a result they often work down and end up bunched around my ankles.  At only six feet in height I don't think I should require an extra large sock.
B00GRTJ2W0|5|I loved them so much I just bought them is the smaller size. The smaller size fit oh...so, nicely.  It is nice to look good and feel good in pants.
B00NEVGEH0|5|orig pic made it look orange but i like it
B004HSUQT6|5|I got this dress for a friends beach wedding and it turned out to be a great dress. I wasn't sure if it would fit because I'm a size 16 and 40D. I'm 5'9 and order the large and it was perfect. Love the fabric and LOVE LOVE LOVE the dress. Great date night or girls night out dress as well. Worth buying. I will be getting another very soon in a different color. :D
B00ONHVN3O|5|my daughter loved her birthday dress!
B00BPDCDEM|5|High quality jacket. The leather is soft and supple. The workmanship that went into this leather jacket is first rate.
B00CDU7W60|4|Its awesome, the materials are good, looks great the color it's just a bit larger than I tought. The fox details are cool. The snapback looks great.
B00HWV0L86|5|Skirt is beautiful, though short for me because I measure 1:76 cm. I recommend, it is really beautiful.
B0082CJFZY|5|Excelent fit!!
B00NI4ZWHQ|4|The string holding the mittens together came apart within seconds of my 2 year old putting them on. Otherwise mitten is fine.
B00M0JI0DS|1|Way too large in the hips and seat.
B00BSVR5BW|5|This fits perfectly! It is the first bathing suit top that has been perfect for my size and comfortable
B001TC82AS|4|These are pretty good as far as thigh highs go. They are very silky and stay up well. Very good value for the price.
B00KMNR6AM|4|Well a little about my body type. I am very curvy. By this I mean I have very rounded hips and  very round booty and a very petite waist. I am 5'5 and I weight about 180. (l Nicki minaj/Kim K booty and hips with Beyonce thick legs). Now I know this sounds fat to many but in person I am not very big, just bottom heavy, a mixture of fat and muscle. I only go into detail about my body type because I think that body type is very important when buying something like this. The manufacturers size charts means nothing because our body types vary.<br /><br />Saying all of this I purchased the size XL thinking that because this comes from china it would run small. BOY WAS I WRONG. I should have purchased the one size. This thing fit me very loose. Because I am by no means skinny I can pull it off but I wanted it to fit like a glove, which I think the one size would hv but am not about to spend 35 again to have it shipped from the US.<br /><br />I know prices are cheaper if you buy from China but I was afraid of how long that would take so I spent more for the US seller. I am unsure if the quality is different from China sellers but the quality is pretty good. Doesn't look like it will break. Idk about the seller who posted above me, my zipper does not seem like it will break.
B003BYDNEW|4|This product fits as I expected and is a really nice soft material.  The shirt sits at the hip and is a good layering piece.  One thing I really like is that the sleeves are not ridiculously long, sometimes I find that with shirts. Good buy. The color was the same as what I saw in the picture.
B00NPCPWYE|5|great color, great fit. comfortable
B00029I0YW|4|like the shirt, but the XL size is smaller than most other XL shirts.
B003OQTS3C|5|Well made.  Looks great.
B00MPDQJ9Q|5|Quite a nice bra with no lining or adding.
B006Z8JKZM|3|I ordered a medium, so that is what i get. They run extremely large and baggy and they are comfortable. The inside fluffs up a little, but I guess it serves its purpose for the price.
B00EYT7S7G|4|Fairly well made, but lots of loose threads. Fit was good. Hard to find pj bottoms with button waist vs. cord, but these fit the bill for cool summer nights.
B00ISRCO6A|5|I ordered medium for my 36&#34; waist, to assure I would avoid sitting on my family jewels; the size is just right!  Seems underwear manufacturers would create and have more readily available underwear choices for we men, to help us avoid the crushing.  Also, I thought I was getting a pouch in these but, they are just like regular underwear.  I guess I need more schooling, to understand contour from pouch.  I am happy with these in a smaller size, which gets the job done.
B00CN5ED76|1|Very poor quality too small not as the picture
B00LSC0U8G|5|Got so many compliments. Feminine, flirty and fun
B00INT7YE0|5|was a gift for a friend and it looks great on her and she loves it.
B008CMWIZ8|3|I guess maybe I'm just longer waisted than people. The shirt fits. But it's shorter than I really want. I just wanted it a hair longer. But I like the general design.
B00IP4E360|5|Good
B000LUUH8Y|4|These glasses are very clear and block the glare of the sun.  I love them!  I've had Nike sunglasses before and am a big fan. Highly recommended.
B000HD301Q|5|Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts.  Was very impressed with the quality.  Would definitely buy again!
B00CESFB7S|5|This top is the right size, washes beautiful and looks great, exactly what we wanted.  The quality is great looks fabulous.
B00C85KGYU|2|I am usually a size small, but ordered a medium which is snug except for bottom of t-shirt which seems stretched out. There is also a black mark on the side of shirt, looks like marker. The areas of grey seem discolored. Not to happy with it.
B004Q7D1GS|2|I think this tank is adorable but wont be wearing it without some stitching up first. I was surprised by how low the sides in the back go.
B00EEIKG1M|4|I believe the dress would be a great fit for anyone! I am not tiny by any means (14) and it is flattering on me.<br />It is however extremely shear so for me a cotton slip is a must. Great summer dress!
B0008EOG6W|4|I'm 179cm, 80kg. The size 33w x 32L Fit for me!
B00422M6FY|4|I bought this wallet in black for my boyfriend for Christmas.  His wallet was falling apart, and it was time to change.  I liked it because it was simple and yet looked nice, with the Tommy Hilfiger logo across the bottom (I like logos).  In the comments, I read before I bought it that it tends to be really tight but breaks in to the cards and cash after using it a little bit.  Well, it works out ok, but my boyfriend insists on using a lot of cards and carrying a lot of $20s, so he consistently complains of it being too small.  So far, it holds up well.  It's nice and smells expensive :p
B0018OP43U|5|they fit great
B00MLOECQ6|5|I absolutely love this product. It says one size fits all, which I agree with to a point. My breasts don't quite fill out the top portion but it is somewhat adjustable with the stings to tie it back, and adjustable like a bra with the straps. The length is absolutely perfect as it falls mid thigh. It reveals just enough. No complaints. Love the color.
B000VK3Y02|5|Great bra for support.  It covers a lot so it will not be a good bra for shirts with scoop neck.
B00422M6FY|2|the material looks poor, not as expected.
B002BFQ9V6|5|Nice colors.  I got a lot of colors for every occasion.  Nice quality!  love the look!  Got hangers with holes in them to store them.
B00EK7V85K|5|Love it!  Fits perfect!
B000NFCFQO|2|The material on this hoodie is terrible you can literally pull at it and hear it ripping and that's just as you are trying it on.  Spare yourself the trouble don't buy
B000BROCII|5|This is an ideal hat for people working outside in the sun. There is enough cover/protection without the hassle of large hat with ties, etc. It would be nice to have one with more ventilation.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased, sa this was a replacement.
B004I5A6XE|5|I bought this shirt to go with some BCBG gray sweatpants, and it worked perfectly! It is very loose, so go down a size. I wish I had gotten the XS but I still love it.
B00FFYVFYQ|2|Very cheap material-im talking the spongy fleece style. And the skulls were painted on- not screen, u can see where it wasn't dry in parts and the white touched some of the black in veriouse areas
B0095PD9PO|4|Hope it holds up in the wash. The colors in the fabric are not as vibrant as I expected, but still a good quality garment and a good buy
B00FFQWXQ8|5|This top fit do well
B00TG8J8JQ|5|Great swim trunks. Fit true to size.
B001N1C8ZA|5|Warm, comfortable, and oh so cute!  This was the perfect Halloween costume for my baby (who was 3 months at the time that he wore it).  Plenty of room to grow, but he didn't swim in it either.
B00C6WCNIW|5|I really like these bags, they are perfect.  They hold everything and I want and great to use as a purse.
B00QM5R6AO|5|You warch the flash the series, I don't think they have the shirt though, only the sweater, but this is 5 star for me, because its good quality and I wasn't expecting that it would be. So if anyone is asking regarding the durability, its ok on machine wash just turn it inside out washer and dryer.
B00A17K2IM|5|fit well and stays put. Feels nice around my package. Color is nice laundry nice. does not bind. would recomend
B00NUDGMYW|5|Great!
B00OABQOXW|5|Great!
B001EJMT5A|1|When I measure my ribs (under the breasts) it measures 28.  I'm supposed to be a 30D, but I could not get the bra to connect in the back and I was spilling out of the cups!  Had to return it.
B00NFTKSV4|5|Very thin but bought for Halloween costume so not a big deal.
B00DFUO76K|4|She loved it
B00AATGSKM|5|Fit my baby great
B0083H3R8Y|5|Very good value
B001NEKCZ0|4|Very comfortable bra . The cup size is quite small ! I wish it came in DDD !!!
B002A8QQG2|5|This garment is great. I am almost 6 feet tall, have a 35 inch waist and almost 42 inch hip. This fit me well, the to hit right where the current image  shows. There is singe more stretch, so that us nice. Looks hot and feels like a well constructed article of intimate apparel.
B007J89RGO|5|Awesome hat...
B00RUE3Z1U|5|No wedgies!
B00KXSNQYG|2|Too small for the size I ordered but still warm
B00FQH1WX6|4|very good
B0040FB3WA|5|Got this costume to scare my hunting buddies. The game cameras pictures looked real at 50 yards. Glad I didn't get shot.
B004G9OII6|5|I have 4 pairs of this fit and size.  I hate shopping for jeans, and these are the only jeans I'd feel comfortable ordering online.  Other brands seem like they're all over the place with fit, even in the same style and size off the same rack.
B004VSQ3GC|5|This tape works very well to hold my new silicone breast enhances in place.  They are very sticky and tissue thin.
B00HEDEP0M|5|He loved iy
B00HXIZ6M4|5|fashion design
B003KK601U|5|I bought a pair of these earlier this year and they immediately became my favourite pants.  They are quite comfortable and even in the hot, humid climate of Jakarta, they kept their comfort and crease.  I think a girl I was seeing stole these pants from me, so now I need another pair.  No idea what possessed her to do that...  I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she cut off a lock of my hair while I slept too, though.  I had that effect on women because of these pimp pants.
B00ED4T6P4|2|I was on the lookout for workout shorts that wouldn't really &#34;stick&#34; to me, so I decided to give these a try.  The material reminds me of a wetsuit that I use for scuba diving and the size runs big.  I'm returning them because of the size and I hate the material.
B000GY0ALO|4|I absolutely loved this mask!! It looked great with my dress!! I received so many compliments on it. I had a small hairstyle issue with the headband that was attached, but other than that, it was great!
B00GFAKNZ6|5|Beautiful dress.
B00B89PJZI|5|This dress is great- I wore it to a wedding fairly soon after having a baby, and it looked elegant while disguising some of my newly aquired curves.<br />I will definitely wear it again, and can dress it up or down depending on shoes, hair, and jewelry,
B00XZD660M|5|Got these for my teenage son as a surprise. Him and his 6 year old brother play plants vs. zombies so he was tickled green. Shirts are good quality and fit as expected and washed well. Just ordered some more from this brand, thank you amazon!
B000A38EUU|5|I bought these for my husband for Christmas.  He had an old pair and was in need of a new pair.  He works outdoors and on very cold days these keep him very warm.  He would highly recommend these.  They are made good and fit well!
B005442A0K|5|Love it very warm!!
B00MAO7DGI|5|I love these joggers!!!! Great Fit!
B00XWHGO3U|5|Shirt came exactly as expected. It's comfortable
B000HKXKDW|5|6 bucks for a decent wig is an amazing price- very good quality for such a low price- don't know if this was a close-out or what but i'm very happy with it and thanks for the quick shipping!
B00A3HEBQ4|5|Great dress can be worn dressed up with heels or at the beach with flip flops! Size M fits like women's size small or 4. I am 5'4&#34;, 125 lbs with big hips and size M fits me perfectly.
B00O7OTT34|1|Not at all what I expected.  The pattern covers only the front with a black fabric back.  The sequins will cut you under your arms when wearing for only 5 minutes.  Fit was nice, but not worth the pain from the sequins!
B00IUAFYVM|5|These pants look nice and fit nice.  I especially like the inconspicuous cargo pockets - no visible seams, just the zipper pull.
B008I582B8|3|Little small but still a good fit...
B00BRLGC5I|5|Just perfect!
B00CBALAME|4|not much else to say just awesome to own and wear. the material is pretty thin though so I dont expect the actual shirt to last too long.
B005OB7CNI|3|I have a couple of different CK boxer briefs and trunks and I love them all because of the special crotch area that holds your privates so well. These CKs are not like that... they are just simple briefs, just like the ones you could pick up at Target for a fraction of the cost.
B00284B5TQ|1|I have worn flexees for quite some time.  I am very disappointed in this particular shaper.  The reason I purchased it is because I saw some reviewers indicate that it had a short torso.  I am short, about 5&#34;0 tall and it was too short for me.  Nice backside coverage, but I also did not like the feel of the straps.  I have no idea how you taller women are wearing this one, but enjoy.  I won't re-purchase this style.
B005HDPCQ2|2|I am 5'4\\", 132 lbs. According to the website, a size 6 needs a medium. Upon receipt, color was cute and the quality seemed very good but, when I tried it on, the torso was so short that the cups were waaaay below my bust. I have a very average to short torso so one would have to be extremely petite to wear this. Other than that was TTS. Was disappointed because, had it been a bit longer, would have been really adorable for shape wear.
B00HDOU94I|5|My son loved it!
B007IRM1YG|5|These shirts are very good. They are long enough that the women folk don't have to look at plumbers crack of my 300 lb. body when bending or crouching.  The quality of this shirt rivals the JC Penney shirts of old. They are well stitched, wear evenly with a very good collar. I ordered these, the regular collar T's and underwear and am pleased with all.
B002IKLY7S|4|Perry Ellis makes great shirts. The only negative thing about the shirt is the picture that is shown on Amazon. It seems like it's a bright white with light colored plaid, but when I got it, it's a litter darker that I would have hoped. Regardless, it's a great shirt that I will wear on a regular basis.
B00GRS3DRG|4|First off Its really  a Decent quality jacket, a good  deal considering the low price, and it looks nice on. But like most foreign clothing the sizing is tricky, OK so I'm a average build 5'8 male not necessarily wide in the shoulders, I'm actually sort of a slim build all around. I would normally buy a US. Men's size small Jacket and it would fit and then some. But this said to order 2 sizes larger so I ordered a large. Upon receiving the item it was still too small being short on the arms, and in the shoulders. So honestly I would recommend buying 3 sizes larger for a good fit. It seems kind of crazy but you probably will need  it.
B00FPWFTKE|2|I purchased two of these shirts, they are short to the point that they don't remain tucked in comfortably, and sleeve length is not adequate in comparison to other shirts I own in the same size.
B00I9WY1JC|5|excellent
B00BB8VK8G|5|This is another great Calvin Klein value.  It was well made and the fit was good.  I would gladly purchase this otfit again.  It was well worth the price.
B00B6PT964|4|I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. Its a quality dress, with some vaguely familiar designer label..probably a knock off, but I dont mind! The dress has beautifully done lace, which seems surpisingly sturdy, and kept me relatively warm on a cold Norwegian night out on the town. The excellent liner helped as well..thick and slimming. The length was perfect, a couple inches above the knee, with a slit in back. I did have to constantly pull the dress down while dancing because of the slit. I was pleased with the fit though. I am a solid 4 in dress size, with an athletic 134 lbs build...34\\" 27\\" 36\\" and a height of 5'7. However I bought a 6 in this case and I am glad of that. It was certainly fitted, but not unseemly tight or uncomfortable. I would recomend this dress for those in cooler climates or for fall.
B000U70RC4|5|Olga's attention to detail is just what this 55 year old woman appreciates.  The coverage is great, the straps stay up, the back hooks are lined & best of all it is so comfortable I can wear it to bed, if I want.  It is convenient that I found this product online; saves time & money.
B003IYYEB6|5|This tank top is sheer and form fitting. I wore it today under a regular tank top and I didn't even notice I had it on! It didn't make me super hot, which is what I was originally worried about.  When it came time to nurse my 2 month old, I was able to easily unhook the clip and enjoy not showing off my side fat! I'm a 32H and a medium fit me perfect. Yes it is a bit long but that really isn't a big issue. I'm 5'2&#34; so it's probably a bit longer on me anyways. I think the length ensures that it won't ride up. You can tuck it into your pants but I was fine wearing it as is. This is exactly what I needed since I nurse my baby without a nursing cover.
B00T7U9MFS|5|great shirts dont feel cheap and scratchy like others,
B00T2QH376|5|Fit as expected and the seller is amazing, we contacted her and she answered us right away. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.
B00DVH5GDA|3|they are great, however they fit my daughter rather tight but we managed to use them, they were for a christmas play and we did not have time to return or exchange, very expensive though, couldve had better quality from walmart for 5 bucks
B00H5APHV0|1|Fit small
B00G6KPBZM|5|This has great quality and hold. Super comfortable. My favorite freya sports bra so far. That being said, $72 is really kind of ridiculous for a sports bra that probably cost them nothing to make...Kind of disappointed with that.
B00BT77PB0|5|AAAA++++
B000FGX7YA|5|great!!!<br />2nd buy of three!
B00J66DI7Q|5|Absolutely love it, got it for a close friend for there birthday next month
B00PIM5E7Y|5|Very comfy, yet stylish. Feels like PJs
B005YO3HGQ|3|I've ordered the 'Rinsed Playa' jeans first, probably 2 weeks before ordering these so i put in an order for the darker pair. These came and they fit significantly different that the other ones. Not as breathable / stretchy, and pretty tight. Almost feels like skinny jeans.<br /><br />=/ 4/10
B00ARA6JTY|5|Very happy with this product. Any Pokemon fan will love this adult size hat from the original series main character.
B005VVRGKU|4|I purchased this belt for my granddaughters aged 7, 8 and 10 to play &#34;dress-up&#34; with. I purchased one each of black, red and silver. I will say they like them very much and have fun playing with them.
B0089KCA6K|5|My 10 year old grandson loved this shirt. He is a big Star Wars and Lego fan, so it was a home run on both counts. Also, it runs true to size.
B00BCYDSL6|4|Super cute! My girl is in 18 months, at 12 months, and it's just a little too big. Not a deal breaker though. She's still wearing it for her party coming up.
B00567OBQQ|3|The front is nice, however the back is completely yellow, they could have added a bit of color to make it a better costume.
B003Q6AXJ8|2|Wish I saw tracy's review before I purchased.  The rows of coins are about 10&#34; shorter than the other Zumba skirts that I have.  Total length is fine, but that's not the point.  I like to wear my skirt with coins in the front and the back with the tie on the side.  Can't with this one. Just looks weird.
B00FM4E5MI|3|Nice wallet. Thought it would last longer but it totally ripped apart after two months of use. The grommet pulled through the leather and destroyed the wallet completely.
B006E5PNR0|5|This bathrobe ran a bit large for the size marked but I hemmed it, added some pink terry cloth mouse ears, embroidered a cute mouse face on it and now I have an adorable bathrobe for my 18 month old granddaughter.  The terry cloth is soft and luxurious and became even fluffier after washing.  Overall, a wonderful robe for the price and made of hard-to-find terry.  I don't like synthetic fibers so this was a great purchase.
B00A76FEG2|4|The sizing on they hybrid trousers varies noticeably -- this pair was a bit tighter than others I have, but there color is great for the fall with a blazer and pair of boots.
B00N34NT94|2|Although I followed the size chart, these were way to small.  Would recommend ordering one size larger than your normal size.  I returned for a refund.  Delivery was extremely quick with Amazon Prime and refund was processed quickly.  2-stars is only because they were smaller than size chart said.  Looked to be if good quality
B007G11T7Y|4|and the feel of these.  They are comfortable, give great coverage and protection and enhance the butt.  My girlfriend thinks they are extremely sexy as well.  I drive a truck and I wear these under my uniform.  Great buy.
B00L21LVSQ|3|The legs are thin
B00B5GS5O6|3|Would have loved it if the material was a bit thicker, not so sheer. Dont get me wrong its beautiful but would have been great wearing at the pool then go grab lunch or shop
B003U9VPMU|5|this top came just as seen in the picture. good quality. and packaged excellent the fitting is also as expected
B00631VHSE|5|I love this town, because it is made of a slightly heavier cotton, that remains crisp and lovely after every washing!
B00CHAWRZ2|5|I ordered four of these in four different colors in medium size to wear at home. I am a 34DD. These fit perfectly! Material is super soft but holds up really well. Very comfortable. White is see through.
B000VZPUP4|5|You can never go wrong with Arrow Shirts, well made, great quality and a great fit. I'm a repeat customer...
B00MMOVD3U|1|No way this product is made for kids - toddlers at most and those toddlers with small heads
B00I3VZZ7G|2|I did not like the cut of the shirt
B000GOF4WY|5|My hubby is from MA so I am partial to Red Sox.  When I found out it was a boy, I had to have a Red Sox onesie for him.  I surprised my husband with it and he loved it!  Our son wore it a few times and now I want a pink one for your infant daughter!
B00B9KU636|4|As described.  The beads are only on the outside if you have both tiers behind you. I haven't decided whether to wear it for my wedding yet. Will come back if I do! Update: wore for my wedding and got tons of compliments! Everyone was shocked it was so affordable!
B00CCQS8FO|2|The leather is great, but plastic case that holds the phone breaks to easy.  So I give it a 2 star rating.
B00FQPX3BW|4|La compre para mi hijo y le quedo exacta, ni muy grande ni muy ajustada.
B00G2JM0XS|5|I really love the shirt and it fits great!<br />can't wait to wear it!
B00HNYZT02|5|I love this brand! I'm petite, 5'0&#34; and about 125 lbs. I have a small waist but bigger than average leg and butt muscles (ex-soccer player lol). Size 9 fits me perfect. It has always been a challenge finding jeans that fit perfectly, and it's an added bonus that they are inexpensive. I have several pairs (about a year) and they aren't showing signs of wear yet. Love them!!!
B0009MZVAS|5|I bought 3 pairs of the Thorlo socks last Christmas for my daughter, who lives in New York City. She says that these socks are the only ones she's ever found that keep her feet warm through winter and give her superior comfort from the thick padding. When she told me that she has to wash them twice a week because she wears them EVERY day in cold weather, I ordered 4 more pairs so she can get through one week's wear. Through her description, I can highly recommend them to anyone who is on their feet for many hours a day, and needs a good thermal sock for warmth.
B007NLXBZA|5|Really like this dress! It's a beautiful wine color and the size is true. The detail is amazing on this dress...very lovely. I bought a pashmina on Amazon to cover my shoulders and it looks very put together. Great price and quality! I will be getting more colors.
B00IOGWXVG|5|This is a great leotard.  My daughter needed a black one for her ballet class and this fit the bill perfectly.  Love the added frilly detail along the top and the understated sparkle on the wide shoulder straps.  The back has a small bow for added cuteness!  My 6 year old loved it as soon as she took it out of the package.  Just beware, like any leotard, I found this to run on the smaller side, so order a size larger than what you would normally.  My daughter is in a 6x/7 in regular clothing and I ordered the medium 8/10 and it fits perfectly.
B00WRW8UJW|5|Just what I expected
B0059EO4TU|4|This is a beautiful, soft, warm, cuddly fabric and I wish I had more in my closet made from it! This is a robe I suppose, but I'm wearing it as an open cardigan.  Taking away one star because as it hangs on you, the sweater stretches longer. Also, given that I didn't wash before wearing, the fabric shed some fine downy fuzz onto my other clothes. I couldn't care less though, it's so comfy to wear!
B008EQQLPA|5|Love the stocking good quality. Not too thick not too thin. Durable for a 3 year old
B00KBZD60U|3|very cute, seems well made. But definitely for a slender body type. Not someone with breasts and butt. If you are curvy this is probably not going to fit you very well unless you're a very petite and slender curvy girl .
B005MIZDX4|5|Very high quality, warm, thick fabric. Sewn together nicely. Looks great, well worth the money. I will probably buy another in a different color!
B00O29RNUK|4|They AREN'T see-through, they seem pretty well made, they fit well, they're comfortable, and they're cheap. Pretty win-win. I was surprised at how long they were, which for me is a plus because I'm tall—but might be a problem for shorter ladies. They come down to about two inches above my ankle bones (unlike the model's pic). Ankle openings seem a little wider than the picture too, but still skinny.
B00GWT78TY|5|My grandson has been taking lessons for a few months.  This was a Christmas gift and he has worn it since to lessons and performances.  Everyone else wants one!
B007QPATA8|5|Hubby loves it!
B0007CKMDQ|5|Great fit.  He is well pleased with the feel and texture of the jeans.  Will buy more later .  Thank you !!
B001Q7MSH4|5|These pants matched the ones I previously purchased in the store and at less than half the price.  They arrived before the first expected arrival date.  Excellent service!
B00JDQ8BU8|5|My husband loves this belt. He's a big guy, with the gut over the belt, it got really uncomfortable for him if his shirts were untucked. He loves it. The system is really cool and easy to adjust to the perfect size. The belt is sturdy and the design on this one is slick. He photo makes it look a little greenish, but it is really black. If you're on the fence, try it.
B00L3KTS86|4|Fit right
B00A1XQCF8|5|Great price Great watch
B00IV5GL0E|5|I got this for a 4th of July celebration and it was perfect! It's a really soft material and for the price I wasn't expecting it to be something I would wear on other occasions.
B00D5OW2U4|5|Every year I get my good friend two of these for x-mas. She loves them and wont accept any other brand. She loves how soft they are and how well they hold up over time. Great gift
B00SMRNB7C|5|Awesome deal. Great glasses
B00IRGJFOG|5|GOOD
B00B1BXIOC|5|I like them. for the price they are very cute and comfortable.<br />A little loose on the ankles, but other then that, I love em.<br />So does my boyfriend, haha.
B00GHH9OPM|5|I am 125 pounds and 5.7 tall and the small size fits perfectly. It looks great and got lots of compliments when I wore it. It looks exactly like in the picture
B00AED8QKY|5|fits great nice and thin can see my crown especially when wet the girls love it
B007A7PQZ0|5|Husband absolutely loved it.
B007AD7FFI|4|as you can tell from the title of this I bought this for my 4 yr old boy who is actually fairly small for his size. Yup the hat is a bit big for him.<br /><br />Let me stress that it is only a Bit Big. It doesnt fit on my head at all. I would say this would fit the 6-12 yr old boy range. I wouldnt necessarily call this a &#34;Men's&#34; size.
B00HU0BQPG|4|I almost didn't buy this wig because it looked very cheap in the picture. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  Great for the price.
B004K416PA|4|I have large calves and was worried about my legs looking like &#34;stuffed sausages&#34;.  These worked great! They are stretchy and comfortable.  They did stretch out a bit (started pulled up to mid calf) by the end of the night they were at my ankles, but let's say I was moving and shaking so it could be expected.  I would say that if you are a tiny person, these might be a little big on you by the end of the night.
B00COK3ER0|3|Ordered 36/32, length fits more like 34
B00D8CUUNE|2|I got this to replace a nice Lodis wallet that I had really loved, so I was sort of trying to find as close to exactly the same thing as I could.<br /><br />I found this wallet a bit too bulky, the color appears pretty washed out when you see it in peron, and the clip has an ugly logo engraved on it.<br /><br />I ended up buying another Lodis.
B00WKTUJ8C|5|I wish I had bought more! (Plus my husband loves how they look!) The most comfortable yoga pant! Truthfully, I'm a chubby girl, and I didn't feel self conscious in these at all!
B00KVDLDU2|5|Looks exactly like Natsu's scarf, is a great size, and really warm!
B00HQC6XG0|2|Material low quality, very thin material
B001JBNDLM|3|toooooooo largeeeeeeeee
B00FWR4X7C|5|Good price, nice fit and saved a lot of running around trying to find the right size! I'm satisfied with the purchase and would buy again.
B00FK6CUGQ|5|Love it. Look better in person, fit great, feel sexy!
B005S2GQLW|2|My polo shirt has a small hole in the front... I would like to change this item.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Roberto
B00JBW2U9W|4|It arrived within  a week of me ordering it, its great quality and has very fluorescent colors. I ordered a small and the bottom fit great...but the top is awkwardly small. I'm a 34B and the cups on the suit are unusually close together and almost pointy looking.
B00BJOG5GY|5|This was a christmas gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it! Couldn't wait to put it on. Fits perfectly. Thank you
B005SCNCJQ|4|Fit perfectly, lots of room.  Feel better than comparable Levi's, which surprised me.
