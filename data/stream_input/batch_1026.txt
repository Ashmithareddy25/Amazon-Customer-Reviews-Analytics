B003KT3NRA|1.0|I own over 8,000 albums, and I have to say that this is one of the worst cds I have ever heard.  Juvenile lyrics,lack-luster covers, and just plain bad songs.  Tommy had a pretty good album a few years back with Tommyland, but this is a real stinker.  The cover tunes show just how weak and limited his voice is.  This is one of the best examples of the famous overating of items that appears on Amazon.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|This would have been an amazing movie that me and my pals enjoyed to the extreme except for 2 reasons! The reasons are that it had way too many close ups of Miley Cyrus's dentist's nightmare and the fact that it was just a tad depressing! Most of us do not love Miley Cyrus and her behavior so me and my pals felt that she hurt a good concept! My other point is that no one wants to leave a movie theater feeling as sad as we did! So if you want to be annoyed by Miley and bawl your head off for 2 hours then go ahead and buy this. If not, read the book! Ive heard it was pretty good!
0439023491|5.0|The first book in this series was great and this one was just as good if not better
0393061310|5.0|Whenever I read a book that I really like, I always check out the bibliography to see if there are other books on the subject that I might like to read.  I pay special attention to books that are specifically mentioned in the text of whatever book I am reading.  Lately, one title has come up over and over, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".  I read it when it was published in 1997.  Because so many authors are using it in their research, I decided that it was time to read it again.<br /><br />Rereading this book was a pleasure.  Enough time has passed since my first reading, that I experienced those \\"aha\\" moments again.  Moments when what the author is saying is so clear and makes so much sense that I find myself wondering why I have never looked at the subject in that light before.  His thesis is very simple.  The reason that Eurasian peoples conquered and colonized the world was not because they were smarter than the so-called primitive societies that they encountered.  Instead, the reason was simply that they had more plants and animals in their environment that were suitable for domestication which led to population increases which led to more people to come up with technological inventions such as the writing and sophisticated weapons.<br /><br />Peoples lacking enough plants and animals in their environment that were suitable for domestication either got a later start at food production and technology or never moved beyond the hunter-gatherer stage.  Which is not to say that they were any less intelligent.  My favorite anecdote is about two English explorers who perished while attempting to traverse the outback of Australia, an area where the aboriginal tribes had been able to find enough food and water to survive with no problem for thousands of years.<br /><br />And while it is true that many conquered peoples died from the diseases that were introduced by Europeans, those same Europeans died of tropical diseases at the same rates until 20th century medicine was able to overcome them.<br /><br />It's no surprise that this book has become a classic.  Nor should it surprise anyone that it is the Ur text for anyone writing on climate, food and human civilization.It's no surprise that this book has become a classic.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Beatles are utterly studio bound now and their confidence as musicians is demonstrated throughout, crafting a record with absolute flexibility. Song-wise, as a whole, it's not quite as inspired as \\"Rubber Soul\\". And a couple of the songs just occupy space. But the remainder of the material is spot on and the soundscape is diverse and innovative. Ringo's silly song miraculously escapes its own triviality into something funloving. George's brilliant moment is the opening cut where he takes a piss at the Establishment. Paul triumphs twice in his narratives. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is as evocative as one can get in chronicling a world of loneliness. And in his most astute and tragic ballad, \\"For No One\\", he distills a chilling portrait of a couple who are slated to part company. His almost detached vocal and the mournful French-horn solo amplify this feeling of inevitable loss. As the emotional inverse, Paul's ode to marijuana is complemented by its chipper Stax-like brass. Sadness and madness permeate the great acid rock of John's \\"She Said She Said\\" - the guitar work here speaks for itself. And his spiritual quest closer, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is the most ambitious and futuristic sounding of all: a one-chord wonder of various electronic noise swirling about backed by a drum groove with hypnotic effect. Especially noteworthy is George Martin's major league production values.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is an excellent show. It's so funny and well written! You are constantly amazed by how the writers manage to bring stuff from past episodes in a very smart way. The characters are lovable and funny at the same time. With each new episode you'll laugh a bit more, as everything is explained by situations from the past.  Watch HIMYM. You're not going to regret it. Having seen the five seasons (and waiting for the next one to start) I can say that I love this show more than I loved \\"Friends\\".
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This movie was like \\"whoa\\" in my mind. After the opening credits, I was like \\"whoa\\"! Afterward, I hit pause to get myself some popcorn. I didn't have a bowl so I just spilled the popcorn all over my shirt and ate it off my stomach. Anyway, as I was eating the popcorn, I was like \\"whoa\\" this movie is good. I'm not usually into action-drama/comedy's but this movie tackles every genre. When the main character was running from someone, I was like \\"whoa\\" and how the heck did they think of this action scene. I usually don't compare apples or oranges but this scene reminded me of when Forest Gump was running from someone. After the movie ended, I was like \\"whoa\\" because my mind was blown. It was like the director shoved a blow dryer in my mind. I hope they make a sequel so the get \\"whoaed\\" all over again.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Most of the stories where fun to watch and you can see that they care about their acting and the writers love their work.  It's not to often casting directer gets the right people in the roles, I can watch this series over and over.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|Five years on, the episode after episode inability of Booth and Bones to come together as other than crime partners is wearing thin.  The first four seasons were highly comedic and capitalized on Bones's and Booth's relationship as a crime fighting duo who were also reluctantly attracted to one another.  However, this season, they are a mess over one another.  He is clearly and unequivocally in love.  She is also in love but is scared to death of ever acting on it.  This conflict occurs in every single episode.<br /><br />I frankly think to break this impasse it would be better to marry them off and then have the comedic friction come from their problems as a Nick and Nora Charles type couple (\\"The Thin Man\\").  The unrequited love is sapping the considerable energy and magic of this show plus Bones and Booth as a comedic detective team.  Fortunately, the development of Hodkins and Angela is a lot more satisfying for the viewer.  We also have another wonderful guest appearance by Stephen Fry as Gordon Gordon, psychiatrist turned chef.<br /><br />The \\"X Files\\" developed the same unrequited problem as it continued and it took 9 seasons to bring Mulder and Scully together.  Yes, I kept watching and will keep watching this show for the very same reason, i.e. the episodes week to week make it worth it.  The forensic cases week after week, the interaction of the full cast, the comedy involving the full cast, all of this makes it worth while watching week after week. But the unrequited love over nine seasons made the final few seasons of the \\"X files\\" barely watchable and I hope that doesn't happen here.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The Sony \\"Stock\\" controllers are a torture. Yes I know it is very much the same design as the ps2 controller, but that sucked too. They are built for people with very small hands and are just horrible. They give me all kinds of cramps and nerve pain the way the handle ends dig into the center of your palms. The left stick is poorly placed forcing you to contort your hand and get cramping in your thumb... and the \\"trigger\\" buttons blow.    I prefer the 360 controller design, so I just use a wired one w/ an adapter for the ps3 or I use the Shadow controller. I have not had any of the issues (with the shadow) mentioned in other reviews for that product.    Hope this helps.
006145205X|5.0|It is refreshing to discover a discussion of the future with an optimistic tone; especially one that substantiates itself with reason.  Matt Ridley presents an intriguing and exceptionally compelling case for a positive future, complete with facts and logic that will give even the most ardent naysayers pause.<br /><br />The book attempts to answer the question: \\"Can we anticipate an increase in the quality of life as we head into the future.\\"<br /><br />It is easy to get caught up in all the bad news we are constantly bombarded with these days, but Ridley stomps on the notion that things were better in the past, citing the human tendency to gravitate to the negative as the culprit for this false perception of reality.  As Ridley points out, although is easy to assume quality of life is deteriorating, the facts regarding the human population as a whole says otherwise:<br /><br />- The risk of death due to war or terrorism to the average human today is lower than any time in history<br />- The overall average life expectancy for humans on earth is higher than ever, almost 1/3 higher than just 50 years ago<br />- On average, humans are less likely now than in any other time in history to die as a result of war, genocide, murder, childbirth, accidents, tornadoes, flooding, famine, and a considerable abundance of diseases.<br />- Current day numbers show that the average human is more literate, more likely to own a telephone, a flush toilet, a refrigerator, a bicycle, and have access to clean water.<br /><br />Life is certainly not perfect, and some clearly still live in misery on this planet, but overall, as Ridley points out, we even take for granted many of the significant improvements that even the richest people of yesteryear had no access to.  \\"Today, of Americans officially designated as `poor', 99 percent have electricity, running water, flush toilets, and a refrigerator; 95 percent have a television, 88 percent a telephone; 71 percent a car and 70 percent air conditioning.  Cornelius Vanderbilt (the richest man in the world in the mid 1800s) had none of these.\\"<br /><br />The core of this book delves into Ridley's reasoning of why the quality of human life is very likely to continue improving well into to the foreseeable future.  To paraphrase from the book, at a time when glass fiber is replacing copper cable, electrons are replacing paper and most employment involves more software than hardware, only the most static of imaginations could think that diminishing resources are certain to doom us all.  This is not simply a narrow minded argument; Ridley skillfully addresses issues of diminishing resources, environmental concerns, energy demands, and nearly all major areas of concern today.  The end result is a persuasive book that successfully counters the mainstream standards of cynicism.<br /><br />The reality is quality of life may be just as subjective as how happy we are; something entirely based on how we personally choose to view the world around us.  Yet Ridley's greatest success with this book might not just be that he shines a beacon of optimism among an ocean of pessimism, it is that he succeeds in doing it convincingly.nditioning.

B002ZG980U|2.0|The pounding soundtrack, imaginative visuals and sincere performances in Christopher Nolan's latest high-flying mindbender do not ultimately add up to anything more than a loud, noisy, occasionally diverting series of dreams.  Explosions, chases and frequent gunfire grow tiresome after the first 30 minutes, and the emotion meant to sustain us - Leonardo DiCaprio's wife and kids - just doesn't.  Sorry - this one fell totally flat for me, and had none of the nightmarish sheen that made some of Nolan's other films - Dark Knight and Memento - so memorable.

B00275EHJG|5.0|I finished watching Toy Story 3 and although I still have not seen the first two Toy Story films, I felt that the action and lessons learned were powerfully portrayed, but missing the adult themes and nostalgia that I enjoyed with Wall-E and Up.<br /><br />The film starts out with a short, \\"Day & Night\\" which I thought was fun.  Both Day and Night have their pros and cons which we see.  Ah the nightlife of Vegas!  Ah, the beach girls in summer!<br /><br />Many years ago, most films had a cartoon and a newsreel before starting the main picture.  In fact, there were these things called \\"double features\\" which you don't see too much of, which had two films playing for a single admission price.  Good old days.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the main event:  Andy's toys are being boxed up and he's on his way to college.  Through an accident, most of Andy's toys almost get trashed (to a toy, being trashed is the same as hell!).  Thanks to some of Woody's (cowboy toy) actions they escape only to end up in Sunnydale, a preschool that has the apparency of lots of kids playing with toys, to being beaten up and busted apart by little children!<br /><br />The toys are not happy with being treated like hammers and paint brushes and want to be played with.  Too bad says \\"Lotso\\", a large, toy bear who is literally a dictator running the toy show at the preschool.<br /><br />I came away from the movie with the idea that there are several ways to handle rejection.  Some of the toys, like Lotso, handled rejection by becoming bitter and treating others badly.  He came up with the false idea that \\"everyone\\" treats toys like hand-me-downs, that they can easily be replaced, and that they are not appreciated and will eventually be trashed.<br /><br />Andy's toys however deal with rejection in a different way.  They too feel that they are being rejected and trashed.  But they also understand that Andy is growing up and no longer has a need for toys.  They're not too keen with ending up in the attic storage but at least they won't be trashed.  But these toys are flexible:  All they want is to be played with.<br /><br />Finally, Woody is not too keen on being trashed either.  But he wants to maintain status quo.  He feels that they all belong to Andy and should be loyal to him.<br /><br />All three groups have an epiphany of sorts.  Some adapt and well, some just don't change and end up on the wrong side of (something) (no spoilers, sorry!).<br /><br />There are some scenes that might be a bit intense for smaller kids, but I think Pixar earned its five stars because of what it created here has a story lesson, is not knocking you upside the head with its moral lessons, has some conflict and resolution and is fun to watch.<br /><br />For me, not as charming and fun as Wall-E or Up, but still highly recommended for the kids in your life.e trashed.

0061906220|4.0|This book has wide appeal--from toddlers and preschoolers first learning their colors, to older kids as well<br /><br />It's a story about colors. Pete's shoes are white, but as he takes a walk, they get stained, blue from blueberries, red from strawberries, brown from mud, etc. The art is whimsical and bluesy, which nicely complements Pete's character, because he is one cool cat.<br /><br />I think that his attitude to getting his shoes stained serves as a nice understated reminder to kids that age who can be so volatile. Though this is a story about colors, which is perfect for young preschoolers, the plot and humor is enough that it also interested my six-year-old son, and the text is simple enough that it encouraged him to read it on his own.

I must say, for me it started out very slowly, and I couldn't keep up with the seemingly endless list of characters. But it got SO much better, and I found myself unable to put it down.   I think if I would have been taught it in school, I would have given it 5 stars, but I wasn't paying attention enough to witness its true beauty. Maybe I'll read it again, slower, and more pensively!

You will have a laundry list of incentives behind why you should avoid processed or fast food that is much more convincing than the issue of \\"dieting\\" or \\"calorie counting.\\" If you are a parent, I especially believe you have a responsibility to educate yourself so you can help your kids avoid the obesity epidemic that has gripped their generation.
B0032Y8XH8|3.0|Mumford & Sons have a great sense of rhythm and instrumentation, and some great melodies and harmonies. This is an easy album to listen to, and has an infectious energy. My favourite is 'Little Lion Man', a justly popular track.    I was primed to be blown away by 'Sigh No More' because of the hype, and I enjoy folk rock music. But I must register disappointment here because the music is quite let down by the lyrics. There is a lack of maturity in the writing, and some very obvious choices in the rhymes and phrasing that become quite distracting in places. Also the whole album is infused with a sort of faux-profundity, with portentous Biblical language expressing rather vague personal and relational crises. The romantic songs sound a bit too much like 'Rambling Through the Avenues of Time' by Flight of the Conchords.    This is a good album, and deserves the appreciation it gets. But it not as good as it could be, or as their subsequent albums probably will be.
B0014DFCMS|5.0|A tender story that reflects the spiteful and mindless antics of a disfunctional underage shrew that bullies everyone around her including the passive moron that knocks her up!!

B00005JL3A|2.0|I hate all the reviewers and critics who say that \\"fans of the video game are going to love this movie.\\" These critics normally aren't gamers or fans of the source material, so how can they be an adequate judge of the tastes of gamers? I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil game franchise, the very person these critics believe that will enjoy the Resident Evil films. But I DESPISE these movies. And why, do you ask? Because they really aren't much like the games at all. Oh sure, there's a mansion, zombies, zombie dogs, a \\"Licker\\" creature, and the malignant Umbrella corporation. But aside from those aesthetical similarities, the film bears little resemblance to the games.    When preproduction of the first Resident Evil film began, the legendary George Romero, whose Dead franchise was a major inspiration for the Resident Evil games, was commissioned to write a script. His script shared many similarities to the game, such as the inclusion of characters like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. However, it also made changes to the story that game developers Capcom didn't like, and Romero was ultimately turned down. Instead, they hired Paul WS Anderson, director of Event Horizon and another video game movie, Mortal Kombat. His treatment was more like a prequel to the games, and this approach was more acceptable to Capcom's head honchos. Anderson's treatment was greenlit, and \\"Resident Evil: Ground Zero\\" went into production (the \\"Ground Zero\\" subtitle was abandoned after the events of September 11th).    The film begins in The Hive, a massive laboratory facility beneath Raccoon City. The mutagenic T-Virus is being tested in the labs, but someone releases the virus, infecting the hundreds of scientists within the facility. Sensing the outbreak, The Hive's security system, the artifically-intelligent Red Queen, locks down the facility and douses everyone in halon to further prevent their escape.    We switch to Alice (Milla Jovovich), who awakens in an empty mansion after passing out in the shower. Her collapse has has given her amnesia, a condition that becomes ever more frightening when a team of nameless Special Ops soldiers (see: fodder) employed by Umbrella storms the mansion. Turns out that the mansion serves as a secret entrance to The Hive, and the team has been sent to infiltrate The Hive and investigate its lockdown. The team directs Alice down into the bowels of the facility to assist with the task. Why they can't determine the nature of the lockdown from the outside is beyond me, since that would be a much more logical thing to do. And why can't they just trust the security system they created and leave The Hive locked down, rather than endangering the lives of an entire Special Ops team and potentially the lives of everyone on the outside by reopening the Hive? But as you're going to find out while watching the Resident Evil films, logic does not exist in this dojo.     Anyway, Alice and the team discover that the T-Virus has turned everyone in The Hive into flesh-eating zombies, and they must get out of the facility before it is sealed up  permanently. But seeing the risk of letting them leave, the Red Queen isn't going to make it easy for them.    The Resident Evil games excel at creating a dark, suspenseful atmosphere, where you don't know what horrors are literally waiting around the corner. The main characters are given little ammunition to fend off the hordes of zombies and creatures salivating for their flesh, perpetuating a sense of doom and dread since the player must be methodical and conservative with their weapons. Writer/director Anderson attempts to establish a suspenseful mood by not even introducing the zombies until about halfway through the film. But sadly, all attepted suspense is lost once the flesheaters appear and the Covert Ops team whip out their big machine guns and blast away at them. The film becomes less about mood and scares and more about action and gunfire.    The emphasis on action increases once Alice begins regaining her memory, suddenly remembering that she is a martial arts expert who can run along walls, do flying kicks, and break necks with her thighs. It feels like her sparring partner was Trinity in The Matrix.    In fact, the film cribs a lot of elements from The Matrix Bargain Bin, such as references to Alice in Wonderland (Alice, the Red Queen, the entrance to The Hive is a mirror), wire-fu, slow-motion bullets, and a lead character who suddenly discovers that they have incredible abilities. The film also seems to \\"borrow\\" elements from other genre films like Cube and Day of the Dead, though it's hard to criticize the game for using elements of Romero's zombie films since the games themselves are inspired by them.    The film also possess a chugging, screeching metal/electronica score composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. No, I'm not kidding. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson assisted in the creation of the film's score. It's actually quite good, even if the combination of the crunching electronic guitars, pounding drum machines, and heavy gunfire could give you a headache by the end of the film.    This film is \\"meh\\". It isn't great, it isn't good, it isn't god-awful. It's quite derivative of other films it shouldn't be, and it lacks the elements that make the game so great. The acting is...well...there. It's also hard to care about characters who don't even have names. The only reason we know that Milla Jovovich's character is named Alice is because it's in the end credits. Characters are almost never addressed by their names during the film. So you feel almost completely indifferent when half the cast is killed off fairly early in the film. They all feel like nameless, faceless fodder, as bad as any cast of horny teens in any random 80's slasher film.    The highlights? The score and the rather humorous audio commentary of Anderson, Jovovich, producer Jeremy Bolt, and castmate Michelle Rodriguez. Jovovich sounds like she's in full \\"valley girl\\" mode here, and they joke about everything from Milla's gas (a little T.M.I. if you ask me), their time spent in a German nightclub (the film was shot mostly in Berlin), and cast member Eric Mabius' affinity for yogurt. But it says a lot about a film when one of the major highlights of the film is its audio commentary. After all, you don't watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 because the movies they're riffing on are great.

I went the very first day to the movie theater with my girlfriends and we enjoyed the film but at the same time I was disappointed. I didn't understand many things...the movie looked rushed and everything happened so fast that I left the theater wanting more.<br />I didn't buy the DVD when it came out (I own all Orlando Bloom's movies) because I didn't want to see again what could have been a great movie and wasn't. Then I found out about this set and after reading some of the reviews I decided to buy it even though I couldn't imagine how big a difference a few more scenes would make....well let me tell you one thing...this director cut is a true masterpiece! It was like watching a complete different movie. When you see it you realize how badly mutilated the theatrical version was and I can't imagine Ridley Scott's frustration after seeing his great work destroyed that way.<br /><br />Give this movie a second chance! Watch the Director's Cut and you will be pleasantly surprised....it is soooo good.....this is a set you will treasure....don't waste your money buying the regular DVD.

He doesn't sugarcoat things or try to place the blame on others, he lets things fall where they lie. If you're interested in Dave as a person then this will be a good read, if you're wanting to get into detailed accounts of recording info, look elsewhere. As a guitarist I would have liked to have seen more about his unique style and show he writes songs but it is still a very good book and I highly recommend it. For a guy who is often demonized or portrayed as godly he comes across as rather human in this book.......

He's invincible, of course, but the reader is sympathetic to his emotional needs.
B003S897U0|3.0|The Crowes last album [[ASIN:B002FG9MVU Before The Frost...Until The Freeze]] could not have been better. It was innovative, energetic, covered their strengths and influences--it even had some seventies Stones disco and a Stephen Stills cover. When I heard Croweology was on its way, I figured it would be a fun way to end this band's whole career.<br /><br />Problem is, it could have been so much more. For even casual fans or concert goers, we've heard acoustic versions of these songs before on Letterman or VH1 Storytellers, and they had an on-the-edge, spontaneous kind of energy. This album will be fun for those guys, but I can't see them preferring these versions to the originals. For the UBER-fans, those guys have been taping acoustic Crowes shows and buying live acoustic MP3s at [...] for ages, and this album, as fine as it is, won't bump those off the rotation.<br /><br />So, say what you want, but I think this was kind of a missed opportunity. How about really mixing it up and giving these songs a total about-face? I mean, why not? I'm not saying do an all-accordion version of Nonfiction, but change the tempos a little more here and there, throw in that sitar from Aimless Peacock, get a gospel choir for \\"Thorn In My Pride.\\" I don't know. Something different.<br /><br />The highlights are a bangin \\"My Morning Song\\" and \\"Downtown Money Waster,\\" which kind of defy what I say above. And \\"Cold Boy Smile,\\" which really deserved a full-band approach. Great musicianship, great recording and a good night to the bad guys.

B00004TX5F|5.0|An outstanding film with a outstanding cast performance, there are characters for whom you will really care for, when you are witnessing them on screen, you simply feel their grief, their joy. An outstanding chemistry between Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso who play the Broschi brothers brilliantly. The film doesn't only throw light on Baroque or simply the life of Carlo Maria Broschi, its much more than just a Biographical piece. The film is so engaging that you almost feel every single breath of the characters right from your couch. 'Farinelli' the film in simple words is a brilliant character study film and simply a delicious feast for the eyes.
B002ZG9788|3.0|Clash of the Titans 2010 is a decent remake, but the story line of the original from 1981 is much superior, darker and more engaging.  Sam Worthington is good but its hard to get use to a Peresus with short hair.  He looks and acts more like a modern commando working special ops, than a mythical hereo.  The scenes with Medussa are not as good as the original either.  The 1981 version has its faults but overall is better than the new one.
0684859106|2.0|I had heard the buzz about the Magnolia Bakery and was very excited to try the recipes in this cookbook. I made a few of the recipes, and they just don't seem to come out quite right. I have been an avid baker for over ten years, and I don't have trouble following recipes. For example, I tried the blackout cake, but it just didn't knock my socks off. It was a very average chocolate cake. The vanilla cupcakes were similarly bland. Even without all of the hype surrounding the Magnolia Bakery, I still would have been disappointed with this book.

I'm a feminist, progressive mother of two and am deeply ashamed of this woman.

1569242739|5.0|I decided to try this cookbook because my younger sister is vegan, and I'm lactose-intolerant. I've bought other vegan cookbooks, and I have two complaints: first, many vegan cookbooks use hard to find ingredients, and second, the items taste \\"vegan\\". This cookbook doesn't have either of those problems. Every single cupcake recipe has been delicious. We especially liked the mock Hostess cupcake recipe. The cupcakes are so good that no one would ever guess that they're vegan. The cookbook is especially great because it allows us to make one dessert for the entire family without having to make a separate vegan dessert for my sister and myself.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Before I began, I want to say that even though this movie is about superheros, you are not letting your 12 year old son watch this move. No matter how much he begs. Other than that I can honestly say 'Kick-Ass' is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it in theaters, then bought it the day it came out on blu-ray. This movie takes the whole superhero genre to the next level. Rather than having some kid put on a costume and suddenly be amazing, it's the opposite. The kid gets beat up, almost dies. It's interesting because this movie explains the burning question: what aren't there any real-life superheros? This movie is very violent. But unlike other violent movies such as 'Saw' it doesn't go to far. The violence is used only when needed at the right moments, and also helps in certain situations to enhance the comedic effect. Also, there's lots of \\"adult language\\" used. Even a few words not usually used in movies, but I wont spoil it for you. The other nice part about this movie I like, is that less well known actors are in it. Actors such as Christopher Mintz-Plasse (yes McLovin from Superbad.) It's great and really show the extent of their talents, and also show that you don't need big names to have a good movie. This is an independent film which explains why they can get away with so much. Not much else to say without ruining the movie. All in all a great movie. It's one of the few I'd say buy not rent. Buy the blu-ray version, even if you don't own a blu-ray player. It's nice because it comes with three discs. A blu-ray disc + special features, a dvd version + special features, and a digital copy. And for those wondering, yes. This is the only good movie with Nicholas Cage.

030745455X|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" - luckily I saw the excellent movie version before I ventured into the 630 page novel. The film is focused, tighter, on target, concise, and gives you all of the essentials of the book. The novel is all over the place, diffuse, too gangling, unfocused, has long sections of unnecessary detail and other plot strands that have nothing to do with the central plot arc. I found the book to be a heavy slog, and had a hard time getting through it. At its heart, though, it has the fascinating and deeply involving story of one of modern literature's most vibrant characters, Lisbeth Salander.<br />Lisbeth has been away from Sweden for a year since we last saw her in \\"Tattoo\\" living a life of luxury abroad. She purchases an apartment in Stockholm, but no one knows about it. Unfortunately she talks her former girlfriend into taking over her old apartment, and the girl becomes a target for Lisbeth's enemies. Lisbeth wants to get her records from her sadistic guardian, Bjurman, but he is cooperating with her arch enemy Zala<br />Lisbeth's boyfriend from the first novel in the series, Mikael Blomkvist, spends most of his time trying to track her down. He's publisher of the counter-culture magazine Millennium. He has hired a free lancer to write an article about sex traffickers and the johns that are involved in the trade. The writer intends to out some of the prominent johns, and one of the johns is from the Swedish secret service. The writer's girlfriend is also working on revealing the sex ring.<br />The two narratives converge at a crucial stage when Lisbeth is accused of three murders, and the police start a massive hunt for her, although they aren't very effective, and she is able to move around with relative ease. Get ready for violence, sex, gore, torture scenes, and suspense as we follow the protagonists. Lisbeth always seems to be immersed in trouble and with men who hate women. There's some computer hacking in this one that keeps her ahead of everyone else. Lisbeth's barbarous father whom she had torched as a child comes back with a vengeance in this sequel.<br />The novel ends in a cliffhanger that will entice readers into seeking out the third book in the series.<br />I liked the first novel more than this one because it was more focused and involved more interaction between the two principals, Lisbeth and Mikael; it was more human and more affecting than this one.<br />Lisbeth is as tough and wily as ever. It's an intricately plotted, labyrinthine, tantalizing mystery.else. Lisbeth's barbarous father whom she had torched as a child comes back with a vengeance in this sequel.

B001VEHZZ2|2.0|I did not enjoy this book. Having said that, I'm not sure I was supposed to enjoy it. I did not like the monolog style of writing, the self absorbed (me first) point of view, the satisfaction he felt when 3000+ died on 9/11 or the silent stand in American he is always talking to.    I picked this up because it is required reading for my daughters college class this summer. The good news is that it is a two day read, even with beach naps thrown in.    My article review is \\"Read to the End\\" because the ending will grab you and give you something to interpret based on your own experiences and prejudices.

B002CAWNEM|3.0|I kind of like this movie.<br /><br />Seriously, this movie is kind of stupid yet completely entertaining.  I was really floored with how much enjoyment (cheap and slightly guilty I will admit) I got out of this movie.  My wife and I happened to catch this while lazing it up on our last vacation, and while I was not initially interested in watching the film at all I must say that it held my attention and then some.<br /><br />Yes, the film is kind of a cheap knock off of `Fatal Attraction' with inferior acting and plot development, but it doesn't matter.<br /><br />The film follows a successful man named Derek who happens to land in the evil and manipulative clutches of Lisa, a hot temp who has a thing for him.  The thing is, Derek is married.  He has a family.  He isn't interested (well, at least not to such a degree that he would jeopardize what he has for her).  Lisa is very interested, so much so that she goes all sorts of bat-poop crazy and starts wrecking Derek's life, one ridiculous move after another.  With Derek's family on the line, things start getting pretty intense...and then, well, you have Sharon, Derek's wife; and she isn't content with `sitting pretty'.<br /><br />Yes, there are many moments in this film that are unintentionally funny (Beyonce alone is unintentionally funny) but it doesn't matter.  Nothing matters here.  The film is fun.  Aside from Beyonce's ridiculous performance, and Ali's obvious overacting (I miss the days when she was a fresh face with lots of untapped potential) there is a surprisingly deep performance delivered by Idris Elba.  Seriously, this is far from what I expected.  He adds layers of authenticity to Derek's situation, and you can feel each emotional connection he has on full display here.  It is a performance that is far above the material, which also makes this film somewhat of a hidden gem.<br /><br />Go figure.<br /><br />So, the movie is not a masterwork of any kind, but when it comes of mindless popcorn thrillers, this one is better than average in the fact that it actually entertains more than it insults our intelligence.  Sure, I gave it a C, but that is a C+ with a very strong recommendation.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|This year's winner for the coveted Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival was a little indie called WINTER'S BONE. It finally made it to Cherrydale Cinemas this week, and I have to say that all of the hype surrounding this film is justified. It is one of the best films of the year.     It concerns a young girl, Ree Dolly, who lives deep within the Ozark Mountains. Day after day, she single-handedly takes care of her younger brother and sister, as well as her ill mother. On many occasions, she has to hunt for food in order to be able to feed her family. Ever so often, the neighbors help by giving the family leftovers from the night before. It is clear that this family is struggling, and that Ree is doing all that she can to provide.     When the sheriff shows up at her doorstep and informs her that her father, a fugitive and a crystal meth dealer, has put her house up for bail bond, she has to race against all odds to find him. Everything is at stake, and so Ree sets out on a dangerous journey in order to save her family. From the time that Ree begins her journey into darkness until the shocking finale, we are driven to the edge of our seats. Not once will you take your eyes off of the screen. There are times when you want to look away, but you can't and you won't.     The strength of this film lies in its authenticity. Most of the time, you feels as if you are watching a documentary feature, peering into the lives of these people. Everything from the performances, to the setting, to the minimalist score provides an eerie realism to the final product.     Newcomer Jennifer Lawrence plays the part of Ree Dolly, and I should tell you that this performance is going to make her a star, possibly earn her a few nominations at awards ceremonies. She shows a confidence that many actresses lack these days. I'd put her in the same category as Ellen Page. It's a magical thing when the audience forgets that they are simply watching a performance. Ree becomes real to us because of Jennifer Lawrence's abilities as an actress.     The same has to be said for the rest of the cast. I'm not sure how many of the actors had any experience prior to making this film, but they all shine in their respective roles. The direction from Debra Granik is simple and to the point. That's not to say that it lacks elegance, it only adds to the neo-realist vibe that the film sends out. The score is minimal, yet haunting. The cinematography is breathtaking. The cast and crew take us places that we have never been before to tell us a story that we will never forget.     The film was adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell.
0783225857|5.0|I received my DVD of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and even though I'd seen the movie a number of times, this DVD was a welcome surprise.  The picture and sound, etc., were all excellent.  There was another section which showed the producer's and the director's section comments.  They went through most of the movie together again sharing many of the experiences and thoughts about the process of making this movie.  Giving special anecdotes about the different actors in the movie-making process and also some of their particular stories with each other.  The search for the actors who played the children and what they were aiming for in these characters, along with many of the other actors/characters.      Overall, the movie was as wonderful as when it first came out, maybe a little better with the technological improvements.  I just was markedly impressed with the personal humanity in the director's section.  It is still a movie that can believeably take me back to a much simpler time.
B002BIULQ2|1.0|I'm probably unqualified to review this product.  I mean, this is like when I, on a whim, decided to watch that `Sex and the City' movie and then review it.  I mean, I don't watch `Hannah Montana', so am I really qualified to give an opinion that is so obviously in the minority (at least amongst her devoted fans).<br /><br />I'll just get this over with.<br /><br />I don't know why I wanted to see this.  Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment or something, but occasionally the whole teenage movie scene gives me a needed break from other cinematic ventures, and so the sing-songy pop sensation that is Hannah Montana intrigued me (slightly).  It looked like senseless fun, and if that fun is in the vein of say Raven Symone (since `That's So Raven' is actually kind of hilarious) then I'm game.  I've never seen an episode of `Hannah Montana', but my younger brother used to swear by it, like it was the greatest thing on earth (weird, I know) and so I wasn't really that apprehensive about the movie.  I figured it would be cheap fun, but fun none-the-less.<br /><br />This movie is kind of terrible.<br /><br />I'm taking into account that I am not a fan nor familiar with the comedic angle to the show while I write this, so I can understand if her fans think I'm harsh (and maybe I am being so) but really, how can anyone think that Miley Cyrus has talent?  First of all, I have heard her sing...and she's not very good at that.  Yes, some of her more heartfelt (if you can call them that) ballads strike a nice chord after the studio cleans them up for radiowaves, but vocally she is not strong.  Hearing her sing live (as I have suffered through on numerous television programs) is hard to stomach, and her more pop related fare is generally campy and forgettable.  Her comedic timing is absurd.  Maybe this is just what is `in' with teens (or tweens...there's a word for you Beany) but this is not comedy; this is stupid.  The opening sequence alone was just outrageously ridiculous.  Why would anyone find that funny?  It's just silly and lame.<br /><br />I remember back at the Oscar ceremony back in 2008, before the film was released, and Miley was talking about it `hopefully' being an Oscar contender because it was \\"so much deeper than you may think\\" and I laughed because, well, she sounded delusional.  I mean, really?  This film may have a nice message about being true to yourself, but it's not `deep' by any means.<br /><br />Don't be mistaken.<br /><br />In the end the film is littered with overdone performances and blandly uninspired music.  It just doesn't do much of anything for me.  I know, her fans are going to crucify me (probably as much if not more so than the basement nerds did when I panned `Avatar') but I just needed to speak my mind on this one.just silly and lame.

B0036R92V2|5.0|Previously released in multiple DVD editions by both Anchor Bay and Blue Underground, the latter company now brings Sergio Corbucci's seminal Spaghetti Western DJANGO (1966) to high definition Blu-Ray disc.<br /><br />A man on foot wearing a tattered Union uniform and dragging a coffin behind him (Franco Nero, ENTER THE NINJA) comes upon a bunch of rowdies whipping a woman. Watching from a distance, the man, Django, does not interfere. But when the rowdies are gunned down by a second group of men with red hoods, and they prepare to burn the girl to death on a makeshift cross, he unleashes the fury of his Colts and soon finds himself caught up in a conflict between an army of white supremacists and a group of Mexican banditos. But what are the mysterious gunslinger's true motives, and what's in that damned coffin?<br /><br />Violent and brutal, DJANGO is a gothic drama of the American west (even though it was mostly shot in Spain), rich with colorful characters, memorable set-pieces and director Corbucci's (THE GREAT SILENCE, THE HELLBENDERS) unique visual style. Anchoring the film is Nero's star-making turn as the titular protagonist; handsome, tough and utterly convincing dealing death to all comers, even when the film pushes the limits of credibility.<br /><br />Not as well known in America as the Sergio Leone-directed EuroWesterns starring Clint Eastwood, DJANGO, was, arguably, even more popular and influential with continental audiences. So much so, in fact, that countless unauthorized/unofficial \\"sequels\\" were released throughout the the rest of the Sixties, and most of Nero's later movies -whether Westerns or not - ended up being marketed across Europe as DJANGO films.<br /><br />Blue Underground's hi-def reissue is gorgeous, with a 1.66:1 widescreen transfer from the original negative at 1080p definition.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Every year, Hollywood shells out products that serve no other purpose than to bore audiences into a state of stupidity. This has been a problem for years, since the birth of the blockbuster. In the late sixties and early seventies, mainstream audiences frequently enjoyed intellectually stimulating films, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and TAXI DRIVER. That was until STAR WARS was unleashed upon the world, and everyone threw their brains out the window and settled for pure spectacle. Not much has changed. Audiences still crave style over substance. If you don't believe me, check out the box office results for AVATAR, and then get back to me. A Hollywood film with a brain is a rare thing these days.     But every now and again, I have to insert my foot into my mouth. INCEPTION is one of the most intelligent, completely involving mainstream films since THE MATRIX took the world by storm in 1999. INCEPTION will blow you away. I've already seen this film twice, and I will see it again.     Where to begin. INCEPTION is one of those extraordinary films that is inherently hard to describe, yet easy to comprehend whilst you are in the theatre experiencing it firsthand. It deals with one of my favorite subjects: dreams. We not only deal with dreams, but dreams within dreams within dreams. With all of the complex layering going on, it could be easy to lose yourself - which is why I'm going to give you the most simple synopsis that I can muster in this review. It will be short, sweet, and to the point.    The film deals with a man named Dom Cobb, an experienced thief who utilizes the best of modern technology to enter the subconscious dreamworlds of others, and steal their most precious secrets and ideas. This process is known as \\"extraction\\". Because of this, Cobb is one of the most sought after fugitives in the business. When his latest assignment goes awry, he is offered a chance to redeem himself by pulling off a seemingly impossible \\"inception\\" - a process bywhich an idea is planted into an individuals mind. In order to do this, Cobb must put together a team of experts and race against the clock in order to successfully execute the mission.     This is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more goes on within the two and a half hour running time. To say anything else would only spoil the film for you, and rob you of the pure rush that comes from watching such cinematic genius.     Christopher Nolan is at the top of his game here. His direction is flawless, and his confidence in his cast and crew is visible on screen. This is his best film since MEMENTO, and it's just as puzzling. Yes, there are special effects in this film, but they do not take precedence over the story or performances. They are merely a part of the world that Christopher Nolan has so expertly crafted. After seeing INCEPTION, I have officially forgiven Nolan for those overrated Batman films.     The performances from the entire cast are amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, and Marion Cotillard shine. Everyone else is just as good. There is even a cameo from Michael Caine, as well. Hans Zimmer's score may as well be counted as another character in the film, as it is that powerful. It's one of those scores that audiences will recognize whenever they hear it play for years to come.     INCEPTION is a gift. Do yourself a favor and see it as soon as possible.

0440203856|5.0|I waited 22 years until after it was published, but I finally finished Danielle Steels last epic novel. She just doesnt write them like this anymore. The Ring, Remembrance, and Crossings are my favorites because they take place during the most dramatic evnts of the 20th Century. Zoya's life starts with the Russian Revloution, with all of the important things in between, WWI, the roaring 20s, the Great Depression, WWII all the way into the 1970s. There are some glamorous moments, yet amid the dramatic events there is loss and tragedy.     This effort pushed Steel into the publishing spotlight and made her a product. This is not literature, yet the plot moves swiftly. Most of her work is plot driven. Zoya has just a dash of character developement. Her life mirrors my grandmothers time. Cameos from the Czar, Picasso, Chanel and FDR bring history to life and the relevance of a century that has passed. This story has a happy ending. I believe Steel wrote this one alone. Its is well researched and heartfelt without being sappy. Due to the lull in the publishing world, I returned to this world. Yes, its a guilty pleasure, like cheating on a diet. Sadly, little has been written by her, since Zoya that appeals to me. I consider this the last of the Big 80s epics.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I watched the original version of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" in theaters and felt it to be a \\"so-so\\" movie.  My guess is the studio told Scott to cut almost every scene that didn't have then rising star Orlando Bloom. The result was mediocre theatrical cut.  The Directors cut is much better.  With the added scenes the film still isn't as amazing as it would aspire to be but is much improved.
0061714372|5.0|I read this book in a single sitdown and it was hard to stop reading. From the early days of Metallica to the trials and tribulations of being cut and starting out on his own, Dave Mustaine weaves a well told tale. Not afraid to point the finger at others when it was deserved and certainly able to point the finger at himself for his mistakes along the way. The journey ends with his conversion to Christianity and explains his reasoning for his change without being preachy and in your face. His point of view is to each his own and if you arrive to the same conclusion, then he respects you either way. I enjoyed this book and wait to see if anything will be denied by parties involved. It felt candid, honest and real and focused more on resolving broken relationships, poor life choices, drug addiction and freedom. I wish Dave the best in whatever he does with the remainder of his life and by the end of the book I think most readers would feel likewise.     If you are a fan of rock autobiographies, as I am, I can't imagine not enjoying this story.
0525951652|5.0|This is a fantastic epic, the first in a planned trilogy by the author of [[ASIN:045123281X The Pillars of the Earth]] (now a miniseries) and [[ASIN:0451228375 World Without End]]. I simply raced through the pages, unable to put this book down even though it was a hefty nearly 1000 pages.     The story moves seamlessly and logically, starting in 1911 and ending in 1925, and has a large cast of characters -- all so beautifully developed that the reader comes to care about each one -- the good and the bad. A helpful CAST OF CHARACTERS is provided at the beginning of the book that may be copied and used as reference, but it is really not needed as the reader is introduced to each and they are so memorable that it's easy to keep them straight. The families are American, English, Scottish, French, German and Austrian, Russian, and Welsh. There are Lords and Ladies, Dukes and Duchesses, Kings, Queens, Earls, Dukes -- even the servants, miners, and other assorted people populate this work of fiction. The author has also inserted real historical figures into the story, and their interaction with Follett's characters is very well done.    Book one of the CENTURY TRILOGY is set in Europe before, during and after World War I. From a mining town in Aberowen, South Wales, to the drawing rooms of the privileged aristocracy in Russia, Britain, Germany, and to the War Room in the White House of Woodrow Wilson -- the narrative captivates as it tells the tale of the people involved in the conflict and their lives during this period of change in the world.     The story is intriguing and complex, but eminently readable. The violence and gore that were present in Follett's previous works is absent here, and the action is fast and the storytelling fantastic. I have a fondness for historical fiction, and this work does not disappoint as the author has obviously thoroughly researched the era and has rendered it beautifully.    I won't provide a detailed synopsis of this book since the product description on this page does that, but will say that it's a drama about life and love during these fateful years and I promise you that this will go down as being one of the best books you've ever read.    I cannot recommend it highly enough and can't wait for the sequel! This book, however, has a very satisfying conclusion and can stand alone as you are not left with unanswered questions at the end! Historical fiction at its best.

0385732554|4.0|A small, thin novel, I read it within three days (I do have a life...really...). The world of \\"The Giver\\" is simple and easy, no choices to be made, no pain to be felt, everything is the same. So much so that there's not even any color to the world so there can be no distinction between anything. Once we learn the awful, terrible truth along with Jonas, it comes as a shock and makes us realize why this isn't such a good thing.<br /><br />Once again, a novel which makes me think, which I love. Individuality, choices, decisions we make, it's true, they could lead to war and violence and crime. But what do we lose in the process? Is relinquishing control to people who supposedly know better really a good idea? It makes me very grateful for the world as it is now, despite its problems; I enjoy feeling happiness and love, and I enjoy making decisions for myself, even if they are the wrong ones.<br /><br />I will admit, one thing I wouldn't mind from that community is someone assigning me a job; I've had trouble doing that for myself and finding something I enjoy. But even then I'd feel sort of like a robot...program me for the correct job and I will make the correct motions, no questions asked. Even if part of that program is something unforgivable.<br /><br />Ms Lowry did a great job in creating a community of people who are all stoic and sheep-like while still making them feel realistic, like this could truly happen in the not-so-distant future. It's a little frightening. Can you imagine apologizing for every tiny little transgression? Goodness, nothing would ever get done! ;)
B000003GBN|5.0|I'm biased. I admit that up front. I love the CSO/Reiner recordings.  But why? Was Reiner really that better a conductor than others? Was the CSO  in the 50's and 60's the best orchestra ever? Maybe not, but here's 4 things  that make these Beethoven performances for the ages.  1. Reiner was a combination of tyrant AND musician. Yes he required ALL the notes played well, and in tune. (Don't produce, and you're history). And yet he let his musicians PLAY and express themselves. Also,his inner sense of tempo,rhythm and balance are unmatched by most conductors.  2. The orchestra under his baton was a unique one. Listen to the first-chair players...hardly matched even today by modern orchestras...ALL the sections were uniformly strong,not just the famous CSO brass.  3. The Hall! The Hall! The Hall! Chicago's orchestra hall in the 50's was found to be a near perfect place for stereo recording. It was ruined during renovations in the late 60's. Shame  4. The RCA engineers did a fantastic job of recording these performances    Add to this Reiner's feel for the classics and you have a perfect storm combining in two unsurpassed performances of the 5th, and 7th.  Check out CSO/Reiner in the other Beethoven symphonies. Enjoy...
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Contrary to the review given by Mr Horton and other wannabee experts ... My wife and I found AVATAR to be just what we were shopping for .... Great Entertainment ... Superb animation .... Fantastic story line and Top Flight acting.  A trip into fantasy for two hours ... cost us less than 20.00 on the big screen .. 3D to boot .  Can't say enough good things about it ... Recommend it very highly...
B003XM70B4|3.0|I have not seen or purchased this new 25th Anniversary version of the Goonies being released on DVD and Blu-Ray. I do however know alot about it from the Digital Bits. First off, I am a Goonie Fanatic. It is my favorite movie of all time and I even took the time to visit Astoria Oregon and went the goonie house and other locales when I was on the west coast a while back. To say I wore out the special edition DVD release is an understatement. So when I heard about this new version I was beyond euphoric. I was crushed though when I read what Warner Bros is prepping for said 25th year version. They are basically repackaging the DVD we all have with a new remaster and adding a board game(beyond lame), some promotional magazines(I will take those) and I think a few trading cards or trinkets If I can remember, that's it. Nothing more. Come on Warner Bros, where are the rumored deleted scenes such as the goonies oath scene, the second store visit, the data intimidator scene, the leech scene, the gorilla scene, and extra dialogue. Also how about seamless branching so we can watch the goonies with the existing deleted scenes back into the movie. And it wouldn't hurt either Warner Bros to throw in a new commentary or documentary. The goonies has one of the most rabid fan bases of any movie in history and I feel this is shameless double dipping. I'll probably cave in the end only for the new Blu ray transfer but I'm confident writing this review which is way before release that they dropped the ball big time on this one. 5 stars for the movie (ok 10 stars if Amazon would let me) 2 stars mostly for the yet unseen transfer and extras.  PS, sorry for the bad spelling and grammar.

B002XMGGJM|5.0|I kept seeing this movie at Blockbuster, but never found myself interested. Finally rented it one day after I had seen all the new movies out, so glad I did. After watching it I immediately got on amazon and ordered it. This movie will have you saying \\"That was crazy awesome\\".
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The product is fine, in good condition.  And I apreciate the sender including a nice note - shows that she cares about what she does and her product.  Thank you.

B000I0QK74|5.0|I was initially wary of this purchase because although I have always loved James Taylor's music, I wasn't too sure how he'd pull off a Christmas album. Well he shut me up, let me tell you and I am so happy that I bought this album. My family asks me to bring this home to add to our usual Christmas song collection now. It didn't take more than one playback to grow on me and now I have to listen to it or Christmas isn't the same. I greatly recommend this album to Christmas lovers young and old.
B0009HLD0K|4.0|Love this movie I remember it from growing up and bought it and it was still a great movie...go cutters
0143118420|1.0|I absolutely hated everything about this book.  I couldn't sympathize or empathize with the author, the writing was adolescent at best, and the story was new-age drivel.  If this woman had really ever once had to struggle to \\"make it\\" or worked with disadvantaged people here in the States, I would have a bit easier time buying her bit of self discovery.  But instead she was selfish, ignorant, childish, and naive.  Who new that discovering the gift of giving of oneself would lead a path to enlightenment???  Just about anyone else who has come down from their high class society to see how the rest of us live.  What baloney!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son loves his monkey Wubbanub.  It is not only cute but functional.  He has done best with this versus a standard pacifier.
B002QVOQ0Q|5.0|Don´t know about you, but when I read about a band who gets seriously hyped I almost always get suspicious. But then again, if you don´t give them a try, you will never know, right?    So when the opportunity presented itself, I bought Anno Domini High Definition by Polish band Riverside. So the first question to answer is, is it any good?    I can honestly say I think it is. Especially music wise this is a very convincing album that speaks loudly of its qualities. This is somewhere between symphonic rock and progressive metal, with some unexpected twists added. Think of brass (really! and it works) and some more modern sounds (sequences). It rocks where it needs to, the guys know what they are doing, know how to write a good tune, can lock into a groove and how to spice it all up with clever arrangements.    The only 2 things I feel leave room for improvement are the lead vocals and the length of the album. I think 44 minutes is rather short and as far as the vocals go, they are in no way bad, but fairly clean. I would love to hear Jorn Lande or Steve Hogarth doing this. I know, 2 very different types, but both are able to add an extra dimension to a song.    That said, these remarks are obviously minor. This is top notch without doubt. If you haven´t checked them out yet, do it, you will not be disappointed!
142314189X|5.0|Great books.  Fun and interesting with a good basis in greeko/roman mythos.  Percy Jackson is a light fun series (not dark and angsty like in the movie).  The books have a foundation in family and friends, which teaches that with good friends anything is possible.  LOVE THESE BOOKS!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Brilliant movie, bang up-to-date yet an old fashioned Saturday matin&eacute;e feel to the excitement. I loved the use of sound across five speakers. This movie does contain voices behind you!<br /><br />Impeccable performances from all those concerned. Special mention to the editor James Herbert for containing all those jump cuts and matching them to the cut-throat dialogue. For long moments, especially early on, we do teeter on the edge of zaniness.<br /><br />This movie is young and fresh and very exciting but does ripple with inventive twists to tickle the intellect. I was especially impressed by the fight scenes with their pre-action commentary explaining every move.<br /><br />The villain is the despotic English control freak. Dreams of Empire using the same language as Herr Hitler but aimed at America. Re-taking America. But Holmes is the Astaire hero. His effortless movements due to foresight and physical prowess. What a performance.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is a highly recommended dvd. Proper widescreen, subtitles and blistering 5:1 soundtrack. Action adventure for the boy in us all.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|My son and I felt dirty and exploited after watching this movie.  Everything about it is wrong:  the premise that the Mayan calendar dictates the end of the world; the snide aside that only China could build the arks, as if America is no longer capable of any significant effort to save itself or the world - a role it's uniquely played for almost 100 years; the silly uniforms the admiral and navy personnel wear on the arks; the wonderfully affirmative and PC cast of the White House and leaders of the arks, particularly the smooth-talking Obama-like scientist-functionary; the rewarded instinct of elitist Ivy-League bureaucrats to preserve themselves instead of the more innocent and deserving whom they serve; the celebration of Africa as the only surviving continent and new home to humanity, with the implicit premise that this is divine retribution for centuries of oppression; the passing reference to how 400,000 people were selected to include a careful distribution of genetic material, as if those created in God's image are so much breeding stock; the triumph we're expected to feel when 5.96 billion out of 6 billion people die so that the Obama administration can live on.    The special effects are admittedly great, but can't save this wallowing hippo of a movie.
030745455X|5.0|If you can keep the characters straight you will love this book! I had a difficult time putting it down. Larsson is such a great storyteller. I wish his life had been longer.
B003U55J9Y|5.0|This was the single best series finale' I have ever seen. Enough questions were answered so none of it felt like a cheat. Although some questions were left such as why the Others wanted Walt and why were children kidnapped, its good not to have ALL the answers. As to the emotional impact, I went from a little sniffle from the odd tear falling to using a roll of paper towels for the ending. Thanks guys. It was a hell of a ride!
B003ITZBVI|4.0|Batman: Under the Red Hood encompasses the Judd Winick (who also wrote the screenplay in what may be his best work to date) story line of the same name as well as the classic 1988 Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo yarn \\"A Death in the Family.\\" Synopsis and plot summaries of the movie are readily available all over, so you hardly need me repeating it.    While not a perfect film by any stretch of the animation, Under the Red Hood is dark, fun and, more than anything else, able to walk the line between giving fanboys what they want while never insulting the intelligence of an average, non-initiated viewer. At no point does the film hold your hand or spend much time on exposition, something the other DCU Animated films seem to have a problem with. Winick's script is tight, clever, and really understands the core of each character. The animation looks tight, for the most part, with the notable exception being any and all of the 3D vehicle models, which look clunky and lifeless. I understand the reasoning behind using these models, but more than anything else (including the voice actors), they take me out of the moment.    And now the big one: voice casting.  I was incredibly skeptical going into this film, in large part due to the fact that Batman and the Joker were no longer voiced by fan favorites Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (who has stated that Arkham Asylum 2 will be his final performance as the character) but two other well known actors: Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio. Greenwood does a fine job as Batman, mostly because he's doing his best Kevin Conroy impression. Obviously there are some differences in the voice, but overall he does a fine job. John DiMaggio, however, takes a lot of risks and decides to completely change up that loveable rascal, the Joker. Knowing Mark Hamill's trademark high pitched, whimsical voice and cackle wouldn't cut it, DiMaggio goes for a stark alternative: a deeper, much more vicious and cruel version of the Joker whose laughter is less grating and irritating (as it should be), but much more sinister.  DiMaggio's history in animated comedy shows as many of Joker's lines are timed perfectly, and there's never a moment where the viewer ever feels comfortable around him, regardless of the restraints he may be in. DiMaggio's take is a welcome breathe of fresh air for the character. If WB was smart, they would keep these two on speed dial in the future. Supernatural star Jensen Ackles voices Jason Todd and doing a fine job out of it, as do most of the cast. Fanboy favorite Neil Patrick Harris feels a bit underused. On camera, his charm and wit are unmistakable, but here, they fall flat. It also hurts that Nightwing is in, maybe, 20 minutes of the movie and really feels like an afterthought.    A solid score mixed with ok extras (though the FANTASTIC Jonah Hex short had me smiling ear to ear at completion) really makes me think that DC's animated film department really stepped up their game for this one. Again, while not perfect, it's a huge step forward for the line, especially with All-Star Superman up next on the plate.  After this, though, I really wouldn't mind more original Batman movies. Recent storylines like Batman RIP come to mind, as do classics like Arkham Asylum and the Killing Joke, but we'll have to see. Check this out if you're a fan or you just want to be entertained for 75 minutes.
0143118420|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love is the story of Elizabeth Gilbert's search for herself and her examination of beliefs following a divorce and a second broken relationship.  She spends four months in Italy in the pursuit of pleasure, learning Italian and eating great food, she spends four months in India in the pursuit of devotion, spending her whole time at an ashram in a small village, and four months in Bali to work on balancing the two.    I was completely drawn into her story by the time she sat down to her first delicious meal in Italy.  Her writing is funny, humble, and captivating.  She doesn't hold back her emotions and tells the reader the bad about herself as well as the good.  While some readers have criticized her problems as being selfish and petty, if they are serious enough to her to have her fearing for her life, then I would say they are serious and action needed to be taken.  Congrats to her for making all these wonderful discoveries about who she is.  Highly recommended, there is a little pearl of wisdom in here for everyone!
B003HLM2QO|3.0|This is just an OK Ozzy album. It's about what you'd expect if you've heard his last couple of albums. People review this so high because they love Ozzy and have a hard time admitting that his time as a songwriter is gone. It's a sad fact, but it seems to be true. But, hey, it's still Ozzy and it's not a bad listen. All I'm saying is that you shouldn't expect this to be another Ozzy classic, because it's not.
B003O86MY8|2.0|First of all I have to say up front that I love David Garrett. I brought my sons and mother to the last concert.  It was a wonderful family evening.  I watched the website and jumped on 4th row seats before I purchased this cd.  It is as relaxing as having sitting in hours of traffic.  I couldn't wait for it to be over. It also seems like this cd was produced over the course of a weekend. Every piece seems rushed and feels like it's in hyper drive. Kashmir is not a showcase for violin. It is bothersome.  There isn't a soothing moment on this cd which is a departure from his previous cd's.  My first clue should have been the cover photo.  That isn't the David Garrett I've seen nor is the music the experience that I've come to expect.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I do portrait photography for dollars, and often travel with an extra computer just to download photos onto and then upload them to the internet. Apple's press releases and promo materials said the adapters can couple with the iPad via cameras---> USB cable or directly with smart cards via the Smart card reader.    Well, I use Olympus gear which takes an XD card not SD, and supposedly doesn't support 'other devices'. Camera coupling was seamless and quick.    So I took a chance and pre-ordered a $5 USB 2.0 XD card reader which you insert the XD card into and then plug the adapter's USB end into the iPad adapter, and when I plugged it into the Apple USB adapter it imported my pictures into the iPad at record speed (faster than when I'm hooked directly to a camera), apparently without knowing (or caring) that I was doing so in unauthorized fashion.    Very glad to have the adapters in our kit so we will have the ability to download other people's SD cards with family pics etc at events we attend. It's tough getting people to get back to us with pictures, and this allows us to grab photos from friends on the fly - during or immediately after events.    They are well built, and reasonable (I picked them up from an Amazon vendor for $2 more than Apple's retail)...
B000SMWUPS|5.0|The Buggy Buddy parent console is a must have for your stroller. It's perfect for trips to the zoo, amusement park, mall, wherever.  The drink holders held my 20 oz. bottles of water wonderfully. And the middle part is great for your camera, cell phone, sunglasses, etc. The velcro straps are long enough to accommodate different stroller widths. I use this on my BabyJogger City Series single (2007) and it works perfectly, as the handles adjust to an angle that will hold the parent console level. I also have a Maclaren Volo and it works well with that one, too. However, if you load the console with too much stuff, the stroller (any umbrella stroller) will tip backwards. The only improvement I would make is that they add a swivel mechanism so that the parent console automatically levels itself, no matter the angle of your stroller handlebars. Small improvement aside, I would totally recommend this product!
B00005QAPK|4.0|Poe's macabre tales [[ASIN:B0026RIHI2 The Collected Works of Edgar Allan Poe]] are re-envisioned by three auteurs: Vadim, Malle, and Fellini.<br /><br />Vadim's 'Metzemgerstein' is reinterpreted in the form of a debauched, depraved, decadent countess -- Jane Fonda. Her nature is aptly described as a 'petty Caligula.' Orgies, bisexuality, and hedonism abound. Her costumes were late 60's outrageousness. Falling in love with her cousin, played by her brother, Peter, just added to the creepiness factor. Eventually, she and her spirited black stallion are literally consumed by flames.<br /><br />Malle's vision of 'William Wilson' was my personal favorite. Alain Delon is perfectly cast as a sadist, haunted by his conscience, which is manifested as his doppelganger. Malle's jumpy camera perfectly translates the terror and anxiety experienced by Delon after murdering his doppelganger. By eliminating his superego, he has essentially murdered himself.<br /><br />Fellini's loose adaptation of Poe's story is replete with surrealistic trademarks. This heightens the absurdity of the story. Terrence Stamp is well cast as an amoralist, tormented actor. His joyride to hell is the most shocking scene in the trilogy.<br /><br />The combination of the tales is quite moralistic: the devil will always get his due.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Already a five-star movie in my book, this remastered, second edition of the blu-ray version of Gladiator is spectacular!  The scenes in the Colosseum, especially during the re-enactment of the battle of Carthage, are so vivid they are almost three-dimensional.  I cannot imagine this looking any better.  I was tipped off to the availability of this new BD version prior to the \\"yellow UPC code\\" that apparently will denote the new version.  The packaging on this one has no security strip across the top and lacks the words \\"2-disc set\\" on the back bottom right of the case (not the slipcover).  My local store had both the old and new versions so I could compare the packaging.  By all means, get this one!
0312330537|4.0|I found Shantaram at Target just days after returning from India. You may have well already imagined that I had fallen in love with the countries. I know what a dichotomy, France and India as two of my favorite cities. Surprisingly there were plenty of French on vacation in India. I am a restless person and sitting on a plane for about 24 hours as I made my way to Asia did not have a lot of appeal to me. This was back in 05 I believe when Sudoka was slowly overtaking the nation. I had brought my book of Sudoka with me and I remember sitting on a plane on one of the domestic flights in India next to a French man. He was rather forward and literally was trying to learn how to play Sudoka over my shoulder. So obviously I taught him how to play Sudoka and ripped a few pages out of my book so he would have his games.<br /><br />I honestly cannot remember what drew me in to the book, I just knew I had to read it. Ironically enough one of my friends from the trip was at a party that weekend and called me to tell me about a book someone had mentioned to him given he had just returned from India. Shocking it was Shantaram.<br /><br />Shantaram is not a memoir, yet is a memoir. While author Roberts does not write his story, the book is based on his story. It is only apropos that author Roberts, would travel to India, as his life is as colorful and chaotic as the streets of New Delhi. As a former Australian journalist, Roberts succumbed to a nasty heroin habit. In the throes of desperation and frustration over losing custody of his daughter he robs banks, only to receive a 19 year prison sentence. Escaping from an Australian prison he finds himself in Mumbai, India.<br /><br />His time here is full of both adventure and misfortune. Roberts is quick to befriend the Indian people living amongst them in the slums. His training as a paramedic elevates his status to that as a hero as he helps the slum dwellers with their ailments. Backed by the local mafia, Roberts is given access to whatever medication he needs to assist the locals. Without spoiling the story for you, his other occupations include, drug dealing and Bollywood.<br /><br />For me a good book is one that appeals to my senses. Shantaram does that are more for me. Given I read it on the eve of returning from India, I appreciated his colorful descriptions of the streets and people. I am not going to pretend that I spent and times in the slums of India, although I saw plenty of people in need. Roberts had me walking aside him down the streets of Mumbai. I could smell the scent of curry wafting through the air and heard the cacophony of the city. This book was India.<br /><br />I was struck by the relationships Roberts developed with the locals. He was kind to all and helped where he could. To tempt you to read the book I will tell you that as a fugitive and one of Australia's most wanted men he did get caught.he needs to assist the locals.

1423113381|5.0|Harry Potter created a wave of copycat books that tried to capture the teen audience.  Every publushier was looking for that one golden book that would capture the Potter magic.   The true is no one can caputure that first time we read Harry Potter and were transported to a new world of magic.  Rick Riodan came close with his Percy Jackson series. The first book started out as a Potter clone but the series grew into an idenity of its own.  It is a shame the movie ruined the series.    Sherrilyn Kenyon has an interesting start with her INFINITY the Chronicles fo Nick.  It shows promise.  However I must say that Mr. Riordan maybe has a hit on his hands with this book.    The Red Pyramid sounds and reads more mature than the Jackson series.  Riodan has picked a world far different from Potter with his use of Egyptian gods.   The brother and sister don't sound juvenile in their actions or speech, and the use of the split narratives is very efrfective.  The question is will the readers warm up to the Eyptian gods.  They aren't as well known as the Greek ones and the names are hard to pronounce.  The action here is much better than in the Jackson series and far different than that found in the Potter stories.  These gods are in fact a very blood thirsty crew.    I am a way older than the average reader of these types of novels, but I was still engaged with the plot.  As a matter of fact I was not aware of this being a teen novel.  Mr. Riordan has gotten better as a writer when compared to the Jackson stories.    So the future looks bright for the teen readers with the Chronicles of Nick and more so with House of Kane series.  let the action begin.  Now I sense a pattern with Mr. Riodan, first Greek god, nest Egypiant gods, can Norse gods be far behind?
B00127RAJY|5.0|A great at-home workout, gets through it really fast. I'm in decent shape so I combine two at a time usually (do level 2 and level 3 together), which is great and a tough workout. But even the 20 minute ones are good for a quick daily workout. I like Jillian's down-to-earth, no-nonsense style.
030726999X|5.0|The three books by Stieg Larrson - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest  - are a great read.  I could not put them down.  They \\"grab\\" early in the first book and keep you hooked until the end of the third. If you like a good thriller, well written and with good character development, these are the books for you.

HE IS NOT ONLY TECHNICALLY AN OUTSTANDING GUITARIST...HE'S AN ENTERTAINER TOO.  FASCINATING FOR THE LISTENER AND THE CRITICAL 'MUSICIANS' AUDIENCE.  ANYONE CAN ENJOY THIS DVD.//JM
B00004R99F|4.0|A Goofy Movie is my favorite Disney animated movie of all time. Hands down. It's almost never mentioned by uppity film critics, a lot of Disney fans usually forget it, and it isn't exactly a 'masterpiece' like Snow White with stunning animation, but it definitely holds its own. I watched it back when it came out, and I loved it. Remembering this, I saw it sitting on a shelf at the store and decided to give it another shot to see if it stood the test of time and my being 25 now. It did. If anything, it only got better. Before The Incredibles, there was another Disney film that brought families close together. And that, was A Goofy Movie, believe it or not. Go ahead and laugh, because I wouldn't believe it if someone told me that too. Goofy, bringing families closer together? Insane! But it's not. Goofy is a great character for this kind of movie about a teenager growing distant from his dad. While it's a good one for families, it's even better if you're a single dad with a son. While I'm a few months late in saying this, it's also a very good Father's Day movie if you two can sit back and enjoy \\"just\\" a cartoon.    We start out with Max, Goofy's son. He's dreaming about a girl he has a crush on, Roxanne. It's ruined before they kiss, when he starts to turn into his dad. Huge teeth, feet, hands, ears, everything. He wakes up, and panics once more- he's overslept and he's almost late for a little surprise at school. His dad busts in and embarrasses him already, showing up with a towel wrapped around his body and one on his head too while Max is getting dressed. Not a good start for the last day of school. Max makes it and gets together with PJ and Bobby (a new character voiced by Pauly Shore. He acts just like him too). They throw together a huge stage performance where Max imitates Powerline, a pop star in the Goof world, and everyone in the school goes nuts. It comes to a halt when the principal interrupts, and the three friends get into big trouble. Unfortunately, he calls each of their parents at a bad time- Pete (PJ's dad) is giving Goofy a speech about how Max could join a gang or get into even worse trouble if Goofy doesn't start being a little harder on him. Goofy takes the call from the principal as a little wake up call, and makes plans to go on a trip to a fishing spot he and his dad went on ages ago. Well, Max had impressed Roxanne with that onstage risk, and they were going to go to an after-grad party together. The trip gets in the way, and he lies to her, saying he's going to see Powerline live since he knows him. Goofy and Max hit the road to what Goofy thinks is a fun fishing trip and time to bond with his son, but it's anything but. The two argue, stop talking to eachother for a period of time, get into huge danger in the woods and in a river, and more. I'm sure every parent with a teenager can relate to most of what goes on here.    Now, even just barely out of my teenage years, this movie really hits me. How Max treats his dad from time to time made me resent him, but also made me realize that we've all done something like that. Leaving in the middle of what's supposed to be a fun place because you think it's dumb...you can see the pain on Goofy's face when Max does this. And what makes it hurt the viewer is that it's Goofy- a character who's always upbeat and happy. Watching him get sad actually made me tear up. What's worse is when he and Max run into a mishap involving a waterfall. Eventhough I know how it's going to end, I wanted Goofy to be alright. See? This is just an animated character. But you get attached to him after all he goes through. But now I'm making the movie sound depressing. Aside from a few moments like the ones I've mentioned, the movie's funny overall, and kids age 11+ will be sure to get a few laughs out of it. Bigfoot discovering disco music has to be one of these things.    The visual quality didn't get the best treatment here, but I'm hoping a Platinum Edition is in the works somewhere down the line. There's notable grain and smudges one the print, and it looks like a slightly cleaned up vhs version. But the movie was made in the mid-late 90's, so it still looks pretty good animation-wise. No jagged lines here. And the audio's nice and loud. The Powerline songs at the beginning and end are booming all over the place. Some sound effects are a tad quiet, like Goofy and Max stay at the underwater-themed hotel, but it's nothing you'll mind unless you're listening for things like this.    Here's the reason it gets four stars instead of five. While I was surprised when I went to the special features menu, and discovered some that were actually good, there weren't enough. I remember seeing some concept designs for Big Foot and a few other characters way back when, and it would've been nice to have had them here in some sort of gallery. Also, it would've been nice if Disney had given it as equally great extras as some other Gold Classic Classic discs. But what's here's still good. The first one I have to mention is an entire episode of the classic Disney Afternoon cartoon: Goof Troop. It's the \\"Calling All Goofs\\" episode in which a few of Goofy's relatives are having a reunion. Because Pete screws up Goofy's car, he can't go. So instead, Peg (Pete's sultry wife) has the reunion at their house. Of course, we all know how Pete is around Goofy. How will he handle more than one at the same time? It's pure chaos. Unfortunately, the transfer to dvd wasn't kind to the episode, and there are a lot of visual problems here and there (some images jump around instead of smoothly moving. Keep focused on a character when they're doing something, and you'll notice it). It's a funny episode still, and I was surprised to be laughing at it well over ten years after it first aired. It was nice seeing the whole crew, sans Chainsaw. Next, is the biggest extra of the batch- A Goofy Success Story, running over 40 minutes. It covers how Goofy became a household name. It goeswell into his past, and is a must-see for classic Disney fans and animation fans in general. After this is the embarrassing A Goofy Movie dvd Storybook. If you remember those books on tape...with books included of Disney movies from the 90's, that's what this is...only you watch it. There's the option of having it read to you, in which the narrator sounds like he's talking to kids with ADD. This is actually worth a laugh, if only for what pictures they chose for each page. The first 3 had me holding my sides (go ahead an' say I'm immature. I don't care). What's almost as bad is the Disney Mambo No. 5 by Lou Bega. It's Mambo No. 5...but with some changes for a family audience and a Disney theme. What's somewhat sick is that he goes over pairings for characters. Like Mickey = Minnie, Donald = Daisy. But then he gets to Pluto, who in turn gets Huey, Louie and Dewy. Horrid. There's also a lame trivia game and the usual trailer to round things out.    That's all there is to it. Get A Goofy Movie. Don't even rent it, just buy it. We're never going to get another one like this.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|This is by far one of the BEST CD's I've heard in years! The music is original & fresh!  This band offers a wide range of beats & rhythms and there is not one song on this CD that isn't awesome!!!  I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!  I'm thrilled with this purchase & I can't wait to hear more of their music!
B002ZG97RY|4.0|Found the story line very good, based upon what most of the public did not know was happening in Iraq.    Matt Damon is good, similar to seeing him in the role of Jason Bourne, but more realistic.    I am not a big fan of action movies, infact the spouse is the one who selected the movie, but I would not object to seeing it again.
145283668X|4.0|What originally drew me to this book was the beautiful intriguing cover, and I soon discovered a very engrossing story within the artistic picture on the front. This book tries to create a link between the good and the evil that is there within all of us and it succeeds in doing so within a few hundred odd pages. It is easily read at leisure with a couple of hours in hand. I would highly recommend picking up and reading this classic!
B0030IIZ56|5.0|Great buy!!!!! Toy story 2 looks awesome on Blu-ray!!! What movie doesn't look awesome on blu ray though??? Haha blu ray is the best!!!!!
B0000CGV00|5.0|I'm neither a musical scholar nor classical expert, nevertheless I feel compelled to offer my opinion about this recording. In short, for me it is stunning in its drama, boldness, and sheer beauty. It is a CD that's a permanent fixture in my car's changer, one that I'm always excited to hear when its turn comes around once more. It connects to the soul like few others, at least for me. At times it goes places where I say to myself, \\"Wow, you can't be serious\\". At times it seems utterly crazy, and then transitions to the utterly sublime. Masters at play, all.     Thank you Corigliano, Beethoven, Part, and especially Grimaud, orchestra, and choir for the amazing performance.
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the show, I love everything that exuded from the 90's. However, this is legit never ending teenage angst. Claire Danes always is crying. But then again, thats the whole point of the show. I loved it!
B0000024YL|5.0|Seeing as this album was originally released in 1972, Amazon should provide an accurate description so that buyers are aware that four of the hits are live versions and not the original album versions. The live tracks are excellent: Other reviewers have mentioned the wonderful version of For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her; Homeward Bound and Kathy's Song are also excellent - the live Feelin' Groovy is a bit goofy to me. The rest of the tracks are the original recordings, but evidently an artistic decision was made to fade the clapping from the live tracks into the introductions of some of the studio recordings. I like the attempt to do something interesting with a greatest hits album, but Amazon should accurately describe the recording so buyers are aware of what they're buying.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Love the movie. Shipping took a while, but I am on the other side of the globe, so that was expected. No surprises. Good Product, good seller.
B003X73QA8|5.0|This album was well worth the wait. It is simply great. It only comes as a whole after several listens and then it becomes quite hard to peel away from it. Without leaving their unique and very distinct style, Butler and his awesome gang explore new alleys and flood us with new sounds and harmonies that sink deep into our subconscious. The Lyrics are dark but that is to be expected considering the first two albums. Every single song is worth exploring. Some will clinch onto you right away some will take time. Arcade Fire are true originals and more than a few newcomers have tried to imitate their sound, but AF are here to stay and we should all feel very blessed about that.
0793542049|5.0|I have loved this book since it first came out. I am an elementary teacher so how things are presented for learning is always of interest to me. Like my title says, Build is the key word. Ed starts off simple enough. You can play along with the CD if you can read the notes on the ledger (pencil them in by name ahead of playing if you haven't learned them yet). Nothing too earth-shattering at first, but you progress with each bit of information. When my guitar teacher was describing a gig he played upright on he said he was merely doing root-5th throughout the night. I knew immediately what he was talking about because that appears fairly early on in this book. No tab, but that is really no big deal. A good place for beginners to start if they not only want to learn how to play bass, but the process of building interesting bass lines. There is a followup book  for those you have finished this one.
1932100660|1.0|I had great interest in this book after finding it mentioned in a couple of books on alternative medicine, and the sample pages in the \\"Look inside\\" feature convinced me to buy the book. That diet could revert cancer was of utmost interest in my search to handle my wife's own pancreatic cancer, which appeared 15 months ago and has been really well handled with alternative cares alone. But then, the first statement that a vegetarian based, low fat diet had such power was all I could find in this book, repeated again and again as if it was a sales pitch. Plus lots of mentions about how great the author is in the world of science and research. What about the China Study? No facts, no numbers, barely a few charts and lots of commented conclusions (without the facts or numbers) always stating the best option was a vegetarian, low fat diet. On top of that you'll read statements backed by no more than the author's supposed authority on the subject. One of them that vitamins and supplements are not good and that food alone should supply them: the experience with my wife's pancreatic cancer has been quite different, and I am not alone. I sure did not pay to read a \\"famous researcher\\" deep beliefs.<br /><br />I have been studying several books related to cancer those last 15 months, and found huge differences among them in the quality of the information. Technically and about proper food advices, Anticancer by Servan-Schreiber is by far much more interesting and you get lots of facts about scientific experiments that do enlighten about what cancer is about. Then, for real world step-by-step advices on the correct supplements and what to do day after day, I strongly recommend The Cancer Recovery Plan, by Barry Boyd and Marian Betancourt.<br /><br />The China Study is a great idea not fulfilled. Do not expect to find scientific study results, think rather about a book written by a used cars salesman turned scientist.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought this movie from amazon.com because of the great reviews. I love period piece movies and this one is now on my list of faves. The story line and the love story walk hand-in-hand through this great movie. You are taken into the turmoils of early industrial pitfalls, but the development of the characters and their individual stories is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It is a keeper and one to watch over and over.
1400052173|5.0|As another said -- Five stars--it was hard to put down this compelling, admirable and eminently readable book.   Every med school student should have to read this book.   Can't say enough good things about Skloot -- can't believe it's her 1st book. Hope she writes more, that don't take her so long to research.
B002UZCJUC|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DVD'S OF MICHAEL JACKSON THAT I HAVE SEEN. I LOVE THE CARTOON PART OF IT AND THE PICTURE WAS EXCELLENT.  \\"SMOOTH CRIMINAL\\" WAS OUT OF SITE. I HAVE NEVER HEARD MICHAEL SING \\"COME TOGETHER\\" AND I LOVED IT! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE THAT IS A MICHAEL JACKSON FAN.
B003AMAOW4|5.0|This performance is a must.  Jonas Kaufmann is excellent.  The rest of the cast is good.  The production is clever and I have to admit interesting to watch \\"where its going.\\"  Buy it!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|What more can I say? The cable came early, was the cheapest price I could find, and the quality is great.  I highly recommend them.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I took a chance and rented this movie on iTunes and watched it on my iPad.    I loved this movie!  The Kick-Ass character was OK.  But Hit Girl stole the show!  She was amazing, talented, funny and full of surprises!    As soon as I finished watching the rented copy of Kick-Ass, I immediately went out and bought the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy combo pack.  That's how much I enjoyed this movie.    It would be great if they made a sequel with Hit Girl as the main character.    I won't give any spoilers here, but there is a gadget in the movie that James Bond would love to have.    Do yourself a favor and add this treasure of a movie to your collection.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|This book has surpassed my expectations of what a Guild Wars book can be. The authors did a spectacular job at shaping the world of Tyria into book form.    5/5
B000W93CHC|2.0|I know I am behind the wagon on this one, but I just read Pillars recently (having seen a television show)so I read World without End immediately following...  Yeah.  I could have done without it.  One-third of the way into the book and I had been treated to five sex scenes and two rape scenes, and they just kept coming.  I didn't fall in love with any of the characters, I didn't get that 1300's feeling and even the architecture/building aspect was all scattered.  I supposed if you are looking for bad sex scenes draped in a quasi historic cloak, this book is for you.  Otherwise, skip it.  There is far, far better historic fiction available.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|An enchanting movie with lots of very cute animation.  It's a bit dated by today's standards but it still holds up quite well.  The colors are strong and the music good.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Im a big reader and i was suggested this book in 5th grade by my library teacher. I was fasinated by it and it soon became my favorite book. there is some parts that confuse me like how there can be no color but otherwise i love the book. I recommend it to any big readers or kids 11 and up.
0684847817|2.0|I was looking for informative and folkloric style but this description fit only a small few first pages of the book. A big part of the book is dedicated for the \\"open your heart and see the magical world around you\\" kind of faeries. Example would be the fairy of pure joy or the slippery fairy that make it \\"slippery\\". The bad fairy section of the book is heavily centered around this theme. Rather than dedicated to trolls, ogres, and goblins, it is full of personifications of negative things possibly invented by the author himself and I don't like that.    Overall, it's a bad book if you are like me, seeking for information and nothing else and it would be a good book if you are the kind of person who is romantic or like to tune with nature and see things within.
B003XDUCIG|4.0|I downloaded the free trial (which is generous, covering the contents table, the index, the first 3 chapters, and part of the 4th chapter, out of a 7 chapter book) and decided not to buy for the reasons I describe below.  This review is based on that trial version.  It is possible that the problems I had would not appear in the full version.    The Kindle edition is said to be optimized for the larger screen of the Kindle DX. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be decently formatted for Kindle at all. The problems I found were present in both on my Kindle DX and in Kindle for Mac.    There appear to be many illustrations, but what I got in the Kindle edition was captions which either had no picture or had a picture unrelated to the caption and the surrounding text. I could match up a few of the pictures (which are mostly very small) with distant parts of the text, but many were missing altogether. I did not find a single picture that was near the right place and had a matching caption.  This seems to be a beta release of the book, being sold at a premium price by Kindle standards.    There are also problems with displaying tables: sometimes we get columns that each contain a fraction of a word, and sometimes the table can't be shown in full even with panning. It is possible that these result from problems with Amazon's software. Likewise, sidebars and footnotes are inherently hard to handle on any device that reformats the book on the fly to fit the screen, font size and other settings, so the relatively minor issues they cause are forgivable.    The book's content is mostly good, though it is unnecessarily padded with interviews, and contains oddly interspersed recipes (probably in sidebars in the hard copy book). There is the basic advice that we'd get from any cook book, but the aim is to teach us underlying principles, such as the important bits of the chemistry of cooking, so we don't have to rely on following a recipe slavishly then wondering what went wrong ifit did not work out.       If you don't get or enjoy geeky jokes and references to software engineering, or if you'd rather be told what to do in detail instead of how things work in general, look elsewhere.  If you are fascinated to learn which amino acids cause the umami taste, or you'd like to know how to calibrate your oven thermostat, or you get a kick out of a dangerous-looking demonstration of how to make ice cream using liquid nitrogen, then this book is a good place to go.  If you care about the layout issues, I suggest checking whether they've been fixed before buying the Kindle edition.    I'll revise this review if the layout problems are fixed for the Kindle. In the meantime, 4.5 for content (for its target audience) and 2 for Kindle usability, averaging to 3 stars.      UPDATE April 3, 2011.  ==============    I bought the full Kindle version right away, as I mentioned in replies to some comments. My apologies for not updating sooner: new job, state, city and house intervened.      The formatting problems were less than I had feared but were still present with the full purchased version. Fortunately, O'Reilly (the publishers) are not like most others and pretty quickly produced an improved version which has few, if any, formatting issues. If only all publishers were as conscientious.    Getting the most out of an e-copy of this book really needs a screen big enough to handle the layout of the original, with its tables, photographs, sketches and sidebars. I have used the Kindle version on my Kindle DX and on my iPod Touch. The Kindle does not always handle the pictures and so on well; the iPod is too small to do the book justice. This is one case where, for me, reading on the Kindle is not as satisfying as usual.  The appearance on my laptop screen is much better, but that's my least-favorite way to read a book.  Perhaps someone who has read it on an iPad can comment on whether that is better.    But I like the book a lot more than it might appear fromall these criticisms. If I had waited for the paper copy I'd have written a 4 or 5 star review at the start.  I'm glad to have the book in some form, and with the improved layout the author's presentation comes across better.  I'd now give 4.5 stars for the content (I like the emphasis on underlying principles but still think there's a bit of padding) and 3.5 for the pleasure and practicality of using the Kindle version.  I've revised my score to 4 stars.
B002UZCJP2|5.0|For better or worse I watched the movie before I read the reviews and what do you know, I really enjoyed it! I had a great time and found myself completely immersed in the story and the action.<br /><br />I'll agree there were some clich&eacute;s but not enough to get in the way of my enjoyment of the movie. I am a serious sci-fi fan and this movie did not disappoint me.<br /><br />If you enjoy sci-fi and appreciate Bruce Willis, then you owe yourself the opportunity to watch the movie and form your own opinion.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews I'm almost embarrassed to actually admit I really liked the movie, but that is the fact of the matter, I really did!<br /><br />I guess this is yet another example of beauty being in the eye of the beholder.
0307987698|5.0|This book was my son's favorite as a child, now he is 33 years old and expecting his first son, thought he should have this book to enjoy as much as his dad did as a child.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Have you ever wanted to be a superhero. [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass]] is about four very different people who take very different paths to become superheroes. With a few exceptions, they do provide some innovative fighting scenes and hilarious moments.<br /><br />First, the great. One of the superheroes, Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), is a adorable 10-year old girl who has a passion for guns and slaughtering bad guys the way other young girls get excited for jewelry or dolls. Chloe is a great actress and gives her character a unique spunk and energy. In several scenes, she has the best fighting scenes and is absolutely merciless. She easily steals the show.<br /><br />The fighting scenes are also pretty cool. Make no mistake - this is a violent movie. But unlike a lot of other fighting movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously. [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass]] is willing to be original in terms of who gets killed and how. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that somebody knows how to use a knife very well. At times, you won't know whether to be disgusted by the violence or laughing at the absurdity.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass]] also sets up the contrasts between the mundane and superhero worlds really well. The high school world of teen romance and comic books looks petty in comparison with the blood and gore of the fight scenes. Also, the corny superhero names and goofy costumes contrasted with the deadly seriousness of the characters - what a riot. And, of course Chloe Moretz as a cute little girl who swears like a truck driver and kills like a commando is the ultimate mind-boggling contrast in this movie.<br /><br />I did feel the movie went a bit far in some scenes. Some scenes were just filled with gratuitously bloodshed and outright murder. I still don't get why Hollywood has abandoned the art of panning away right before the victim gets killed (interestingly enough, the only time [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass]] does spare you the sight of bloodis when a female gets killed). I think the movie would actually have benefitted from a bit less explicit gore and more innuendo.<br /><br />I also thought the rest of the casting was alright, but not stellar. I've never been a fan of Nicholas Cage, and this movie convinced me that his acting just isn't up to it. The contrast between him and Chloe Moretz - his daughter in the movie - is striking. Aaron Johnson is decent as the dorky Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, but gets overshadowed halfway through the film - his character reaches his peak too quickly. Mark Strong as the druglord villain just doesn't convince. We're supposed to fear and hate his character, but really he just comes across as a good excuse to kick some ass.<br /><br />Overall, I'd warn sensitive types away from this movie. This is a comedy only in the darkest sense. However, if you like a few laughs, a bit of fighting, and a lot of both mixed together, [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass]] works wonders. It's original, fresh, and funny. But for some of the casting and excess in gore, I feel it could even have become an action-hero classic.
B000JIHP88|3.0|I just got this \\"musical\\" mobile for my son, it was a gift...(cant complain about that)because it complemented my rainforest theme....but its pretty low on volume, it s not the batteries cause they re brand new..i guess the volume only goes that high..the room has to be completely quiet to barely be able to hear the tunes....i thought it would do more like blink a light but no, all it does is flap the leaves really slow as it sloooooooooowly circles around the little critters...even the \\"light\\" is barely visible..anyway..i think it could have been better. Overall i give it a 3 star cause its ok, not worth the 35 dollars, 15-20 dollars might have been more appropiate.
B000V86OKG|5.0|why do i find this somewhat disturbing content so irresistable--i don't know but it's extremely entertaining and the cast of characters is really interesting.  just as good as if not better than season 1.
B0019IB26I|3.0|This is my first CD of his.  The first half is definitely more acoustical than I would like.  The second half which features his whole band is much better.  If you are a fan of  his songs, I would recommend an all vocal CD.  If you are also a fan of his incredible Guitar skill, you'll enjoy this CD.  I am more visual and need to see the performer when the focus is just the music.  I will say that the price for this CD was incredible and a real bargain.
B000GGSM94|5.0|This album is one of the quintessential 80's album.  Not that it is 80s music but it was released in the decade.  Head on the Door preceded it and Disintegration followed and those 3 albums are the height of The Cure.  This album broke thru in america big-time and sent them to the stratosphere.  Filled with songs both dreamy and violent, it manages to throw in pop music as well.  Having a little of all 'the Cure Sounds' this album probably represents all the moods that Mr Smith records in better than any 1 Cure release.
0143118420|5.0|Fantastic book, I could relate to this book on every level except I don't have the resources to up and leave and travel abroad as she did.  :-)  However, if the opportunity presented itself I would go, no questions asked.  I highly recommed this book to any woman between the ages of 30 and 35. There are VERY few books I read and don't want to end, this is one of those books.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B0030U1TLQ Disintegration (Deluxe Edition) (3CD)]]    From the dark ambience of Fascination street to the poppy Lovesong, you have the essence of the Cure in Disintegration. My favorite album, period.    It's not surprising that Pictures of You is in a commercial. They write memorable hooks that stay with you, and the mood is always palpable in a distinct, and deep way.    The different versions are great because you get different takes on each song. For a collector, this is a must have. For a Cure fan, it's \\"Just Like Heaven\\".    Some of the other reviews harp on audiophile pickiness, and while there may be flaws in that respect, it's still a great deal, all things considered. A must have!
0451450523|5.0|This book has become a classic and is a must for the believers at heart. If you were not a believer, the book will make you wonder, and it does cause you to yearn for that first site of a Unicorn. Would we be able to recognise one or would we be more like the unbelievers and only see what we expect. This is a fabulous book for both young and old and I have not been without a copy since I first read it when it came out. This book is a fabulous read, and leaves you Yearning.......
B000MGATTE|4.0|I have been a King reader for a long while.  I am a serious fan of the Dark Tower series and look forward to his next walk into an epic series.  In the mean time I satiate myself with his single works.  To my joy, I found Lisey's Story to be a wonderful microcosm of what, was to me, so powerful in the Dark Tower Series - a perfect combination of horror, fantasy, and love.  Not since the relationship of Rolland and Susan Delgado from the Wizard and Glass has King created such a powerful story of mature love, enveloped in a fascinating web of engrossing fantasy and gut wrenching horror.  Playing, as he so often does, with horror as seen through the eyes of the young and vulnerable, King weaves a tail that wont let you put the book down for more than evening, and will keep you dreading the final page.  Which, by the way, was not rushed; rather extra time and care was taken to adequately reflect and properly finish the tale.  Well-done Mr. King.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|The slow-boil thriller is a genre that I immediately respond to and Roman Polanski is certainly the master. With \\"The Ghost Writer\\" he crafts, what I believe, to be his best film next to \\"Chinatown\\". With crackling suspense, spot on acting, and a plot that is always compelling, relevant, and well told, you get one of 2010's finest films. The picture is so well made (expert cinematography, a memorable score, snappy editing) that it's almost unbelievable. Roman Polanski is back and in top form.

B003L20IHE|3.0|Film: Charlie St. Cloud<br />Director: Burr Steers<br />Writers: Craig Pearce, Lewis Colick<br />Cast: Zac Efron, Charlie Tahan, Amanda Crew, Kim Basinger, Donal Logue, Ray Liotta, Dave Franco<br />Year: 2010<br /><br />Charlie St. Cloud is a film that wants to be everything. It wants to be a grief drama. It wants to be a romance. It wants to be film about the bond of brotherhood. It wants to be a film about sailing. It wants to be a supernatural drama. It wants to be a comedy. It wants to be a melodrama. Is Charlie St. Cloud anything of those things: the answer is maybe. Sure all of those elements are present in the picture, but none of them are fully developed to truly connect. Based on the novel The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud by Ben Sherwood, Charlie St. Cloud misses the sweet, tender nature of the Sherwood's writing and the awe that lays in the center of his novel.<br /><br />The story revolves around Charlie (Zac Efron, Me & Orson Welles), a promising young sailor whose life is put on perpetual hold when he causes the car accident that kills his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan, Nights in Rodanthe). With his mother (Kim Basinger, L.A. Confidential) devastated and leaving town, Charlie, runs off into the woods to encounter Sams ghost, promising him that he will continue playing baseball with him every night at dusk. Years pass and Charlie works at the cemetery where Sam is buried to fulfill his promise, when he meets the beautiful young sailor, Tess (Amanda Crew, Sex Drive). Through that relationship he starts to question that if living a secluded life in \\"the in-between\\" is really whats best for him or if finally letting go is what he needs to do.<br /><br />As you can tell from the plot of the film, there is a lot going on. The supernatural aspects nearly sink the story into sappy melodrama and quite honestly don't make much sense. The scenes of grief and the effect that Sam's death has on his family, especially, Charlie, are well done but sadly there aren't enough of them to fully resonate. The one aspect of the film that really does connect is that of Charlie and Tess' romantic relationship. It's the strongest plot point until a third acts emotional reveal threatens to destroy the entire structure.<br /><br />Regardless of the scripts schizophrenia, the film is, shockingly, held together by Zac Efron's strong performance. Coming a long way from his work in High School Musical and 17 Again (which was also directed by Burr Steers), Efron is showing real range as an actor. He has the good looks (which the camera relishes) and the charm and charisma to be a true leading man. He creates a very honest and true emotional arch for Charlie and does connect well on screen. The same can be said for Amanda Crew. She has a light and natural screen presence that helps add to the believability of the romance.<br /><br />Since the film never actually picks one genre, the emotional weight of the story is pat. The cinematography is beautiful and Efron's performance is worth a look for sure, but there really is not much else to take away from this, inoffensive, but ultimately uninteresting picture. Younger, undemanding, easily manipulated audience members will certainly take to the film, but anyone looking for an emotionally complex study on grief and family will need to see Ordinary People instead.<br /><br />Rating: Cte.

B003O86MY8|5.0|I've just recently heard of David Garrett and his music blows me away. I love every track on this CD. I listen to them over & over. These are fabulous arrangements. I've bought both of his CD's and would love to hear more.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I never actually watch the original series, but I can say from watching the first installment movie that this was very good. The animation was bright smooth and stunning. The story itself is good, though it goes into the emotional side of being an eva pilot quite a bit. Worth viewing.
1401227821|5.0|I've met Adam Hughes a few times and I am super glad that this book contains his unique humor in commentary on every piece. There's definitely a lot of his personality in this book in the writing and little jokes he makes throughout. Its almost worth it for that alone.<br /><br />Each piece is well displayed, shows preliminary sketches and alternate sketches. It really gets you into his head as far as the process of making his art goes. If you are interested in sketch books and art books alike, this is a MUST BUY. Well worth the price even if it were twice this amount. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up immediately!
B0033QC0WY|5.0|Leonard Bernstein was a pioneering force in having Mahler's monumental symphonies committed to tape.  His first cycle (on Sony) was and still is a ground-breaking recording when it first appeared in the late 1960s.  His second cycle (on DG) shows some drastic change in the man who was at the leader of the Mahler pack.  The standards he set with that set were the ones which almost all subsequent Mahler recordings were held to.  I'll compare the two cycles symphony by symphony.    Symphony No. 1- This was the next to last symphony that the orchestra recorded in the first set, and it remains a powerful contender among Mahler 1sts.  It has a sense of discovery that is refreshing.  Over twenty years later, Bernstein had changed in this work.  It has slowed down (including a nearly eight minute Scherzo) and it has more of a lift to it, oddly enough.  The Royal Concertgebouw plays much better than their New York counterparts, but the sound that DG gave him cannot compare to Columbia's excellent soundstage for the first recording.  I definitely recommend the Sony recording.    Symphony No. 2- Mahler's 2nd symphony was a perfect recording for Bernstein to be over the top, and some days this works well and some days it gets on every last nerve that I posess.  In the Somy recording, Bernstein is surprisingly conservative with the work. It is a little in the slow side but always well-paced.  The New York Philharmonic plays with aplomb and the work is almost a total success, save for the fact that the recording is sometimes muddy.  The DG recording is very.... excessive.  This recording has a tremendous sense of occasion to it.  It was Bernstein's 1000th concert with the NY Phil, and he lets us know it.  The tempi in this recording are sometimes GLACIAL.  The 1st movement is almost 26 minutes (!) long.  Depending on who you are, this is either emotionally impactful or incredibly boring.  Granted, the last coda is very thrilling, but on the whole it is just too slow.  I recommendZubin Mehta's 1975 recording with the Vienna Philharmonic.    Symphony No.3- There really is not much I can say about Bernstein in this work.  He connected with it on a level that I think few others did.  His blazing 1960s rendition remains the definitive version and the later one from the 1980s is basically the same.  Sonically, both are very impressive. NY plays better on the second recording I would not be with out either recording.  I recommend both, if you see them anywhere for re-sale.    Symphony No.4- Bernstein's 1st recording is my favorite recording of this work, period.  Reri Grist sings very well in the last movement, and Bernstein on the whole is pretty quick throughout the work. I do not like the second recording, mostly because he uses a boy soprano in the last movement.  Mahler's 4th is not my favorite work, but the 1st recording here is most excellent.    Symphony No.5- If I were you, I would go ahead and skip the Sony recording all together.  Very shoddy playing throughout and altogether too fast.  The DG recording is much better.  Bernstein has a much better sense of the structure and the Vienna Philharmonic is on form throughout.  If you see it for sale anywhere, buy it up quick.      Symphony No.6- I think the same case for the 5th applies here.  The DG recording is INCREDIBLE!  Bernstein gives the music plenty of room to breathe, and the Vienna Philharmonic gives a very committed performance, all white-hot intensity and fire.  The hammer blows are a little underwhelming, but the performance that the orchestra gives more than makes up for it.  Bernstein's over the top conducting is most suited to this work of incredible extremes.  10 star performance.    Symphony No.7-  I find that the case for the Third also applies here.  I slightly prefer the second recording simply because DG's sonics are in a different league and the playing is better.  I also really like how the brass sound here, simply because it is a full, American sound.    Symphony No.8-  The 1st recording from 1966 with the London Symphony is the better recording here. The organ roars and London's playing is to die for.  The DG recording from the 1975 Salzburg festival is... bad.  The organ is incredibly underpowered and the recorded sound is very distant.  I would stick with the first one.  The first movement in particular is exciting.    Symphony No.9- I personally do not like Bernstein in this work, on either recording.  He applies his over the top style and the work becomes distorted.  I find both to be very weepy and heart on sleeve.  Go for Claudio Abbado with Berlin.  This was my first recording of the 9th and remains my favorite.    On the whole, I find Bernstein's second cycle to be slightly better.  I would pick 1,2,4, and 8 from the first, and 5,6,7 and 7 from the second.  For the Ninth, I would get a different recording all together.    Bravi tutti!
B003ES5JDS|5.0|this is by far the best DC dvd. if you like the story in the comics, it literaly flies off the screen here. this deserves an award for it's compelling story, superb animation and over the top action. not for small children.I highly recomend this to every dark knight.
030726999X|3.0|After reading so much about this trilogy, I could not wait to get it and read it. Sounded like something that I would enjoy. I love murder/crime/mystery books. I was able to purchase the trilogy from G Britain on ebay. Anxiously waited for the mail. Upon arrival I dove right in. The first book, especially, was dull, dull, dull. Only about the last 1/3 to 1/4 was exciting. Too much explanation. It lost so much of its excitement. Book two was a little better. Moved faster and was more exciting. Still, not living up to the hype. Finally, the last book was good, but not great. Again too much blah, blah, blah. The detailed explanations took the wind out of my sails and I lost interest. Decide for yourself, but I personally did not feel it lived up to the raves it got in the media.
B0009F9O08|3.0|David Bowie's first official live album was considered something of a dud upon its original release in the fall of 1974. The show it documented was something of a rock n'roll epic in its day but supposedly it was as much of a visual spectacle as it was sonic and judging by the results of the recording probably more so. I have a problem with most of the versions of the Ziggy era tunes as they are set to mostly an R&B beat which is what David was starting to pursue at the time.  I absolutely HATE \\"Rebel Rebel\\" on this album as the studio version is one of my all-time favorites. I have no problems with David's performance which is strong throughout and the band is top notch so I guess my blasé look at this double LP is due to the style of music. There are some decent run throughs (\\"Diamond Dogs\\", \\"Space Oddity\\" and album opener \\"1984\\") but I have a hard time with such favorites as the aforementioned \\"Rebel\\", \\"Panic in Detroit\\" and \\"Suffragette City\\" which are in a word awful. Still worth a listen for the Bowie fan but not for someone who wants a best of from this era. `David Live' is proof positive that the artist would not stand pat with any given image and would change styles even in mid-tour.

B00275EGWY|5.0|This is an independent film, and as such it has a unique flavor to it that you're not bound to find in anything coming out of mainstream Hollywood.  To me, that's a good thing!  The story is about one of the most unconventional of soldiers:  the EOD expert (better known in the civilian world as the \\"bomb squad guy\\").<br /><br />The movie has more of a feel of a documentary than it does a movie that has a linear plot.  The main character is an amazingly competent diffuser of bombs, but is also a person who lacks common sense and social skills.  He is so adept at deactivating bombs, and yet he is clueless about relations with his girlfriend, and something as banal as shopping for cereal @ the grocery store makes him very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Some may be surprised that this doesn't come off as an anti-war movie like, say,  [[ASIN:B00005AUJQ Platoon (Special Edition)]].  The veracity of the this film has been criticized by people who are far more qualified to challenge its realism than I am.  That said, I would STILL say that the movie brings the viewer closer to what it feels like to be a soldier in a combat zone than most films.<br /><br />As in [[ASIN:B000B8QG22 Good Morning, Vietnam (Special Edition)]], the main character befriends a young boy who is a native of the foreign country.  Some have said this is unrealistic.  I would disagree.  No matter whether the soldiers are EOD specialists, Rangers, Delta Force or whatever, there's a good chance they have strong parental insticts.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that it's many times strong parental instincts are one of the things that drive them to become soldiers in the FIRST place.  They want to leave a better, safer world behind for their family / children.  So, I would contend that the criticisms of this aspect of the movie are unwarranted.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie & would like to experience more Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), then I would recommend [[ASIN:0470444304 Rage Company: A Marine's Baptism By Fire]] and [[ASIN:B000DN5WUW Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories DVD]].IN:B000DN5WUW Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories DVD]].

9889979942|5.0|I've always been very curious about mainland China and its people. Having only been to a couple of the major cities in China, I knew I've only seen a very tiny fraction of it.     China Portrait of a People opened my eyes to all the other parts of China that I've never imagined seeing. Each portrait captured the culture, a story, and the emotions of the people. The author found a way to capture the essence of who they are no matter what the image is. Whether it be a head shot, a body part, a scenery or just plain objects, there's a clear story behind everyone of them. GREAT GREAT work!!!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Disney Pixar is amazing. They appeal so well to both kids and adults, and this movie is no exception. It was very sweet, humorous, and even sad at parts. The color is incredible, the effects are great, the story is fun, and the whole family will enjoy it.
0061714372|5.0|I got my copy in the mail yesterday. I started reading it, and didn't stop reading for seven hours!   The book is written in a very conversational tone- as if Dave Mustaine himself was talking about his life. Very interesting and eventful. As you probably already know, Mustaine's life was not an easy one! I really admire the man for his honesty and putting himself out there for the rest of the world in this great book.  There is funny, sad and random in this tome. It is a great read. Not only that, there are also many photos in the book from when he was young and from the metallica years too.   Overall, I think this book will be loved by any fan of Mustaine or Megadeth or of metal. You can really understand the man's struggles over the years, his dedication to music and his determination to succeed.  Buy it, read it!
0525951652|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Ken Follett's epics, \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\".  Though they are hefty tomes, the pages flew. Thus I jumped at the chance to read and review Follett's latest epic, \\"Fall of Giants\\" which promises to be the first in The Century Trilogy.  When it arrived from Amazon at ~1000 pages and 4 inches thick, I found myself contemplating one of the advantages of having a slim Kindel (I don't). When the thing comes out in hardback in September it could be used a murder weapon!<br /><br />But we all know that size doesn't matter when you've got an expert storyteller weaving an enthralling tale. I became so engrossed that I'd look up and 100 pages would have flown by. What is it that makes Follett so consistently \\"readable\\"? In \\"Fall of Giants\\" it's because the book is so well researched about the period (early 20th century especially WWI) with information on coal mining, trade unions, women's suffrage, protocols and manners of the minor royalty, politics, government, revolution and war. The story flows from this rich period but the riveting characters are at the forefront. Even the largely unsympathetic characters, such as the Earl, are made at least understandable because Follett thoughtfully portrays their motivations. There are few totally good or evil characters here, as it should be. (Though Follett seems none too fond of Russians and priests - be they Catholic, Anglican or Orthodox!)<br /><br />In past reviews I have criticized authors that I believe would benefit from more editing (e.g., Steven King, John Irving) so why don't I find Follett's book to be too long? Because there are no slow spots, no political point pushing, and no self-indulgent purple prose.<br /><br />I learned a great deal about WWI reading this novel, what led up to it and how it set the stage for WWII, which I hope is the subject of the next volume. It was fascinating to read about how the media and the governments of all the countries involved, lied to their people about how bad it was.<br /><br />One other thing that I believe readers should know going in: as mentioned, this is Part One of a promised trilogy but, like \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World\\" it is a stand-alone novel. The reader is not left gripping a cliff at the end. I recently very much enjoyed Connie Willis' \\"Blackout\\" which DOES end with a cliff hanger and I am glad I knew that going in; some readers didn't and felt cheated. You will not feel at all cheated at the end of \\"Fall of Giants\\". Enjoy!people about how bad it was.<br /><br />One other thing that I believe readers should know going in: as mentioned, this is Part One of a promised trilogy but, like \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World\\" it is a stand-alone novel.

0316098337|5.0|It is SO hard to write a review for this book because, unlike several other reviewers, I do not want to give away ANYTHING about what happens in the book, so as not to deprive anyone of the full experience of reading this remarkable novel.    What I can say is that \\"Room\\" evoked just about every emotional response from me.  I laughed. I cried. I raged.  I empathized.  At one point, my heart was pounding, while at another, I felt as though it stopped.  But unlike other novels that elicit strong emotions, \\"Room\\" never once made me feel manipulated.    Emma Donoghue has created a wonderful and magnificent character in Jack.  And her realization of his unique perspective and experience is nothing short of brilliant.  I will say that at times during the first quarter of the novel I felt that she was less than successful in creating a coherent internal logic, because it seemed \\"wrong\\" at times that Jack would understand one thing but not another.  But I soon came to believe that the author probably created these \\"inconsistencies\\" intentionally rather than sloppily, because, by failing to adhere to what would appear to be \\"logic,\\" these inconsistencies serve to disorient the reader from the world he or she \\"knows,\\" so as to bring the reader more fully into Jack's world, which is unlike ours in so many ways.  Simply put... genius!    \\"Room\\" is long-listed for this year's Man Booker Prize.  While I have not read any of the other books on the list, I cannot say whether \\"Room\\" deserves to make the shortlist or win the prize, but the novel moved me in a way that makes me HOPE it wins.

This is not a feature for everyone, in my opinion, for unless you are  somewhat familiar with the history of the period  the film may appear a bit confused.

This would have been a great season and a great final to end the show for good, closing the plot but still keeping everything open - of course I'm more than happy there is going to be at least another one ;-)    Anyway, Jensen and Jared / Dean and Sam rock and are absolutely awesome. I'm also very happy Misha Collins / Castiel got to stick around will also be in the future season(s).     This review might not be very helpful but I'm in love with Supernatural, the characters and the 5th season and therefore had to rate it :-D

B00004VXF2|1.0|You know what's *really* annoying to me?    The fact that there must be several MUCH more deserving albums from the 70's that obviously require more in the way of creativity, songwriting and just overall talent that are rapidly fading away.      Meanwhile, a horrible piece of garbage like Metal Machine Music gets all kinds of totally undeserved attention these days, despite being one of the noisiest, crappiest and most obnoxious albums that ever came out of the entire decade.  Guitar feedback absolutely *stinks*.  All because of a contractual obligation?      And why do so many people claim to *like* this album, you ask?  Because these days (well actually, for the last 15 years or so) implementing noise into rock music has been considered not only acceptable among the majority of young teenage music listeners these days, but actually enjoyable.   I totally don't get it, but it's true.       REALLY?  Enjoyable?  THIS album?  I will never understand todays generation.  I realize everything comes down to personal preference, but songwriting is significantly more important than straight up unbearable noise (at least, it most certainly *should* be) and Metal Machine Music simply doesn't deserve to be remembered (or praised) in the slightest.    You could argue that it helped pave the way for allowing noise to be utilized in rock music these days.   You could also argue adding noise helped to slowly deteriorate rock altogether and turn it into a big pile of uninteresting secondrate crap (like the majority of it we hear today).    If Lou Reed intended this album to be a huge joke, well, the joke is obviously on him.  Lou Reed himself released several other solo albums where more dedication was obviously given to the music, otherwise he wouldn't have taken the time to lay down a set of songs.      He didn't lay down a set of songs for this horrible album- he laid down a piece of unlistenable garbage.      If it wasn't for Transformer and Berlin, his reputation could have potentially been permanently damaged and never taken seriously again as a musician.  Imagine if this album had been released *before* Transformer and Berlin.  Yikes.    Anyway, yes.  Never listen to Metal Machine Music.  Ever ever ever.  The fact it's remembered and actually getting attention gives the 70's a bad name and is certainly insulting to... everybody making music back then.

B001DRF84W|4.0|I thought this was pretty good. The Hulk scenes, though CGI, weren't overdone. Enjoyed the movie as a movie only. Did not try to pick it apart.
B002ZG997C|2.0|I found the movie to be exceptionally entertaining, probably not factual or real life but close enough to be entertaining.  The movie I rate this title a four or five star.  Visuals and sound were fine.    DVD was rented from Redbox during the month of July, 2010.  Assuming the DVD is the same as retail this Warner title is a pain in the rear.  Disc starts with several trailers and forces/locks the viewer in this mode because fast forward, chapter skip, and menu are disabled.  My stand alone DVD player is a Sony DVP-7700.  The only function I found that will by pass the trailers and start the movie was to place the DVD player in program mode and play/execute title #1.    DVD disc features are bare with only language and subtitle selections, no extras.  I don't mind trailers listed within the special features when I can play each one at a time and I do frequently view the trailers.  But dislike having to be forced to view trailers at startup.    Most likely should I ever own this title it will be a different version or will not be willing to pay much for it.
B000GIWRIY|5.0|Root to Branches is an excellent CD. To me it sort of sounds like a cross between \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Minstel in the Gallery\\". It's had rocking, but it still retains that signiture mid-evil sound. And the song \\"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\\" sounds like it has some Frank Zappa influence in it! It's a fun song. If you like Jethero Tull and Ian Anderson, buy this CD. You'll love it!

0783225482|4.0|Like they say,it's all in the eyes of the beholder.  Most of the people who have reviewed this movie loved it.  I laughed in a few areas but, overall, I was left with a feeling that something was missing [pardon the pun].  I thought it was too cute and too campy by half.  I liked the beautiful temptress and I thought Willis, by stepping out of his usual routine tough guy roles, was great.  Hawn and Streep bouncing off one another didn't do much for me.  Then again, in matters of taste, there is no dispute and, overall, the film is well done and scripted.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|This is a must see movie with Bruce Willis.  His snide comments to himself provide comic relief.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Love all of Hayao Miyazaki movies.... Our collection is just starting. A little bit violent but if you explain the movie to small kids they will like it.
0060930349|1.0|The first 700 pages of this history are great! Unfortunately the last 300 pages reveal the author's biases! I don't understand how the author can absolve all of Nixon's presidential sins, but damn all the Supreme Court's rulings and the Democratic presidents since FDR! Does anyone wonder why GWB would award Paul Johnson the PMH, especially since GHWB was denigrated so thoroughly?
B00004RD54|5.0|My favorite album from Lou Reed.  Love at least four of the songs, the rest aren't bad either!
B002B55XGI|5.0|This is in response to a comment posted on July 24....    It's too bad you never finished the book to see it was way beyond pushing a political agenda.  The whole entire purpose, the greatest significance which you have clearly missed (which is easy to do when you've only read 35 pages), is to pay tribute to the 19 heroes who died during Operation Redwing. Your opinion \\"I think that Luttrell does the SEALs a disservice by having written this book\\" is also unfortunate to say, considering the MANY veterans and inspired-to-be SEALs who have nothing but the utmost respect for what Marcus Luttrell has written. You probably also do not know the massive response of inspiration this book has created with its message \\"PAY IT FORWARD\\" and how thousands of people have made it their mission to do just that - GIVE BACK to our servicemen (which, sadly, many people here at home have forgotten).  The way I see it, this is far from a \\"disservice\\" to the SEALs, or for that matter, ALL the troops overseas.  Obviously you are entitled to your opinion, but it's hard to give it credit when your ignorance shines through what you say.

0765357151|5.0|Many reviewers have described the greatness of this story and its influence on modern writers.  I wanted to offer my viewpoint as a reader who had seen the movie first.  I initially avoided the book because I felt that the movie, while entertaining, was shallow with an uninteresting story.  However, the positive reviews finally convinced me to give it a shot and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />The character portrayed by Will Smith is a brilliant man who is the cause of the epidemic and also the eventual savior of the human race.  The character from the book is a much more interesting and relatable one.  He is just an average man who struggles to survive.  Not only with the vampires, but also to motivate himself to complete the menial tasks required for his daily survival.<br /><br />The vampires portrayed in the movie are superhuman killing machines completely devoid of any perceivable intelligence.  In contrast, the book's portrayal of the vampires is much more interesting.  They retain many of their human qualities, including their intelligence, personalities, and physical capabilities.  This allows for interactions far more interesting than those found in the movie.<br /><br />The conclusion found in the movie is very unsatisfying.  It serves as a confirmation of the woman's belief that God had directed her actions, portends the rebirth of human civilization, and illustrates the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.  All very common themes that deliver a boring result.  The book's conclusion deviates drastically from the movie's.  I don't want to ruin the ending, but I will say I found the final realization the main character is forced to accept very interesting and thought provoking.<br /><br />I encourage anyone to read the book regardless of their feelings on the movie.  The book provides a deeper story and a much different take on the vampire genre than the one presented in the movie.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|The whole disc is all the same volume level, no real highs and lows like older Alice in Chains discs.  Would love a non-Loudness War version.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the Cat is the coolest for my children. He goes with the flow and finds beauty even in his own mistakes. This book is a great way to take a step back for you and your children and enjoy life. The kids have applied this philosophy of \\"I Love My White Shoes\\" to anything bad that happens that day. I love my muddy car, I love my broken sandal, I love my rainy day even when we're at the pool,I love my lost silly bands!! If you are a parent and want your kids to read great book, buy it!!!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Let me start by saying that I've been a fan of Garmin and the Forerunner since the early days. That being said, I am reviewing this product not independently, but in comparison to other Garmin models. Here's what I like:    -The design is greatly improved. It fits like a watch, albeit a very large watch. This is a dramatic improvement from previous models.    -The GPS connection is nearly automatic. I used to set my old units outside, get a cup of coffee, and return to hope that the signal had been found. With the 405, it's connected as soon as I'm outside my door. In new places, it takes a bit longer to lock on, but once it's done it's strong.    -Accuracy. I don't have quite as many inconsistencies in pace/distance as I did with previous models.    Other than that, everything else works just as well or the same as other Forerunners I've owned.    Now, the not so good:    -The battery life is awful. If you travel with this device, forget leaving the charger at home. I used to charge my 305 to 100% and run for a week. With the 405, it's always ON, apparently, and the battery will drain to nothing within a couple of days, even if you aren't using it.    The touch bezel. I don't like it. It isn't \\"intuitive\\", it is over-sensitive and \\"buggy\\"when it gets wet (anyone else sweat when they run?), which can be a major annoyance. It took me about a month to finally get the feel of it, and I still don't always get what I expect when I use it.    -The menus. Again, not intuitive. Things just don't seem to be located where they should be. I had to go to the owner's manual to find out how to pull up run history. I am a gadget geek, not a technophobe, and I usually figure things out easily. Not the case with this device.    -The software. Others have done a good job telling what a nightmare the Garmin Training Center software is. I personally don't use it because I don't always run with my Forerunner (treadmill, etc.) and I want my training log to reflect all my runs. That's whyI use paper. If Garmin ever figures out how to let runners manually enter training, I will use the Training Center.    All in all, it's a very good device, and I'm sure it's the best in the market. However, I can not give it a 5 star rating because I see all the things that Garmin can do better.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Just got mine in the mail.    Very nice quality dice. Colorful and easily recognizable icons. The icons are \\"etched\\" deeply into the die, making the dice durable and long lasting.    The dice container consist of a simple cardboard tube, with removable plastic end caps. Not very good at all. But it's functional enough for carrying the dice around, and can be used to shake up the dice.    Game instructions are simple and easy to understand.    I had first seen \\"Zombie Dice\\" as a free iPhone App. The iPhone app was fun to play, and had high quality graphics and standards. After playing the iPhone version for awhile, I decided to order the actual dice version.    I'd take a few points off for the cardboard tube, but the actual dice and game itself are excellent. Excellent purchase.
B00386EZJU|5.0|As every other reviewer is noting, this is one of the best soundtracks ever.    If you liked the movie, you need this soundtrack.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I received this DVD for Father's Day and have enjoyed it thoroughly.  I have been and will continue to recommend and share this DVD with all my music/musician and RUSH friends and family.    Finally, a documentary that is skillfully and tastefully executed to not only celebrate the band but also illustrate the lives behind the lighted stage.    This is definitely one for your DVD library; it's that good!!!
0312427999|2.0|This book had some mildly interesting anecdotes, although there is nothing pleasurable about this read. And very little accuracy from what I know.     No one and nothing is perfect, but this indictment of is the equivalent of junk science. Hints of facts interspersed with a raging and disillusioned perspective, in my opinion.      My recommendation: Skip it.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Purchased the last album Continuum based on his performance at 2007 Crossroads in Chicago.  His live rendition of \\"Gravity\\" blew me away.  Battle Studies traces his growing up from media brat to more mature - both personally and musically.  Very rich writing and playing.  I just can't get enough.  A guitar and rock masterpiece.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|UPDATE 4/12/11:  Forget about build quality: after only a few months, this unit now emits a loud, annoying hum regardless of the input source.  Can't recommend this now -- you're better served getting a high-quality CMOY headphone amp or professional grade amp if you can afford one.    My original review follows -- I took out the \\"solid construction\\" bullet point.  ---------------------------    I'd been debating for a while on what headphone amp to buy: I was considering a CMOY amp or a commercial solution like the E5. My requirements were:     * on-off switch  * power indication light  * volume control       The E5 meets all those.     On top of that it's rechargeable, but the downside with this is the unit has a built-in lifespan (when the internal nicad battery dies, you'll have throw this away and get a new amp).  But for ~$20 this is a great deal and it does what it promises -- to a point.    For my iPod I use Sony MDR-EX33LP - these have a stated freq. response of 6-23,000 Hz. With my iPod hooked to the E5, the volume is not noticeably louder (FYI: my ipod 2nd gen nano is 4 years old though) but the sound is clearer, instruments are more easily discerned in the mix, and overall there's a warmer sound.    Using the same Sony earbuds, and with the E5 between them and my old Panasonic portable CD player from 1993, OK sound becomes incredible (note: the CD player has a line out though; with the Ipod I'm using the headphone jack -- could be a substantial difference in the outputs). Frankly, the sound from this old relic becomes just as good as if the CD player is going thru my Yamaha home receiver!    At work I have a pair of old Creative Lab speakers (very basic) hooked to a Lenovo T62 laptop: these speakers on their own are tinny and flat sounding - but when the E5 is added between them and the laptop - WOW! - better definition and louder, and the bass is more defined. And there's no need to crank up the sound on the laptop or speakers themselves. Suddenly thesecheap old Creative Lab speakers sound much, much better. The minor investment in the E5 is worth it for this alone.    I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD-555 headphones that I haven't had time to try out with the E5 hooked to my various audio devices -- I'll update this review when I do.    So in sum, a little disappointed that there's not a huge difference in sound when used with my Ipod Nano, but for my portable CD player and laptop speakers - YES - this was definitely worth the price.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|Looks like Zeus (Sean Bean) has had his lightning bolt, which is his sign of authority, pilfered. He suspects Poor pitiful Percy (Logan Lerman.) Percy who never suspected that he is the son of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) must pass trials and tribulations including going to Hadês. On the way, he makes new friends as Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) the Daughter of Gray Eyed Athena. He also comes across many perils such as a medusa (Uma Thurman) that makes you want to look.<br /><br />I have to confess that I have not read the books or anything relevant about the books before seeing the movie. Of course, with few exceptions movies cannot be the book; movies are usually a pale reflection. Yet some times, they can exceed the books. In this case, I cannot judge. However, I would want to have the movie if only the title matched.<br /><br />Not comparing to the books the movie is still just a mediocre teen coming of age movie. Percy is reborn by trial of fire. Now what will he do in the next movie?<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|My favorite scenes of the movie are with Bill Murray and the expressions on his face, it doesn't get better than that, and the beautiful wide-shot of the train when it gets lost. I like Angelica, but only tolerate Wilson and the other two actors because it's a Wes Anderson film. BTW, wtf were they planning on doing with that snake anyway?
B001E9641K|4.0|Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries is the same fun boardgame as the others in this series (don't bother with the dice or card version, however). What makes Nordic Countries different is that it combines and revises some of the more advanced rules from both [[ASIN:B000809OAO Ticket to Ride Europe]] and [[ASIN:B000WTDUZ6 Ticket to Ride Switzerland Map Expansion]]. You get ferry and tunnel routes like Europe and the locomotives are only usable on them like Switzerland. Ferry routes all require one or two locomotives to build. Unlike Europe or Switzerland, you can \\"crush cards\\" when building ferries by \\"crushing\\" 3 of any single color card into a locomotive and some of the ferries require you to use cards of a specific color. Tunnels operate the same as Europe; when you try to build one, flip the top 3 cards from the draw pile over; if any of them are the same color as the route you are trying to build or are locomotives, then you need that many extra cards of that same color and/or locomotives in order to build the tunnel. You also get a new vertical game board and ticket cards, of course, depicting Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland (plus a bit of Russia), as well as a bonus 10 point Globetrotter ticket awarded to the player with the most tickets completed at the end of the game. There is no longest route bonus as in the original game or Europe. The new map has a lot of short routes in the south and long routes in the north (including a 9 train route that is incredibly tough to build since locomotives do not act as wild cards on normal routes in this version). There are several diabolical choke-points up north where you can screw over the other players by cutting them off while other areas in the south (the big cities) have a ton of ways into them. You can expect a real challenge from this map and its new rule tweaks.  Like the out-of-print Switzerland, Nordic Countries is only playable by 2-3 players; if you are playing with 3 people then you can use the double routesjust as in 4-5 player versions of the other games in this series. Once again, Days of Wonder delivers a deceptively simple, fun but challenging game sure to provide years of entertainment. Production values are durable, beautiful and excellent as usual except well over half of the tickets are confusing. Many of the vertical destination tickets have names of the cities listed in order of south to north or right to left, which is the reverse of how one would expect to read them, and this takes quite a bit of getting used to (note that the Marklin edition of Ticket to Ride, which also uses a vertical map, does not seem to have this problem with its destination tickets). I suppose the logic behind the decision is that the south is the heavily populated region with more available routes but it comes across to me as an incredibly bad design choice. Usually, big cities are listed first on a ticket so maybe that is part of the logic but it took actively staring at the cards and comparing them to the map to finally see some method to the madness. And it is madness, because every single player I've gamed with was totally confused by the tickets that had the aforementioned issues in game after game. Okay, so maybe Days of Wonder can say it's not a screw-up but a design choice, except the rule is not even applied consistently. A few tickets do not follow it. Another problem, which cannot be played off as a design choice, is that all seven of the tickets leading to Finland's capital of Helsinki erroneously point inland to Lahti, the city directly above it. I'm not happy with the destination tickets; they cause unnecessary confusion and time-wasting in what is otherwise an excellent game. It does does get a little bit easier once you play enough games and familiarize yourself with the foreign names and locations of the cities. Days of Wonder customer service didn't seem to care or even consider the tickets an issue when I contacted them.   Nordic Countries is especially handy for when I can't get 4-5 people to play (so we can use the double routes), but I am taking off one star from my review for the ridiculous ticket confusion. Regardless of the problem, after playing several games of it, I still prefer [[ASIN:B000809OAO Ticket to Ride Europe]] (with the [[ASIN:B002OFLL7A Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1912 Expansion]]) because the locomotives are true wild cards and it adds three stations per player you can place to avoid being cut-off by your opponents. However, there is nothing to stop you from adding the station rules to Nordic Countries or any other edition. In fact, I recommend it if you like your games a bit less cut-throat, although the station colors may not match up depending on which edition you are trying to integrate them into; different editions of the game use different colors for their trains (Nordic uses black, purple and white, for example). I also like the variety of [[ASIN:B000EYF7RS Days of Wonder Ticket To Ride - Marklin]] which adds passengers for an extra layer of crazy bonus point scoring strategy, although this edition can be a bit fiddly due to the extra rules and probably shouldn't be your introduction to the Ticket To Ride series. The original [[ASIN:B0002TV2LU Ticket to Ride]] is the simplest version but also the most frustratingly cut-throat unless you also get the [[ASIN:B000K8FYAS Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1910 Expansion]] which gives you a lot more choices on tickets and customizing the rules to suit your group's play style (but it's still probably the most cut-throat edition even with the expansion).

B003S897UK|5.0|If you're a tried and true Govt Mule fan, this one is a no-brainer.  This 3 CD edition of their New Years Eve set following the previous years \\"Live With A Little Help From Our Friends\\" release, this show from The Roxy in Atlanta simply smokes from front to back.  The first CD is mainly vintage Mule with some new stuff from the Life Before Insanity disc ending off with covers of 20th Century Schizoid Man, We're Not Gonna take it and Dazed and Confuzed.  Enough reason to buy this already!  Disc 2 is a solid blues disc with friend Little Milton and Warren and company simply rip it up all bluesy-like.  Not enough?  Disc 3 they bring out pals Audley Fried, Johnny Mosier and Mark Van Allen and proceed to rip through Helter Skelter, Sometimes Salvation, 30 Days In The Hole, End of the Line,...well you get the picture.    This disc is yet another example of what a great band GM was back then as a 3 piece band before the premature death of Allen Woody.  Great as they still are today (By A Thread), this disc is a must have to any seasoned Mule fan, a casual fan or someone who simply needs to hear great players playing great music.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|My wife and I have been watching a lot of Clint Eastwood movies as late night entertainment. Most fall within his Western Movie series or Dirty Harry series. Last night we switched to \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\" Boy, what a change! No gunfights. No violence. No tough guy. Rather, a very engaging love story, and set to a beautiful soundtrack.<br /><br />Eastwood plays a National Geographic photographer who accidently meets Meryl Streep, a lonely Iowa farm wife, at a time when her family is away for four days at a state fair. He is there to photograph the covered bridges in the nearby vicinity. Everything that happens is totally unplanned. An elegant and deep love story slowly unfolds. Of course, it's playing against the clock as her family is returning and the time eventually runs out. Streep stays with her husband and Eastwood goes his own way. The ending is quite touching. Be sure to have a big box of tissues around because you're going to need them. It's a wonderful story and just exceptionally well done.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B00005KAQP|5.0|I was 12 years old when Sister Act was released in theaters! I remember when I went to see it! It was the summer of 1992, I went with my aunt, my cousins, and my sister! I sat in that theater simply amazed at this movie! I remember laughing and trying my best to take in every moment of the movie! As soon as the movie was over, we got up from our seats and this lady approached us and said \\"Wasn't that good?\\" I had to agree with her - it sure was! Every since then Sister Act has been my #1 favorite movie! I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it! I have actually watched this movie so many times I have it memorized. This movie is well written and directed! Whoopi is fantastic in this movie!
1401322425|5.0|I have enjoyed the tv show with Jamie cooking produce from his garden.  This book follows up on the show.  The recipes are the same ones that he cooked.  This is wonderful, because the book has the specific ingredients listed with cooking times, etc. that one needs after getting inspiration from watching the tv show.  He makes it very easy to make great meals from foods on hand. The pictures in this book are fabulous, also.

0385528752|3.0|Switch has good suggestions for effectively getting others to want and work for the same things you want.  I would have liked to see much more on how to recognize the need for change in oneself and, miracle of miracles, how to find a way or ways to achieve such change.
B002W24E0G|4.0|This is not Nick's best effort, but entertaining just the same (I prefer the Swing and Blues side of Curran that makes him one of the best, but as always, that's just a personal opinion).   To the reader, treat your musical ears and purchase this CD and any and all of Nick's others.     And to Nick himself,   if you'll fight that illness with the same fire that you put into your music, that cancer won't have a chance.   Looking forward to your next CD and many, many more to come.
B003HE2B9E|5.0|This is a great cd from a great musician  A bit \\"pop rock\\" in places but the guitar playing is fantastic especially on \\"Highly Strung\\" with Steve Vai  Orianthi can sing as well which makes a pleasant change.  This is a re-release of her debut album, and in my opinion slightly better as it contains the last single (\\"shut up and kiss me\\") as well as \\"according to you\\" and \\"highly strung\\" as well as a good cover of 1984 hit \\"missing you\\" by John Waite. \\"Think like a man\\" is a bit more rocked up as is \\"addicted to love\\", but there isnt really a poor track on the disc  Think Avril Lavigne / Kelly clarkson with a bit more edge on the guitar and your close to Orianthi.  Highly recommended, but be warned, its far cheaper (almost £15 cheaper in fact) to order from Amazon.com direct rather than get the import version via Amazon.co.uk
0312370849|5.0|Excellent book about the French roundup of Jewish children and families in summer 1942.  Sarah is one such child, the book follows her terror and trials.  A portion of the book is the story of Julia Jarmond set in 2002 who is doing research for her articles on the \\"roundup\\".  She gets very involved in this topic because her husband's home was a previously Jewish occupied building.  Julia finds herself pregnant with a child that her husband does not want - they already have a daughter Zoe.  Sarah locked her little brother in the closet to protect him from the \\"roundup\\" and she has the key to release him, thus the title of the book.  GREAT READ.

031606792X|5.0|I have read all four of the published Twilight Saga books and the non-published Midnight Sun (it's Twilight{the first book} told from Edward's point of view) and this is the one that really had me not being able to put it down from the first page on to the hardcover on the back. I am an avid reader of many genres of books but this series got to me like \\"my own personal brand of heroin\\". Stephenie Meyer has a gift for storytelling that is out of this world and I am so glad that she felt the gravitational pull to write down her dream that she had one night thus, giving all of us, the gift of Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn and Midnight Sun (go to [...] for this non-published 12 chapter book). The world is a much better place for having her and her books in it and I am so thrilled that she is so hands on with the movies so that all of the essences of each book is present. Stephenie Meyer, loooovvvveee herrrrr!!!!! Twilight Saga, looooovvvvveeeee itttttt!!!!!

Tips on decoration and troubleshooting are included at the beginning and there is a healthy balance of unique and classic recipes.  I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for vegan baking recipes.
B002ZFQD0E|4.0|So I'll be honest, I got this CD for Tightrope. I saw the video before the album release and loved it.     I was a bit skeptical because my first experience with Janelle was at work (I work at a clothing store that plays all types of music), and it was her song \\"Violet Stars Happy Hunting!\\"...and it's pretty crazy. So I knew I had to give it a few listens. I wasn't sold at first, but the more I listened to it, the more I really began to dig it. The local college station started playing songs from The Archandroid like \\"Oh, Maker\\" and then work started playing \\"Faster\\"... and now I'm going to see her in concert, and I'm pumped for it.    Definitely worth your time.

His writing style is extremely annoying and he spends more time talking about how to make images better in Photoshop than actually taking better pictures.  He also wastes countless pages with jokes that run on forever.  When he does get to an interesting topic (like how to to take better sunset photos), he blathers on for two paragraphs and really says nothing...no info on settings at all.<br /><br />Get  [[ASIN:0817435522 The Betterphoto Guide to Digital Photography (Amphoto Guide Series)]]for a much better introduction to digital photography.
B003HFFVDQ|2.0|After the rather lackluster collaborations in We are the Night, it seems CB have decided to take an alternate course for this record. This new course, however, leaves alot to be desired. Progression certainly is not since there isnt much room they havent tapped into within the world of big beat, therefore, what is their intent here? Attempts at white noise and ambient soundscapes are truly dull. This music has been done over by countless bands in the 90s that possess a sharper grasp for the subtleties and details required to make these sounds work. Im glad to see CB attempt to break away from the sound they pioneered but it would have been much more digestable if they would have had a clear understanding of what they were truly trying to say. Obviously, this music is not for their rabid fanbase but if its a cathartic statement of purpose, they could have used an alias or released it as some film score or soundtrack and not as a CB release. As such, very disappointing.
0765356147|5.0|This was incredible. Sanderson carried the action from The Well of Ascension and brought it to bear in Hero of Ages. While it moved slow at times in the early going, it was great to see some new point of view perspectives and many new twists to the magic system of Allomancy.<br /><br />There is much more exploration of history and the old religions, and how it all ties into what's going on in the modern times. It is very tough to avoid spoilers here, as Sanderson does a remarkable job of tying up all of his loose ends, even some that I didn't realize were loose ends early on in the first books.<br /><br />A surprise ending. While I was able to piece some of it together as I was reading and make a few decent predictions, I was still pretty far off the big picture of that finale. Again, I have to be vague so that the effect won't be spoiled by those reading this review. I read it with no hints other than what Sanderson himself was weaving into the text, and the overall impact of the ending was fantastic. It was satisfying, pulling on several emotions all at once. And that's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />But I will say this. If the Mistborn series is any indication to the quality of work that Brandon Sanderson is giving to the final Wheel of Time books, Jordan fans and Sanderson fans alike are in for a serious treat. Luckily, I count myself as both......
B0007TKNIS|3.0|It wasn't bad.  But then again, it didn't meet my expectations.      The first time I saw this movie in choir, I wasn't impressed by the musical ability of Emmy Rossum or Jennifer Ellison.  We had ended directly after Angel of Music, and I had headed home, eagerly awaiting more of the movie.  I wasn't able to satiate my hunger for it and immediately pounced on youtube and found the movie in it's entirety and completely fell in love.  From my thoughts then for maybe another year, it was sumptous!  I immediately became obsessed and devoured everything I could ever find.  The cast could do no wrong, the set was beautiful, the voices? Sublime.    But then, I went to the stage show for the first time, and was absolutely blown away by that as well.    So...I went back home and watched the movie again, and it felt like the shine was gone.  What was left was a visually beautiful film with cold characters, subpar voices and a passionless plot.    With all the hype that she had gotten, hailing from the Met and recieving classical training at a young age, Emmy Rossum should have taken one of the greatest soprano roles in musical theatre history and claimed it, becoming Christine Daae physically and vocally.  Rather, I saw a young girl with a mediocre voice who at times, seem to not know just how the heck she got there.  While her voice is light and lifting, the character's voice has been deemed seraphic...angelic...the soprano of the century.  Not by fans, but by the creator himself, Gaston Leroux.  Broadway/West End actresses have possessed these qualities.  Sarah Brightman may have not appealed to many, but there's no doubting her voice was very well refined, her high notes well supported and impressive.  There's no arguement to whether or not she was well qualified in her role.  Subsequent Christines also were lovely, notable names including Sarah Lawrence, Gina Beck, Sierra Boggess...all inspiring.  ERossum just didn't...cut it.  Think of Me was truly emotionless, WYWSHA had many bum notes.  While I applaud her for the magnificent emotion she brought in the later songs, that appreciation is marred by many bum notes and unsupported, breathy phrasing.  There were so many qualified girls vying for the role of Christine, including the magnificent Boggess, now playing the role in Love Never Dies, or even Charlotte Church, who was also on the short list.    Gerard Butler....what to say about him...  It is difficult praising his acting as stellar because in retrospect, nearly any actor who has played The Phantom has been wonderful.  Gerard Butler certainly brings tears to anybody's eyes in some scenes.  The end, when he screams \\"It's over now the music of the night...\\" is heart-wrenching, soul shaking...the only problem is...he's screaming.  Reviews are constantly cheering him on for not ever having musical training but...    IT'S THE FREAKING PHANTOM OF THE OPERA! HIRE SOMEONE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SING!     That is all.    In conclusion...the set is marvelous and most of the supporting cast is wonderful.  Yes, Patrick Wilson is a bit wooden, but in All I Ask of You, you can truly hear the love in his voice.  During the Lair scene, the anguish is clear in singing and acting.  Jennifer Ellison is radiant as a more sympathetic Meg than the stage calls for.  Madame Giry...has an interesting accent but makes her mark.  The joint team of Hinds, Callow, and Driver is hilarious and brings some much appreciated comic relief to a dramatic film.  Yet, why must the two leads have been so horribly miscast?  Rossum and Butler were stunning to look at, but Phantom of the Opera shouldn't be watched.  It should be heard, the music should pull at the heartstrings and envelope the mind with it's magic.  All I hear on this soundtrack are two people stuggling to do the best that they can to cater to 80 million eager fans.      Though this movie took more than ten years to create, one could wonder, didn't Sir Andrew have any say in the casting of the film?  Could the man who once wrote, and still writes some of the most beautiful music to ever grace the world really choose two unqualified actors in his magnum opus?    Phantom of the Opera, I thank you for introducing me to something that is now a large part of my life.  While I do have many negative things to say, in a bind, I'm quite indebted to this movie.
0307454541|3.0|I picked up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo because of some of the professional reviews I'd read.  They made it sound like a book like no other, well-written, smart, venturing into areas unknown to other authors, with a mystery so dark and terrible that I expected to be amazed.  What I found was animal cruelty, abuse of women, murder, rape, financial crime, and two characters fighting to save themselves as they fight the bad guys.  Not much new there.<br /><br />The two main characters are not a match made in heaven.  Blomkvist is a charming, middle-aged, womanizing journalist about whom another character says, \\"You're a person with morals, Mikael.\\"  Lisbeth Salander is an anti-social young woman, seeming younger than she is who will use any means to accomplish her chosen task.  Together they break rules and laws to save themselves and bring the bad guys to justice.  One has to wonder who will eventually bring them to justice.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the Vanger family which is large in numbers, but doesn't seem to have many decent members.  Their mystery is an old one involving the disappearance of young Harriet in 1966.  It seem unsolvable but fresh eyes might make a difference.  It was easy to guess some of the secrets as the plot unfolded.  A couple of things came as a surprise.  Overall, there was little that was fresh.  I did give the book 3 stars, simply because I finished it, and I did enjoy certain elements.  But in the end, I did not like the characters and I hope that good mysteries will some day appear without a single battered woman.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|If you have an interest in viewing or purchasing this movie, you're likely a fan of Batman, DC Superheroes, or both.  Either way, this blu-ray disc will not disappoint.      Batman: Under the Red Hood is an amazing disc featuring a superb video and audio presentation of one of the best films released to home video by DC to date, and it comes loaded with special features. The following is my take on this release.    THE MOVIE (A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW):    This movie is an adaptation of the comic book story that debuted in Batman comics nearly five years ago. Those familiar with the comic who watch this film will notice some changes to the story (this story omits the Infinite Crisis tie-in device featured in the comics, allowing the film to work as a stand-alone piece). Although I'm a fan of the comic, I personally found the film to be superior to the original comic storyline in every way.     The film opens with Batman attempting to avert an international threat involving two of his deadliest foes, and the opening sequence ends with Batman suffering the worst tragedy of his crime fighting career. After the opening credits roll, the story jumps ahead about five years. The setting is Gotham City, and a mysterious figure calling himself Red Hood is waging war against Gotham's reigning crime lord: Black Mask. Black Mask is noted to be the first criminal in Gotham to take over the crime/drug trade completely.  It is no small feat then when Red Hood cripples Black Mask's operations, taking over Black Mask's territories and eliminating anyone who gets in his way. Red Hood's actions eventually place him in Batman's sights, and the resulting chases and battles between the two prove to be some of the most impressive ever depicted on film, animated or otherwise.     The chase scenes through Gotham city rooftops incorporate extensive aerial acrobatics, lightning fast martial arts techniques, death defying use of grappling lines, and bullseye gunslinging by Red Hood. Also keep youreyes open for a very impressive scene where Batman and one of his closest allies employ perfect team work to prevent a falling aircraft from crashing on city streets. I've never seen anything like it before, and I was very impressed.  Of course, the film culminates in a showdown between Batman and Red Hood, but between the opening and closing of the film, you'll be treated to one breakneck action sequence after another. Each of those scenes highlight different aspects of Batman's crime fighting skills and his advanced crime fighting technology. You will be treated to extensive shots of the Batcave, and you'll see appearances by the Batmobile and the Batwing. Special mention goes to one of the earliest action scenes where Batman is first reunited with one of his oldest allies.  The two employ perfect teamwork in a breathtaking action sequence where they take on and defeat a very powerful enemy. The battle takes them from the ground to the sky in an amazing display of aerial combat, death defying acrobatics, and life-saving grappling gun skills, culminating in Batman's stealthy and perfectly timed use of his utility belt arsenal to defeat the villain.     While the film's story is pretty straightforward (mostly serving as the thread tying together the awesome action scenes), the plot is solid, featuring a few interesting twists along the way. These plot turns reveal how cunning and ruthless the Red Hood is, as well as how the Red Hood is connected to Batman's past. Red Hood is a worthy adversary for Batman, and his strategies lead Batman into a situation where the only way out may be to cross a line he has vowed to never cross.     Being that this is an animated film, the performances rise and fall on the strength of the dialogue and the talent of the voice actors. In that respect, neither of the two disappoint. The dialogue sounds mostly natural for a story of this nature, and the voice acting is very strong. While long time fans of Bruce Timm's Animated Batman consider Kevin Conroy to be the definitive Batman voice (myself included), Bruce Greenwood (Captain Pike from JJ Abrams' Star Trek) does an impressive job as the Dark Knight Detective. His style is different from Conroy's, a bit softer and more gravelly, but a fitting voice for Batman. Greenwood is joined by Jensen Ackles (best known as Dean Winchester from Supernatural) who does excellent voice work as the Red Hood, Neil Patrick Harris as a good humored but highly skilled ally of Batman, John DiMaggio (Bender from Futurama) and Jason Isaacs as two of Batman's oldest foes, Wade Williams as a frothing and violent Black Mask, and, Kelly Hu as the trusted assistant of Black Mask.     As for the animation, the style is similar to Bruce Timm's previous animated work, but with a smoother, more realistic look to the characters. The animation quality runs somewhere between the more recent Bruce Timm Justice League animated series and a really great anime. This isn't quite Disney caliber animation (which features generous frames of animation per second that give the appearance of life-like fluidity of movement), but for direct to video, it is truly great work. I'd say it's on par with good Japanese Anime such as Naruto.    All in all, I was so impressed with this film that after it ended, I watched it once more just to digest the awesome action scenes. I've let the movie run while doing other things, but I always stop what I'm doing to admire the action scenes; they're more inventive and impressive than anything I've ever seen.     Conclusion: this film is very highly recommended.       Now for the BLU-RAY REVIEW:    PICTURE QUALITY: Picture quality is a flawless 1080P. Although most of the scenes in this film take place at night or in otherwise dark settings (the movie is about Batman, after all), the image never falters. Characters are animated with amazing clarity, while backgrounds pop with near three-dimensionality. Colors are sharp and vibrant without bleeding, as evidenced by night time scenes involving explosions and electrical/energy weapons. There is also no artifacting or aliasing that I could see. Perfect video here.         AUDIO QUALITY: Audio is very crisp and balanced. Flying batarangs, gunfire, explosions, dialogue and everything in between comes across solidly and clearly. I did not have to constantly adjust the volume up and down to hear dialogue and to avoid overly loud jumps in volume levels when gunfire and explosions rolled around.    SPECIAL FEATURES (SPOILER ALERT: TWO OF THE FEATURETTES MAY BE SPOILERS TO THE PLOT OF THE FILM, SO BE FOREWARNED)    ANIMATED SHORT FILM: The best special feature is a short film starring Jonah Hex (he is a gunslinging cowboy character set in the wild west time period of the DC Universe; his most notable physical characteristic being horrific burns/scars on one side of his face). Thomas Jane does great voice work as Hex, and his fine effort is complemented by that of other well known actors, including Michelle Trachtenberg, Linda Hamilton, Jason Marsden and Michael Rooker. This short ten minute film sees Hex tracking a a wanted criminal to a saloon/hotel where some of the clients check in and don't check out. When Hex comes up against the murdering criminals who run the joint, you'll see him employe fast thinking and even faster shooting to stay alive. The ending sees the villains getting what they deserve, and I for one, was very pleased with the film. I've seen a review saying this film was in standard def, but it looked hi-def to me, so you will have to decide for yourself when you see it.    FEATURETTES: The first one features Dick Grayson, the first Robin; the second features the second Robin, Jason Todd; the third is called \\"Robin's Requiem\\" - a feature about the comic story from the late 1980s called \\"A Death In the Family\\" which involves a death in Batman's family; and the fourth is a sneak peek at the upcoming Batman/Superman Animated Movie featuring Supergirl's reintroductionto the DC Universe called \\"Apocalypse.\\"  These features are in hi-def.    FURTHER BONUS FEATURES: Included on this blu-ray disc are four original episodes of the Bruce Timm Batman Animated Series hand picked by creator Bruce Timm.  The episodes are: \\"Robin's Reckoning\\" Parts 1 & 2 (featuring the origin of Robin as told in the Batman Animated Series); \\"The Laughing Fish\\" (Joker is the main villain, with his scheme being to use his chemical gas to create fish that share his Joker's smile - the story is actually more entertaining than it sounds, plus Joker is voiced by the definitive Joker voice actor, Mark Hamill); and \\"Mad Love\\" (a Joker story featuring Harley Quinn, Joker's main squeeze, who hopes to get rid of Batman permanently so that she can be the focus of Joker's attention). These episodes are in standard def.    DIGITAL COPY:    You also get a free digital copy of Batman: Under the Red Hood. But don't get too excited. It is exclusive to Windows Media Player, so all you itunes/ipod/iphone users out there are out of luck.    FINAL WORD:    If you are a fan of Superherores, Batman or the Bruce Timm animated DC Universe, you owe it to yourself to either buy or rent a copy today. The film is by far the best direct to home video feature ever produced to date.  With great voice acting, solid animation and a story that is equally dark and exciting, fans of Batman and superheroes in general will not be disappointed. Very highly recommended!
0345444051|4.0|Childhood's End taps two themes that it's hard not to root for.      One is that we, human beings, have almost unlimited potential.  We are meant to be more than we are.  Clarke's story tells of \\"Overlords\\" who arrive suddenly, in incomprehensible spaceships, representing a civilization of a scale and technology well beyond our ken.  But we have been recognized for our potential, to join and contribute to that civilization (provided we don't blow it, kill ourselves, and destroy our planet first).    The other is that we have in fact been selected and are being looked after, by a kind of father/mother who can shepherd us toward realizing our potential.  Here, our \\"Overlords\\" are midwives, incapable of the same kind of potential as us but capable of seeing us through our adolescence.      These are invigorating self-images that Clarke plays out.  And he builds an entertaining story around them, unfolding them for us.      I couldn't help likening Clarke's vision here to his own 2001 (check out the story \\"The Sentinel\\" that provides the basis for that movie) and, maybe more esoteric, Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, in which Zarathustra similarly midwives the exceptional human from the \\"merely human\\" to the \\"more than human\\".
0060899220|4.0|We like him because he's a rogue. The TV episodes tend to be formula driven as TV is. I don't fault Bourdain for that he's taking advantage of the situation. What's wonderful to watch is the transformation of the chef that was hardcore in the trenches and an opinionated ass and developed understanding of people in his travels and experiencing other cultures. He has a natural ability to see situations and people that come through in a limited way on TV and one would wish he had more control on his show. I think even though he's a great success it's difficult for him to alpha male the show. In any case it's a joy to see someone  thats obviously not hollywood generated and at least in print speaks his mind.  He's separated from the food shows somewhat by focusing on the culture more than the food. Because after all it's the people that make the food.
1594202559|5.0|If you have read \\"Too big to fail\\", \\"House of Cards\\", \\"Big Short\\", \\"Lords of Finance\\", \\"Fool's Gold\\", etc. you will like this book better. More wisdom based on incredible research and interviews. I was initially resistant to Mallaby's recommendations about financial reform, but he sold me based on reasoning well supported by evidence. The clearest, most readable and reasoned discussions of the efficient-market theory and Soros' reflexivity. If you don't know those terms, read this book anyway. He will at the end and you'll be glad whether you interest is investing or just voting. This is scholarship dressed up as popular non-fiction. On a par with Tom Wolfe and Malcolm Gladwell for brining non-fiction to a wide audience.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Eminem is back aftetr just 13 months since his last, and best solo album to bring you another solid high 4 star album.  All 6 of his solo's are at elast a high 4 star rating and the 2 D-12 albums and his \\"Re-Up\\" Compilation each are worthy of 4/4.5 stars as well.  Glad to see he didn't take as much time off between albums as he has been.  This one has 17 songs, 1 is a near classic, 4 are ok, the other 12 are ood or real good songs, no classic on this one though.  Guests are very minimal, on 7 songs, but only rapping on 1 and doing the hook on the other 6.  Production is where this differs from his last one (which was almost entirely and perfectly done by Dr. Dre).  DJ Khalil does 4, Just Blaze does 3, Boi 1da does 2, and Dr. Dre, Kon Artis (Mr. Porter), Supa Dups, Emile, Jim JOnsin, Script Shepherd, Alex da Kid, and Havoc all do 1 song.  Still a very nice album to have in your collection.    #1 - 8.5  #2 - 9.5 (f/ Kobe -- tight beat -- deeper song)  #3 - 9  #4 - 7.5 (f/ Pink)  #5 - 8 (tight lyrics, annoying hook)  #6 - 9  #7 - 8  #8 - 8.5  #9 - 8.5 (f/ Lil Wayne -- who actually has a verse I can tolerate)  #10 - 8.5 (f/ Steve McEwan)  #11 - 8.5  #12 - 9 (F/ Liz Rodrigues)  #13 - 8 (a rare beat by Dre that is only average)  #14 - 7.5 (f/ Liz Rodrigues)  #15 - 7.5 (f/ Rihanna)  #16 - 8.5  #17 - 7 (Rare beat from Havoc that is only ok)    Marshall Mathers -- b. 10/17/72 -- b.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|This was outstanding. The voice acting, sound track, action, dialog, color and story is just a sight to behold.  Fantastic on Blu-ray.  Batman by far is the franchise.  I compare the story to Batman Beyond Return of the Joker (the directors cut) for telling a great story with plenty of action and drama.
0061714372|1.0|I don't think I've ever read a more, bitter, self-centered diatribe in my life. I'm not sure if this is an exercise in exorcizing demons, an excuse to rip on everyone or just a fictionalized view on what happened (after all, if he drugged and drank as much as he says he did in the book - there's little possibility that he could recall as much as he does with this type of clarity). This is an ego driven, hate fueled excuse for literature, more apt to further burn bridges rather than build them.      While, I'll admit I didn't expect a balanced viewpoint (it is an autobiography after all) - I expected more than this. I thought that we get more of reflective Dave rather than the venom we got from him years and years ago. Now, more than ever, I feel sorry for Dave Mustaine. Not because he wes kicked out of Metallica or that he was/is a drug addict. I feel sorry for Mustaine because he sees the world solely through angered eyes, he can't let go and he can't grow up. ...and this doesn't just relate to the Metallica stuff, it's his whole life. His whole life is about Dave, Dave, Dave and apparently how he can mess that up and those bring those around him down.     According to Dave, it's everyone's fault but his. I'm seriously thinking of passing on the book signing coming up in a few weeks I'm so put off by this book.     I'll sum it up for you: \\"Everyone sucks but me - I can do no wrong. I did drugs and drank and it's everyone else's fault. I created Metallica and guitar in general.\\" Damn, Dave - get over it and get over yourself. You sound really whiny... I was really starting to appreciate you and your band again.
0743298039|5.0|Brilliant indeed! This book is A-MAZING-LY well crafted and fascinating! My daughter and I read it (unbeknownst to each other)and we couldn't wait to tell each other about the wonderful new author we'd discovered. But where are the other books Diane Setterfield wrote. Oh NO! There aren't any! How can this be? We want more of the same literature-quality tales from this ranks-up-there-with-the-best author.
B0013D8LOU|1.0|Im was big fan of J. Deep when about 8 years ago or so was doing serious movies like THE NINTH GATE, BLOW, IN HELL and SLEEPY HOLLOW.<br /><br />Funny enough I though this was going to be some sort of a SLEEPY HOLLOW type of movie instead is a musical. So is J DEEP meets BROADWAY sort of speak.<br /><br />I literally wasted my money on this. I couldnt watch this past the first 1/2 hour. It is very bad because it had the potential to be something in the lines of SLEEPY HOLLOW and beyond. A very serious movie. Rather than that, Tim Burton whos a great director decided to do this masquerade with musical number.<br /><br />Johnny Deep and some of the other actors are not singers anyway, so why waste money on people that when they sing dont crack your ribs.<br /><br />I never like to give NEGATIVE feedback, but this one took the bakery for me. Sorry :(<br /><br />RATING 1<br /><br />RAY ST JOHN
B0036EH3U2|1.0|So after years of hearing how great the new Battlestar Galactica is I decided to buy the fist season. It was difficult but I managed to make it through the miniseries and 4 episodes before I just gave up on it. Everything about this show is terrible. The Camera work makes you sick, it's always spinning around and at weird angles. They should have invested in a tripod. The story is bland, the acting is bad, dialog is even worse. I usually love sci-fi, firefly, brisco county, terminator, but this show takes itself far too seriously and is stupid. I actually enjoyed Caprica which is the spinoff of this show, and the original which is pretty bad is about 1000x better.
B003BKF696|5.0|Not a bad song in the bunch. I can't think of a recent album that so rewarded repeated listening.  A must have.

This was not a great read.  It is not better than SATC. I wish I could rate it less than 1 star. The character's in this book were just plain stupid.  They sounded more like teenagers than grown women.

B000UR9TQO|2.0|Since there's plenty of reviews concerning the movie I wanted to focus on the packaging.      When this edition was announced I was quite excited to get my hands on a copy. I was more interested in the packaging including the shirt and other extras not included with the other editions of this release. I'll cut to the chase. The outer box is made from flimsy cardboard that can be easily damaged. I bought several extra copies since I wanted to have at least one sealed since I'm a collector. Both of those copies arrived damaged and I don't blame the dealers but whoever the brainchild was whom created this version. These two were also cut out copies. Upon opening my original copy I couldn't help but notice the cheap quality of the shirt included. Very thin cotton and after about 6 months of use there's not much left of shirt and it looks very worn now. For the most part I'm very displeased with the material used for this set marketed as 'Collector's Edition\\" I think more thought could have gone into this and considering the original price when released, it should have!!!    \\"  Their are two versions of the \\"Collector's Edition. I believe when originally released, their was material used that Zeppelin did not own the copyright to nor get permission to use so it was discontinued quickly. This version has white symbols like the picture used for this review. The second version omits this material and has black symbols which is more than likely what you will receive when ordering. You might want to check with your dealers to confirm what your getting and I'm still looking for the white symbols box.
0671027344|2.0|I was so excited to read this book- I had heard great things about it, and how it had such a cult following.<br /><br />But after reading it, I am disappointed.<br /><br />The book started slow, and I was not very interested. It was not the type of book that I would put down and yearn all day to pick back up. One positive note: the book is pretty short, and it only took me a few days to read it (had it been more interesting, I probably could have finished it within two days).<br /><br />The book is written in narrative and letter form. The letters are written only to `friend', never revealing any names or possibilities throughout the book of who this person could be. These letter describe his life, almost like a journal. Besides the main character, Charles, there is his best friend- who is gay- and his best friend's sister- who Charles pines for.  He starts out as a loner and, after many drunken, drug-tripping, girlfriend-involving events, the books ends the same way it began.<br /><br />Just a fair fact about the writing style: it is written like a boy entering high school might write: not very well. I understand, though, it's part of the book. But it annoyed me. The letters, however, did get better as the book (and `year') went on.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|My boyfriend loved this movie and I actually bought it as a gift; needless to say he loved the fact it was blu-ray and I loved the fact it also contained a DVD as well! Best deal & a great buy!
0307388921|5.0|Firstly, I must say that this is the first book by Mr. Palahniuk I have read. I. Loved. It.<br /><br />The protagonist character is Victor Mancini, whose life is just falling apart. He is a med school drop out, forced to pay for his mother's nursing home care. He works at a colonial theme park, but this does not cover all his bills. So, then, how does he make his money?<br /><br />He fakes choking.<br /><br />But still, choking does not lead to money. Or does it? The people who save him now feel semi-responsible for him, and write him letters, send cards, or make phone calls to see how he is doing. It is then that he milks these people for everything he can. He tells them about upcoming surgery, or how he has to have wisdom teeth pulled, etc. and cannot pay for it. These people then send him money and support him. He makes his rounds through several restaurants in the area and makes enough money to pay for his mother's care, his rent, and everything else he needs.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Victor has flashbacks from his childhood. You find out that his scamming persona is something he inherited from his mother. You read about his sexual addiction. He falls for a girl... one who is not who she says she is. And you meet his best friend, fellow sex addict, and co-worker, and his own personal addiction.<br /><br />This was a great book. It is very well written and carefully planned out. I am excited to read the rest of his books!
B0039M41X8|4.0|I haven't heard the Japanese import, because although I'm a fan of the Scorps I'm not paying $30 more for one song!  But, there's some various info going on about what is and isn't \\"bonus tracks\\" I thought I'd clarify.  The European release has 12 tracks, I consider this the 'album\\" proper.  The US release shorts you one track - don't buy the 11-track edition; it shouldn't be too hard to find the 12-track edition at a regular price (maybe go to amazon UK, that's what I did).  So, the Japanese edition only has one bonus track \\"Thunder & Lightning\\".  \\"The Best is Yet To Come\\" is on all editions, despite the Amazon description here - it's \\"Let's Rock\\" that's not on the US version.  I actually think the album would've been fine without \\"the Best Is Yet To Come\\" - not because it's a bad song, but because the second half of the album is ballad-heavy!  All editions have 4 ballads, so the American version alternates a ballad for every rocker on the second half, while the Euro (12-song) edition mixes one more rocker and this helps the pace a bit.  If the American version had omitted a ballad instead of a rocker, the album would've been improved even more.         Aside from that, the album is pretty much representative of the Scorpion's usual good-time-rock-n-roll/metal sound of the past 30 years (unlike albums like \\"Humanity Hour I\\" or \\"Eye II Eye\\" where they strayed from their usual sound), so if you like their other albums you should like this and if you didn't like the other ones this one won't change your mind.       Some people have commented on the lyrics - there's some cheesy/poppy lyrics (\\"yo, yo, I gotta go . . .\\"), but it's not like the Scorps are one of the bands I look to for great lyrics; they can still hardly speak English after 38 years of singing in it!  There are some outside songwriters on this album, but unlike \\"Humanity Hour I\\", they don't water down the \\"Scorpions\\" sound of the album - it's more like \\"Face The Heat\\" in that regard, and overall youfeel like the Scorps had the main writing influence here (or, at least, the outside songwriters were trying to write in a Scorpions feel).

B002ZG98J6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The integration of greek mythology into modern times was great.  I thought the story line was great and the action was superb.  Also all the cgi creatures looked great.  If your a fan of harry potter, or lord of the rings, you will enjoy this movie.

160094048X|5.0|What an amzing, cute little cookbook!  I actually took this book out of the library, and after leafing through it, and baking a few recipes from it (the oatmeal cookies and the chai spice shortbread), I'm going to buy it as soon as I have the funds. I'm an avid baker/cook, and have fallen in love with Isa and Terry and the amazing recipes they've brought to the vegan world.    The photos in the book are great...I've gotten used to using cookbooks without photos, but I have to say, nothing beats actually SEEING what the end result is supposed to look like....plus, the photos just make you hungry and want to bake more. ;)    I absolutely recommend this book...and believe me, no non-vegan is going to know these are vegan!     BUY THIS BOOK!!! :)
B0028SVXR6|4.0|I have always been very impressed by this band, but I've never been able to REALLY get into them. I already had Deloused and Francis, parts of which I really loved, but I was never able to like it enough to give the albums consecutive repeat listens. A once through every long once in a while would wet my whistle, many times not even finishing the album. I wanted to make a compilation album and forget the rest, but I never got around to it. I can't really say much about their other albums because I have never given them a chance. I stumbled across a review of Octahedron, not even knowing it had been released. Reading that this album had \\"went acoustic\\" immediately struck my interest because it has always been their softer, calmer songs that really grabbed me. It is without a doubt that this is the Mars Volta album I've been waiting for. Not only does it get played all the way through, but I've not been album to stop. I've been playing it almost once a day for a month and I love it more with each listen. Yes, it utilizes more acoustic than ever before, but it is still full of electricity. I'm not sure what my problems were with their past efforts. I'll be the first to admit I obviously didn't \\"get it\\" as a whole, but the magical moments were many and they kept me interested. Now that I'm hooked on Octahedron, I definitely need to revisit the past.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock is a favorite actress of mine. Therefore I might be a bit biased, but I think this is one of the best (or maybe I should just say my personal favorite) movies made in the past couple years. A very fresh comedy. Plus, you have Betty White. How can you go wrong? Betty White is phenomenal. When this came out, I was obsessed wit the Golden Girls, so it was perfect. The ending is superb.
0316067938|3.0|I have just finished reading all four books but will post only my review of Breaking Dawn.     *spoilers if you are, like me, a latecomer and haven't read it yet*    1.I was scratching my head about how Bella got pregnant at all, since it was established in earlier books that vampires can't even  produce tears, much less sperm. And not only does she have a baby, she has a super advanced baby that talks, walks, and has teeth before she's a month old. Oh well, if you're going to change things, might as well go all the way.  2. Bella becomes a vampire, ironically just as she had decided that she would like to remain human a little bit longer. She also turns out to be the most graceful, the most restrained, the most refined, the most gifted vampire of all. Enter Mary Sue Bella Swan Cullen.  3. I am convinced that Forks, Washington, is the home of all golf announcers since the populace is incapable of vocalizing in anything other than mutters, mumbles, and whispers.   4. Charlie Swan can swallow anything, no matter how earth-shattering, just so long as it's served up with a basketball game on TV. This is the same man who had a fit because Bella got a motorcycle.  5. What was with the big buildup with the Big Bad Volturi, only to be concluded with \\"oh well, that's okay then\\" and they all go home leaving Edwella to live happily ever after. And ever and ever.  6. What, exactly, has Bella sacrificed to become a vampire? All the endless talk and speculation on this subject in the previous books, only to have everything tied up neatly with a big pink ribbon so she could, after all, have her happily ever after.  But with that said, I found the book an entertaining read. I think you will too.
0446608955|4.0|This book was so good! I'm not a big crier when I read books but this one i almost did. So touching! I saw the middle and end of the movie and knew I had to get the book! In my opinion the movie might have been a little better because the book was a little slow moving. Other then that this book is a must read for anyone a teen or above. .....love Nicholas Sparks and this is one of my favorites. :)
B002ZG983M|5.0|When I saw the trailers when this movie was at the theaters I thought this might be an entertaining young adult movie and so I added it to my to rent list. Had I known how entertaining I would have made a now rare visit to my local theater to enjoy this with an audience when it first released. Most kids and even some adults still have the dream of making a difference whether doning a costume or just helping their community in some way. The story here is compelling and like the music starts at a slow tempo as we are introduced first to \\"Kick-Ass\\", well portrayed by Aaron Johnson. He is a high school student that finally gets tired of bullies and decides to take steps to not only improve his own self-esteem but assist others that are afraid to take a stand. On his first mission to save a lost cat he drops literally into three men beating up another. His fight to defend the single man from the gang is painful for him and lands him it the hospital with broken bones but it is posted on all the usual hot amateur video sites and he becomes famous overnight.<br /><br />This stardom catches the attention of \\"Hit Girl\\", remarkably done by Chloe Moretz (some superbly choreagraphed scenes make her larger than life), and \\"Big Daddy\\", well played by Nicolas Cage (purposely overacted while in hero mode is good acting not bad), that have been more reclusive and deadlier against criminals. When they save Kick-Ass from certain death a bond is formed against crime. The choreography and stunts of the fight scenes are phenomenal and the music is fantastic (the CD will be a huge hit I'm sure). As the story unfolds we find out that Big Daddy not only was falsely accused of drug trafficing while he was a police officer but he ends up in jail and his wife commits suicide. Fortunately their daughter is born with her death. When Big Daddy gets out of prison he vows to avenge his wife, and he enlists the aid of his very young daughter on his quest. Enter the villains son, Red Mist, that convinces his father to get him some gear to impress Kick-Ass so that he can lure him into a trap. The events that transpire after this build to an incredible climax that is suspenseful and exhilarating.<br /><br />I won't spoil things for you with any more of the details but there are some absolutely hysterical/bloody scenes that will quite possibly have you laughing and crying with joy. Anyone that feels overly offended by vigilantes may be disturbed. Although I'm not saying I condone it, how can I possibly condone what criminals do to the innocent public? Keep in mind everyone has been exposed to far worse on the news every day. I highly recommend this to anyone that can appreciate unconventional heroes and can stomach some bloody killing scenes. The DVD has excellent quality picture and sound with a few extras. Superb story, casting, directing, choreography, stunts, camera work, costumes, music, and special effects.

0061714372|5.0|Dave is just a man. It comes through loud and clear in this book where he lays bare all his brokenness and mistakes over the years. It has all the drugs, sex, and rock n' roll that such a book should have but the tone is completely unexpected.     Dave tells his story from a place of deep humility, some regret, and a thankfulness that he's still alive. I thoroughly enjoyed it and appreciated the honesty throughout. Whether or not you are a metal fan, its worth the read.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Rent is one if thee best Broadway shows I've ever seen. A truly life changing show of our generation. Turning it into a movie for millions to experience for years to come was just miraculous! I was very happy to see most of the original cast members; it made the movie experience so much more real for me. Just incredible; a must see for all. Real life issues brought out with amazing music.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|In the vein of F. Scott Fitzgerald this is a study of life under unusual circumstances. Like in his other novels Fitzgerald has put people into extraordinary situations. The director and tech teams have delivered this unique story to the screen in spectacular fashion....without losing the humanity of the original story. After the first couple of scenes you stop trying to spot the special make-up and effects and just enjoy the waves of emotion evoked by the players. Highly recommended.

B0028NSE3M|5.0|Hearing Hot Buttered Soul for the first time draws some amazing contradictions about Issac Hayes. Hayes spent much of the 1960s at Stax, writing stripped soul hits for guys like Sam and Dave. The epitome of southern grit and its most famous Memphis label.<br /><br />But if the late 1960s planted the seeds for art rock, why not art soul. This hot buttered take on the genre takes music that made up the best singles of the 1960s and turns it into a lush, spacious hub of sound.<br /><br />In a sense, the emphasis here is not on writing. There were four tracks when this came out in 1969, and though one of the best American songwriters, Hayes wrote only two. Hot Buttered Soul is about expanding what can be done with songs: sonically, texturally.<br /><br />Hayes kicks off the album with Burt Bacharach's \\"Walk On By.\\" Last anybody heard, this was a nice bossa Dione Warwick took to the charts. Hayes rips and reassembles limb from limb--turning \\"Walk On By\\" into a dark, brooding, orchestral fuzz guitar symphony. Never had soul music been so frighteningly epic, a departure point for such daring experimentation. And it sounds as revolutionary in 2010 as it did in 1969. The rave up that ends the track is alone a unique invention.<br /><br />\\"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedellmystic\\"-wow that was not easy- shows Hayes able to take this epic soul approach, and with circular buzz saw guitar, make it stomp hard has Hendrix. Lushness with steel teeth. And though \\"One Women\\" shows Hayes able to make what would have been a perfect single, Jimmy Webbs \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" done by Hayes is a precursor to rap.<br /><br />Not many picked up on the massive mandate Hot Buttered put in front of soul. Had they, soul would have been all over progressive FM radio in 1969.  That never happened, and it was not until the mid 1970s that bands like Funkadelic and Earth Wind and Fire,  really started to explore soul on this grand a scale.<br /><br />But talk about a leap off the tight rope, Hot Buttered Soul is still one of the most revolutionary albums far too few people know aboutonary albums far too few people know about
0439023483|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down! I started reading it around 8PM a couple evenings ago, and only put it down because I had to get to sleep. The next day I read for 35 minutes over my lunch break (another 40 pages), and last night I finished the book.    For some reason, when reading about Katniss, I kept picturing Saoirse Ronan's character in \\"The City of Ember\\" movie.    I've just pre-ordered the Kindle, but it won't ship for a few weeks. So I have to decide... do I buy the second book in the trilogy now... or do I wait for my Kindle to show up and get the Kindle edition...?
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Unbelievable dry brittish humor if you like that sort of thing.  Very very funny.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This is the first CD in a while that made me stop what I was doing to listen. I haven't heard a sound like this in a while, and the message threw me back to the good days when lyrics mattered. Nas has the perfect flow to complement each track and Damian Marley did the best job with production and sound. Great CD. Go get it immediately.
B002ZG9788|4.0|I saw the original back in the 80's with the bad acting and silly SP effects. This movies CGI were excellent, acting was also decent, even Sam W. acting was better in this movie as I have thought he was quite bland in Avatar and Terminator. The story is quick and if you don't pay attention it goes right by you, as  the CGI affects take hold. A must see on a big screen to appreciate it more. Over all a decent remake, one thing I loved in this one, was the fact Perseus picks up the Golden Owl, which I hated in the Original and one of the soldiers says to him, ah you don't want to take that it is best to leave it behind. LOL   Too me a much more enjoyable film than I thought it was going to be.
B001TI7DG6|3.0|Unfortunately my copy (bought for daughter in last year of school - book mandatory for advanced English studies) was missing 7 chapters.    Unfortunately again - the 7 chapters missing form the book are of course the ones that the students are discussing and reviewing.    Unfortunately - and what a pain in the neck - I need to go and buy another copy of this book - one with the 7 chapters included.     I'll buy it in a real book store so I can check that the chapters are included.    Daughter (17 yrs) said the book was a pretty good read even if a chunk of it was missing. She really didn't understand the ending though - not until it was discussed at school.    My advice is to buy this book from another publisher.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|I've loved Kylie Minogue since i heard the fever album but Aphrodite catches her at her  absolute peak thanks in big part to master dance producer stuart price.  Aphrodite bursts with positive messages on finding your greatest love (all the lovers),  finding love when your other half won't give you what you need (get outta my way),  the joy and overwhelming ecstacy of finding that explosive kind of love that's almost too much  to handle (too much), affirmations of power and strength (aphrodite), and celebrating life and love with  everything you got (put your hands up).  The Messages lay perfectly on a bed of infectious melodies ranging from the bach flavored hypnotic vibe of \\"closer\\" to the euro dance stomp groove of \\"put your hands up\\" to the dance pop euphoria of \\"too much\\" to the edgy rnb flavored \\"Aphrodite\\".  Kylie doesn't worry about wearing her pokerface though lady gaga's type of dance drama is fun too but Kylie is set on celebrating who she is and recognizing that she's fierce and powerful but full of life and love.  She's Aphrodite and she wants you to be free to express yourself, to dance your cares away, and to live life to its fullest.  It is musical and lyrical prozac that to me is the most fun dance album of the year.  All hail the return of Kylie!    Oscar F.
B003O85W3A|4.0|I loved Funeral and thought Neon Bible was very good.  I have listened to this numerous times since its release and so far it feels like a classic.  I hear new things every time---the songs are complex, nuanced, and beautiful.      Some of the other reviews on here are driving me nuts.  These run the gamut from pretentious reviews comparing this band to the second coming of Alternative Music (i.e., exaggerated hyperbole) to reviews that rip them for being derivative of other bands (there is even a positive review on here that compares every song to other bands...\\"this song is U2 meets REM\\", \\"this is Springsteen and New Order\\" etc.).      The fact is, ALL bands are influenced by their peers (and by music they grew up with and loved).  There really is NO completely original music around anymore free of all previous influences (not sure that there ever was!).  So for me to point out that Arcade Fire rips some of their chord progressions right out of Pixies songs or that Win Butler at times sounds like a cross between David Bowie, Black Francis (Frank Black), and David Byrne...well, what's the point? The fact is, Arcade Fire are currently one of the most eclectic and ambitious bands around.  I like how they can take what sounds like a simple pop song on the surface (\\"Modern Man\\", for instance) and fill it up with meaning and pathos and lots of little musical touches.  And I love how they are respectful of their influences---yes, there are many nods to new wave bands of the 80's on here---but no, they are NOT derivative.      This album is probably a tad long, but its hard to complain when the music is this good.  The songs have been dancing in my head for days and, just like Funeral, I am guessing that the meaning and depth behind them will continue to emerge over time.  These guys really write songs that get into your subconscious---I mean, right now all I have to do is think of the movie \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" and I can immediately hear the music and words for \\"Wake Up\\" in my head.      If you have any appreciation at all for their past work, get this album---it's a good one.

B001HIJYR4|5.0|Saw this movie at the theatre and buying a copy for home ownership.<br />Awesome action, wonderful CGI, and the plot ties all the elements together perfectly.<br />For those seeking more depth or character development, go watch one of those 3 hour long flicks filled with emotion, diatribe, and values.<br />If you want a good dose of an underdog coming into his own this is one good film to see.<br /><br />The office worker turned assassin storyline probably appeals to some of the people who are cubicle dwellers who do their tedious jobs just to put food on the table.  Also it takes one to have the soul of an eternal adolescent to appreciate it as well.<br />If you are a fan of being an 'adult' and thereby putting 'age limits' on certain practices and feeling that people should 'grow up' then this movie may not be something you want to watch repeatedly.<br /><br />But if like me, you are bored with having to adhere to stuffy and inefficient rules and standards of the modern world, then this movie is a perfect escape.<br /><br />I also recommend Hitman as a companion movie.
0756405890|5.0|I am not a big fantasy genre reader, though I do read a half dozen or so titles from this genre in any given year.    My 25+ year old nephew suggested this book and I downloaded it to my kindle.  I had to force myself to put my kindle down to go to work the next day after waking up at 3am to continue reading where I left off when I fell asleep the previous evening.    Rich characters, an intriguing world and rich but readable prose made this book a true pleasure and have me eagerly awaiting the next book in the series due in March, 2011.    It is simply the best fantasy book I have read in this decade.  I have not been so hooked by a fantasy series since Donaldson's original Chronicles of Thomas Covenant.

B001C3KCSY|5.0|As usual the Kings have created an entirely new sound! An amazing CD!A lot of energy and filled with great ballads as well as rocking songs. I wish they would've made \\"Frontier City\\" and \\"Beneath The Surface\\" actual songs ON the album, it would've been sweet. But what they put on the album was still amazing! The order of the songs is perfect and makes it easy to listen to from beginning to end.
6300182819|5.0|My son enjoyed the movie.  He loves the story and the music.  He likes music from that era and it was a fun movie to watch.  He has watched it several times.  It came when it was supposed to and he was very pleased with it.
B0002XMF5I|3.0|I'm a huge Sabbath fan (my favorite band ever), and also a huge Deep Purple fan.  So naturally, I was very excited when this album first came out.  I bought it on vinyl and was very disappointed.  It seems that the music tracks and vocal tracks were laid down with very little collaboration.  Somehow, Ozzy could make that work, but Ian fails with the vocals on this album.  Also, the guitar riffs from Tony are not up to par, with the exception of \\"Trashed\\".  There's a reason why Gillian only made one album with Sabbath before leaving - listen to the album, it's obvious.

The list of incredible songs on this include \\"wicker man\\", \\"brave new world\\", \\"blood brothers\\", \\"sign of the cross\\", \\"dream of mirrors\\", \\"fear of the dark\\", \\"number of the beast\\", \\"hallowed be thy name\\" and others...

0307474712|5.0|At the very beginning of the story, Emma Morley declares she wants to change the world in some way-even if it's just a part of the world she inhabits. At the same time, she makes an uncomfortable prediction for the beautiful boy she's just spent the night making out with: Dexter will meet 40 with every possible cliche fit for a vain, superficial entitled man like himself. Does Emma's dreams of making a difference come true? Yes, but in a much more personal,moving way than she ever imagined - and in a way that might save her self destructive friend from such a dreary mid-life forecast. This is an easy, fast read - I read it in one day. Don't let that easiness fool you though. Some argue the story borders on maudlin, others are accusing it of being chick lit. I call bs on both charges. This is a high concept story by all means, but it's the writing, and the characters that cause this novel to transcend such limiting descriptions. These characters feel real, their relationship ups and downs feel so real too.  This is an engaging, emotionally honest story about two characters you can't hope but root for, even when you feel like smacking them on the head at the same time.

0140120416|3.0|The New Penguin Russian Course: A Complete Course for Beginners by Nicholas J. Brown is right in line with previous language texts in that once material is introduced, the author can then move on.  This assumes, of course, that you totally assimilated every bit of what has so far been introduced.  Or should I use the dreaded \\"M\\" word?  ( Memorized )      For example, all past language books I have encountered had the alphabet on one of the first pages. Once introduced, it then employed the alphabet AS IF you already knew it without any teaching/learning activities.  The assumption is, don't go to page 2 until this alphabet is ingrained like your mother's telephone number. For those with Memorize-itis, this would just about be as far as you would get in learning this new language unless you had been imprisoned by the KGB and this was the only book you had access to.     The language I am learning is Russian.  I have been working on it during spare moments for about 1.5 years and have even taken the first class at a local Community College.  With that background, I am much more appreciative of this book than perhaps I would be if this were my first introduction and I was truly a beginner.     What are the advantages of this text?  First, I got the paperback, so it is much lighter. Next, Mr. Brown does not start with a listing of the alphabet, but rather immediately breaks it down into sections and creates a \\"teachable moment\\" by giving you starter vocabulary WHILE you are learning how to pronounce the letters. He gets points for this.    He also explains some oddities about the alphabet like, \\"The soft sign\\" and \\"The Hard sign\\" in a way that I could understand better than my teacher and the text we were using and guidebooks that I had been using previously. More points.    After he has explained all of the letters with the starter vocabulary, he then lists the whole alphabet, with pronunciation guides in dictionary order. And more points.  Next there are practice exercises!  Next there are some emergency \\"signs\\" like toilet, post office, pull....things that are very necessary to know and pictures of some of them. More points.    Next he introduces a short list of words that have the same sound in English as in Russian. Once you employ the sounds of the Russian letters, what comes out of your mouth is the same name as you would use in English.  It is just spelled differently.     I have not gone through the book to evaluate the next important feature of any teaching text: concomitant learning.  That is, once I have mastered the things in chapter one, does the structure and speed of chapter two and succeeding chapters move me along because it builds on my previous learning?  Or is it completely new stuff which puts me back on page one and back into memorizing mode?  I leave that for another reviewer.    So, with a little experience, this book makes excellent sense as a supplement.  For the memorizers of the world, I should think it would make acquiring Russian easier than with previous texts.  But for the beginner without assistance and without a terrific memory it still may not be their cup of chai.

1577311523|3.0|I'm thankful that the Lord placed this book in my hands. I've been studying enlightenment and Eastern mysticism for over 20 years and never quite understood it. You know the old saying: \\"When the student is ready the teacher will appear.\\" I'm thankful for this book. It made enlightenment simple. End all the distractions, be in the moment. The mind is the problem, misusing the mind, drawing upon memory, projecting it into the future. The egoic separate self-sense. Use the mind responsibly, in a balanced and practical sense. Learn to feel and think, that is, to be in the moment. It is the moment that is important, not the endless distraction of what I have to do tomorrow, but managing my responsibilities here and now. If you want to know the secret to enlightenment, something these spiritual teachers never mention, read the book \\"The Benefits of Marijuana\\" by Joan Bello. It is my hope more of these spiritual teachers will just come out and tell everyone the truth. Using Marijuana prudently and in the spiritual sense makes enlightenment simple and easy. It's most likely the best therapy in the world, when used responsibly, and I'm usually not one to advocate using drugs. Use it prudently and if possible do it legally for medical purposes. It's going to take awhile for peoples perceptions to change. The law against it is ridiculous. Having said this, in my opinion, Eckhart Tolle is not as spiritually enlightened as he may think. He is extremely arrogant. He lacks real dimension to his depth. I contribute that to his theology. He does incredible violence to conventional Christian theology. If he would avoid that he would be fine. He doesn't have the ability yet to integrate difficult ideas or contradictions. To him, it's Either/Or but not Both/And. Our connection to life in the present moment is important, but it is also important to retain individuality and the diversity of life. This is impossible to do from a panentheisic point of view. It says I can save myself. Frommy experience, this is not possible. This only leads to arrogance and pride. It could be said, that we have two responsibilities in life, to develop self-knowledge (Know thyself), and when we are ready, to accept a personal relationship with God, and receive His grace. So much more awaits us when we do. We are creatures, created beings, we are not God, we have to accept that and humbly submit to His will. Eckhart Tolle's God is impersonal; he derives his suppositions from this core belief. Of course, you will never hear him say that. He describes everything with absolute certainty. What arrogance. As created beings, we really don't know anything. It's all speculation. Humility is a virtue. His description of what I believe to be one-half of the truth of life is correct \\"in my opinion,\\" that is the present moment, but until he grows up and relinquishes his underlying core supposition about God, he won't be ready to be infused with God's grace. Pray frequently, and rely on God for everything, giving Him all the glory. Grace is greater than self-knowledge. We need them both, having the right perspective, and being able to measure by degree. Self-knowledge is wonderful, but being infused with the love and grace of God is beyond words. Only tears of joy. I hope you will keep an open-mind.
0525951652|5.0|For a 1000 page book, I should probably rename this review \\"Tome Zone\\" or something fitting. \\"Fall of Giants\\" is a good advertisement for owning a Kindle!<br /><br />However, Follett's new part one of a trilogy, \\"Fall of Giants,\\" is easily read and discussed, though the heft of it might hold some readers back.  His fans from his previous series (\\"Pillars of the Earth\\") know what to expect and won't be daunted. In this new series, he takes on World War I in England, Wales, Russia, France, Germany and the U.S. with stops in Poland and Switzerland.<br /><br />Although the first five pages before the narrative begins seem overwhelming just because they list a hundred characters or so, Follett deftly pulls us into the lives of Welsh miners, the Lords (and ladies, and not-so-ladylike ladies) of London, the factories of St. Petersburg, and the White House.<br /><br />We follow the women's movement to achieve the vote in England as the unlikely pairing of a lady, Maud, and a housemaid, Ethel, begin working together on a newspaper. We worry about the fellows on the Front as the world disintegrates into war. Follett brings us into the negotiations and counter-offers that could have prevented the war through the characters of Fitz and Dewar, but as things explode, Fitz is in the trenches and the miner Billy is as well.<br /><br />The only part of the book that fell flat for me was the dialog among the revolutionary leaders, Lenin, Trotsky, et. al. I liked Grigori's part and his sly, less-than-honest brother, Lev.<br /><br />It is a lot to ask a reader to forge on through a 1000 pages of history and story, but Follett pulls it off, leaving us waiting eagerly for volume 2. I am glad the effort the author put into this book paid off for the reader with excitement, humanity, and historical enrichment.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|This Trio is Amazing. I'm going to own their Discography Soon. This is easily my favorite album, a close second would be HAARP (Their live Album from Wembley Stadium), and Third Would be Black Holes and Revelations.  The group puts out such a well trained sound it's astounding. All their albums are must buys in my opinion.
0743487486|5.0|Only if I could get my wife to read this book. I think the title of this book is a little bit misleading in a sense that people might shy away from getting this amazing book thinking \\"ha! another parenting book telling us to spoil our children\\".<br /><br />If you have kids, you SHOULD read this book. The author's arguments are so logical that you cannot deny them. Everything he talks about in this book hit me hard and made me rethink about how I should raise my kids.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor. Read this book now.
B003K025V4|3.0|This CD is not for the Hannah Montana crowd, it's got a rough edge and is clearly a wish on her part to bring an end to her link with the blond wig.  That said, she might just have a career in the more adult music world if she can distance herself far enough from Hannah, but her core fan base is associated with the character and she probably should have done one more CD like her previous one that got her younger fans use to newer music. Actually looking at the talent in her age group she's probably one of the more talented, and this CD is fine for the young adult fan.

B002TZS5GU|4.0|Another \\"everyone's dead or sick\\" film. Two guys and two girls going to an old beach house while trying to avoid the effected. It was a little slow at times but had some good scenses. I like Piper Perabo from Coyote Ugly, so thats the main reason I got the film. It could have been better though but i'd watch it again.
B000R209NY|4.0|I saw the original movie of the Poseidon and this movie was a enjoyable remake of the original movie.  Of course with Blu-ray it made me feel like I was on the ship with them.  It was a good movie that I could look at again.
0783225482|5.0|What a great film with such good people in it. Meryl Streep is great like always and Goldie Hawn is funny as well. Isabella Rossellini is also good in this. I didn't even recongize her from \\"Blue Velvet.\\" Death Becomes Her is really funny and wicked. The two ladies both die but come back to life with different problems and Bruce Willis is the guy caught in the middle of it all. There is nothing bad I can say about \\"death.\\" It's a must see film. When I saw it in the store when I was younger, I always thought it was a horror film. Boy was I real off about that.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|In this film we can both see and feel the thoughts and actions that a remarkable dog takes throughout his extraordinary life.      At first the human characters may appear to take a back seat during the proceedings in this seemingly quiet film, but then one realizes it is the protagonist Hachi, telling his story.  A momentary quirk of fate occurs that appears as a loss to all except one.  Hachi: A Dogs Tale is a very special picture about an unbreakable bond that transcends time and space.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I think almost everyone's fav. hero in this film was hit-girl. Who can blame them? She's cool, funny, and dangerous. Kick-Ass is a great action film about people wanting to be superheros and the few who actually do. The action is wilded and the main nerdy guy who pretends to be gay so he can hang with the girl he wants who always wanted a gay friend was funny. Nicolas Cage is good as the \\"batman\\" hero and the dude from Superbad who played the evil guy was good too. It has a great opening and the film doesn't let up at all.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|For this kind of music, only humility exists. My only contribution to this thread would be the following: please tell me out there, you listening folks to the culture of music that we love, when will this wisdom enter our places and beyond.......?    Oh, by the way, who will be the fool that gives this album lower than the five star album it always deserves.....? Bless the Waters......
B00005JNTX|5.0|An all-star cast in one of the best films ever made. You have to be high to not like this film. It has 3 or four stories that are not hard to follow at all. The action is hardcore and the ladies of Old Town are capital H-O-T. One thing I love is the black and white of the film and how only certain things are in color. Like a red dress, golden hair, blue eyes, and so forth. Just certain features of people and places are in color, which is really cool. Sin City is one of those films that will never get boring or forgotten.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Compelling bio of some interesting characters.  Amazing how so many turned a blind eye to this fiasco.
B002ZG9788|2.0|Clash of the Titans is an overally stupid movie with neither the story or good special effects to match wits with its other fantasy movie counterparts, such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. In a LOTR type fashion this is an adventure story involving a group of characters out to perform a mission, which I forget. Liam Neeson plays the \\"God\\" character (who is pretty screwed up himself), but never really does much for the story. Scenes are flat, dialogue is profoundly stupid, the musical score is elementary, and it has one of the stupidest endings in history.   This is just bad overall, no need to go into details. People these days think they can just toss a bunch of special effects in and they're set. The only thing redeeming about this flick was the main character's hot mom.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Who would dare to go into the same hell to reunite with his wife and children? Just a loving father who losted too much, start a ride through an amazing adventure to recover his family...Robin Williams simply beautiful as always, this movie will take you to paradise like a rollercoaster thorugh hell...Love it!
0671027344|5.0|This book is right up there with The Chocolate War and 1984.  It's emotional, truthful, hard hitting, even a lot educational.  The main character is an easy kid to identify with.  The family is a typical family with problems just like everyone else.  The best coming of age story since The Catcher in The Rye.
B001QB9H1K|4.0|if you iked the firts 2 transporters strap in for the final instalment. This movie was the best of the series the car is better and even the villins are better. Best of all the detective is in the series again as well only this time he isnt trying to bust Frank. this would be a must see if you like Jason Statham.

B00006AUIG|5.0|At first I thought that this movie would be a scary ghost movie and while it does have a touch of supernatural suspense it's actually more of a psychological mind game type of movie but don't let that discourage you.  The basis of the movie has five cleaners contracted by the city to renovate an old sanitarium that has gone to disuse through the years with an added bonus they'll get for doing the job within the week thanks to their boss who is at the edge of loosing his business before the job came his way.  As the workers clean up the asylum one of them discovers a forgotten package with recorded sessions with a former patient of the hospital, and as we listen with him during these sessions we also see the situation that starts to happen with the other workers throughout the job especially the boss who seems to have a dark situation happen that he wishes to keep secret from the others and that slowly consumes him.  The storyline and actors for the movie were pretty good and while you won't see the CGI effects of ghosts an such there will be scenes that will cause you to jump from time to time but again the movie isn't really a ghost or true supernatural horror movie you see like House on Haunted Hill or Ghost Ship so if you're expecting that kind of movie than this one probably isn't for you.  Still for the entertainment value of the movie I do suggest to at least give it a try you might just enjoy it much to your surprise...
B003L45JLW|4.0|Great new album, love the variety: one question on the .flac download. Should I be able to burn this to a cd-r to listen to on any cd player? I made an audio copy, but all I get is silence. I've done this with other .flac files in the past, but I wonder if these are copy-protected?
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I just finished the 4th book in the Twilight series.  I try to read many different types of books and I'm a woman in my mid 50's so not a kid.  I thought the last book was entertaining and I liked the ending.  I have read reviews from people complaining about the happy ending, how this never would have happened or that never would have happened.  Good god-get over it people!  Ever ready Harry Potter?  Do you think that people actually can fly around on brooms and pictures can talk?  As far as not liking the happy ending?  I loved it. Life is full of tragedy and pain that is on the news eveyday.  Happy endings are nice.  Life is tough sometimes and books are a way to escape to a different place where the rules don't apply and good will sometimes overcome evil.  Lighten up and enjoy!

B003K1EYM6|5.0|If you are on vacation and want to view or share the pictures on your camera, the iPad Camera Connection Kit makes it very easy to import pictures from your camera, an SD card, or a thumb drive.  You get two adapters that plug into the iPad's dock connector.  One adapter provides an SD/SDHC card reader for the iPad. You can just take the memory card out of your phone or camera and the iPad can access and import the pictures.  You can even delete the images from the camera after importing them into the iPad.  It supports JPEG, TIFF, and many RAW formats.    The second adapter provides a USB port for the iPad.  This was designed for cameras or phones with a USB cable so that you could access the pictures without taking out the memory card.  This adapter has an undocumented benefit of also working with USB keyboards.  If you connect a USB keyboard, the iPad will display a message about the device being unsupported, but the keyboard will work anyways.      You can also hook up a \\"thumb drive\\" to the USB port.  The iPad will be looking for files in a root folder named DCIM and if you have other images or even videos (in formats supported by the iPad), they can be imported in as well.  If your camera uses Compact Flash cards or other types of memory, you can plug a USB card reader into the connector and bring the images in that way.  You can even connect an iPhone using the standard dock cable to the USB adapter to import pictures taken on the iPhone.    The biggest drawback is that all of the pictures go into a single gallery.  It would have been nice if the iPad could let you create or specify another folder for the pictures.    Since posting this review, Apple released iOS 4.2.1 for the iPad.  While that update added much needed functionality to the iPad, they cut the power going out to the USB connector. Prior to iOS 4.2.1, the iPad supported devices that could draw up to 100ma of power.  This covered thumb drives, Skype headsets, and USB keyboards.  With 4.2.1, thatpower dropped to 20ma.  Just enough to read an SD card or connect a digital camera.  If you want to hook up a device that needs more power, you would need to get a powered USB hub and connect that to your iPad.  That takes some of the functionality out of the adapter.
B002ZG9788|2.0|I got to see it in 3D and even that was bad.<br />The first one was great. It had quality actors, decent effects for the time, a great plot. This remake has none of those things. They spent their entire budget on effects then hired a writer a director, and actors with whatever change they found in the seat cushions of their casting couch.<br /><br />That, for all those like me who were wondering, is how Sam Worthington landed such a potentially awesome roll as leading man. The guy has no personality. He has potential though. I saw that when he was in AVATAR but only because James Cameron is such a phenomenal director and can take unknown talent and get the best from them. This director only wanted a decent looking guy who can swing a sword. That's what he got. So I guess in that sense Sam Worthington did the best of what was expected of him.<br /><br />In the first movie  the hero rescues the fair maiden ,does his best even when faced with insurmountable odds, never gave up even when times were at their worst, he loved and lived life to the fullest with what little time he thought he may have left in the world with his girl. You know hero type stuff.<br /><br />The remake was basically revenge and oh yeah if you got some spare time could you save the girl who you care nothing about if it isn't too much trouble. The justice isn't even exacted properly Hades kills Perseus' family. So he wants to kill Hades right back but he can't do that because Hades is a God and can't be killed. Yet the movie suggests that the gods can fade away into nothingness if no one fears them. Which sounds like some kind of twisted Tinkerbell rule to me. So all Perseus achieves after this huge quest is send Hades back to his home in the underworld. Basically go to bed without supper kind of punishment. LAME!!<br /><br />The effects were good except for the riding giant scorpions like elephants scene, which was just stupid. The girl they cast as IO Gemma Arterton was super cute and showed some decent acting ability and the only reason I gave this turdball of a film an extra star. I would watch the movie again if it were on HBO just to see her.<br /><br />Because the movie was PG-13 Medusa wears a leather top yet the Medusa in the first PG rated family version is topless both are fake animated monsters so I didn't get the reason for that move. Not that seeing snake lady boobs are my thing. Just an interesting factoid<br /><br /> I say wait until it comes on cable don't buy it and don't rent itreason I gave this turdball of a film an extra star.

0061906220|5.0|We love this book - my Granddaughter loves reading it and singing the story as well.  A fun book.
1439148953|5.0|My husband bought this on a business trip but didn't get a chance to read it. Even though he paid full price, I was glad he discovered it.<br /><br />Brooklyn was absolutely delightful. Unobtrusive and subtle, Toibin writes the story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish girl. Arranged by her mother and sister, Eilis leaves her small town and family to emigrate to America in the mid-twentieth century. She is sponsored by a priest who finds her work and a room in Brooklyn. There she finds love, an education and a future. But the lure of home is strong and she must finally decide for herself what her future will be.<br /><br />The most wonderful thing about the book is the naive and sweet yet complex character of Eilis.<br /><br />Reading this book is like sitting in the cozy front room and listening to a grandmother tell her story. There is nothing flashy about this book. It simply rings true.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Definitely an \\"on the edge of your seat show.\\"  So full of suspense you really cannot miss any part.  Too bad the network doesn't know a good show when they see it.
B003ODL004|5.0|The Score does exactly what it was intended to do. It draws the listener into the dream that is Inception. If you set aside the previous scores by Zimmer and the scores of other composers and listen to it for what it is, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy it. It doesn't take a great effort to expose the flaws in a musical composition especially if you are looking for them. That said i think if you are willing to listen to the complex simplicity of this score for what it is then you will find that it is more enjoyable than maybe you expected it to be at first. In the end a Score is meant only to empower a cinematic experience. If you get more than that it is extra. If you take it for what its worth i think you will find that this score does just that. It transports you the listener back into the dream that is Inception. I don't know about you but i personally enjoyed the experience of Inception. The Score only extends that experience past the theatre. For that i am more than satisfied with my purchase.

I have every album, books of all kinds about this band.

B003TOH8AE|5.0|This movie is worth watching just for the Hit Girl fight scenes, but it has so much more. The characters are all what you'd expect for their roles, and are well played. Wonderfully entertaining, I watched it 3 times back to back, just to see what i'd missed the first two :p
0525423842|5.0|I had grown tired of John Grisham's formula court room books, but this book intrigued me with the \\"Kid Lawyer\\" part.  It was a quick, and most enjoyable read!  I'm glad I took the chance on Grisham again.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This is a fantastic DVD set.  The acting and writing wonderful, combining drama and well crafted story lines with clever wit and humor.  This show is urbane, sophisticated, and fun.  The relationship between a by-the-book FBI agent teaming up with a rules-were-made-to-be-broken con artist gives White Collar it's entertainment value.  Besides the quality of the writing of the individual episodes, the writers are also smart enough to keep up the subplot of going in almost every episode.  The characters are easy to relate to, fitting a \\"type\\" without every falling into the stereotypical.<br />The DVD itself is also well done.  The discs all play well, and the packaging is an efficient use of space, and popping the discs in and out is a breeze.  The extras are good, the commentaries are entertaining and enlightening, the gag reel is funny, and the featurettes are well worth watching.  Overall, this set is a good buy for any White Collar fan.

B000O77SRC|5.0|\\"Die Hard\\" is one of the best action films of all time. When I think about the best action films of all time, I think \\"First Blood\\", \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"The Terminator\\". In all three of these films, a big reason why they did so well was because they had a good plot and the star of each film did a phenomenal job.    \\"Die Hard\\" is about New York cop John McClane (Willis). It is Christmas so he is visiting his wife who lives in California (because of a job she could not turn down). McClane goes to the building where she works, because there is a party going on there and his wife Holly has to give a speech. While McClane was in a back room washing up, he heard gun shots. With being a cop McClane goes to the top floor of the building \\"Nakatomi Plaza\\", he finds out that terrorist have taken control of the building and he is the only chance the hostages have.    Bruce Willis did a wonderful job acting in this film. In my opinion Willis should have won best actor for this role.   If you are a fan of action films, \\"Die Hard\\" is a must see.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how much I love this show. It has a beautiful cast and wonderful scenery. The plots are amazing and I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters, including the baddies. I love the powerful female roles, great role models for women my age. It's just an around great show.
B002ZG9788|4.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you Sam Worthington! The next great action hero...who can act! I mentioned in my Terminator Salvation review that there was something special about this guy and this remake of Clash of the Titans should solidify that! This is saying a lot considering how short on character development this film is. Imagine if a lousy actor played Perseus? This would've been a complete bomb.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans is an adrenaline rush! Fans of the original should love this. It follows the myth of Perseus and the Gods of Olympus with some new twists along the way. The short of it is simple. Perseus (Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Neeson)and as the last remaining demi-god the city of Argos looks to him to save them. Feuled with rage against Hades (Fiennes) for killing his earthly adopted parents, Perseus takes up the quest to stop the revenge of the gods. The task, capture the head of Medusa, kill the Kraken and send Hades back to the underworld! Sounds like fun? It is! A complete romp and action fest.<br /><br />The movie does fail on one level, and it is an important one: character development. The storyline is wonderful and the great actors in this film do much with little. If only they would have spent 15 extra minutes on the band of soldiers and the royal family of Argos, we might have found a little more emotional investment. You just don't care when people start dying and that is never good.<br /><br />All in all, this movie still packs a wallop and is totally enjoyable! Even with it's flaws, this movie is pure entertainment and a wonderful remake of a classic!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Clash of the Titans was made for BLU! This movie gets 5 brilliant stars for video and audio! SPECIAL FEATURES: Wonderful and copius. Check out the deleted scenes and alternate ending only found on BD. You will appreciate the ending they chose even more. FINAL THOUGHTS: A DEMO DISC, OWN IT, SHOW YOUR FRIENDS!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|To be completely honest with you, this show has changed my life. Not only has it introduced me into the fabulous books the show really resonates with me. I crave it, after a while of not seeing it I have to go and watch the DVD again. I've never felt this passionate about a show before. I just love the characters and the lessons learned from watching this amazing show.
B000LC4TJ0|5.0|no, this is not your traditional commedia version of Nozze and those offended by the darkness of the performance have panned the Bergman/Strindberg approach, yet for the first three acts it works incredibly well: so, if you are prepared to explore the tremendous sense of distrust and unease between men and women that haunts all the Mozart/da Ponte operas (tensions that are too often fudged or glossed over in so many productions) then this is a performance you MUST see since for the most part this Nozze deserves far more than five stars, seven or eight at least, despite the seeming lack of the director's trust that his singers could bring home the last act cleanly and successfully without (unnecessary) arch over-staging     with Netrebko (a simply magnificent Susanna), Roschmann (a fascinatingly deeper and more powerful Countess than her fine work under McVicar/Pappano released in 2008), Schafer (a glorious voiced awkward Cherubino), McLaughlin (a stunningly sung Marcellina) and Liebau (a beautifully voiced Barbarina) rivaling the excellently voiced men (including a much unfairly maligned Bo Skovhus as a Count whose aristocratic sense of guilty entitlement is excellently portrayed vocally despite the cumbersome over-use of his white handkerchief, and an excellent Basilio from Patrick Henckens)    and with sumptuous orchestral work throughout from Harnoncourt and the Wiener Philharmoniker beautifully recorded    and with excellent camera work from video director Brian Large    this is a performance very much for this age    however, the fourth act is problematical:  with the gender tensions and eroticism already deeply explored in the first three acts the notoriously difficult to stage fourth act can only offer more of the same - especially with the action supposedly taking place in the park still confined to the house:  moreover, and unfortunately, the directorial conceit of the added Cherub becomes here a downright nuisance drawing attention away from the charactersthe singers have superbly created by their acting as well as their magnificent voices, as does the totally unnecessary 'show and tell' staging of the temptations for men and women which interfere with the excellently sung fourth act arias from Marcellina and Basilio    despite this qualification this Nozze will take pride of place in my collection, even though I might be tempted to only listen to most of the fourth act instead of watching (thank goodness for the lack of interference with  Babarina's opening Cavatina and Susanna/Netrebko's beautifully sung 'Giunse alfin il momento')

0470601787|5.0|If you have ever reached for a pencil to explain or hang onto an idea, then you will be delighted with this book. Visual Meetings will change how you think, work and meet - and even think about \\"visuals.\\" Don't draw? Not to worry - this isn't about drawing per se but how to use \\"visuals\\" - text, simple drawn images, photographs, graphic metaphors -- as a natural part of engaging people, analyzing, innovating, and better yet, getting people to put their ideas together and take action. Visual Meetings is about how to surface the knowledge in the room (or in yourself!), and get it organized so that you can use it. And this means both via traditional paper with pens, as well as digitally/virtually - from table top size to huge templates and charts.     Sibbet outlines a comprehensive system of visual strategies and techniques. The clear instruction and tons of inspiring examples / case studies are backed by serious concepts and models about how people think, group dynamics and engaging people around tough questions, real work, deep learning.

B0000TLA9G|4.0|The most dangerous band in the world...... and now we have the greatest hits huh? Well lets face it G'n'R were pretty much one of the top five bands on planet headbanger for much of their existence and spawned a range of hits that leapt up the mainstream charts around the world, turning their major players at least, into cultural icons of sorts.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean this greatest hits package is in any way indicative of that nor really representative of their greatest recorded moments. Any real fan of this band is going to own at least three releases, Appetite (obviously) and the two Illusion albums. And hence in this day and age of CD burning at home there really is no excuse for any long term gunners fan from putting together a far more personalised slice of rifferama from the one time bad boys of hard rock/metal. I mean, at the very least this thing should have been a double disc and while they may have been hits for the band, I'm uncertain of where I stand on the inclusion of (count `em) five covers on a 14 track compilation. Is it just me or does that come across as a bit unseemly to you as well, dear reader?<br /><br />Having said all of the above I have to point out the simple fact that the originals on this album are pretty much all ball tearin' slices of perfection. Seriously - it's hard to go past numbers like Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, You Could Be Mine and mini-suite November Rain. All worth the price of admission alone but of course we come back to my main point which is that.... you already own these songs don't you? I suppose there is some value here for the total newcomer but honestly if anyone asked me I'd just sling them my copy of Appetite for the weekend and they'd be on their way.<br /><br />All of the above notwithstanding this is at least a four star release for the material on offer, I just have some philosophical issues I guess....
B003HKN52A|3.0|I own the original VHS of Elvis On Tour and when I saw the DVD I was dissapointed. First, the editing. Three full minutes of the film were taken out. Second: NO EXTRA FOOTAGE. I thought this film was going to get \\"deluxe treatment\\" that the Aloha From Hawaii and This Is Elvis got when released back in 2004. There were times where a line appeared right in the middle of the screen. The new edition simply did not live up to my expectations. I wanted the original version PLUS extra footage. All I got was a barebones version that was below the level of greatness of the original. After waiting for so long for the release of EOT on dvd I, as a fan and customer was dissapointed.
B00026KDC2|3.0|The Quireboys (as they are generally referred to) originally spelled their name more conventionally until the Australian band named The Choirboys objected - hence the funny spelling of the name. Anyway, that's part one of our history lesson. Part two is that these guys came outta the blocks at around the same time that a few other bands also seeped out of the woodwork with a similar 60's/70's schtick and ultimately only one was afforded any real critical and commercial stature - The Black Crowes.<br /><br />All that aside the Quireboys worked their subtle and ultimately fairly minimal charms to perhaps their maximum potential here on their debut, led by lead vocalist `Spike' and his Rod `the mod' Stewart raspy inflections leading this album rather merrily and quite contentedly down a sort of honky tonk hard rock amalgam of a road where, for the indulgent listener, there is a fine enough toe tappin' album to sling into your stereo for when they are mentally busy with something else (like writing reviews perhaps?). The instrumentation is quite upbeat, the arrangements free and open and very much in love the simple tales being told.<br /><br />With a production job that doesn't seem to have aged badly - at least to these ears - and a mission statement that is plain and honest this album would be worth a look for anybody who loved The Black Crowes and others of their ilk and even, to tell the truth, fans of Status Quo or any other boogie rock groups from the last.... oh three or four decades and given the price one can acquire this thing for you can afford to take the gamble.<br /><br />But I stand by my three stars due to the limitations of the sub genre being addressed, the very average way it's mostly delivered and the lack of any overt reason to be. Which perhaps explains why so much of what media attention these guys achieved was centred around whether they or the Wildhearts were the heaviest partying band in London in the first couple of years of the 1990's.
0312427646|5.0|De-lightful, de-licious, de-lectable, de-lirious, de-lovely!! I wish everyone could read this gem of a book.
1594488843|5.0|There are certain books that transform thinking, and fewer that have crossover to different facets of life. Drive is having that impact on me. I say this in the present tense because having just read it, I'm rereading it. Can't tell you how long its been that I've reread a book so quickly. From work place to personal life, Drive presents the ideas of Intrinsic Motivation, what Mr. Pink calls Motivation 3.0. Anyone in leadership or who's work requires creativity, problem solving, and/or innovation, which includes just about everyone, NEEDs to reflect on the content of this book.<br /><br />A summary does not do justice. Suffice it to say that if you want any of the following this is the book to read:<br /><br />A) Explore your passions that may be a hobby or dream<br />B) Love the work you do because it's interesting and challenging<br />C) Desire time to develop and implement ideas that would make exceptional your workplace or meeting needs of clients<br />D) Feel satisfaction in accomplishments and hungry to break out of the box (professionally and personally)<br /><br />Chapter one is important background. Then read chapter Two. At that point, I defy you to put the book down. Won't happen, and you'll thank yourself for continuing.
6302641888|5.0|Persona is not a story of two women, it is the story of one woman. At the start of the film, she is having a breakdown. At the end of the film, she is back together again, ready to return to the world. The woman--call her Vogler--is not \\"everyman\\" or \\"everywoman.\\" She is Bergman's ideal of the creative personality, with its horror show of neuroticisms. Liv represents the inner woman. Liv is silent to the world, but she is the essence of what is expressed by Vogler as an actress. Bibi is the persona--the outer woman. Bibi is the mask that Vogler presents to the world, her mechanism for coping with reality. The analysis of Vogler that the psychologist provides is 100% Bergman, and \\"on the nose.\\" The easiest way to dial into the movie is to focus on the scene in which the husband reappears. This is the only actual \\"intrusion\\" of the outside world into Vogler's healing process. In this scene, the husband doesn't see Liv. The inner woman is invisible to him. He only sees Bibi, the persona. That is because he only knows his wife through her mask. When the husband first appears, Bibi doesn't recognize him. This is because, as a result of the breakdown, the two halves of Vogler's personality have become dissociated. But in this scene,  Liv appears behind Bibi, raises Bibi's hand like a puppet, and places it on the husband, directing her exterior self to resume her role. And at that point, Bibi \\"recognizes\\" her husband, remembers her child, and steps into the role. Bergman intended that this scene would shatter the viewer's notion that the movie was about two women, because the scene is otherwise inscrutable. The portrait of the two women, with Liv in the background and Bibi in the foreground, with Liv arranging Bibi's hair (and about to sink her fangs into Bibi's neck), is emblematic of Vogler's psychological architecture.<br /><br />If you start at the beginning, and view the film as the story of the reintegration of a woman who has had a mental breakdown, keeping Vogler'spsychological architecture in mind, it will make sense. At the end, when the reintegration is complete, Bergman shows us one woman, with one face, split down the middle. In the last scene, there is only one woman who gets on the bus. We see Bibi, the persona, restored to her role as the external woman, and we get a glimpse of Liv, the inner woman, as she will emerge as an actress, now that Vogler is able to return to the world.<br /><br />During the period that Bergman made Persona, he made two other films in which he used multiple characters to \\"stand for\\" a single personality. In \\"The Silence,\\" he used three people; and in \\"The Hour of the Wolf,\\" he used a whole island full of people. Hope this helps.
B003KHJJNE|5.0|PABLO CASALS: THE ORIGINAL JACKET COLLECTION is a stellar set of 10 of Casals original Columbia LP recordings on 10 CDs, each in a Mini-LP Cover from the original LP. One of the frustrating things about the online description is that there has been no listing of which albums are included. Here is a listing of the original Columbia LP numbers, titles and composers:<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4349 PRADES FESTIVAL 1950 - BACH<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4350 PRADES FESTIVAL 1950 - BACH<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4560 PERPIGNAN FESTIVAL 1951 - BEETHOVEN<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4562 PERPIGNAN FESTIVAL 1951 - BEETHOVEN<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4715 PRADES FESTIVAL 1951 - SCHUBERT<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4719 PRADES FESTIVAL 1952 - BRAHMS<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4876 PRADES FESTIVAL 1953 - BEETHOVEN<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4878 PRADES FESTIVAL 1953 - BEETHOVEN<br /><br />COLUMBIA ML 4926 PERPIGNAN FESTIVAL 1951 - SCHUMANN, TRAD. ARRANGED BY CASALS, BACH, HAYDN, DE FALLA<br /><br />COLUMBIA KL 5726 A CONCERT AT THE WHITE HOUSE - 1961 - MENDELSSOHN, COUPERIN, SCHUMANN, TRAD. ARRANGED BY CASALS<br /><br />The playing and the sound throughout is masterful. Casals is featured in duos and trios, with the exception of ML 4926 where he is featured with the Prades Festival Orchestra and the Perpignan Festival Orchestra.<br /><br />I have listened to other Casals sets, particularly the unreleased Prades Festival tracks, and I find this set to be heads and shoulders above the others.<br /><br />Although this set sells for $61.98, you can purchase it on Amazon.de (germany) for $38 including shipping!
0062511408|5.0|I bought it because of the author but not expecting much and it ended up been a great book!!! A must read...
B002M2N9JI|5.0|Great CD.  Am a bit confused by the long silence before the last track, but...  I'm fond of every track on the album and look forward to the next La Roux release.
B001EO748M|4.0|This is just another in the series for my collection.  Look at my review on the 3rd season.
B000069HK2|5.0|If you had read the negative reviews that other people have written and are now having second thoughts about listening to The Used please DO NOT let those reviews fool you!  The Used is an amazing band with a unique sound, don't think all they do is scream they have beautiful songs like \\"blue and yellow\\" and \\"on my own\\". I have yet to meet a person that does not like this band and for me it looks like the ppl that gave this cd a bad review are old dudes who never got over 80's music and hate on bands like The Used because they play new and creative music. So please give The Used a chance and if you are open minded about music I know you won't be disappointed.                   The Used's debut cd is great from the moment it starts to the very end so you don't have to worry about it having any bad songs, the lyrics are tremendous, the music is really unique and it's a nice change if you're tired of bands writing about their girlfriends. This is their best cd so if you're curios about this band listen to it!
B003L45JLW|4.0|First of all, this is a great album - the best by far from TP in over a decade. I bought the regular CD when it first came out.  It was very well recorded and sounded great.  Since I have a Sony PS3, I was very interested in hearing the supposed higher resolution that blu ray can provide.  While the sound quality was slightly better and more detailed, I don't think that it was worth buying the album twice just to get the minor improvement that the blu ray provided.    I should say that I have a fairly high quality stereo and that my CD player has all the best interconnects hooked up to it so my listening test may not have been totally fair.  Hope this was helpful.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I don't watch movies for the performances, or for their artistic value, which is probably why I found very little in this. What matters to me is the story, and this movie doesn't seem to have one. It is a mismacthed patchwork of unrelated storylines, if I can even call them that, from differenet parts of the world, that are supposed to entertain. Well, they didn't entertain me in the slightest. After all the hype I found this to be a turgid, pointless and disappointing movie. I can't see what all the fuss is about. I don't like clever, arty films for the sake of it, so I don't like 'Babel'.
030726999X|5.0|This novel was a rare thing for me...an entirely satisfactory story, with no gaping plot holes. I read this book immediately after finishing \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and was amazed how smoothly the story continued. Like most fans of the late Mr. Larsson, my only disappointment was that this is apparently the last novel from this amazingly-talented writer. (Rumors are circulating about a 4th manuscript...We can only hope they are true!) READ THIS BOOK!!!
0440246016|3.0|I'm reading the Reacher series backward, starting with 14 and 13. Both of those books are brilliant. The author does a lot of research and the action is fun, so even when the plot gets slow or far-fetched, you can enjoy Reacher's bits of trivia about guns and observations such as that snowploughs should be properly called bulldozers instead.     This book, however, has neither fun action or interesting observations. Here are some examples of plot holes:  - Three special investigators find three thumb drives. The thumb drives are encrypted. The password software has three attempts after which it erases the data. Instead of backing up the data on the drives or running a dictionary cracker against it, they bang their heads against the wall trying passwords consisting of first names. Needlessly losing two USB drives to the self-destruct mechanism, they spend their time trying to guess their contents. It's as if Reacher saw a banana peel on the sidewalk, stepped on it instead of going around it, and now he's in a hospital with a broken leg, and I'm supposed to feel sorry for him and empathize with his troubles?  - After getting a coded message referring to the 6th track of Hendrix's 2nd album, three special investigators get in a car, drive to a CD store, and buy a CD, because the track title is obscured by a price sticker. Meanwhile, Reacher's only clever observation (this is the first CD he's ever bought) is that the plastic bit that holds the jewel case together in new CDs is a pain to get off. No s**t, Sherlock! Why not google \\"Hendrix discography\\" and have the answer handed to you in 10 seconds?    To summarize, it's not the most insightful Reacher book ever. It feels like Lee was not inspired when he wrote it.
067101756X|5.0|I have no idea what to believe in this elaborate tale of hostile et's and massive cover-ups that sound so wildly incredible even Hollywood would be reluctant to produce it. I give it 5 stars for pure entertainment value.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|I've bought the last 4 Roots albums and I've never been disappointed. Each one giving you a different flavor much like candy. This new album How I Got Over is yet again another amazing album from the crew. This album is a bit more serious feeling than their last record, but it's good. This album will be great to lead into winter with and for those living up north the tracks are definitely more than just a summer banger, they are the type of tunes you really listen to and let connect to you as you connect to them. All 42 min of this album will leave you fulfilled but yet still anxious to listen to it once again. The artistry that went into creating this is something that definitely didn't go unnoticed either. Black Thought brought out his deepest thoughts for this album but musically the group tried a more ecclectic feel that will definitely be appreciated by the musically elite. This is more than another hip hop album, even though it is probably the best to be released this year, it is an orchastration. Put together by a group of phenomenal artist to make something that truly will provoke thought as all art should.
0061906220|5.0|This is a catchy, fun book with great illustrations. Both my kids like it, even the 12yo. We like the story, the rhythm of the words, the song. It is a great book.
B00005N6KG|5.0|They certainly are not bose but they are still nice enough to be worth it if light is a priority fo you like it is with me.  I have to replace mine every 5 months or so because one of the ears gets too worn. I would pay more for a more durable pair. But for the price, you can't beat them! If you intend to be a habitual user and like to use them everyday at work in the office, I would recommend having an extra pair on hand. There is nothing worse than struggling through a workout and one side goes out! I have been using these sony head phones for about 3 years and love them. I am happy to see them on Amazon, the only other place I know that sells them walmart, for a similar price but this is much more conveinen). I use them for running 3-4 times a week. Throughout the years, I have tried other kinds, earbuds, the kind that wrap behind the ears, but these are the only headphones that stay on my ears when I do the eliptical. My only complaint is that I wish they were more rugged.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|We all know the movie was great! It is even better on blu-ray!  This is a great little set with a bunch of bonus features! The mask extra was really a plus and a great collector's item! This is a must have 2-disc blu-ray w/mask and extras and a great price! This will make a great gift for any batman fan!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Likened to Dusty Springfield, and other great female vocalists seems like high praise, and it's richly deserved. But Duffy exudes a soulful charm, and individual style that's essentially all her own, despite a strange deja vous you get when listening to her range.<br />Powerful rich vocals, great acoustic and backing accompaniment and a soulful approach, put this diminutive Welsh singer almost in a league of her own.<br />I bought the album having heard only the title track, and the upbeat \\"Mercy\\" which for those who remember that far back, made me feel like I was in a scene from Our Man Flint, or more recently the spoof 60's flicks of Austin Powers.<br />As great as these two tracks are, they are but a taste of the other excellent songs on this album, all of which I loved, and which got better every time I heard them. The heartfelt almost begging of \\"Syrup & Honey\\", the gentle sway of \\"Stepping Stone\\" and the emotional depth of \\"I'm Scared\\" didn't just put me in mind of the aforementioned Dusty Springfield, but also Brenda Lee, Elkie Brooks, and even Etta James, and many more.<br />Another great power of the album is it's pure soul, and blues approach. To many it will evoke memories of simpler times, when singers sang, and musicians played without the need for mixing and synthesizers, but make no mistake, this is contemporary stuff, made for today.<br />It won't be to everyones taste, and one wonders in today's mass media pop culture whether it's target audience (assuming that it is aimed at the pop and top 40 crowd)may find it too slow, or not upbeat enough to keep pace with the marketplace. Whether that's the case or not, and Duffy's fan base get's marginalized out of the billboard charts, the album stand's on it's own merits. Too early to call it a modern \\"classic\\", but this is great stuff. I look forward to more from Duffy soon. 5 stars.
0061906220|5.0|This was my daughters 2nd favorite book. We could tell her the story anytime we wanted to settle her down, in the car or Dr. office.She loves it and ask me to put on the DVD often(we have one of the origanal versions)
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Excellent service with prompt delivery.  Absolute essential for uploading photos to ipad.    Quickest method I have seen so far for uploading of images.
B000000IRR|5.0|I bought the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs Gold Ultradisc of Steely Dan's 'Gaucho' CD.<br /><br />This version sounds incredible. And considering it is a re-master of the original master recording, there is no doubt as to why they just sound better than conventional store bought aluminum CD's.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|So, I was considering purchasing the new re-matered release of REM's Fables of the Reconstruction, but decided, partially based on price, to restrain myself and read a few reviews before I spend the money. My first stop was Amazon.com. Overwhelmingly, the critics gave a positive reviews of the remastered original CD, but did not like the \\"extras.\\" OK. But, one reviewer, claiming to be an audiophile (with initials S.D.), gave a clear thumbs down. This put me off (momentarily). I also have been very disappointed with remasters over the years--i could not appreciate the differences they introduced--if any.    So, logically, I went to see what Mr. D. had to say about the new Disintegration remaster (if anything).    After reading the glowing reviews of the Disintegration remaster in the popular audiophile mags, and, being a Cure and Disintegration album lover, I decided to make the purchase. I can't say enough. Dynamic range has been expanded--and yes, this means the loudest parts are going to be more louder on average. Guitar twang now had body and definition (reminds me slightly of Nick Drake's acoustic twang). Bass has been extended to make the drama of Plainsong fantastic. [BTW: if your systems can't handle this without booming and distortion, well than...].    Suggestion to Mr.D.: My new favorite contemporary \\"reference\\" song in OK Go's \\"This Too Shall Pass.\\" The recording has been pushed to the limits regarding low compression. You should be able to follow each part through every crescendo and not notice clipping or distortion within the limits of your system.    One final note: this remaster was fully supervised by Robert Smith. Think about it folks. This is not someone else's interpretation.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the Cat is a great book - especially for beginning readers.  Yes, it may indicate an acceptance of fate (seen as a negative by the School Library Journal), but let's face it, when one is  4 or 5 and learning to read with this book, there are a lot of things that one just has to accept.   I'm all for teaching empowerment, but there is also value in teaching kids of that age to learn to keep on walking and singing their song because . . . It's all good.
0739384171|4.0|I enjoyed listening to the audio version of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and looked forward to book number two, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\". I have just finished listening to this book as well and enjoyed it very much. First of all it is not a typical 'formula' follow-up which is refreshing. Second, it takes a while for the plot to develop in this book. As a result, I wouldn't recommend reading it without reading the first Dragon book. Third, listening to the audio version was great - the reader is very good and it also takes out the guess work on the pronunciations of the Swedish words and names. As a follow-up to the Dragon book, I found the second Fire book to be very satisfying and am anticipating reading the third and final book in this series.
B002ZG983M|5.0|It's hilarious, action packed, just....awesome. If you like super hero movies and like enjoy movies like Superbad and Feast, then this is a movie for you. Comedy mixed with gore, dark humor, and entertaining super-nonsense awaits you.    I hestitate to use the term \\"super-nonsense.\\" Part of what makes this film so great is an idea of heroism moored in reality. Mark Millar has brought us so many interesting takes on the super hero mythos; he's a credit to the genre. In Ultimates it was the fallibility of the men/women behind the masks, and the violent implications of supernatural power. In The Authority it was the tacit dominion of these god-like figures we call super heroes.    And in Kick-Ass, it's the consequence of a mortal taking on greater-than-mortal role. The heroes in Kick-Ass bleed (a lot), and cry, and break, just like you and I would. Kick-ass himself, a punching-bag super hero pastiche, represents youths placing themselves in harm's way to find themselves. Correlate his misadventures to what you will: drugs, gangs, self-inflicting, diseases of body image - Kick-ass talks about teenagers and their distorted perception of the world as much as it talks about the distorted world super heroes exist in.    Because of it's social and cultural implications (and the fact that it's so DAMN funny and entertaining) I rank Kick-Ass one of the top 5 super movies ever made.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Dear God, she pulls the soul right up out of her heart and lays it out there for everybody to hear.  The piano of Allen Toussaint carries me away and Cyndi melds right into it.  The \\"Down So Low\\" track is my fave, although I love the whole CD.
B00338QENI|2.0|I found this story fascinating but the writing disappointing. The author seems almost patronising towards the family and clearly sees herself as socially superior. The authors commentary detracts  from what would otherwise have been a good story. disappointing.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|I was enamored with this show until the end of this season. To use a football analogy, it was as though they carried the ball diligently and with only a few hiccups until the one-yard-line and then dropped it. I felt as though it they were more concerned with comforting their audience then tying up the plot. I felt like they basically took everything that had happened over the last five seasoned and made it all totally irrelevant in the final episode, most of which, made little or no sense.    I would still recommend this show as a whole and I had a great time watching the other seasons and watching the characters develop, but I was monumentally disappointed with this ending, especially when the rest of the show was a great display of creativity and courage.
0446618322|3.0|Reading a Nicholas Sparks book is a little like reading Readers Digest or eating at Sonic. It is good but not great, fun but not earth-shaking, fine writing but not award winning, intriguing but predictable. The Lucky One, like other Sparks books, reads well and is a page-turner. The tortured hero, Logan Thibault, returns from the war with a photograph of an attractive lady. Walking from Colorado to North Carolina, he meets the girl in the photograph and begins the process to win her heart. Unfortunately she is being kept from developing relationships due to the controlling attitude of her ex-husband.     Making enemies of the ex-husband and a few others, Logan proceeds to win over the rest of the town. The antagonist continues to harass his ex-wife, Logan, and demonstrates weak character traits throughout most of the book. As the book progresses, the love of Logan and Elizabeth becomes stronger until he reveals how he came to be in North Carolina. A subsequent storm, a lost boy, and some man against nature stuff helps resolve the situation, coming to a hopeful conclusion.    Our hero Logan finds himself in the process, Elizabeth becomes free from her ex-husband, and the people stop their judgmental ways. It makes for a nice read with the internal strife of the characters becoming less stringent as the work progresses. This makes for a polyphonic book of independent yet congruent challenges and a goal direction that while predictable is exciting and satisfying (at least mostly). The characters get better while the story becomes energized. The region contains enough small-town folk attitudes to keep the smiles working. Fun stuff.     Yet I thought it was all rather average compared to great books and great writing. Still, it is hard to be critical of a vastly successful writer whose words seem to reach so many people. Recommended for those needing romance with an edge or seeing flawed but warm characters. For me a little more Philip Roth depth or Thomas Hardy character writing would give it greater meaning and personal connection.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Well, I must say I do own the first three Karate Kid films. I never did get a chance to see the fourth one with Hilary Swank but I did hear it was the weakest of the series so I guess I'll skip it for now. I'll start with the first film which is of course the best one. It has a great plot. A teen-age boy named Daniel who is very kind-hearted and has a deep interest in karate relocates from New Jersey to California with his mom. This is where all the trouble begins!     He falls for a cute blonde named Ali who is the girlfriend of champion Johnny Lawrence who is the best student at the Cobra-Kai karate dojo. Oddly, Johnny is not exactly a traditional villian per-se like some of his friends seem to be. It basically is a love-triangle sort of situation. Obviously, Johnny has the edge as he is bigger and much more skilled than Daniel. But Daniel has a secret weapon that everyone soon finds out about. He befriends an elderly Japanese karate grandmaster and war hero named Mr. Miyagi. Mr. Miyagi is well aware of Daniel's situation and expresses to teach him all the tricks to defeat Johnny and his friends at a tournament which he sets up with Johnny's ruthless instructor, Kreese.     The second film takes place in Japan. Daniel takes a vacation with Mr. Miyagi and ends up not only learning about Japanese culture but fighting for his life as Mr. Miyagi's long-time rival and one time best friend, Sato along with his first-rated student challenge the two. This paves way for the third film with is again based on a tournament. In my opinion, this really should have been released after the first as it seems to be more of a direct sequel to the first than the second film was. It picks up where the first tournament ends. Kreese turns on Johnny for having lost to Daniel and starts to choke him. Mr. Miyagi jumps to Johnny's rescue which persuades Kreese to throw a couple of punches at him! However, Mr. Miyagi proves very elusive to hit and he ends up severely injuring both of his hands due to accidentally hitting two car windows instead. Mr. Miyagi has the opportunity to give Kreese a severe beating due to his handicap but decides to let him go and forgive him.     Kreese, humiliated and now without students opts to consider giving up karate. But his war-buddy and vicious karate instructor, Terry who is also his partner discovers the situation and vows to help Kreese put an end to Mr. Miyagi and Daniel's championship reign. He handpicks a great Cobra-Kai type martial artist named Mike Barnes. Terry makes Barnes a great offer providing he can defeat Daniel which persuades him to really attack Daniel with a viciousness that very much intimidates him. Daniel really wants to continue fighting in tournaments but Mr. Miyagi advises against it as he believes karate is more so for defending life and honor rather than his trophy! This forces Daniel to choose another instructor who happens to be Terry! Terry pretends to be his best friend and on his side but puts him through such physically demanding training that it drains Daniel and turns him into a vicious Cobra-Kai with an attitude.     He ends up mistreating Mr. Miyagi and breaking someones face in a street fight. Daniel finally sees he is being someone he's not and returns to Mr. Miyagi who finally promises to train him. I really did enjoy this one but I do agree with the other review on here that Mike Barnes didn't have the charisma of Johnny or even Chozen. In my opinion, they should have brought Johnny back to fight along side with Daniel getting revenge against Kreese for choking and mistreating him! Also, if you remember, he did sort of make amends with Daniel at the end of part 1 and Mr. Miyagi did save his life. It would have been really interesting to see how Mr. Miyagi would've trained Johnny.
B0000026UL|5.0|The backing band is a bit slicker than usual for Dylan, but the songs are truly excellent, and Dylan sings with a haunting directness and without affectation. It's really wonderful. It's very good Dylan, and very good Dylan is way better that the very best of just about everyone else. \\"Most of the Time\\" is a classic that will stand with the very best songs ever recorded. You won't regret owning this, and you will listen to it often.

B00192IV0O|1.0|Hello. We're here today to talk about the Black Eyed Peas \\"Energy Never Dies\\" album, ao here's a few facts and figures first of all. \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", the first single, had the second longest reign at number one in America, beaten only by their second single. That song, \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" is the most downloaded track in HISTORY. In the UK their third single \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" was their third consecutive number one single, the former two already hitting the top spot as well.<br /><br />This proves two things;<br /><br />1. The Black Eyed Peas are phenomenally popular.<br />2. There are more stupid people on earth than there are trees.<br /><br />It's funny, the one thing idiots always try and hit back with whenever this awful group are insulted is how successful they are and how many records they've sold. But as I've proven in my Official Room 101 of Amazon many times before, sales mean squat. The likes of Justin Bieber and Susan Boyle may sell bucketloads of records and make little kids scream (although the latter was never really her fault, she did warn them not to peek through her bathroom window), they still make terrible, talent-free music. It was the English poet Thomas Tusser who once remarked that a fool and their money are soon parted. That's still true today, and if ol' Tusser was around now, he would probably remark; \\"Gadzooks, Boom Boom Pow makes me want to hack my ears off with a scythe.\\"<br /><br />What's really funny about this album is the misguided notion Will.I.Am and the rest of the Black Eyed Peas (Black Hitler, The Creeper from Jeepers Creeper and Fergie, now almost 75% recycled) has that he's made some form of \\"New Sound\\". The way they brag on Boom Boom Pow about having this far out futuristic music, when in fact Daft Punk's Discovery album fused dance, pop and rock (and even auto-tuned vocals) in 2001, and it STILL manages to sound more fresh, vibrant and exciting than the Pea's idiotic noise and Fergie's obnoxious honk.<br /><br />The other singles from the album are disposable, instantly forgettable drivel, although the fact that by the time \\"Rock Your Body\\" was released, Fergie's \\"vocals\\" have now been so auto-tuned she sounds like Alvin the Terminator Chipmunk is pretty hilarious. Why is she even there? \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" is perhaps the biggest offender of all. This song is 4:50 seconds long, and in that time the phrase \\"tonight's going to be a good night\\" is repeated 24 times, the phrase \\"do it\\" is repeated 17 times, lyrics like \\"here we come, here we go\\" and \\"easy come, easy go\\" are actually included in a song written in 2009, and let's not forget that plastic zombie saying \\"Mazel Tov.\\" And this is, let us remind ourselves, the most downloaded song EVER. Depressed yet?<br /><br />Let's take a break right now. If you haven't heard this album, I want you to scroll up the page and click on the link to listen to \\"Ring-a-Ling\\" and listen to it for thirty seconds. That burrowing feeling in your head is your brain trying to escape down your throat. Although, to make you feel better, take a listen to the hysterically bad \\"Now Generation\\", in which the Peas sink like a stone in their attempt to \\"rock\\", coming off as about as convincing as Barry Manilow singing \\"Anarchy in the UK.\\" You gotta love those deep, insightful lyrics, too. \\"We are the Now Generation. We are the Generation Now.\\" You just know Bob Dylan is sitting at home taking notes.<br /><br />The Black Eyed Peas are, of course, abysmal, and this album is another example of braindead, empty, nothing to say pop garbage that a million kids are wasting their money and youth on. Music that's going to date quicker than the Macarena and will turn out to be just as irritating. How many people will seriously be playing this record in 5 years time? Exactly. 5 years is a long time in pop music, by which point more people who don't like music will be buying into the next terrible record, Fegie will have accomplished full automaton transformation and, hopefully, B.E.P will be nothing more than an embarrassing memory.

B003BZXI6E|4.0|I enjoyed watching ONE NIGHT ONLY: BARBRA STREISAND & QUARTET AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD BLU-RAY. The picture is crystal clear and the VERY small venue provides viewers the opportunity to experience --at least vicariously-- the thrill of being in one of those jazz supper-clubs of yesteryear and the intimate setting between performer and audience.<br /><br />Barbra, though her voice has changed somewhat the older she gets, is still in fine singing voice. Like a well-oiled machine, that inimitable voice starts to purr at about the third song and it's as though time has stood still. Perhaps the first two songs were just warm ups or maybe Streisand got more comfortable with the audience, whatever it was she was back in fine form by song number three. The band plays nice and tight, with the arrangements sounding bright and lively.<br /><br />Most of the song selections come from the CD [[ASIN:B002DYJAIO Love is the Answer (Deluxe Edition)]] as this was a promotional type gig, but she does some of her other songs like \\"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,\\" \\"My Funny Valentine,\\" \\"Evergreen,\\" and \\"The Way We Were.\\" And Barbra really opens up that voice on \\"The Way We Were,\\" belting it out and almost sounding hoarse --for effect, mind you-- and I really hope that's an indication of things to come. I'm still hoping for a more up-tempo jazz/torch song album with Barbra belting like she did back then. And though \\"Love Is The Answer\\" was OK it didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Some reviewers complained about her talking too much in-between songs, but I liked this part. She talks about the song and when and where she heard it etc., and also anecdotes about her past and experiences in the Village(Greenwich Village). This makes the whole performance much more intimate, rather than some robotic singer going through the motions.<br /><br />There's some exterior shots of the nightclub and fans that lined the street, and the audience was a mixed bag. The place can only hold a little over 100 people and many were right up on the stage. Most were famous like Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton and actresses Nicole Kidman and Sarah Jessica Parker (who was right up front and beaming from start to finish). Also in the audience was husband James Brolin and others, along with the small handful of lucky fans who won tickets to the event. There were also a few bad apples in the audience who looked like they'd rather be in Dante's 7th circle of Hell than be there. Why they were included is beyond me especially since there's a lot of reverse angle shots from the stage so you see the audience pretty regularly.<br /><br />The running time for the Blu-Ray performance is 01-hour:23-minutes:04-seconds. And the only special feature included is a paltry 06:47-minute featurette on the nightclub with owner Lorraine Gordon, the widow of owner Max Gordon, who's funny and tells how she met Barbra and how the Vanguard started. I really wish there was more stuff though and that's why I deducted one-star. Wasn't the whole draw to Blu-Ray the extras? They could've at least interviewed the lucky fans who won the tickets or given a tour of the nightclub and the surrounding area.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're a Streisand fan you probably already have it. If you are new to Barbra and having trouble choosing between this and a previous special might I suggest [[ASIN:B000059H73 Barbra Streisand - Timeless (Live in Concert)]] for present day Barbra, and/or either [[ASIN:B000G75B1A Barbra Streisand: My Name Is Barbra]] or [[ASIN:B000GW8RZM Barbra Streisand - A Happening in Central Park]] (both of which are included in the box DVD set [[ASIN:B000B9PW7G Barbra Streisand - The Television Specials]] for a much better price) to see what the legend is all about.

B000005RT8|5.0|This is as original and beautifully done as anything he has recorded in the past and it seems to be in the playful vein of his first solo album. He uses the synthesizers with rich sounds in a very creative and melodic way. The use of them remind me of two pioneer artists who influenced the use of synths in popular music with a folk tinge in the melodies and interesting chords; ABBA, check out ABBA (self-titled), ARRIVAL, THE ALBUM & VOULEZ VOUS all from the 1970's, also VANGELIS whose influence is very evident in many songs and who has used sounds like these since the 60's. I can also detect STEVIE WONDER'S SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS. The most important element is that the chord structures of the songs are as sophisticated as anything he has done in his career; added to this edition are 3 songs which I love and add to the album's creativity and variety; it does not feel like a mixed bag, it is an album with a concept which takes you on a musical journey, something lacking in music and albums today...hence the decline of the recording artist.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|The films are just awesome, as all of you might know. There is not a doubt about it.    As it was filmed in the 70s, obviously it's upscaled. Not a bad upscaling job, actually it was done very nicely.    A must buy for every Coppola fan.

B002Q9VPFM|4.0|First off let me say I am an absolute die hard Watchmen fan. Getting this ultimate cut was a must have in my book. I purchased my copy directly from Amazon (there were 2 minor tears in the case but i eventually cried myself to sleep enough times to shrug it off).     This copy includes the following: The complete motion comic (6 chapters/comics/episodes on the first disc and the other 6 on the second disc), the ultimate cut of Watchmen (this disc includes Tales of the Black Freighter plus commentaries from Snyder and illustrator Gibbons), Special features (this was actually pretty interesting and i do recommend you at least watch it once), and then theres the theatrical digital copy for your pc and mac.     The special feature does include Hollis Mason's Under the Hood which is included in the Tales of a Black Freighter dvd (last time I was at Borders I recall this dvd being around $34.00 completely not worth it for just those items.) Sadly I havent gotten around to watching it.    As far as the digital copy goes there was an expiration. Mine is Nov. 3, 2010. Theres really no reason for this disc imho.     I absolutely loved the movie despite the fact that osterman was the cause. It wouldn't have made sense to other movie goers why *spoiler alert* there was a giant alien monster with a human brain destroying NY. *spoiler end* I loved how Snyder kept the main story alive with a different plot twist. And yes the movie still ends the same as the comic.    The motion comic is beautifully done besides silk spectre's man voice.    The only thing I didnt like was how long the movie drawed out for because of Tales of the Black Freighter! At first I thought I was going to be awesome but it almost felt like Lord of the Rings long.    Overall I'd give this copy a solid 4.5 (only did a 4 cuz here werent that many 4 reviews) I was very satisfied by the quality, and the overall experience (did i mention the 3 discs not including the motion comic has its very own case within a case?)    I recommend this copy to any Watchmen fans. I perfer a tangible copy of any movies I love and so should you![[ASIN:B002Q9VPFM Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut]]

0783114893|4.0|Sometimes I feel for movie critics. They have to decide on a rating for a movie in a few hours after watching it. Some movies just cant be that way. Movies like the Hitcher need a week or so and a few showings for it all to sink in.    When this movie first came out in 1986 it was considered one of the worst movies of the year by numerous critics. I cant imagine any of them feeling that way about this movie now. Maybe it was the gruesome killings by Haeur or maybe the movie just followed too closely in time to the Friday 13ths, Nightmares, and Halloweens.     Im not gonna bother with the plot of this film as its already been done. But Im just going to add that this is one of those kind of movies that really gnaw at you long after you have seen it.     That is why it is so beloved by people 20+ years later. Like a fine wine it just gets better with age. Sometimes the creations are too far ahead of their time. This movie is a prime example of this.
B003L45JLW|5.0|The reviews are right on, this is an outstanding set of music presented wonderfully on blu-Ray and (via handy download) the mobile format of your choice. It's been a joy to rediscover Tom Petty in fine form after all these years.  This is a solid blues-driven set which shines in a smart 5.1 mix that supports the music without becoming gimmicky.  For a reasonable price,you can enjoy Mojo in surround and while mobile. I hope more commercial releases adopt this model.   If you've got a taste for the blues and are old enough to recall the Petty hits on the radio, do yourself a favor and pick up this album/disc/whatever...
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This fine political drama is based on the book \\"The Ghost\\" by Robert Harris, and its storyline features the Hitchcockian theme of an ordinary man caught up in an overwhelmingly difficult situation -to be more specific, in a web of political intrigue.  The ghostwriter is ably played by Ewan McGregor who blends seriousness with humor. McGregor is outstanding because the whole movie revolves around his character.  The viewer identifies with him and cares about what happens to him. (Interestingly, the character of the ghostwriter is not given a name.)    A. Brief Synopsis    The ghostwriter is hired to rewrite the memoirs of ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang after the first ghostwriter mysteriously dies.  As the ghostwriter digs in deeper into the memoirs, he starts to uncover some of the secrets of the Lang character, who is accused of being a war criminal and a puppet of the United States.  Pierce Brosnan does a superb job of portraying a charismatic and dynamic leader who finds it challenging to deal with the aftermath of stepping out of a powerful political office.  This is one of Brosnan's best post-007 performances.     Meanwhile, the ghostwriter meets the two women who are most important in Lang's life -- his politically savvy wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams) and Lang's administrative assistant Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall).  The most interesting character for me was Ruth. Olivia Williams captures the many different sides of this complex and intelligent woman, who loves her husband but who also hates him, and finds it very difficult to deal with some of the choices he makes.  Kim Cattrall (in a role which is vastly different to Samantha in the Sex & the City series) plays Amelia Bly, the loyal assistant to the Prime Minister, who becomes like a second wife to Adam Lang.  Some of the most interesting parts in the movie are the dagger-like dialogues (more like verbal sparring) between Ruth and Amelia. They clearly hate each other but they have to cover it up and look civil in front of the ghostwriter.      The ghostwriter tries to uncover the truth of how the former ghostwriter dies, and Lang's political background and ties.  Meanwhile, the memoirs of Adam Lang become a central character in the movie and takes a life of its own.        As the ghostwriter tries to get behind the truth of the allegations against Adam Lang, he finds himself at great peril as powerful political figures will stop at nothing to prevent him from discovering the truth.  Although this movie starts out rather slowly, it gathers momentum and builds up to a very interesting and surprising climax.  Enough said.  You'll have to watch the movie for yourself.     B.  DVD Features     Special Features:     I enjoyed these 3 featurettes:     1) Documentary:  The Ghost Writer: Fiction or Reality -- author Robert Harris talks about his novel and what inspired him to come up with the story after looking at Tony Blair's life in office and after seeing a real-life story of another British leader accused of being a war criminal.  Harris comments about his meaningful collaboration with director Roman Polanski.    2) The Cast of the Ghost Writer:  The stars in the film (Ewan MacGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, Kim Cattrall) all talk about their positive experiences in making this movie and in working with Roman Polanski.    3) Interview with Roman Polanski:  Polanski talks about his interest in turning Harris' book into a movie and his collaboration with Harris as a co-screenwriter and director of the movie.  He talks about his casting choices, his work with the director of photography, how he designed the Lang house, and how he developed the manuscript.  It was a very interesting interview.     Bottom Line:  It is more of a political intrigue movie rather than a political thriller (and that's why I deleted one star).  It is not a Tom Clancy \\"Jack Ryan\\" sort of movie with lots of action or a John Le Carre movie like \\"The Tailor of Panama\\" (with Pierce Brosnan).  Ifyou're looking for that, you'd be disappointed.  It is a satisfying political intrigue-drama with a twist of Hitchcock. Even though the story is different, this movie is more similar in feel and pacing with the earlier Roman Polanski film \\"Frantic\\" (1988), another Hitchcockian film starring Harrison Ford.  I appreciated the rich character development and the well-written, intelligent script in \\"The Ghost Writer.\\"  They don't make many movies like this today.

Gone is the gain-clipped distortion in Alex Lifeson's guitar intro to \\"The Spirit of Radio\\". In fact, his guitar tone is hugely improved from previous issues of this CD. There's a warmth that was not there before. The instruments are well separated-- you'll hear things you may not have noticed before. I can finally hear all the nuances of the bubbling water effect in the beginning of \\"Natural Science\\". A true revelation!     In short, one of Rush's best albums has finally received the mastering treatment it deserves. I dare say, this issue sounds better than my original vinyl copy. It's well worth the money if you are a big fan of this recording.    Okay, now to find the discontinued MOFI versions of Moving Pictures and 2112!
006145205X|5.0|Matt Ridley has put together a fascinating survey of human history to argue that things are much better than most of us realize. Even for people who disagree, this book is packed with enough ideas that everyone should give it a read.    Ridley's major ideas are:    (1) Trade, specialization and economic growth are, on balance, massively good things, and have produced staggering increases in human welfare. That increase was gradual at first, and is now accelerating into faster and faster improvements.    (2) For the past two hundred years, most prophets of doom have proved to be at the very least grossly overestimating the harms on the horizon, and more often than that, massively wrong. Most of the scare stories we hear don't pan out, and most of the ones that do pan out don't cause nearly the harm we expected.    (3) Therefore, we should all (a) cheer up, because things are better than we think and (b) be very skeptical of proposals that attempt to limit economic growth in order to prevent potential future catastrophe, since the main thing that has historically prevented or blunted the catastrophes is economic growth itself.    Whether or not you agree with those ideas now, you should give The Rational Optimist a read. The book is packed with historical and scientific anecdotes exploring and developing Ridley's ideas. I had to put the book down to stop and think dozens of times.    Ridley has gotten the most flack over a half-chapter than he devotes to global warming. Basically, Ridley argues that global warming is real, but not as bad as the most extreme opinions think it is, and that the best way to respond is with a revenue-neutral shift towards carbon taxes. I don't think any of Ridley's ideas are that outrageous, but if you want to read the debate, google Matt Ridley and George Monbiot or the New Scientist - both sources have a back and forth with Ridley on their own fora and his blog.    My main concern, as far as I have one, is that the book doesn't seem to offer an assessment for identifying and responding to global risks. I agree, most prophets of doom will be proved wrong, but it's also true that fascism and/or communism probably *could* have conquered the world in the 40s, given the right breaks, or that the US and USSR probably *could* have engaged in a devastating nuclear war in the 80s. I'm optimistic too, but what, other than \\"don't sacrifice economic growth\\" and \\"it will probably be all right, but maybe not\\" does Ridley have to say about the stuff that worries me?    Still, The Rational Economist is fascinating, informative, and a healthy tonic to a number of the gloom and doom books crowding bookstore shelves. Highly recommended.
0307592839|4.0|Just finished the book A Visit From The Good Squad.   Throughout parts of the book I was thinking, \\"Why am I reading this?\\"  Then I got to the last two chapters and was simply amazed.  The power point chapter was pure genius--how she was able to impart a great amount of information in several sparse slides--wow!  Then I read the final chapter and was so glad I stuck with the book.  As I read the final chapter, my mind kept flashing to Alvin Toffler and Future Shock.     Did a search and found lots of people old enough to remember Toffler made that connection. Scary true!       [...]    As I then reflected on Facebook and other social networking sites, I shivered.  Then, I went to my FB site and made a post!  Am I acting on my own impulses or is society creating them??????  I think digitization is bigger and far more invasive than many realize.  I recommend the book but it is not light reading.

0307271862|5.0|I learned so much in this novel.  I 'read' it in the CD Audio version and highly recommend the woman reade of it. It is worth the extra money to be able to sit back and have a story told to you! The acclaimed narrator has an unusually attractive voice and perfect delivery. It makes for a synergistically heightened experience. This is an excellent story if you are interested in the wintery Sweden, China's incursion into Africa to pump out valuable resources and repeat China's history of colonial oppression but this time as aggressor. Generational vengeance gets vanquished, women as protagonists are well-written. Highly recommended for those who like a bit of an intellectual stretch, and who are not expecting Kurt Wallander (though an excellent series, Wallander is a bird of a different feather).

B001FB5634|5.0|I think it may have been unfair to even think about reviewing this film.  Cormac McCarthy's novel is, in all honesty, the greatest novel I have ever read, and I read a lot.  I know that it has many detractors, but the simplicity that illuminates the savagery he creates is just beyond flawless in its execution.  No single novel has stirred me in so many different ways.  So, when it was announced that this film adaptation was in development my initial reaction was that of immense joy.  I could not wait.  And then the film was delayed and that always worries me.  Then the critical response was lukewarm and not what I was expecting.  I understand the oppressive bleakness with which the story unfolds can be a deterrent for some, but I really was expecting a very warm critical response (especially considering that director Hollcoat's previous effort was `The Proposition', which is the single greatest western of the decade).  The reviews came in and I sidelined my anticipation and moved on to other, more critically accepted fare.  In the back of my mind I was still aching to see this film, but the constant thought that I was setting myself up for disappointment haunted me.<br /><br />Finally, I caved in.<br /><br />I'll say first off that this film is not as strong as the novel (by any means really) but it is far from a weak effort.  There are many elements that work masterfully here (not the least of which is Viggo Mortensen, who just commands with such authenticity) but there are also a few that don't.<br /><br />The story is a simple one.  A father and son (in the novel referred to as The Man and The Boy) are trekking across the barren wasteland that is earth, in search of the coastline.  Their main objective is to survive.  The men and women still alive are either good (like our man and boy) or have turned to cannibalism and thievery as a way to survive.<br /><br />Simple as that.<br /><br />For me, it is the ambiguity and open-endedness of the story that makes it so compelling.  I have heard some complain about not knowing all the details (How did the apocalypse happen?  Why did The Woman kill herself?  What awaits them on the other side of survival?), but for me, these questions do not need to be answered.  In fact, my biggest complaint with the film is the attempts to answer some of them.  For me, the flashback scenes that `build' the relationship between The Man and his wife are unnecessary and take one out of the film.  If the film had been stripped of all flashback sequences except the one where she leaves (because that is a central emotional point in the novel as well as the film) then the narrative flow would have been better (in my humble opinion).  The Woman is not important here.  The knowledge of her existence and her suicide are very important, but the foundation that supports her memory is not.<br /><br />As some have mentioned, the stories progression on the written page depended on the imagery created by McCarthy's words.  A sliver of that is lost on the big screen.  Some stories are just not well suited for a film format.  That said, I don't think it's a big enough slice to really dampen the films impact.  The imagery that is created by Hillcoat and company is not as sharp as Cormac's pen, but they are spellbinding in their own right (depictions of the aftermath is at times shocking to behold, and completely surreal).<br /><br />But there are some big selling points found within this film, which include some tremendous performances and Hillcoat's spectacular direction.<br /><br />Mortensen is utterly brilliant here.  The character of The Man is a tricky one because, for me, it is one of those characters that is so rich for development but could easily (in the wrong hands) become one-note.  Mortensen breathes so much humanity into this man.  The way he tackles his instincts (to survive and protect) with his own selfishness (the way he handles finding his old home was flawless) as well as his nostalgia (giving us the tormented looks at his happy love life as well as his affectionate response to something less emotionally demanding, like a whiskey) is all simply perfection.  Kodi Smit-McPhee also handles his character with authenticity.  One may initially balk at the way he reacts to certain things around him, but understanding that this boy knows nothing but the life he is living (with the apocalypse happening while he was still in his mother's womb) will help us understanding his emotional state.  While I strongly favor Max Records performance in `Where the Wild Things Are' (not THAT is how you play a kid), I must say that Smit-McPhee did not disappoint me.  Even when I found him underselling the moment (that final scene with his father could have pulled more heartstrings if he pushed it a little more) he also sold his characters frustrations exceedingly well at time (\\"YES I AM!\\").<br /><br />Toss in a very seasoned and memorable cameo by Robert Duvall and you have a film with some poignant performances.<br /><br />The musical score also worked very well here, building tension when needed but also baiting our heart when needed (the final moment, on the beach, with the simple yet stirring score looming in the background brought a slew of tears to my eyes).  Hillcoat crafted a very tightly woven film, one that felt completely within itself, which worked very well for the concept and the impact it set out to make.  Everything looked and felt real.  The wasted away bodies of the people wondering the road; the ash covered scenery and looming desperation captured in every collapsed remnant of a civilization past was spot on.  The way the script was written was also a plus, for it fleshed out the internal struggle that is so pertinent to understanding McCarthy's vision.<br /><br />Yes, it is flawed, but not so deeply that it isn't well worth experiencing.  The film is a downer, one that is as bleak as they come, and yet there is a hope presented to us that touches the heart.  While it fails to `perfectly' render Cormac's masterpiece to us, it is still an extremely good film that deserves to be received as such.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in giving this film an A-.fectionate response to something less emotionally demanding, like a whiskey) is all simply perfection.

B003MWHVLY|2.0|So I've been a fan of Sia for a few years and have most of her material, which so far has been impressive.  However, We Are Born is quite a change from her older stuff.  Most notable is the electro dance driven, noisy, overproduced sound.  Aside from the two \\"I'm In Here\\" versions, I find this album hard to listen to, as it is less cerebral and seems geared to a jumpy teenager fanbase.  I still enjoy Sia, but this inconsistent release ranks far below her other material in substance.
B002WTC8RA|5.0|Since reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society, I have recommended it time after time, to nearly everyone...all ages.  The characters in this story come alive through their letters (This is an epistolary novel), each one distinct and memorable. The writer is so skilled that we regard the developing romantic interest as only right--the perfect outcome for these cool people.  I learned about the isle of Guernsey and the part it played in WWII, and gradually I got a real feel for the folks who live there. I hadn't expected an historical novel, but it was that, too.  This book went MUCH too fast!  I wanted it to last about two years longer.
B001GCUO4S|1.0|This film was not done well in any way.  THere was no real creative and new death scenes...and the ones they had did not shock you like it had in the past films.  The actors sucked in this film really bad.  There was no mention about any of the previous people in the other films, it only mentioned about premotions, signs, and stuff llike that but nothing specific like they had in the other films.  Not even worth wasting your time watching on HBO.  Would not recoomend to anyone to watch and will for sure not add it to mu collection of the other 3 films.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I remember when this CD first came out back in 2006. The R&B Neo Soul scene was in desperate need of something new and fresh. Everything was becoming repetitive and predictable. We were at a crossroads where mostly everyone seemed to be singing about the same things. Then I happened to catch her breakthrough video on VH1Soul; I wasn't mesmerized by Girl Put Your Record On, but I had to admit that it was something different (especially in a time when we needed something totally different). She began to get a lot of rotation on the radio with that song then her CD came out. I took a chance on it and I was pleasantly surprised at how every song on her CD was far more superior than the one that was getting air-play. The acoustic guitar feel on the whole CD was something that I was not accustomed to, BUT it definitely worked for her. Not just anyone could've pulled that off. She came off as innocent and naive in her songs (just my opinion) and that just added to the messages in her music. She paved the way for a wave of music that began to sound similar to her own and for that alone, she deserves 5 Stars. From beginning to end, her Freshman Effort is a breath of fresh air...
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Don't shoot! I'm a man! Don't tase me, bro! Please baby please! There's Something for everybody.<br /><br />Devolicious tracks that are the crispest, pumpin' techno that was and is again Devo. If a decades long hiatis can create an album this perfect, well, let's not wait that long again, OK? A dozen tracks of pure, fan-chosen work out of 16 recorded. There is a perfect driving track: Please baby, please. That's my sunroof open, all windows on down, haul-it favorite. WE should be stunned, but really, we should turn it up and hit the floor: there hasn't been anything this fun in some time, or at least this great to reunite with.<br /><br />However, in hindsight, I should've bought the blue vinyl and CD combo instead of a download: DEVO's new CD deserves that measure of respect. So far, 2010's top CD alongside Sharon Jones. If they don't nail a Grammy, it's rigged.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|Notorious Italian film about a bunch of teenagers who are taken from their homes by Germans.  They are taken to a deserted castle in the outskirts of their town.  There they are degraded, humiliated and brutalized in the most disgusting ways possible.    There are a lot of different interpretations of this work (read the other reviews) but I don't think this works at all. Director Pasolini shoves all these disgusting and dehumanizing acts into the viewers face for no rhyme or reason.  Any point he is making is lost.  He wallows in the disgusting acts and it and just shocks the viewers to the point that they can barely think straight.  Seriously he could have made his point (whatever the hell it is) without going out of his way to shock and disgust viewers.  He seems to enjoy shooting this which makes things even more disturbing.  Two friends of mine saw it also.  One couldn't take it seriously--he says he saw some of the kids laughing in the background.  I didn't see that and have no interest it sitting through this again.  The other friend is a strong, masculine, tough guy who says nothing bothers him.  By the end he was in total shock!  He said it made him want to grab a teddy bear, crawl under his bed and curl up in a fetal position till he forgot he even saw this.    Sick and degrading piece of garbage.  There's no message here--only repulsive imagery that numbs the viewer.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Just in case you've been living under a rock, Dexter Morgan, based on the books which btw are great, great, great, is a police blood spatter expert. Did I mention he's also a serial killer of bad guys who beat the system?<br /><br />This time, Dex is married to the adorable Rita, a once-abused wife of an ex-con, and her two adorable kids... and Dexter's son. The series deviates from the books in that the children in print are just as damaged as he was, and Dex finds his life's purpose to be to guide his young killers to be perceived as normal.<br /><br />On DVD, Dexter encounters the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow) in an Emmy-winning role as another serial killer. How does one kindred killing spirit deal with another? Dex has to kill him, but this time, the chase is true cat-and-mouse with enough twisting side-stories to make the toughest viewers gasp.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall and cast are superb as cops under a system that both corrupts and forbids corruption; the final episode is now the stuff of TV legends: It is nearly impossible to outguess DEXTER and when this collection is done, you'll be drained, shocked and yet exhilerated by the stregth that this series has in both cinematic value and masterful creativity.<br /><br />DEXTER producers, I hate you for what you did, but applaud your combined mastery of your combined crafts. Dexter: The Fourth Season blew me away!
B003O7I6L6|5.0|I'll keep this short since this movie is roughly 30 years old and anything that there is to be said about it has been said already.  This new release was barebones, I knew that going in, so I'm not going to take away a star for that because I just want the movie to look and sound as good as possible right now.  I know that there will be a re-release at some point in the near future - either for the 30'th anniversary or for a \\"first look\\" at the upcoming remake.  I'm sure this is going to happen.  I'll worry about that when it happens, and decide what to do with this release when the time comes (if I decide that I *need* to have the extras on Blu-ray).  Anyway...    The transfer is great.  Easily the best this film has ever looked outside of the theater.  This release wasn't a DNR nightmare and lacks the edge enhancement and contrast boost mess that took place in the UK release.  The picture here is nice (it looks a little dark, but it seems natural) - probably the best it will ever look on Blu-ray.  The audio was amazing as well.  Amazing DTS-HD MA track!  There was only one line that was difficult to hear due to the sound effects/music, but it was like that on the DVD too - so whatever - I guess that's just how it is (for anyone interested, it's whatever Brain says after he says something about redskins).    A DVD was included with this release, which was unnecessary but infinitely better than a 'digital copy.'  The DVD is a flipper disc that features the widescreen version on one side, and the pan-and-scan version (EWWWW) version on the other side.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  Is this the same disc as the 2000 DVD release (since that was a flipper disc, too)?  That's what I thought at first, but I distinctly remember that disc not having a 5.1 audio track (it only had 2.0).  This one has a 5.1 track.  So, is it the 2003 Special Edition DVD version, but instead of it being on a regular disc, it's on a flipper disc?  This one is missing the Carpenter/Russellcommentary track!  I don't know what MGM did, but it's like they merged the two releases or something.  The picture quality on the DVD wasn't bad, and the 5.1 track was nice, so I'm *guessing* that it was the 2003 version, stripped of the commentary, and pressed on a flipper disc.  Why would they do this?  I have no idea.  If anyone knows what exactly went on with the DVD, since it is clearly SOME kind of mixture of the two discs, feel free to comment me on it!    All in all, if you just want the best looking/sounding version of 'Escape from New York' that you could possibly buy right now, this is it.  If you're worried about special features, maybe you could hold off for a year or two and see if the product gets re-released (I'm betting it will be since this one is barebones and the anniversary AND remake are coming up).  I didn't want to wait, so I scooped this up.  I care more about outstanding picture quality than special features, so this was a good buy for me, especially with the included DVD for those times where I'll want to get my Snake Plissken on and I'm not near my only Blu-ray player (or if I want to let somebody borrow the DVD).
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This music is so, so wonderful to listen to.  This is party music at it's best.  When you reach the song Crazy...turn up the volume...and dance the night away.  Crazy is such a catchy tune...I've listened to it over a hundred times...still I can listen to it another 100 times.  One of the centuries classic songs.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I used to consider myself a film purist but I guess I no longer can because I really enjoyed this 'digital noise reduction' version of the film.  That's because the excessive DNR was noticeable mostly in the first 10 minutes (before they got to the jungle) and for a few scenes outside of that - scenes which had incredible amounts of grain which is why they look bad when they were DNR'd to death in this release - but I imagine they would have looked worse, and more out of place, if they weren't grainless like the rest of the film (Ah, but film grain is good, and it should have been left in - in the first place - right?  Yes, I'll elaborate later).  For film, grain IS good.  Grain basically 'is' the detail in the film.  There's no denying that.  I already have the 2-disc Collector's Edition DVD, which I've watched many times so I know how grainy it looks.  It never bothered me because I understood that that's how the film was shot.  The thing is, the original Blu-ray release of 'Predator' used a poor codec and the disc was only single layered.  So, the compression artifacts made the grain look even worse.  People complained, and FOX came out with this release.  If they did it right the first time, and used the proper codec and bitrate (due to having the 50GB dual-layer disc that they have now), I'm sure there would be a lot less complaints.  But, they screwed up the first time.    Wanting to satisfy fans and milk this franchise for all it's worth (since they left out all of the special features on the last Blu-ray), they decided to \\"clean up\\" the picture, put back all of the special features, and give a little sneak peek to the new 'Predators' movie.  It was a good business strategy, but film purists would not agree.  At first, I was very against the idea of this release.  But hell, Amazon was offering it for $13.99 and I always wanted to own 'Predator' on Blu-ray (with the best picture possible and all of the special features), so i decided to give the disc a try.The first scene of the movie looks excessively DNR'd.  I'm not denying that at all.  However, I'll live with that since the rest of the film looks BEAUTIFUL.  It looks like it was shot yesterday.  I know, I know.  It wasn't shot yesterday.  It was shot in 1986 and released to theaters in 1987.  The film stock used was cheap, hence the film should look grainy.  I know that.  But damn, the picture looks so gorgeous now.  I still have my Collector's Edition DVD for when I want to be a film purist and see the picture in all of its grainy glory.  I wanted the film on Blu-ray, and I wasn't about go to buy the original release which was more like an upscaled DVD.  If the movie were released, grain in tact, with the proper codec and bitrate, I would have bought that.  I feel that this disc is the lesser of two evils.    If you want the movie to look like it did when it was in theaters, please, go and buy the lovely 2-disc Collector's Edition DVD.  If you want the movie to look like it was shot yesterday, buy this release.  I've seen the movie enough times to know how it's supposed to look.  If you can get over the first scene looking excessively DNR'd, then give this release a try.  I've included a page with some comparison shots of later scenes in the movie (to see the comparison, check out the 'Comments' section).  If you prefer the grainy pictures, buy the DVD or the original Blu-ray.  If you prefer the 'clean' (DNR'd) image, buy the 'Ultimate Hunter Edition' Blu-ray.  Aside from the first scene (the infamous shot of waxy looking Arnold - which really didn't look as bad in motion on my TV as it did in the screenshot), there really aren't too many parts of the film where detail is lost due to the DNRing that took place.  I know, grain is detail, but I'm talking about the lack of sharpness that can occur when too much DNR takes place.  That doesn't really happen at all, aside from that first scene.  Give the screen shots a look and judge for yourself.  The detail looks very well preserved, which is the ONLY reason I recommend this release.  If the whole movie looked like the first scene did, I wouldn't go near it at all.  But, the picture quality ends up being pretty damn amazing, albeit artificial (since I know what it SHOULD look like).  Like I said, I think this release is the lesser of two evils, especially since I don't think FOX will re-release it AGAIN any time in the near future.  The lossless audio (DTS-HD MA) track is amazing, the special features are great, and the picture quality (artificial, I know) is astounding.  If you are a film purist, stay far away.  If you don't even know what DNR means and you just want a nice looking movie, you won't be disappointed.    On a side note, the menus can be a little annoying.  They are very Predator-like, but they take too long to navigate and while you fastforward, an image pops up on screen showing you what chapter you're on - this is the only disc I have that does this.  That stuff was only a minor annoyance that doesn't really detract from the awesome disc.    In summary, I normally wouldn't recommend such a DNR'd release like this, but since the only HD alternative was the lower bitrate (and worse codec) Blu-ray that was already released (with no extras), this seems like the obvious purchase - especially since the DNR is only distracting in that first scene.  Once the action starts, the film looks beautiful - and the sound is amazing.    PLEASE CHECK THE 'COMMENTS' SECTION FOR A SCREENSHOT COMPARISON!
630542845X|5.0|This movie offers a powerful performance by the lead actor.  The entire cast is excellent as well.  This movie is about a young man ( Powder ) who was born different and the movie explores his differences...how others react to his being so while ( Albino ) and the magical powers he's inherited due to his birth.  It sends a message to everyone...love one another and accept one another for who we are.  It's a moving story...and the lead actor is mesmorizing in the role of Powder.

B000002LOE|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD since I've purchased it.  The entire selection of songs is catchy...and Losing My Religion is one of the best songs ever recorded.  Highly recommended...by one of music's great groups.
0765348276|5.0|I loved this book! I found the idea of only being able to join the army when you turn 75 interesting and the alien/human encounters entertaining. I enjoyed the sarcastic tone that's in much of the dialogue and the military battles were exciting.  While there are serious moments, there weren't enough to leave me feeling down after finishing the book.  I often recommend this at work - especially for people who want to start reading sci-fi. It's not too technical, it's exciting, and it's fun.    This is the first in the Old Man's War series. It's followed by The Ghost Brigades, The Last Colony, and Zoe's Tale.
B0000248SW|5.0|This cd arrived in great condition. Of course this entire album is great to add to any collection.
0345350472|2.0|2.5 really. Definitely not my favorite.  I can appreciate PKD's vision of what the future could be, but I didn't like the character of Rick Deckard at all. I couldn't feel anything for him except dislike. There were also quite a few times in the book where I had to stop, scratch my head, and then re-read the passage, and it still didn't quite make sense to me. (Or as I like to call them, my \\"Huh?\\" moments.)  I can see how this influenced cyberpunk and later sci-fi authors, and I appreciate this novel for that, but it just didn't work for me.  I read this quite a while after I had seen the movie, and I liked them both about the same.  The book and the movie are significantly different from each other, and Deckard follows different paths to achieve the same goal of \\"retiring\\" (killing) the androids.  I thought that paths were interesting, just not interesting enough.
030726999X|5.0|Loved this one more than I did \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  It's a pity Larsson died so soon, I would've loved to read more about Salander's endeavors.<br />Btw, definitely watch the Swedish movie version for the entire trilogy. Stays very close to the book and Noomi Rapace,who playes Lisbeth, is a right-on Salander.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Ordering was easy, and the movie I was ordering was just what I was looking for. Transit time was quick.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Great movie love Quintin !
0812973992|5.0|A very fine read. Highly inventive and quite extraordinary in its ability to present an alternative (and very brave) way of living one's life, and changing the lives of those both in proximity and much less so.  If you have a creative soul and believe in the old \\"safety in numbers, more fun, too\\" adage (also described by the B-52s as \\"others like you,\\" don't hesitate -- order this one up straight away.
0307454541|3.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" loosely falls within the crime genre of \\"police procedural,\\" though the alluring procedures described here are of the journalistic and (even more) of the computer variety. As viewers of the TV series \\"24\\" well know, nothing is sexier than technology.<br /><br />But that is not to say that sex of the more prosaic variety is lacking in Stieg Larsson's trilogy (of which this book forms the first volume). The protagonist, reporter Mikael Blomkvist, is carrying on a multi-decade affair with his married colleague, Erika Berger (approved of by her art-historian husband), while also sleeping with a 50-odd-year old suspect as well as the novel's namesake, the girl with the dragon tattoo herself, the underdeveloped idiot savant Lisbeth Salanger.<br /><br />For her part, Lisbeth, having been abused as a child, sleeps with other older men as well as with women her own age (early 20s, though most people identify her as a teenager). When one piles this polymorphousness on top of the litany of Swedish names and places, one is led to the conclusion that at least part of the extreme popularity of this book and the two that follow derives from a certain exoticism that comes from the European panache plus the Scandinavian reputation for looseness.<br /><br />It's a dynamite combination, if more than a tad degrading to the female characters. I'm in the middle of the sequel, which shows that I'm hooked in spite of myself. A good vacation book; not literature.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Outstanding movie. Very good portrayal of what really happened when black september hit the munich olympic games in 1972.  That event not only shocked the nation but also was the reason most of the worlds elite counterterrorist units were formed, except the SAS. They have been a round since the 50's and helped train most of the units. All in all I would watch this movie over and over again. Thank you Mr. Spielberg.
B002U6CJCO|1.0|Positives:   (1.) Jean-Claude is looking healthier which is good to see.   Negatives:  (1.) I knew the movie was in trouble the second I saw the \\"indestructible\\" fighters putting on soccer shin guards -  OK?  (2.) The action scenes were like from a '90s video game with soldiers running in open spaces of the now well worn & tiresome abandoned industrial plant set, how original, and up stair cases yelling like banshees while being torn apart by fake, evenly spaced, ground flash explosives meant to represent rocket/grenade launches. Or, being annihilated by rapid fire firearms with unlimited ammo - please, that is so old special effects.   (3.) The combat consultant had the soldiers going around corners with weapons drawn and turning like they were in slow motion molasses - very lame. In fact the way they moved I thought they were 80 year old actors with CGI to make them look younger.   (4.) The dialogue was the same old, old-school military Hollywood jargon one always hears in movies but in actual warfare is ridiculously out of place.
B003TOH8AE|5.0|I would give a 4-4.5.  It's not at all what you're expecting when you look at the cast and movie box, but this movie was definately worth watching.  Something different, unique, with a good storyline and great action scenes with a little bit of humor mixed in.
B003VB5D84|5.0|So far, it seems that the reviews are focused on the Fathom movie release, not the actual DVD itself.  Do we know for sure that the Fathom movie is a subset of what Rhino is releasing as the DVD?  I don't necessarily think so.  And I expect much better editing from the Rhino DVD (as with previous Crossroads DVDs).  The movie was worth my $12.50 and I would pay 10 times the $29.95 for the DVD, especially if it included the entire day.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" isn't in the same exalted ranks as \\"The Sopranos\\", but it's good enough and different enough to easily get five stars.<br /><br />Vince Gilligan, the series' creator, says it can be viewed as a comedy, and the first two episodes are blackly funny throughout. The tone is Hitchcockian, and Gilligan borrows freely from The Master, even going back as far as \\"The Lodger\\". I leave it to you to find the other references and takings. (The following episodes are more-fitfully funny, with the theft of the methylamine being the most-broadly humorous.)<br /><br />The most-obvious Hitchcockian element is having the audience thoroughly identify with the character we /aren't/ supposed to identify with -- Walter White. He didn't /need/ to cook meth -- his former business partner would have covered his medical expenses -- but he does it anyway.

B003O85W3A|5.0|Arcade Fire's music takes me back to a special time in my life: I'd rush out of my cookie cutter suburban home and buy the latest release from from my favorite bands. The magic and meaning of The Smiths, U2, The Cure, Radiohead etc. gave me a sense of sanity in an insane world. Arcade Fire's latest, The Suburbs, will give thoughtful youngsters of today similar thrills, spills and chills.<br /><br />Win Butler sings his shattered heart out amongst the ruins of modern life. In his mind the safety of the suburbs is a myth. Our honest thoughts tell us he is right. Our eyes can see the damage done with more danger ahead. Win spews thoughtful lines like \\"as I hide inside my private prison\\" as well as beautiful ones, \\"Now the cities we live in could be distant stars and I search for you in every car.\\"<br /><br />The styles range from an almost Neil Young-like Wasted Hours to the early rock riffing of Month of May. One must not forget the ethereal gems sung by Regine Chassagne. Empty Room and The Sprawl II are epic and awesome. She is the secret weapon that puts Arcade Fire on top of the rock heap.<br /><br />In an age when music listeners are force fed chest thumpin' hip hop, predictable pop and generic country, Arcade Fire are here today to blaze out of one's iPod and save rock (indie or otherwise.)
B001DJLCRC|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" isn't in the same exalted ranks as \\"The Sopranos\\", but it's good enough and different enough to easily get five stars.<br /><br />Vince Gilligan, the series' creator, says it can be viewed as a comedy, and the first two episodes are blackly funny throughout. The tone is Hitchcockian, and Gilligan borrows freely from The Master, even going back as far as \\"The Lodger\\". I leave it to you to find the other references and takings. (The following episodes are more-fitfully funny, with the theft of the methylamine being the most-broadly humorous.)<br /><br />The most-obvious Hitchcockian element is having the audience thoroughly identify with the character we /aren't/ supposed to identify with -- Walter White. He didn't /need/ to cook meth -- his former business partner would have covered his medical expenses -- but he does it anyway. Gilligan enhances our sympathy for Walter by surrounding him with thoroughly unlikeable and/or stupid people * -- his sister-in-law (a shoplifter), his brother-in-law (a macho DEA cop), his drug-dealer associate (who, as they say, couldn't pour piss from a boot if the instructions were printed on the bottom), and worst of all, his wife.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I didn't think I could like Legend of the Seeker any more than I already did after seeing the first season. But I was wrong. The second season has great new characters, and further development of existing ones. As always, the costumes and scenery are breath-taking and the storylines are entertaining. Once again, there is an overall 'quest' to be carried out, but each episode can stand alone, with interesting little side quests along the way to keep things interesting. Both the cast and crew do an amazing job to make this one of the best quality shows on tv in recent years.

I was disappointed to discover that so many of the Austen continuations were basically bodice-rippers in disguise.

This is also very easy to put in a shirt pocket for inconspicuous carry.
B002K8BLSA|4.0|This is the Prefab album I've been waiting years to hear! Simply fantastic in every way. The lyrics are poignant, the arrangements are spartan but effective, and Paddy's voice is wonderful as ever. If you are a Sprout fan and don't have this yet: WHY NOT? This one makes up for lost time in a very big way. Here's hoping Paddy will release more fine efforts like this in the years to come. Very highly recommended!
B003ITZBW2|4.0|`Under the Red Hood' has a huge advantage going for it in that it's working from a great storyline with mountains of emotional potential. The plot harkens back to 1988 when the Joker (with the help of thousands of DC fans) killed the then current Boy Wonder, Jason Todd. In the comic Jason was brutally bludgeoned with a crowbar before being killed from an explosion. The film doesn't shy away from extreme violence including a thug who gets immolated on his own Molotov cocktail and I was impressed with how accurately they retained the comic death. One change that did bother me was the redesign of the red hood itself and that I cannot understand. The classic design of the red hood is very distinctive, carries a ton of history and shouldn't have been altered. But c'est la vie, I guess we just have to live with it.<br /><br />** Possible Spoilers **<br />I don't know if spilling that the Red Hood IS Jason Todd is considered a spoiler since it's well established in the comics in a storyline that continues to this day and quite frankly Batman figures it out before the halfway point of the movie. The basic premise of the movie is that Jason Todd has returned as the titular Red Hood and has decided to manage crime his own way by becoming the crime boss of Gotham City. This is an interesting concept that that was used by Alan Moore in The League of Extraordinary Gentleman although it's quite a bit less fleshed out here. In fact the only crime Red Hood even commits (besides wanton killing) is extortion from the various criminal heads. He starts a war with the hyper aggressive current crime boss of Gotham City, Black Mask, but the war is only a means to an end and exists just to move the plot forward towards the films Raison d'être; the bringing together of Jason, Batman and the Joker.<br /><br />The movie culminates in a spectacular battle between Batman and Jason which is choreographed (or I guess storyboarded) brilliantly. My only complaint is that Batman dishes out enough punishment that in the real world Jason Todd would be dead again five times over. The film climaxes with a powerful speech by Jason on the absurdity of allowing the Joker to continue to live after all the people he's killed (particularly Jason himself). There is one little problem with this scene. Batman is supposed to be right but Jason is the one making all the sense. As a die hard liberal I can unashamedly say that the Joker should be put down like a rabid dog. In the real world Batman's noble views on vigilante killing would be fine because society would take care of the Joker but in Gotham City the justice systems revolving door leaves Batman little choice. The idea is that if Batman kills just once he's started down that slippery slope and there's no going back which makes sense but why not just walk away when Jason offers to do the deed.<br /><br />The animation is inconsistent ranging from very good to about what you'd get on a television program. Luckily it's good at the important moments and the fights in particular are well done. I don't have a problem with violence and killing but I do take issue when it's gratuitous and the movie definitely skirted the edge of gratuitous if not plunging straight over. My final issue was the fact the there really is no plot resolution in the end and that's a tough one to swallow. I would probably wait for the price to get around $10 for this one because I just think it has a bit of room for improvement.nishment that in the real world Jason Todd would be dead again five times over.

031237593X|5.0|I first read this book quite a few years ago, and it's one of those rare books that I pull out and read again every few years. (along with Stephen Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, but that's another story).    And every time I'm pulled into the amazing world that Sharon Penman has created.    Every time, I cry at the end, even though I know how it's going to end.  You cannot help but get totally absorbed in the world that is written about, and in the people in this book.  They are good, bad, ugly, pretty, but above all REAL.      This is most definitely one of the best books I have EVER read and re-read.      If you want gritty realistic historical fiction, and are tired of sappy romantic drivel, this is most definitely the author to read - and this is one of her best books (although the others all come pretty close!).
B003CF0XDE|5.0|SHUBERT-What's not to like?<br /><br />Ordinarily, back in days not so long ago three separate single compact discs in their plastic jewel boxes would set you, the buyer, back some forty-five dollars.  Their cost would be even more money if the music was not on sale. This was the status quo, the rule rather than the exception for a good number of years, especially during the early years in which compact discs made their initial appearance in the retailing marketplace. I mention this because during the time, Schubert's three greatest song cycles:  Die Schone Mullerin, Schwanengesang, and Winterreisse<br /><br />In this case with the Schubert Lieder, there are twenty-one Deutsche Grammophon compact discs with hundreds of Franz Schubert songs for male voice and piano, including the aforementioned (on the last three compact discs!), tucked away in cardboard sleeves in this neat little box.<br /><br />This is at least the third incarnation for the Schubert LIEDER with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau with Gerald Moore performing the piano, released by DG to commemorate DFD's eighty fifth birthday.  The earlier releases were issued at a much greater cost, with the most recent release prior to this one for DFD's seventy fifth costing double the price of this one.<br /><br />Technically, to me the recordings sound resonant and clear.  DFD was well at ease and at home with these recordings captured in his prime with the originally recorded songs, from the late 1960s-early 1970s.<br /><br />Admittedly, lieder is not for everyone, but I am sure that its partisans believe that ultimately, in classical music at least, it ought to be.  I had the aforementioned three cycles already with another performer on another label, together with some lieder by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and Schumann.  This collection, which I would add amounts to hundreds of songs for male (not female) voice and piano, is the best which I have had experience of hearing so far.  For die hard, never say quit Schubert lieder fans collecting there is only one set available on Hyperion which compares to or arguably exceeds the breadth of this set and includes lieder for female voice, as well, on forty compact discs, for six times the price of this one (just over forty dollars or the price of three full priced compact discs).<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Franz-Schubert-Complete-Songs/dp/B000B8657S/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1281062792&sr=1-10<br /><br />The bottom line is what is there not to like about this set?  DG has compensated somewhat for what would have been the missing translations to the songs by enabling downloading into a file from their web site.<br /><br />Track List<br /> CD 1: Schubert: Lieder<br />1  Eine Leichenphantasie, D. 7 [19:16]<br />2  Der Vaterm&ouml;rder, D. 10 [5:40]<br />3  Der J&uuml;ngling am Bache, D. 30 [3:30]<br />4  Totengr&auml;berlied, D. 44 [2:15]<br />5  Die Schatten, D. 50 [2:43]<br /> Sehnsucht, D. 52<br />6  Ach, aus dieses Tales Gr&uuml;nden [4:11]<br />7  Verkl&auml;rung, D.59 [3:29]<br />8  Pensa, che questo istante, D. 76 [2:17]<br />9  Der Taucher, D. 77 [23:54]<br />10  Andenken, D. 99 [1:42]<br />11  Geistern&auml;he, D. 100 [3:40]<br />12  Erinnerung (Totenopfer), D. 101 [2:23]<br />  Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Gerald Moore<br />Total Playing Time [1:15:00]<br /><br /> CD 2: Schubert: Lieder<br /> 1  Trost.

B0035J6TAI|5.0|Although somewhat of a departure for Peter Gabriel, a sparse covers album, this is another collect that grows with every listen.  Many of the tracks are challenging if you are familiar with the originals, but that is not to say they are bad, just different. These are genuine interpretations. All the arrangements are understated, leaving it to the rich and earthy tones of Gabriel's voice to provide the emotional weight. Personal favourites include \\"Listening Wind\\", \\"Flume\\" and \\"The Power of the Heart\\". Enjoy
0061122416|3.0|Charming little tale of fate, will, luck, & spiritual enlightenment.  Symbolism galore with subtle religious references.  Offers an insight into one's purpose on earth and reason to live, as well as urges others to discover their \\"personal legend\\".*
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|\\"Bubble Gum Goth\\"? I like that term. But I probably differ from a previous reviewer in that I think it describes a sound that should be celebrated, admired, and strived for - not dismissed as teenybopper pop. However, I agree in retrospect that much of the Cure's mid-80s output now sounds tiresome and a bit dated.    So \\"Disintegration\\" not only marked a solid return to form for the band, but a career-defining piece of musical genius which effortlessly melded many of their previous styles into a cohesive whole. It still sounds great today, including the classic \\"Love Song\\" and under-rated \\"Fascination Street\\" - name another tune which so effectively combines such a hugely massive wall of layered intertwined guitar parts into a pop song that got significant radio and MTV interplay at the time, but seems almost forgotten today.    And yes, the album really helped take their live shows to a totally higher level. That 5 piece lineup was operating like a well-oiled machine in concert between '89 and '92 and could do no wrong as a live band at that time. Their live shows are not even close today. Bring back Boris! (and the Fender guitars while they're at it)
B0037QGS0A|3.0|If Ivan Reitman made a French movie this is what you would get.  Naughty but a little too heavy-handed.  Its entertaining because the acting is great and the actors are beautiful to look at.  But I never really believed what I was watching was real.  I would agree that if you cannot see what's going to happen to Chloe, within the first 15-20 minutes, this could be quite intriguing.
B001LF347E|5.0|We like the legend of King Arthur. This is a fabulous show and great new take on the beginning of Arthur and Merlin. Each show adds to the character depth and you can see how the experiences are changing Arthur and Merlin. They do not portray choices as simple black and white and mistakes are made with consequences. We find it interesting that both start out young as we are used to seeing Merlin (in other stories)as a much older. Our family watches this show together and first caught it on Scifi channel. I was quite happy to see Anthony Head (who we also loved as Giles) in a key role, albeit an imperfect king Uther. I personally like the fact that the female characters are also strong and not just damsels in distress.<br />We bought the first season and will buy the second when available.  I kind of wish it was available in blu-ray but it looks good on our large screen in it's regular format. We also enjoyed the special features.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|December 28th, 2009. Every A7X fan knows the significance. The saddest day imaginable in the bands history and also for it's fan base. It seemed unreal. Unbelievable. But after the shock, there was no stopping having to accept the inevitable. The Rev was gone. And who knew what would happen next.     However, A7X having just written a new record with Jimmy \\"the rev\\" Sullivan, they felt it would be an insult to Jimmy not to go on and at least put out the record. A tribute to his memory, to his genius, to the man he was. \\"Nightmare\\" is what we got.     Nightmare originally was designed to be a concept album. To take the listener on a wild ride through the depths of hell and death. But after the death of Jimmy, it proved to become a totally different animal. Only this new design seems to express solely the bands heartbreak at the loss of their brother. Every song seems to either allude to, or completely confront the passing of Jimmy.     For this reason alone, A7X deserves praise. Finding a way to forge ahead and make a record written in great part by Jimmy, without him behind the drum set for the first time is amazing in itself. The music that follows, is even more amazing.     NIGHTMARE 5/5  The title track and first single is classic A7X in every way. It is obvious that this song would have set the tone for the concept album tracking. But either way, its an outstanding song.     WELCOME TO THE FAMILY 4/5  Has a good grind to it. M. Shadows begins to show just how much he continues to improve his vocals.    DANGER LINE 3/5  It's a decent song, but does not seem to mesh well with the rest of the album.    BURIED ALIVE 5/5  This is where it starts to get interesting. The first song to me that begins to address the loss of Jimmy. Midway through it starts sounding like something on \\"Death Magnetic\\".     NATURAL BORN KILLER 5/5  Amazing song. The speed and precision on this song is something rarely seen from A7X before. Shadows vocals continue to impress. The drumming ofMike Portnoy should be much appreciated.     SO FAR AWAY 4/5  Sounds a little bit like a country song, so it is pretty cool.     GOD HATES US 5/5  Straight up ass kicker. Great riffs after the intro. Shadows growls like he never has before.     VICTIM 5/5  Okay, this is where the record goes from amazing, to mindblowing for me. It begins with a Bullet for my Valentine type guitar intro, to angelic vocal solos, to Shadows ballady serenade. This song is where Shadows just pulls out all the stops and throws his feelings out there. To be honest, this song brought me to tears, because it honestly feels like and open letter from Shadows to Jimmy. His vocals are pristine, perfect, and probably the most impressive he has ever done. You could call this song the \\"seize the day\\" of the record. Great guitar solos and great all around. Shadows ends with repeating the plea \\"im missing you, im missing you\\". Bone chilling.    TONIGHT THE WORLD DIES 2/5  The only song that didn't do much for me. Just a personal opinion though.     FICTION   This song.. wow, where do I begin? This was the last song that Jimmy turned in for the record. He turned it in on Christmas Day 2009 saying, okay guys this is it, this is the last song. 3 days later, he died. Who knew that this song would seemingly forecast his own death. It's like he knew he didn't have much time left, and he was saying goodbye. The lyrics clearly relate Jimmy saying goodbye and letting everyone know that it would be okay to move on without him. A wonderful piano riff to begin the song. The coolest, and also most heart breaking part of the song is where Jimmy's demo vocals are included before a couple of choruses. This also brought me to tears, but at least it is a way for the listener to have one last experience with Jimmy. One more way his music touches us very deeply. Yes, this was definitely his masterpiece. I'd say, it is one of the most amazing and special songs ever written. I want to give it a 1/5 because, it means thatJimmy is really gone. But, being as how that is not fair and the song is so amazing, I give it a 13..    SAVE ME 5/5  Just listen to it. Great end to a wonderful album.    All in all, This is A7X best work to date. They took an unspeakable tragedy and made something beautiful out of it. The Rev is probably in heaven jamming out to his opus as we speak. This record is Use Your Illusion 3 if there was such a thing. This is what Axl Rose probably was shooting for when he wanted to make Chinese Democracy, but he just isn't good enough. Avenged Sevenfold at this moment after this work, is the greatest band in the world. Will they remain that? Their future is uncertain, I doubt they even know what the future holds. But the important thing is, they are now.. and their brother would be very proud of them. If this is indeed the last record, what a way to finish..

B0036TGSR6|3.0|Yes, the acting and production values are awesome, but the plot itself is all about America bashing, and it really makes one squirm.  In essence, the USA is the implausible villian in this piece and it really grates on one's nerves to see such a biased account of a nunaced issue that is a life and death concern for all of us. Then again, it's Roman Polanksi, and his antagonism towards this country is well-know.  So.. it winds up as a well-acted propaganda piece that will met with the approval of the many viewers who may share its jaundiced world view.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This product was brand new, great quality! Even better was the price for a blu-ray! Especially one that is highly coveted by Final Fantasy fans. This product would usually be much more expensive.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I read this book in paperback and am now rereading it on Kindle. What a disgrace! There are multiple typos / conversion problems in every chapter (random format changes i.e. italics or bold). Very distracting. Whichever company converted this to Kindle should start over.
0061122416|1.0|Following your dreams is important, so I agree with the purported premise of the book; but I found it offensively, condescendingly simplistic. I don't care if it's a fable, it was written as if it was meant for third-graders. I also have a problem with material wealth being the coveted reward for spiritual awakening. The book is also sexist, the only female being a cipher who waits patiently for her man to complete his quest, apparently with no dreams of her own. The main character is completely self-absorbed, concerned only with achieving wealth and getting the girl of his dreams. At the end of his quest, where is the reunion with his family? They are never mentioned again. Weird. I think it would fit on the shelf nicely between The Secret and The Law of Attraction.

The books are enormously enjoyable for their excruciating attention to detail. While some may refer to Larsson's \\"narrative excess\\", I say bring it on. Everything seems completely believable, no matter how wild the leap he asks you, dear reader, to take. And so, I leapt joyfully - Sweden, Australia, Russia, the US - the narrative circles the globe.     One of my favorite dimensions of the book is Steig Larsson's ability to portray nuanced inter-personal dynamics, in the police force, or at a magazine's office, and make the inner workings of these organizations accessible to completely naive readers (like me). The book is also a fascinating portrayal of current urban swedish society - the names, attitudes, politics and interactions are telling, and more detailed than that of many other Scandinavian crime writers. My only quibble with the writing is that the emotional depth of some characters, particularly a couple women, is not convincing. Bloomkvist's vibrant sex life is almost a caricature. I will confess that the third novel felt like the weakest link. Salander's emergence as a \\"normal\\" person was slightly anti-climactic. I am going to attribute it to her head injury! Her sister Camilla, is a loose end, one that perhaps was supposed to foreshadow a fourth novel. The audiobook version works well for the most part. The narrator does not seem to use too many scandinavian accents. Salander had a really unusual accent.  Minor quibbles aside, I heart the Millenium Trilogy.

B0008ENIAC|5.0|This is one of the best Joan Crawford movies and is terrific to boot.  Joan plays a mother with an obsessive love for her older daughter.  The daughter constantly rejects her and Mildred gives her just about anything she wants including the girl's choice of stepfather.  Joan portrays a strong woman who goes from being impoverished with a loafing husband who doesn't work to a waitress and later a restaurant owner.  A great woman's part and Joan is terrific in it.

B00000IGGA|2.0|You know how sometimes an artist will come out with an album that the critics suggest is merely a self-parodic gesture, a give-the-people-what-they-want work?  The Rolling Stone magazine review of Bloodflowers by the Cure comes to mind. Well, Mule Variations is just such an album.  This is the sound of Tom Waits coasting.  This is Tom Waits giving the people what he thinks they expect from him.  On this album you've got a little bit of everything that people have come to associate with Waits, but none of it done as well as in earlier days.  You've got the depressing country songs, the \\"Going Out West-\\"type song, the screeching nonsense.  The only thing missing is the big band stuff.  None of it is done with the same panache and creativity as on previous albums. It's just a make-time album, the act of a man bored with his own career.

0385504225|2.0|Also pedantic and -- heavens forbid -- boring. THE LOST SYMBOL should have stayed lost. The characters make Al Gore look like an action figure as they plod and wade through the treacle of a plot as subtly foreshadowed as with a bulldozer or sledgehammer. Dan Brown, the Prince of Thrill, has achieved the anti-thriller.<br /><br />Parodying a line from Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, Brown \\"mouths his verse and moans his tragedy, and heaves up -- Ugh! -- like a hod-carrier, lines that ought to soar on their own wings.\\" Or, as Willie put it in his Scottish play, it \\"is a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\"<br /><br />Which is too bad. I liked all of Brown's previous books -- especially THE DA VINCI CODE -- and looked forward to reading this one but found it less interesting than a three-hour freshman lecture on the love-life of protozoa, grass growing, or the only DeMolay ritual I attended.

B002NPUCP8|4.0|AT A GLANCE:Young Australian guitarist, with awesome style and a half decent voice, delivering her first industry produced CD, that launches her into the pop market with a bang.Taking the first steps in cementing a career that could go anywhere.A collection in two parts, with the rockier guitar shredding of the last half of the tracks to turn your head and make you sit up and listen clearly eclipsing the commerical friendly pap of the first half.Worth a listen if you like a genuine rocking guitar lick, from a genuinely talented young female up and comer, in the popular music genre. Rating :3 1/2 - 4 stars<br /><br />This is one of those careers that could develop into anything, if handled properly, and not swamped by overly high expectations and media hype.This is the second CD from Orianthi, after the surprising, \\"Violet Journey\\" but the first really serious attempt to crack a listening market.She was the child guitarist at 16 years old who could write all the songs, play all instruments, produce, mix and sing all vocals on \\"Violet Journey\\". It was easy to be swept away that she was the next Santana,or Clapton or whatever and ahead of her time.A few years have passed and she has been noticed, and exposed to international scrutiny on the recent Grammy Awards and sought after by the King of Pop himself.<br />She now has talent in spades as a guitarist (being only 24 years old) and a decent if not outstanding vocal range.<br /><br />I agree that if you are going to review her work, do not compare her to guitar legends, of the past or present, in unrelated fields who are twenty to thirty or even forty years her senior.She is not strictly rock or blues or funk but an evolving mixture of styles.She has the immediate appeal to the MTV generation X and Y ers,and something that makes a picky old middle aged person like myself see something on offer here, if managed correctly from now on.She can deliver a shredding chord feast and can make the guitar cry or sing with out any apparent trouble.It is unfair to expect her to exhibit all the experience,interpretation and grit of hardened players, when we should be congratulating her on delivering a well worked and listenable pop/ rock CD.<br /><br />In saying that, I must point out that you will go a long way to find a 24 year old, or older for that matter, that can joust with Steve Vai so competently, and blow you away as she does on \\"Highly Strung\\".This is clearly the highlight for me on this CD.So many glimpses of brilliance here that she teases the listener into expecting that the next CD will be fantastic.<br /><br />However, the second half of this CD is much better than the first, Or is it that I cannot warm to the pop formula rock chick stretch of the first 4 or five songs?\\"According to You\\" is a pop song pitched to the adolescent broken hearted/disappointed teen and for download off the net/radio play, not to my generation or the serious adult listening public.This in itself, is not fatal for the CD, but if she wants to  develop and hold an audience she will have to move on in style and substance.Hence, my favouring of the second half songs which are, grittier, rockier, a little bluesier and showcasing the guitar sensation. The first half , forgettable songs as they are the same and can be produced by anyone who can play a guitar and has a clever producer and managing agent and an eye for the mass market. Here today gone tomorrow.<br /><br />I would like to listen to the second version of \\"Believe II\\" and see if the new songs show a development and not merely a clever marketing ploy to cash in on the promise shown at the Grammy Awards and the hype surronding the death of Michael Jackson.<br /><br />Orianthi is a work in progress, and certainly has the potential to be a truely great artist and sought after as a session guitarist, but just not yet. She is paying her dues ,but watch this one for the future. I will give a 4 star rating based on the promising and excellent second half of the CD.

0061711292|4.0|I enjoyed The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and would definitely recommend it. At first, I thought it would be a charming coming-of-age story about a group of privileged girls and their adoring teacher. It is, in fact, much more complex and enigmatic than that. It takes place in 1930s Edinburgh, between the two world wars. The rise of Fascism in Europe serves as a historical backdrop as well as a parallel to Miss Brodie's attempts to control the lives of others.    Spark shows us how the older generation has been marked by WWI (Miss Brodie lost her fiancé, Mr. Lloyd lost his arm, and many of the teachers seem to be hardened by life and suffering). In contrast to some of the other teachers and the headmistress, Miss Brodie is a passionate woman; she is a great believer in art, music, and is full of romantic notions that she seeks to impress upon her chosen students. However, Miss Brodie has a dark, manipulative, self-centered side as well. She seeks to influence her clique of students to do her bidding and this leads to her ultimate undoing.
1843794411|5.0|I had not read THE CONVENIENT MARRIAGE before this new Naxos Audiobooks recording happily landed on my doorstep.  I will confess all up front. I did the unthinkable. I read the complete plot synopsis on Wikipedia before I delved into the first chapter. *horrors*  Don't even think about following my example.  It will spoil the most enjoyable aspect of this novel - surprise!<br /><br />THE CONVENIENT MARRIAGE is one of Georgette Heyer's more popular Georgian-era rom-com's, and for good reason.  It has all the requisite winning elements: a wealthy and eligible hero, a young naïve heroine, greedy relatives, a scheming mistress and a revengeful rake.  Add in a duel, a sword fight, highway robbery, abduction, switched identities and scandalous behavior, and you are in for comedic high jinxes and uproarious plot twists.  As I laughed out loud at the preposterous plot machinations in the synopsis, I thought to myself, \\"How does Heyer do it? How can she take us on such an outrageously wild ride and make it believable?\\" I was soon to find out.<br /><br />Handsome and elegant Marcus Drelincourt, Earl of Rule, is comfortable in his bachelorhood. At thirty-five his sister Lady Louisa Quain urges him to marry, suggesting the beautiful Elizabeth Winwood. She is from an aristocratic family of good pedigree but little fortune. With two unmarried younger sisters, prim Charlotte and impulsive Horatia, and their self-indulgent elder brother Pelham (about as much help to his family as a rainstorm at a picnic), she must marry well. Lady Winwood is thrilled when the Earl agrees to marry Elizabeth and save the family from destitution. Seventeen-year old Horatia is not. Presenting herself at the Earl's doorstep she boldly offers herself to him in exchange for her elder sister who is in love with Lieutenant Edward Heron. Horry proposes a marriage of convenience to Lord Rule with the promise that she will not interfere with him after they are married. She does not bring much to the bargain. Not only is she poor, she does not possess her sister's beauty, and  she stutters. Intrigued by this young, brave girl, he is tempted and soon sees the logic, agreeing to her proposal.<br /><br />The new Countess of Rule wastes no time in becoming the sensation of the bon ton dressing to the nines, attending parties, the opera, gambling huge sums and getting into all sorts of scrapes while her husband continues to pay attentions to his mistress Lady Caroline Massey. With patience and fortitude, Lord Rule councils his stubborn young bride against excess and the dangerous liaisons of Baron Robert Lethbridge, a known rake with a history with the Drelincourt family.<br /><br />Determined to teach her husband a lesson for his interference, she defies his wishes attending a masked ball. Escorted by Lethbridge, he sees their friendship as the perfect opportunity to ruin her reputation and punish Drelincourt for thwarting his elopement with his sister Louisa years before. Horry tempts Lethbridge with cards, bending his resistance by scandalously agreeing to offer a lock of her hair if he wins. Unbeknownst to Horry, her husband has followed her to the ball, overhears their conversation and intercedes by stepping on her dress and ripping it. While she is away he disposes of Lethbridge and exchanges his costume with his own. Returning, Horry loses badly at cards and must give Lethbridge/Rule his winnings. Penitent, she concedes the bet which is met with a stolen kiss. Furious, Horry rushes away running into Lady Caroline Massey who recognizes her. Certain that her husband's mistress will reveal to him that his wife was at the ball, she confesses all to him first. The Earl in turn reveals his charade. Discovering that he has fallen in love with his wife, how will he court and convince her that love is much better than a marriage of convenience?<br /><br />Heyer's characterizations just sparkle and shine. This May/December relationship presents great opportunity for difference in opinion and blunder. If Horry had not been an impulsive, stubborn seventeen-year old there would have been little conflict and no story. Lord Rule's patience in dealing with his teenage bride commanded respect, endearing us to him by opening up the possibility of the love relationship that we hope for.  This delightful romp was made all the more enjoyable by this new audio recording by British stage and screen actor Richard Armitage. This is his third foray into Georgette Heyer for Naxos Audiobooks. His skill at unique characterization and resonant, velvetly voice transports the listener like Cinderella to the Ball. Unfortunately, once the story ends, so does the enchantment. My solution was to start it again. For me, a new audio recording combining fanciful storyteller Georgette Heyer and the sultry and seductive voice of Richard Armitage is like la petite mort. Hopefully they are not few and far between.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenprosebeen an impulsive, stubborn seventeen-year old there would have been little conflict and no story.

006145205X|3.0|Ridley's initial premise of exchange being the lifeblood of prosperity and advancement is engaging. His attention to interdisciplinary evidence from evolutionary biology to economicsn allows him to present a reasonable amount of evidence to build upon his idea. His evidence at times however appears quite selective and often it seems that Ridley attempts to fit evidence to his story rather then the other way around.<br /><br />Given the time-scale Ridley addresses in this book, basically the ascent of man to present, the problem of appropriating suitable evidence is inherently impossible given the multiple epochs he focuses on. While noting the book is targeted to general intellectual appeal Ridely's main flaw is that he tries to take on too much. One could additionally be sceptical of using an initial concept of exchange to solve or explain so many global problems. When all you have is a hammer.....<br /><br />Sparse engagement from an evolutionary economics or an institutional perspective is a final criticism one should have. Despite this Ridley's thesis of exchange is interesting.
0061714372|4.0|Ignore the review by JD posted here, Apparently, he/she did not read the memoir carefully. Dave Mustaine's self centeredness, bitterness, and immoral ways are commented upon by Dave himself and he does hold himself accountable for his actions/sins. When Dave Mustaine talks about how \\"he did not care,\\" he's talking about how he felt at the time, about himself in the past, not about how he feels now that he's a changed man and returned to a moral life. His full recovery and return to God are not brought to light until almost the very end of the book. That's the point to show the contrast of who he was with who he is now. Nowhere does Dave Mustaine say he can do no wrong. He lays everything on the line very candidly about all his wrongdoing: the drugs, the relapses, the neglect (for himself and family), his selfishness, etc. Over and over again he points out how he does not blame others but himself. As far as Metallica goes, any bitterness that resides there is demonstrated because (1)they stole/took credit for many of his songs, (2)Lars Ulrch ambushed him into being filmed for the Metallica documentary and after protesting to have his part removed from the film, was ignored,(3)most importantly, he was never given a second chance whereas with Megadeth he gave his bandmates many chances the fix their lives since he too needed to straighten up. Everything Dave Mustaine says here is said in a very matter of fact way. The most touching part of this memoir, for me personally, was the description of how he finally came back to God, how he got his family back, and now understands the most important thing in his life are his family and God.

It was more humorous than I expected, with much of the comedic relief provided by Topher Grace and Walton Goggins, and had all the action I could've asked for and more.  What I was surprised at was the amount of tension and suspense built up during the first 45 minutes or so.  Although those of us familiar with the Predator films knew what we were expecting, Predators did a great job of causing us to fear that revealing as much as we were anticipating it.  Very well done all around.  I did think the ending came a bit abruptly, but I am anxiously awaiting a sequel.

B00005JMUA|3.0|KILL BILL VOLUME TWO is really the first film where Tarantino's &#34;all-talk-as-a-substitute-for action&#34; began to grow weary. In his masterful homage KILL BILL VOLUME ONE, Tarantino did something entirely different from his previous films...he went minimal on the dialogue and let the action dominate the tale; in his previous films, long scenes of dialogue would build the tension into a surprising crescendo of violence. VOLUME ONE went the opposite direction...extensive action scenes that were either interspersed with moments of levity (Bride and Vernita's fight coming to a comical halt after her daughter returns from school, the &#34;trix are for kids&#34; moment between The Bride and O'ren, The Bride stopping to whip the little Crazy 88 boy with her Hanzo sword); these were classic moments. And the dialogue in VOLUME ONE, what little there was, was immensely witty, original, snappy, and quotable. I'd say that VOLUME ONE has the most quotable dialogue of ANY Tarantino film! Sometimes, less is more. In VOLUME TWO, Tarantino goes back to his roots and this was not a good return for me.  Admittedly, the main cast (Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah) is excellent and do a great job of inhabiting their characters, but Tarantino really overdid it on the talking!  KILL BILL VOLUME TWO concludes the saga of The Bride (Thurman admirably reprising the role from ONE, but looking a lot less sexy than she was in ONE) on her quest to eliminate her fellow Deadly Viper Assassination Squad members Budd and Elle (Madsen and Hannah, who had cameos in ONE) and, of course, their leader Bill (Carradine in an assured performance). The opening scene fills in the gaps by detailing events prior to the wedding massacre. We finally get to see SEE the mercurial character Bill and Carradine's portrayal is the main reason I even remotely like this film at all. He manages to make Bill simultaneously lethal and sympathetic, an amazing feat. Actually, this opening sceneand the concluding scenes with Bill are the best of the film, but everything in between is a muddled mess.  While Madsen is very good as Budd, I felt like his chapter was the weakest. That scene at the strip club where he is a bouncer was completely UNNECESSARY. It just seemed like filler with a bunch of pseudo-real, stereotypical characters: the drunk, high foul-mouthed owner (who wasn't very convincing!), the aging bitchy stripper (who came across as just a bitch!). Also, how in the heck did The Bride (who obviously did her homework, honed her skills, and used her best instincts before she approached her targets in ONE (Vernita and O'Ren) let Budd get the upper hand on her, especially given that fact that she must have KNOWN that he knew she was coming (his brother Bill told him as soon as he found out she took down O'Ren and her army). Did she just think he'd be sitting there waiting for her to slash him with her Hanzo sword?! She's smarter (or at least I thought she was!) than this. Budd's outsmarting of The Bride is another amateur Tarantino trick disguised as a realistic moment. And, remember, this film, Part TWO, is supposed to be a more &#34;realistic&#34; representation of the Kill Bill universe, the counterpoint to the fantastical Part ONE.  Then there is the Pai Mei flashback, which ties in to how she will escape her current predicament. These scenes are OK, reminiscent of the kung fu 70s movies, but they seem a bit to &#34;obligatory&#34; with all these &#34;cool&#34; moments illustrating where she learned all those moves that she executed in ONE to take down her enemies in that film. Surviving the ordeal, during which time Elle kills Budd (in a perversely funny moment), then the Bride has the showdown with Elle (and we learn The Bride's real name in the process). Then, The Bride &#34;magically&#34; shows up at the doorstep of some guy named Esteban (Michael Parks, who played Earl Macgraw in ONE) who is yet ANOTHER former mentor of Bill and HAPPENS to know where she can find him! It is at this point when I realized that Tarantino really didn't have a plot or story for this film and that everything that happens is just a convenience to serve the plot to keep the film moving to it's obvious conclusion. As hard as it was for her to conquer her enemies in ONE, in TWO, everything was just too pat to be convincing.  Of course, the concluding scene between The Bride and Bill is extremely engrossing (mainly because of Carradine) and, if the overlong middle scenes had not been so monotonous and poor, it could in some way redeem this film, but 2 strong scenes do not a great film make! Ironically, for all the dialogue and speechifying in TWO, I was much more involved with and felt I knew more about the characters in the non-talkative, dialogue-lite part ONE! The characters in ONE jumped off the screen and left a lasting impression with me...not so much in TWO. Seems like many that say that TWO is better than ONE do so simply because it happens to contain more dialogue and is delves deeper into character, but it's just a bunch of characters talking and talking and at the end of it all, we still don't really know much of anything about them. The main characters in ONE are much more interesting, including The Bride ONE trumping The Bride TWO. Part ONE is good enough for me!

And rises to rhapsodic heights on page 241: '\\"You're chasing a MYTH!... The xxx is FICTION.\\"'    But on page 270 he does away with his doubt once and for all: '\\"...it is always referred to as the LEGEND of the xxx. LEGEND implies that it is mythical.\\"'     On page 359, shockingly, he admits: '\\"All night, I've had the feeling we're treating as reality a collection of myths and allegories.\\"' No! Say it ain't so! But then he delivers the killing blow: '\\"Maybe the inscription is pointing to a METAPHORICAL...\\"' Gosh, really? Well, that came out of nowhere. But on page 360 we gain a deeper insight as to why he may feel this way, when he reveals, '\\"it seems to be more METAPHORICAL than...\\"'    At this point  another character breaks in and tries to rap poor Langdon across the head. '\\"No, the map is quite real, I assure you. And it points to a very REAL location.\\"'    You'd think the emphasis on REAL would help Langdon to understand just how REAL it is. But no, there are some minds that even an overabundance of italics won't change.     On page 410 Langdon cleverly slips in, '\\"Apparently the xxx is more of a METAPHORICAL map than a geographic one.\\"'    And then on page 411 he reminds us, '\\"As I mentioned--'\\" did he mention it? I hadn't noticed, better remind me-- '\\"the map seems to be more FIGURATIVE than--\\"  \\"You're mistaken...\\"' says yet another character trying to point out what even the most brain-dead reader must have guessed by now. \\"The xxx is a REAL map. It points to a REAL location.\\"' If this sounds familiar, yes, these lines are nearly identical to the ones on page 360. Or rather, I should say, they ARE nearly identical.    But on page 557 there is no end of a shock when we discover '\\"There is no actual XXX. It's all a metaphor-- a SYMBOL of the xxx.\\"'     Okay, so by this point we're all pretty sure the xxx will turn out to be literal after all. But Langdon may still have just a little problem with this...    Page 612: '\\"The xxx... is not a legend. It is a REALITY.\\"  Langdon stared... \\"You're saying you believe the xxx is REAL... and that it has actual POWER?\\"'    Breakthrough! Maybe we can finally finish with the denial!    Or maybe not.    On page 614, Langdon says, '\\"this is an allegorical pictogram. Clearly its language is metaphorical and symbolic rather than literal.\\"'    Well. I didn't see that one coming, did you? Around page 618 Dan Brown despairs of getting the idea into our thick skulls using such subtle methods, and is driven to assure us outright that 'Langdon was having trouble taking any of this seriously'. And in case you still didn't understand, page 639 might mention that 'Langdon was having a hard time accepting it.'     Okay, I'm getting tired of typing out all these quotes.By the way, I left out the lines where Langdon is just referred to as a skeptic, or refuses to believe something, or says he's on a wild goose chase. I tried to only focus on the lines which made the specific point about the mystical pyramid quest being a metaphor (a METAPHOR) rather than a literal (LITERAL) quest.    And what is up with the annoying italics? Is it really necessary to emphasize that the desk was BEHIND the door, or that the pot is a PASTA pot, or that something fluttered AWAY from the room?    And then the science is just plain wrong. At one point a character seriously suggests that thoughts have mass, and... '\\"If a thought has mass, then a thought exerts gravity and can pull things towards it.\\"' Or, with a random and patronizing sprinkling of italics: '\\"And BECAUSE this grain of sand has mass, it therefore exerts GRAVITY.\\"' (As George Eliot put it, I hope that these italics assist the reader's comprehension.) I wouldn't mind the silliness of this whole thing if it weren't for the claim, made at the beginning of the book, that all the science is real. All I'm saying is, even if your thoughts could influence the world around you, they wouldn't do so through gravity. Not unless the power revealed by Noetic Science is something like the ablity to attract meteorites towards your head. I think there's a basic misunderstanding of the definition of gravity here.    My review's dragging on a bit, so I'll end it here. On the bright side, this book is a light read-- and even if you don't feel like reading it, you can use it for a game of 'Find the phrase with the most UNNECESSARY italics'. Play with your friends! It's fun! My favorite candidates are: \\"might I ask about the ETHICAL dilemma posed by your work?\\" (they weren't talking about any other kinds of dilemmas), '\\"it is worn by the Mason in charge of PROTECTING the xxx\\"' (they weren't talking about any other Masonic tasks), and '\\"As I'm sure you know, there is a historical and symbolic REASON\\"' (he neversuggested that there wasn't a reason, and as a matter of fact he already knows it, so why emphasize REASON? Your guess is as good as mine.)

B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)<br /><br />Ever since Memento hit the streets ten years ago (we'll not discuss Following, his boring first film, except to note in passing it's getting a theatrical re-release either later this year or next year), Christopher Nolan has been delivering popcorn films that have pretensions at real depth. Pretensions, yes, because while they're usually clever, looking closer reveals that there's not really much to be seen. And there's a small part of me that feels I should be castigating Nolan for this, in the same way I despise the Wachowski Brothers for the same sort of \\"it looks deep, but it's really not\\" they pulled in the Matrix movies. The difference is that, most of the time, Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker orders of magnitude better than the Wachowski Brothers, and his popcorn tastes a whole lot better. (Both of the exceptions, the aforementioned Following and the awful, awful 2002 remake of Insomnia, suffer from not pulling off the illusion of depth, rather than suffering from bad filmmaking.) Inception, both written and directed by Nolan (though I swear I heard somewhere a while ago that this is loosely based on a Philip K. Dick story; I just can't remember where I heard it, or which one), is the latest manifestation of this trend.<br /><br />Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio, taking a break from his longtime association with Martin Scorsese) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are extractors, guys who can slip into your subconscious and, essentially, spy on your thoughts. Obviously, this has a great deal of use in the industrial espionage arena, and as we open, they're trying to get the plans for a business expansion out of Saito (Ken Watanabe, who previously worked with Nolan on Batman Begins), an industrial magnate. After Arthur, who engineered the dream scenario (more on that later), screws up a small detail, Watanabe realizes that the dream is a dream, and the whole team is in jeopardy. It doesn't help that Mal (Marion Cotillard, recently of Nine), a projection of Cobb's, shows up to throw a monkeywrench into the works at the worst possible time. After they're back in the real world, however, Saito does the one thing most captains of industry don't think to do in real life--he's impressed enough to hire them. He tasks them with inception, the impossible (by conventional wisdom) task of planting a memory in someone's mind rather than extracting one. His offer: charges that prevent Cobb from returning to the United States will be wiped clean, and he will be able to return to the children he hasn't seen in years. Thus, Cobb and Arthur start putting together a team. First, they hire an architect, Ariadne (Juno's Ellen Page), to design the dreamscape. A fellow extractor who also happens to be a mercenary, Eames (RocknRolla's Tom Hardy). And a chemist, Yusuf (Avatar's Dileep Rao), who can make the compounds that will both keep the subject, Robert Fischer (28 Days Later...'s Cillian Murphy), asleep and stimulate his dreams. It's Eames who hits on the perfect avenue for inception: make Fischer himself believe he's a part of the team and that they're trying to get secrets from Fischer's father's right-hand man, Browning (Tom Berenger, who has been gone for far too long from blockbusters). And at the last minute, Saito insists on coming along as well...<br /><br />First off, how is it that I've been hearing about this movie for an entire year, I've seen trailers for it at least once a week for the past six months, and I had no idea that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of the best actors of his generation, was in it? Way to drop the ball, publicity department. For that matter, most people seem to have only heard \\"DiCaprio\\", \\"Page\\", and \\"Nolan\\", which seems an insult to the incredible cast assembled here, which also includes Pete Postlethwaite, Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, and a handful of other folks you'll recognize. But all is forgiven once butt is actually in seat and things start blowing up, because while,as I said before, Inception isn't nearly as deep a film as it wants to believe it is (or wants us to believe it is), it is an incredibly entertaining one. Upon reflection, I think the reason for this is that Nolan is just as good with a troop of A-listers as he was with a troop of B-listers in Memento; just as he got career-best performances out of folks like Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Guy Pearce, he whips a bunch of folks here into top form. This is (by far) Page's best performance since Hard Candy five years ago. DiCaprio and Levitt are always good, and DiCaprio has been turning in some monster performances since he finally shook off whatever slump he was in from 1997 through 2006, but this one ranks up there with What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and The Basketball Diaries. Murphy hasn't been this good since 28 Days Later.... Etc. And Nolan, of course, is a very, very good action director; there's CGI here, but it's used judiciously, and that alone in comparison to so many recent action films makes this stuff look real almost by default. Which is pretty impressive when one of your scenes involves folding Paris over like an omelet.<br /><br />I'm going to close out with much the same thing I said about Nolan's last film. As I write this, Inception is sitting on the IMDB Top 250 chart at #3, with a 9.1 rating. (Actually, all the top three films have a 9.1 rating; the others are The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. Which means it's actually tried for #1.) I think that's overstating the case, just as I thought the case was overstated with The Dark Knight (which, two years after its release, has slipped to #12, with an 8.8 rating), but not terribly much. There's no denying that Nolan is one of the best directors working today when he brings his A game, and he's arguably the best working today within the Hollywood system; anyone else I'd apply that moniker to is either working completely outside it (Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Shinya Tsukamoto, and Bela Tarr are obvious examples, though Julian Schnabel would also qualify) or make great films outside the Hollywood system and crappy films in it (Guillermo del Toro is a stunning example of this). Nolan knows how to game the system, and he's also clever enough to take a pretty basic idea and make it seem like it's a world-changing philosophy. It won't hold water when you start talking about it with your friends after you leave the theater, but does it matter? By that time, you will have been thoroughly entertained by some fantastic actors and a fantastic director, and isn't that what going to the movies is all about? *** ½tion isn't nearly as deep a film as it wants to believe it is (or wants us to believe it is), it is an incredibly entertaining one.

B003F3NDOO|4.0|Unlike other who will review this DVD collection, I have never seen the show on television. So everything was new for me from the original pilot episode throygh the remaining 23 episodes of the first season. With the commercials excised, each episode lasts about 22 minutes and it's easy to watch three or four at a time. Actually, I found this helpful since this is more of a continuous story line where each episode generally picks up where the previous one ended.<br /><br />For the newly initiated viewer the show looks like its going to be all sex and body jokes, and that's pretty much what it is for the first  five or six episodes. If you've watched Desperate Housewives and found the sexual humor of  40 year old women lusting after young men or their neighbors husband, you'll feel right at home here. In fact, I was not that familiar with Courtney Cox (well, some folks aren't \\"Friends\\" alums) and many times she reminded me of Teri Hatcher's character, Susan, in DH.<br /><br />After five episodes the sex jokes began to get stale and I wondered how a whole season would hold out. But then, about episode six, all the characters who had separate relationships with Jules (Cox's character) met one another and now they became only happy (well, mostly) dysfunctional family. There's even a brief \\"making of\\" featurette in the bonuses where the creators discuss this issue. From that point on (the \\"bonding\\") the show takes a 90-degree turn and holds your interest - as well as tickles your funny bone.<br /><br />Women of Jules' age will relate with her frustrations while men will find humor in the guys in the cast, though probably won't relate to them.  And this is one of those TV shows that has a killer soundtrack, inserting pop songs at just the right moment.<br /><br />The bonuses include lots of deleted scenes (but in most cases you can easily see why they were deleted) and a blooper reel. There's a whole series of 2 minute \\"Ask Barb\\" videos where the \\"older than the other women\\" character, Barb, answers sex questions with risqu&eacute; answers. And a similar set of videos starring the wacky Bobby Cobb (Cox's divorced husband in the show).<br /><br />Fans of the show will want this to return to favorite episodes or moments. For others, especially those who want to see how a network show could push the sexually suggestive joke boundary, will find that, if they stick with it, the show will grow on you and keep you entertained.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"ex questions with risqué answers.

B001NYEL9S|3.0|This is a good soundtrack, but here's the problem:    I already have the Eagles' version of \\"In The City,\\" and even if I didn't think it's better than Walsh's solo version, they're similar enough that I don't need it twice.    I already have \\"Nowhere to Run\\" in my music collection.    I find \\"Love is a Fire\\" to be an awkward, tuneless song that I don't want to listen to.    I already have \\"In Havana\\" in my music collection.    ALL I WANT ARE THE BARRY VORZON COMPOSITIONS! The theme from the opening credits is AWESOME (although they should have included the Interlude that plays over the horizon shot of the Wonder Wheel). The Fight is great, and The Baseball Furies Chase is intense. All I really want are those three tracks, but they stubbornly refuse to offer single-track downloads of this album, as if we were still in the 90s. I can't speak for anybody else, but I'm not going to pay for 7 tracks I don't want just to get 3 tracks I like. Let me know when you guys catch up with the times and let us buy only the tracks we need. Until then, I'm keeping my money.
B002U33GUQ|4.0|Pianist Brad Mehldau's \\"Highway Rider\\" is a sonic travelogue of vistas both large and small, desolate and dense; a soundtrack for a film that has yet to be made. And, if you don't mind strings and symphonic orchestration in your jazz, \\"Highway Rider\\" is also one of his best recordings, and easily his most ambitious, to date.       Over the course of 2 CDs and 100+ minutes, \\"Highway Rider\\" takes the listener through 15 tracks, varying in length from just one minute to over twelve. In addition, the ensembles range from solo piano to duo, trio, quartet (featuring Joshua Redman on saxophone) to a 40+ piece orchestra.     Featured on the album are Mr. Mehldau's longtime trio mates, drummer Jeff Ballard and bassist Larry Grenadier, as well as percussionist Matt Chamberlain and the highly regarded saxophonist Joshua Redman (Brad Mehldau got his start in jazz by playing in Mr. Redman's band). At times throughout the cd, Matt Coleman leads the chamber orchestra.     So, what works on Highway Rider? The short answer is, any of the small-group-only playing, which is just as good as anything Mr. Mehldau & Co. have recorded in the studio since at least his trio concept album \\"Places\\", ten years ago.     On cd one, \\"At The Tollbooth\\" a lonely one-minute piano solo, almost a lament to a solitary conversation, segues beautifully into the title track, a vibrant, durable stretch of small ensemble playing which showcases the Mehldau trio's current sound. In addition to the piano, Brad pulls out a 1970's Yamaha CS-80 keyboard, letting it subtly add pitch-bending glissandos at times throughout the cut. \\"The Falcon Will Fly Again\\" has the trio met with Joshua Redman on adventurous soprano sax, but it was the sound of children la-la-ing along at the end with the band, ending in laughter and approval, which really threw me off - a very organic and unexpected ending, effectively providing a leavening effect to what at times can be a rather heavy collection.     Disc two, although book-endedby orchestra, is filled with excellent Mehldau small-ensemble compositions. \\"Capriccio\\" is as playful and energized as its name, and again the quartet closes the song unexpectedly, this time with handclaps, almost in a Spanish-dance style; simple, but compelling enough to listen for each time the track is played. \\"Sky Turning Grey\\" features the quartet again, this time with Mr. Redman on tenor sax, and Brad on both piano and pump organ. This eulogy to the American songwriter Elliott Smith features a strikingly angular Redman sax solo, really a chorus for the song, making \\"Sky\\" easily the most pop-friendly track on \\"Highway Rider\\".  \\"Into The City\\", \\"Old West\\" and \\"Come With Me\\" are all extended duo and trio jams, showcasing the creativity and reserve of professional jazz playing by masters of their craft.         But what makes-or-breaks Highway Rider for myself and for a lot of other listeners, especially longtime Mehldau fans, is the large-ensemble orchestration. As far as I can tell from years of listening to both modern and traditional jazz, and from reading both professional and amateur jazz criticism, one either likes strings in their jazz or they don't.     True, kudos are warranted to Brad Mehldau for composing the orchestrated portions of Highway Rider himself, and for having the strings recorded `live' at the same time and in the same studio as the small-ensemble portions. Both of these efforts allow for a more integrated and effective musical statement on \\"Highway Rider\\". (This is, of course, in contrast to some traditional jazz albums, such as Wes Montgomery's \\"Smoking at the Half Note\\", where the strings were tacked-on later without any involvement or input by recording's original members, and the consequent recording suffered as a result). Orchestrating strings is not easy, and credit is deserved for his making the effort, as it proves Mr. Mehldau, now edging towards 40, is still interested in pushing the boundaries of his craft.     That said, the stringy portions of Highway Rider just come across as being cheesy at best, and pretentious at worst, sounding largely derivative, as if we've heard this all somewhere else before. This probably has less to do with these compositions themselves, and more with the general nature of adding a string section to otherwise straight-up jazz. In addition, the modern, grainy sparseness of John Brion's production, combined with the open space of Mr. Mehldau's small ensemble playing on this album, do not lend themselves well to the addition of stuffy string orchestration. At times, it seems the strings and orchestration actually do more to cover up the quartet than actually add to it.     This is especially evident on the final two tracks that close out the second cd, \\"Always Departing\\" and \\"Always Returning\\"; the strings so overwhelm these two compositions that the intentionally dramatic ending instead leads itself to laughter at the ridiculousness of it all, especially last 15 seconds of \\"Always Returning\\", when the strings subside to silence, only to return for one final wave of dramatic surging. Wow. My senses flooded only with memories of bad Hollywood B-features and the three-months-past-the-due-date Limburger in the basement fridge. What an ending. What a disappointment.      It should be added that there is no overall musical theme to \\"Highway Rider\\", no leitmotif which binds the individual compositions together into some grand musical statement. Instead, \\"Highway Rider\\" seems to be more a collection of tracks penned by Mr. Mehldau at a similar time, and which are unified mainly by the quartet's outstanding performances as well as the orchestral flourishes.     I give both Brad Mehldau and Nonesuch Records credit for having the confidence to both release a two-cd jazz recording in this day-and-age as well as adding strings to it when such pretense is way out of style. I will leave it up to the listener as to whether \\"Highway Rider\\" is a great addition to Mr. Mehldau's catalog or just a good one - and I suppose that will largely depend on whether strings are your thing.

Or do I continue my investment in the likable Mikael and Lisbeth?<br /><br />I am beginning to understand why each section of the book begins with a brief statistic on sexual violence against women in Sweden (the author's home country). Presumably, Larssen is trying to bring attention to this important issue. Question: do we need this type of attention?<br /><br />In contrast to the several misogynistic perverts profiled in this novel, Mikael is portrayed as a kindly man who treats women, even misunderstood women like Lisbeth, as human beings.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Mikael's relationships with women are distorted in their own way.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|Despite some obvious plot holes (finding a CIA mole link by simply googling the guy?), Ghost Writer benefits from a fine script, pleasantly low-key direction, a wonderful lack of violence, and a very solid and understated performance from Ewan McGregor.<br /><br />Even Brosnan acts well here, not always the case, and Williams is also convincing. In fact, all the acting is good, which one can credit Polanski for, famous for being an actors' director. He clearly knows how to make his actors comfortable, and by giving them good material to work with paves the way for quality. The plot is excellent, and Harris' book gets a good treatment here. The overall idea is well worth considering, and part of this movie's appeal is indeed its willingness to confront various political realities most of us would rather not think about.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's because of his getting busted for the rape charge (or vice-versa), but Polanski has made a few of the better conspiracy-shaping-American-history movies, most notably of course Chinatown. I've always wondered about his getting busted in LA, the town that Chinatown exposes as full of cheating, scheming politicians and businessmen. Was the bust an act of revenge from LA's power elite? Was it a set-up or was Polanski doing what he was accused of? There are few popular movies that expose LA like that one, and only one director who's not allowed back in America. Quite a coincidence in any case.<br /><br />Maybe Polanksi made Ghost Writer mainly to slam hypocrisy in the land that still wants to jail him? One thing for sure, the plot's central theme---that our leaders could stand trial for war crimes for the torturing done in Iraq by the CIA---can't sit well with Cheney, W, Blair and the boys. A little too close to home, and all too legally accurate. Most reviews shy away from this fact, but it's the central theme of the movie, and one well worth considering at length.<br /><br />I think this film will wear very well as the years go by, and perhaps be seen as prescient. It's certainly Hitchcockian in many good ways, and Polanski's refusal to fill the screen with bullets and blood, instead choosing subtle moments and plenty of quiet face time with good actors at the top of their games, McGregor most of all, is simply intelligent filmmaking.n as prescient.

B003XDUCIG|5.0|Alton Brown fans take note! You need a copy of Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks and Good Food. Seriously, this book takes everything I enjoy about Alton's shows and combines them into a book for the beginner, novice and pro alike.<br /><br />Sure some recipes may seem basic. Extremely basic actually. It may seem weird to some that there are people who cannot even scramble an egg, but I've learned from experience that these people do exist. When my neighbor came flying out her house with a smoking pan, it had simply contained olive oil and water for boiling pasta but she'd turned on her stove and forgotten all about it. It became apparent that people can even burn water if given the opportunity.<br /><br />Everything you need to know about cooking is in this book. From kitchen set-up and equipment to simple tips like reading a recipe completely before getting started, Cooking for Geeks has everything you need to start preparing home-cooked meals.<br /><br />The book offers more than 400 pages of tips, recipes and even interviews with geeks of today. I loved reading Mythbuster's Adam Savage share his love of science and cooking. Learn easy recipes like a 30-Second Chocolate Cake or ones that may seem a little tougher like Butterflied Chicken. By the time you're done, you'll understand that kitchen and be able to whip together nutritious meals for yourself and others.<br /><br />It's a very rare event that I come across a review book that I feel I must rush out and purchase a copy as soon as it is released. This is one of those situations. I can't imagine NOT owning this cookbook and I love to cook and know more than the basics already. With outstanding recipes, entertaining interviews and witty writing, this is definitely a book you should hand your friends, family and especially neighbors who do come running out of their home with flaming pans.
0375507256|1.0|I heard an interview with the author and he sounded so nice -- but I have to say, the book was extremely disappointing. I could only read 3/4 the way through...it was like being inside the mind of a sexually frustrated 13 year old boy with the attention span of a gnat. The weird language wasn't convincing (for me) and mostly annoyed me (and I really tried to get into it). I am shocked at all the good reviews and the enormous praise for this book.
0385474547|4.0|I enjoyed the author's portrayal of the characters' everyday lives. Achebe's description of the strengths and weaknesses of the human being are exciting, realistic, and heartfelt. Although it seemed as though the ending was abrupt, the novel was truly good from beginning to end.
B001NOMNZW|1.0|I ordered the 3 disc of High School Musical. When it came it was the wrong item. It was just the blu-ray disc.

0525951652|3.0|I've read and enjoyed many of Ken Follett's books - and \\"Fall of Giants\\" was the same type of book for me.  While the sheer heft of the thing (my copy is 985 pages) makes it more difficult to read on a plane, a beach or by a pool - it's that type of book.  The type that keeps you turning the pages even when the quality of the writing would not.<br /><br />This book is the first of a new \\"Century Trilogy\\" - dealing with the WWI era.  The sense of major change in the world pervades the book - new social norms and systems of government form the backbone of the happenings in the characters lives. And, I did learn a few interesting things - that Woodrow Wilson was the first American president to visit Europe during his term in office, for instance.<br /><br />As much as I understand the waves of change that were happening at this time, I did find it interesting that every man (save a couple) seemed to desire a \\"new\\" sort of woman - one unafraid to speak her mind/break the rules.  And all the women (save a couple) depicted seemed to be just that type.  Again, I know it was time period relevant, but sometimes the only seemed that the only thing that differentiated the main female characters was their hair color.<br /><br />And yet - the reader is drawn back to that time.  A time of such turmoil and bloodshed...and innocence.  So much is yet to come, the reader and the writer know, and the characters are hapless to avoid the first World War.<br /><br />\\"All his life he would cherish the memory of an endless caravan of camels alongside the railway line, the laden beasts plodding patiently through the snow, ignoring the twentieth century as it hurtled past them in a clash of iron and a shriek of steam.\\"<br /><br />For Follett fans - this book is just what it they are looking for - another sweeping epic full of characters and details.  For other readers - the story may prove interesting as a way to while away many hours.

B002ZG9846|5.0|I loved this movie.  I saw it at the theater, and had to get it on Blu-Ray.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I love to sit back and watch movies that make me think. I use movies to escape and this movie did the trick for me. I am not a great fan of Leonardo, but I must give him credit on a decent performance. The ending was perfect in my opinion and am not going to ruin it for those who haven't seen the movie. If your looking for a movie to unwind after a hard days work and can't find anything on the 300 channels of cable like me. This movie wont disappoint. If you liked movies like \\"The secret Window\\",\\"Fraility\\",or \\"stir of Echos\\" than this movie is for you. If you hated these movies stay away. You probably will not like this movie either. My friend hated the movie yet I enjoyed the movie and even purchased it.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|Since I played the Judge in the movie I look for items now and then from the movie and found I didn't have this particular item. The book was in good shape as was the DVD. It arrived in a timely manner and if asked I would do business with this person again.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|Besides having a top-rate cast, this is an outstanding action movie.  Filled with empathy, good humor and great action.  Chris Evans makes every movie he appears in better.  And the four relative unknowns (Columbus Short,Zoe Saldana from Avatar, Idris Elba from HBO The Wire,Oscar Jaenada, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan from Watchmen, all contribute to the film.
B000025XE5|3.0|Great content but it is a shame that the recording is so overly bright and tinny that it makes it very hard to enjoy the music. I remember the originals when they were first released and was hoping to re-capture some of the flavour of that time.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|I've bought this movie 3 times: VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray. I can't believe the complaining about \\"bad transfers\\". I got this one when the price was only $11.99, in spite of negative comments. I waited too long! I can understand that people get nervous when upgrading favorites to Blu-ray. But some of the comments are silly. \\"The transfer is too dark\\" was one of them (\\"...whoever is responsible should be fired!\\" they said). This movie has ALWAYS been dark during the first part of the film: nights during winter in Detroit, with interiors in a bar, a movie theatre, and a brothel. Now, with Blu-ray, I can FINALLY see the details in the backgrounds during the first part of the film! The second part is in daytime Los Angeles, with its sunny smog, and here the colors (and detail) are also MUCH improved; AND the soundtrack! On the same disc are generous bonus commentaries and scenes as well.<br /><br />If you like this movie, it's just crazy not to add this Blu-ray to your collection at its current LOWEST price!

B001U0HBPG|5.0|Brad Pitt plays the role of Benjamin, who was born in 1918 however unlike all babies, he was born an old person. He had the physical appearance of a 70 year old, however the age and mind of a new born. He gets physically younger when time goes by and experiences life inversley, from older to younger.     I thought the plot was superb. I am not sure if there is a disease that gets people to get younger rather than older, but I once read that there is a boy in the UK who is growing old very fast and the doctors are so confused with his case. But still, I never heard of a case where someone starts old and dies young.     Brad Pitt was great! All the others actors did a wonderful job in this movie too. The direction and customer designing was breathtaking, especially the scenes when Brad Pitt acted as a 70 year old man then at the end of the movie as a teenager.      This movie is a must buy!
B002ZG980U|5.0|When I went to see this movie, I was a bit in the unknown on what it was about. I had seen some of the trailers but I was scared that they were going to do too much of the flipping city or they would go overboard with the special effects. However, when I saw it, I was blown away; completely. I then realized that Inception could not have too many special effects in it because, there all ready were too many special effects in it and it was amazing. The whole thing. The idea was original, the filming was great, the directors picked the best people to fit the characters. It was a truly amazing film. I don't think that I will be able to sit through another movie like this one and not get bored with it. Compared to Avatar, Inception is way better.
0515141429|3.0|I had read \\"Persuader' and felt I needed to read the books in order so I read the first novel. It is a fast-paced novel with a tough guy protagonist as hero and it maintains interest with its action packed sequences and killings. Reacher is a dirty fighter but he kept me wanting him to win ar all costs and in any way. Child did it and it was good, even in the sequences in which Reacher would seem to have no chance but still he would win.  At least he did not have to depend on coincidences as so many other authors use, Child avoids them handily. The problem I had with \\"Killing Floor\\" was in having the antagonists know who was about to give information about them they would know not only who, but to whom, where and when it would occur but Child does not tell how they got this information. Sometimes it can be guessed at but sometimes, too many times,it cannot and I lose track of what's going on while I try to determine how the enemy knows who, what, where and when. This is novel one, \\"Persuaders\\" is better and I hope as I read the later works the problem disappears.
0307592839|4.0|\\"A Visit From The Goon Squad\\" is a bold, unnerving, compelling read that plays with the idea of time far more floppily than \\"Memento\\".    It's probably better to know a little bit about this book before you read it. As a musician, I was hoping the book would get deeper into the music business, as the main two characters were a former musician-gone-music executive, and his assistant.  But this disappointment faded and was replaced with a new disappointment and confusion:  this isn't a novel, it's a collection of semi-connected short stories. In one chapter the main character is a character barely mentioned in the previous chapter, but 20 years earlier or later in time from the previous chapter.  But, again, as I read, this disappointment and confusion also melted away: each chapter/story was compelling enough on its own that it didn't really even NEED to be connected to any of the others.  And even the story told in Powerpoint is compelling enough to dismiss the novelty of it.    You know the end of the movie \\"Animal House\\" where each character's future is described?  Egan's tendency to do this in several places in this book feels a bit forced and unnecessary but, I suppose, fits in the schemata of time-jumping in this book. Some stories, and characters' lives, are left feeling unfinished, and with others you feel more of a sense of closure (The arc of my favorite character, Jules Jones, with hilarious echoes of Ignatius J. Reilly [Confederacy of Dunces], after harassing a movie star and going to jail, gets an unlikely sweet coda in an unrelated story later in the book).    All in all, a good read where the flaws don't derail the book's momentum. Go, Goon Squad!
030726999X|5.0|As with the first two books, The girl who kicked the hornets nest kept me up reading it late into the night.<br />When I ended the last sentence in the book, my first thought after that was that I wished there was a 4th book.<br /><br />Worth every dime of purchase price.
0061714372|5.0|A truly great read, and not just for your typical metal head.  It's comic, it's horribly tragic and, finally, triumphant.  I could go on but it's much better to discover this one yourself!

0061714372|5.0|I was asked to write a review of a chapter out of Dave Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir.  First off I want to say I have not finished this book yet, but that it has been hard to put it down.  Its not your average autobiography that's for sure.  From the start you really get pulled into what life was like for Dave growing up. you learn all about his family, his friends and his musical tastes.  I don't want to give anything away so I'll try not to be to descriptive.  When I started reading the book I thought it might be like your everyday biography but is far from it.  You really feel like you are hearing the story from Dave's eyes.  Every detail of his childhood and his musical experiences that lead him to become one of the greatest guitar players and front-men of all time.  I immediately got drawn in, and can not wait to finish the book.  If you want the truth about Dave Mustaine and want to hear it uncut, uncensored and from the man himself!  I strongly recommend you buy this book so that you to can experience the wild ride that is Dave Mustaines life.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|I bought this camera for my seven year old grandson. He took it to the zoo today and was having a great time taking pictures of animals. After about fifteen minutes an exclamation mark appeared on the screen and he could no longer take any pictures.  I'm not sure if restetting it will make it work again but he had taken less than half the number of pictures that it is supposed to hold.  What a disappointment.
0679746048|4.0|I enjoyed the book even if I'm not all that sure about the message.<br /><br />This book was the true story of Susanna Kaysen who was committed to a mental hospital when she was 18. The chapters were short and crisp, and could most likely be read as short stories in themselves. The book was also interspersed with official forms documenting Kaysen's two year stay at McLean, which Kaysen only got the rights to many years after with the help of a lawyer. Kaysen kept her writing humorous and curt as she talked about the various patients, doctors, and incidents at the hospital. I liked these chapters, but got bored later on in the book after she left the hospital and began to describe the bounds of her illness. I'm a teenager myself, and my attention span is short.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book for its quirkiness and memorable characters, where others might like it for its comments on mental illness and the treatment of the mentally ill in the 60's.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This dvd is a must have for any RUSH fan.  Great interviews and an accurate, concise history from the band members themselves.  Get it as soon as you can!
1441412840|5.0|This book is absolutely brilliant. Joseph Murphy conveys his points across in a simple and effective manner, explains how and why with \\"simple\\" detail. If you have any questions or doubts about religion, magick, quantum consciousness, and the power potential of your own mind, or wish to take control of your destiny this is a great starting point. If you have read some of the more commercial books on similar subjects like \\"The Power of Now\\" by Eckhart Tolle, \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne, \\"Quantum Success\\" by Sandra Anne Taylor, \\"The Four Agreements\\" (great book), by Don Miguel Ruiz, and others by Dr. Deepak Chopra, then you will love this one. This masterpiece, I believe is written from the perspective of a man with true spiritual clarity and wisdom...who walks the walk.
0061714372|5.0|I went over to Barnes and Noble in Long Beach to pick up my copy of Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir the day it came out, August 3rd, and began reading it as soon as I got home. I'm a very big metal fan so as soon as I heard he was writing an autobiography, I became immediately interested. So I finished it in about 4 hours of nonstop reading and I've got to say, it is definitely one of the more inspiring books I've read. VERY interesting read and sounds very honest. Although he does sound like a jerk in a couple of places, as he's most famous for, most of the rest is good. I don't wanna get into it for those of you who HAVEN'T read it but something that really disappointed me was the ending. It didn't include the mighty return of David Ellefson  or the recent tour with the Big 4 and left it on a sour note with the guys of Metallica. I'm guessing that it's because of deadlines for publishing and he was already finished with it by the time David and the Big 4 tour came about, but nonetheless, it's a good book and a great buy! \m/ MEGADETH! MEGADETH! AGUANTE MEGADETH!
B000063S6Z|5.0|I just got back from a 900-mile road trip that would have been much duller if not for Moby's music. It's the ideal driving music--both dynamic and varied, as well as beautiful. The differing tempos combat the tedium of driving along on the I-5--which I do quite often, traveling between Los Angeles and San Francisco. I probably listened to 18 about a dozen times on this trip and never tired of it. It's that good! While I love all the songs, the one I listen to repeatedly (and which helps me haul ass!) is \\"Extreme Ways.\\" I also listen to Moby's music around the house--he's not just for the car!
B000VUCIZE|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. It's the perfect compliment to Dawkins' [[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion]] and Hitchens' [[ASIN:0446697966 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]].<br /><br />My only criticism is Harris' argument in defense of torture. He equates the harm done by torture with the collateral damage done by aerial bombing and suggests they are morally equivalent. This contradicts his earlier argument against Chomsky equating the Bush administration's killing of innocents and Saddam Hussein's crimes against humanity. Harris says the difference between Bush and Saddam Hussein is intent; Bush does not intend to harm innocents, Saddam Hussein does. This same logic should be applied to the United States' use of torture; there is clear intent to do harm and it is not morally equivalent to the inadvertent killing of innocents by bombing.
0807014273|5.0|I had to read this book for a class, but it turned out to be a very interesting and good book to read.
1450596363|5.0|What a book.  It's written as though you were there in the marshes, you can feel the dampness of the cool, wet fog all around you, sometimes it makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck if your reading it late at night, in bed with only one dim light on, lol.  Arthur Conan Doyle was a master when it came to writing stories about his Sherlock Holmes.  I great read.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I gave this book a chance because it was the #1 seller in the Kindle store. I downloaded and read a sample of the book - as I always do with Kindle books - and almost didn't buy it. The book was SOOO slow. I had to check that I had the right book because, after the first chapter or two, it wasn't what was described in the summary. It was a long, boring discussion about companies and business. I bought it only because it was the #1 seller and I figured it had to get better since so many people gave it rave reviews. It did get better - after about the first third of the book!!! The first third of the book was tedious and I almost gave up on it several times but, again, kept at it because it was a #1 seller. Once it finally picked up, it was actually a great story. But I definitely could have started reading at about the 40% mark and not missed much.
0061714372|5.0|Dave Mustaine's, \\"Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir\\" is an autobiography of a struggling hard won music career. It is also a story of survival, redemption, and faith.    Mustaine is a pioneer in the heavy metal thrash movement and his memoir reveals a conservative approach to the business, displaying a strong desire for money, power, and fame. The memoir gives an honest and eye opening account of life as a rock star with an infinite amount of groupies, drugs, and alcohol.    The story is not told in a typical \\"rock star\\" fashion. Mustaine does not divulge his indiscretions in repugnant detail like comparable band memoirs. Life on the road is told like it was and like it is, objectifying women, but not to the extent where there is a sense of alienation and exclusion from heavy metal and the band that is Megadeth.    The battles Dave Mustaine faces on his tumultuous road to recovery and stardom are dark, impossible, and humorous. That he has never given up is inspiration alone. His fights and efforts with band members (eighteen to be exact) from past to present are many, revealing the perfectionist state he runs the business that is Megadeth.    Heavy metal may not be mainstream but it has a huge, loyal, passionate following and Megadeth is a corporation. Mustaine has attempted and succeeded at being one of the best in the business without antagonizing fans to the degree Metallica has with Napster and copyright issues.    Megadeth remains and will live on, despite the toll the business has taken on Dave Mustaine's life, family, and personal relationships. The music industry is not a friendly place, not for the weak of heart or thin skinned. Mustaine's battle with drugs and alcohol are shocking and vastly heartbreaking considering his indisputable talent and degree of humanity revealed in the text.    Dave Mustaine is a legend in heavy metal, he has written music that has inspired generations of fans, and he has proven that with faith anything is possible. It does not matter if you are religious or musical, Mustaine's, \\"A Heavy Metal Memoir\\" will leave you moved and inspired.    [...]
0525951652|3.0|Roughly covering the 20 years before, during and shortly after World War I, at 985 pages, \\"Fall of Giants\\" is more or less the story of the members of five families whose personal lives and/or fortunes rise and fall during the period.  Their stories are intended to continue in two subsequent books of the series dubbed \\"The Century Trilogy.\\"  Also being told here--and in very great detail--is the story of the causes, duration and results of the Great War.  The book's characters are the voices explaining what is to happen and then they are the actors who carry out the action that follows.<br /><br />While I'm a real fan of writer Ken Follett--I've read \\"Pillars  of the Earth\\" twice--I was disappointed in this attempt at more modern history.  My biggest problem with the book was the general weakness of the character development.  There are so many straw men (and women) set up here (and these are principal characters), that it undermines the author's purpose in writing about them in the first place.  With a major theme being class struggle in Britain and Russia, the cast of characters is roughly bifurcated into those \\"of privilege\\" and those of the under classes.  Not surprisingly, the under class folks are more noble than those who are actually born of nobility and wealth.  The scales are so stacked against the latter that they are endowed by the author with limited intellects, undersized (or no) moral compasses and terrible judgement about everything.  This includes, by the way, whether to proceed with World War I or avoid that universal disaster.  Once the conflagration is begun by the collective crowned idiots of Europe, the morally-crippled upper-crust characters of the book are given almost super-human physical courage (but terrible judgement again) to advance the battle action.<br /><br />The under class characters--largely English miners, servants and Russian factory workers--are endowed with brains, moral and physical courage and good looks.  They suffer mightily at the hands of their social betters, but mostly survive and prosper despite the bias and repression that they experience, respectively.  Author Follett sends a clear signal that it is this group that will prevail--at least in the next installment of this series.  Fine, I can readily accept his perspective on social justice.  But there is just too much cliche in these characters.<br /><br />The other criticism I have of the book is its reliance on unlikely conversations about politics, government and military action to advance the story.  Virtually every one of the principal characters is put into situations of coincidence that have them exchanging pleasantries and opining about strategic plans with the leaders of their countries.  Social conversations between lovers, parents and children, etc. include detailed discussions about international treaty obligations, tariffs, military planning and all manner of unlikely topics.  There is one \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" couple in the story (she's English, he's German) that are written into every important decision made by their respective governments before and during the war.  This at a time when women could not vote in Britain.<br /><br />When I finished the book--and there are some parts that are quite readable since it is Ken Follett, after all--I was left with the impression that the author just bit off more detailed history than was necessary and didn't pay enough attention to his characters.  I was also left wondering about the title of the book.  \\"Fall of Giants\\" suggests that some group of superior people experienced a loss of fortune.  But in truth, the superior people in this book--the privileged and powerful-- simply can't be viewed as \\"giants\\".  As described by author Follett, they are more like mental and moral midgets, certainly deserving of a \\"fall\\" or whatever misfortune comes their way.<br /><br />I really hope that the next installment of this series slows down considerably; drops the minute historic and political details; and focuses on the potentially very interesting characters.tentially very interesting characters.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Any person who was a fan of the show when it originally aired will not be disappointed with this series, which comes uncut and uncensored (as far as I am aware).  Even the minor cursing is fully intact (Damn!).  Yes, nearly all the original music has been removed and replaced with generic stock music footage, which is a bummer to \\"purist\\" fans, but the removal is understandable considering the copyright nightmare it would have been for MTV to include every snippet.  More importantly, the music's removal does not detract from the brilliance of the show and should not be a reason to avoid purchasing this product.
030745455X|5.0|This trilogy is just absorbing reading - just couldn't put it down - I liked it better than the first because we have gotten acquainted with the characters - I loved all of these books - no need to review really - they are selling like hotcakes.
B001BEK8E2|5.0|Rashomon was the first movie where Akira Kurosawa really found his filmmaking voice.<br /><br />Visually, Rashomon is stunning.  The techniques used by Kurosawa were years ahead of their time.  The outdoor filming, especially in the forest, gives the film an authenticity that you just can't get on a soundstage.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, there is enough ambiguity to keep people discussing this movie for decades.  Is it about lying?  Distorted memories?  People lying to themselves?  Selfishness?  Or is it about all of the above?<br /><br />Kurosawa's story of a murder told from four different points of view that come across with distinctly different details is captivating.  In the end we still aren't 100% sure exactly what happened, although we have a fairly good idea.  Toshiro Mifune is, as he often is, over the top as the bandit.  But being Toshiro Mifune over the top works extremely well.  It comes across as genuine, and not just hammy acting.  Mifune would take this performance and refine it further in Seven Samurai just four years later.<br /><br />As for the Essential Art House DVD, it is the Criterion version without the extras.  The picture quality is quite good, as the contrast is just about perfect, and the picture has a sharpness and clarity that is very pleasing.  The sound doesn't fare quite so well, as there is a lot of hiss and crackling to be heard, but not so much as to be a deal breaker.  The voices come through clearly, as does the rain and other forest sounds.<br /><br />Why buy this version?  Price.  It is roughly half the cost of the fully loaded Criterion release, so that makes it a lot easier to make the purchase.  Yes, the extras on the full Criterion version are quite good, but if you're on the fence about buying the movie this would be the one to get (especially if price is a major consideration).

B003PWJS9Y|5.0|This album is great.  Read the many other posts for the details.  I was annoyed to learn (after I purchased the download) that track 16 (Knock Boots) wasn't included nor was the video for Fresh.  Why?  Both of these things can be found with the album purchase on the fruity competition's website (you know who I mean)for only $0.71 more.  What gives?
0887307280|5.0|The E-Myth Revisited is the book written by Michael E. Gerber and it is considered one of the most important books of the entreprenural world.<br /><br />Michael is the founder of E-Myth Worldwide, the coaching, training and education firm he created to transform the development of small businesses worldwide. The firm is very succesfull and has helped thousands of small businesses. This book has been written as the product of his work at his firm.<br /><br />E-Myth Revisited is written in a form of dialogue between Michael and a young woman who represents a typical business starter. Through that dialogue Michael describes situations and problems that emerge when people who are great at what they do (in this book, a woman who makes killer pies) start their own business knowing little about running it, hoping that the fact that they are great at what they do is enough to make their business prosper. It's not - they slowly become slaves of their own ignorance and close up. Fortunately, Michael clarifies how to avoid those situations and work on your business not in it.<br /><br />This book is great, it gives you a ton of advice and a better understanding of business and start-ups. A must read.<br /><br />Sven
B001UW58WW|5.0|This is an excellent cd. This songs are crisp, powerfully played and you can still sing along to the songs. BUY IT!
B000000I3O|5.0|I was introduced to the misfits years back. My first album was Collection. I put the cd in and my life changed forever. I never heard a band like this before. The fist songs I was hooked on where London Dungeon and Night of the Living Dead. The topics of the songs where so dark and disturbing yet the songs sounded catchy. Anyway, Collection could be considered a greatest hits by the misfits but the cd is actually a collection of different recordings and B-sides.     If you never heard the misfits and are curious give this album a try, it has a good mix of songs throughout their short-lived career.
0812550706|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book for many years, and finally just started a day and a half ago.  Couldn't put it down.  The ending... I was laughing out loud.  Not because it was funny...but out of happiness, out of celebreation...even triumph.  This is the best book I've read in quite some time.

B0008ENHUI|5.0|It's hard to imagine anyone surviving the penal colony of French Guyana, let alone escaping it.  Papillon and two others manage to do so, but then there are twists and repercussions.<br />Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman are Papillon and Degas, respectively, in this story of two prisoners who end up in a hellhole, with one having to be in solitary for a couple of years--and longer, later--while dealing with bad food, horrible weather, and indifferent guards.<br />The movie is quite long at  2.5 hours but it does not drag or become dull.  You will be riveted at every minute, hoping for these guys to escape.

B00133KHCY|5.0|My husband and I watched this on HBO and fell in love with it.  I purchased this DVD so he could watch it whenever he wished, as he enjoys the story plot, the characters, and the music immensely.    If you have not seen the film, it is particulaly entertaining and is heart-warming when an orphaned child, who is a gifted musician, is reunited with his biological mother and father.  Robin Williams is also in the film.    If you like all types of music, you will enjoy this film.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|What's going on here? The listed price is $20 over what the Apple Store charges for these?
0061714372|4.0|what can i say? The book was great and interesting but most of the things he talks about are directly said in the VH1 behind the music \\"Megadeth\\" DVD. Most of the stories were the same and represented in the book word to word, a handful of new ones though. This book would be great for someone who isn't a HUGE Dave Mustaine fan because they probably heard all of this before and can spit it back to you in their sleep as can I. The writing was great, easy to understand and kept you interested. The last decade of his career was covered in a mere 50 pages, very disappointing. For [...] bucks, It's a great read but definitely didn't bring me \\"closer\\" to Dave Mustaine.

B003TOMAPC|2.0|This film had potential (hence 2 stars and not 1) and there were moments (mainly near the beginning) when it seemed it would build toward something more than the usual banal action flick they churn out with depressing and increasing regularity these days. But as the \\"plot thickened\\" it fell back into that Hollywood default - when in doubt, add violence. When in doubt after that, increase the violence. If you or someone you love is the victim of violence: shock and horror. When you see it played out in a film like this with yet another bullet flying, yet another throat slashed: yawn.
B002TVQ4HG|1.0|this movie is so bad it will make you mad that you spent so much time watching it.   this is one of those movies where about half way through you smell the ending. there is no real sense to anything that happens since nothing is explained.   who are the people who leave good reviews for garbage like this ?    the actors do a decent job of it but it wouldnt matter either way.   this is the worst movie i have ever seen. please dont waste your time.

B0029ZA3H4|5.0|Gary Vaynerchuk has hit a home run with his book Crush It!  This book uses our passion, that deep resonating passion that we all have for a particular interest, and tells us how best to leverage it.<br /><br />Gary, of Wine Library, tells us of his humble beginnings working in his parent's store as a teenager.  Even then he saw a need, people couldn't decide which wine they wanted.  So, he studied up on the subject and realized he loved wine, at least understanding it in the beginning.<br /><br />This book shows you how to:<br /><br />  * Recognize your passion<br />  * Leverage social media to extend or build your brand<br />  * Embrace a customer service model<br />  * Enjoy every aspect of your passion<br /><br />He has since become a main player in brand management and is a passionate user of social media, provided it fits in with his strategy.  This book is not simply a read and never touch again book, but rather a book to reference throughout your journey of \\"passion\\" building.  I listened to the book, but I will probably pick up an e-book or even the hardback version of this book for my library.
0066620996|1.0|This book continues to be published and sold, yet after reading it I cannot imagine why?  A sizable portion of the companies that Collins claims have made the move to being Great are now on the ash heap of life; Circuit City, Fannie Mae which gave us the housing disaster we are now living through.  He proclaims how great a company Walgreens is and while they made a move to become the McDonalds of the neighborhood pharmacy world; it is chain that provides NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, I know because I travel coast to coast and unfortunately have to rely on them from time to time. If Collins who claims to be such a student of business were truly so, he would write a sequel where he revisits the companies he claims in this book are so great and set the record straing.  This is the rare case where I have read a book that has such little value.  Please save your money and time.

1870946502|5.0|We used this series in a private school in Ireland from age 3 yrs 9mos through age 5+.  Learning using this system, and other phonics-based materials, was straight forward and created a very sound foundation for reading and writing.  Using these sounds, you can then grow to reading by sounding out and spelling by sounding out.  The workbooks were fun and the child is able to do pages on their own, which is a nice sense of independence.  The songs with sounds were very fun, and the movements fun too, and singing along was a great way to remember the various sounds of the consonants, vowels, and two letter combinations.  It worked for us.  We also used the Word Dictionary and found it helpful as well.
1416955070|5.0|I bought this book on a whim at the book store, without reading more then the dust jacket (which is not anything like me). I was taken back by how much I enjoyed this book. I thought it was great and ended up buying, and reading the next two in a matter of few days. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy books and more of a classic stance on the mystical world of vampires, werewolves, and fairies.     FYI: I am so glad I didn't read the reviews before jumping into this series. I think it was defiantly worth it.
B0002S94OS|4.0|Wow. The critical reviews on this are really negative. I don't agree with most of the descriptions of the faults with AOTW though. LOG are a Thrash band ok? And pretty straight forward Thrash at that. Obviously not as extreme as death, black, or grind (I think a lot of old \\"classic\\" Thrash is more extreme). But you'd think it was crappy ol' porn grind by the way some reviewers repine! No, AOTW is a solid THRASH METAL album. Easily their best. Followed by \\"New American Gospel\\". I don't see anyone who knows and loves thrash not liking this.     Good riffs throughout. Some are really killer. A lot of groove (ie. headbanging! Yeah, I said it!) The drumming is EXCELLENT. It's focused. Clear. Adds a killer dynamic to the guitar work. The vocals...Well, I can see how some would label LOG as metal core because of the vocals. He screams. Think Phil Anselmo screams with some Death Metal styling, albeit on a political slant. Still, anyone who really knows Thrash would consider LOG Thrash style music. Hey, you really can make out what he's expressing most of the time if you listen up some.     I think that is why some here don't like this album: They should listen closer. There's a lot of good stuff on AOTW you can miss if you're not listening well or if you're all prejudiced beforehand. Oh, and the production is well done I think. I enjoy it CRANKED in the car or at home with a good system. You'll be impressed.       But as usual, they're too extreme for some, too tame for others. It's simply Thrash man! The vocals being the deciding factor. As for moi, I like Randy's aggression and vitriolic diction for the most part. It works well with the metal.   Overall easily worth the metalist's while.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Good album. They are a christian rock band I guess like The Almost. When I first was interested in buying this album, it was because of the popular track \\"Little Lion Man\\". Many of the tracks are complete opposite of what l expected being fast like (Little Lion Man), most are slow but with that same sound. It was not what I expected of them from hearing \\"little lion man\\",  but all in all they are a very unique band. I suggest first listening to a couple of there tracks before purchasing, if you are not familiar with there music. I would deff recommend listening to \\"Sigh No More\\", \\"Awake My Soul\\", and \\"The Cave\\".  Different sound and well written, check them out.
B0018O4YSQ|1.0|I tried 2 different blu ray discs and with both got a terrible constant static noise when playing either the Director's Cut or Theatrical Version.  No matter how I tried changing sound settings on my player and tv, I never could correct the problem.  Very disappointed.
B0009YA386|4.0|I love the unique singing voice found in Editors.  It's almost haunting sometimes.  They lyrics are great and the music has true feeling to it, I can tell these people put a lot of time into their efforts.<br /><br />This CD is great for in the car, at home while working, chilling, or whatever.  The songs are all different from one another, but tie into the overall band itself well.  None are really boring or stale.  It really is a worth-while CD.

B000R8YC18|2.0|As usual, I do not write my reviews to get agreement since 95% or more of the population does NOT know what is good from bad, pearl to a swine.      You know how you watch old movies and now, even when you watch them again, you still tend to rate them high due to memories of watching them when you were younger and feeling the obligation to remain faithful to how you felt?    That's how this movie is. It's an oldie with good acting and whatnot, but I did not enjoy it very much because of the following reasons:    SPOILER ALERT!!!  INTENDED MAINLY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE OR PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE A BLANK.    In no specific order:    1. The guy gets ready and does all this training to, in the end, kill 3 or 4 low life losers, some of which were not armed and even tried not to provoke him? The basically provoked them and acted like some sort of tough guy. The whole movie sets you up, making you sort of think that he was going after big game aka the possible presidential candidate when the whole time, after all the training he's done....he took out 3 low-life's, which by the way sucks and made the ending really disappointing. It's like the whole plot revolves around the end where he kills those guys.    2. He goes and kills those guys and he's declared a hero without going to jail? Was that how it is back then? You go out and you kill bad guys and you not only DON'T go to jail....but treated as a hero? Doesn't make much sense to me, either that or times sure have changed. What he did was basically premeditated murder or mass murder.    3. The movie doesn't really make clear who the main character plans to take out and the main character never seems to do much research or investigation into his mastermind scheme....which I really felt to be completely coincidental due to that fact. So basically that part of the plot goes like this: He talks about how he dislikes the scums and low-life's of the city aka drug dealers, prostitution, etc etc. Then he trains with a few guns that he bought, then one day he just decides okay it's time to do it. Then he goes and kills three criminals. Again I bring up that he does not do any research into these guys or the movie never shows him do enough research to justify his final scenes. You're left confused till the very end and it's not a clever setup either.    4. There was a lot of useless scenes that did not assist with the ending scene. Scenes like:  a) He fell in love with this blond, which dumped him.  b) His hatred for the geek that keeps following the blond.  c) The scenes with the other cab drivers, never really builds a relationship with them much and they do nothing to the story except make it longer.  d) Scenes of him training, did he REALLLLLLY need to train to kill 3 guys???? Thought he was going to take out an army or something, totally anti-climatic.   e) Most of the cab scenes, read the following below.    5. The movie, I felt, did not efficiently utilize and implicate his role as a taxi driver. Why do I feel this way? Because whatever he did and whatever he felt and whatever he knew, could have been done, felt, or known even without being a Taxi Driver. Let's go deeper. He drives around and notices all this crap in the street which makes him dislike the city more and wants to do something about it. You don't need to be in a taxi to feel this way or find out about this. A better way to implicate his role as a taxi driver to further help the plot of the story would be him spying on bad guys or getting important information as a taxi driver, using his taxi driving identity to somehow sneak into certain places and acting as a spy, etc.    Thinking back on that movie, the only spying he really did was probably with the presidential candidate that coincidentally got into his cab and talking to him, but even that I felt was useless. And this scene alone confuses the plot, not help clarifies anything. He knows nothing of the guy, how can he be a supporter?        So what? He feels sorry for one prostitute and helps her get free and he's a hero? What the heck? What about those other hundreds or thousands of other prostitutes? It's like if I went out and adopted a single cat at the pound and ran around calling myself a savior. CRAP!!       The acting was good, but the movie, IMO, is not that great. It was probably a good oldie, but a present day analysis makes the movie not so good at all.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Nightmare is a good (not great) album that has plenty of classic A7X.  It also has plenty of emotion filled throughout the album with the death of 'the Rev'.  You can hear and feel the band's emotional distraught of the Rev's passing, and that makes it a very good record in my opinion.  I feel that they are using this record as a salute to Jimmy and they will come back next album with a vengeance and really demonstrate their talent.  Shadows can really sing too!  This album proves that.  Perfect album for the time/situation the band is in.  Can't wait for the next one!
B0033AX26I|1.0|I agree with Veritas on one point, I don't like it. I, too, am an eternal Chieftains fan. But I like traditional Irish/Celtic music, and this isn't it. I could even buy the Old Plank Road idea, given that so many Irish emigrants influenced bluegrass type music.  I respect the Chieftains and their artistic expression, but I'm just not on board with this release.
037582913X|5.0|I remember loving this book as a kid, and now my son loves it too!  It is certainly not your typical book about a TV character.  Very entertaining.  I encourages interactive reading!
0061807400|5.0|If you are looking for a fast paced, perfectly executed, and suspensful thriller, then this is the book for you. Lehane shares a certain similarity to Harlan Coben but it is a more subtle likeness so if you like Coben, you may very well like Lehane too. The ending is not so much as a shocking revelation that the reader doesn't see coming but rather a slow, meticulous unraveling so that the end reads with much the same satisfaction as putting in those last few pieces of a challenging jigsaw puzzle. The book reads incredibly fast and is so completely enjoyable. Watching the movie directly after finishing the book is highly recommended.
0897500482|5.0|First I must confess that I'm very much a Bruce Lee fan. He was born a few years before me so we are of the same generation. Someone like myself can't help but wonder, when reading this book, what Bruce might write today from the vantage point of age and experience. My personal opinion is that his basic philosophy would not have changed. He would have probably matured in his ideas and continue to evolve and in middle and old age he would have probably adjusted his martial arts to fit the unique needs of aging. But, we'll never know since he died before he had a chance to age. His philosophy, however, was ancient and great. He was wise far beyond his years. And we can still learn much from him --- both about his Tao (Way) and his martial arts style.<br /><br />The book couples his philosophy, which is mostly Buddhist or eastern, and his method of fighting. I find them both enlightening.<br /><br />For example, he tells us to keep our chin tucked toward our shoulder as a defense. He teaches us how to keep from being an easy target and how to attack with explosive action from a neutral stance. These are things that never go out of style.<br /><br />Lee writes, \\"With the chin dropped and pinned tight to the collarbone, the muscles and bone structure are in the best possible alignment and only the top of the head is presented to the opponent, making it impossible to be hit on the point of the chin.\\"<br /><br />I found one or two things that didn't sound like Bruce and they didn't fit in with his times. I felt the editor took a few liberties and added his own thoughts or what he felt Bruce might have believed.<br /><br />For example, under \\"Everyday opportunities for exercises\\" we read:<br /><br />Take a walk whenever you can -- like parking the car a few blocks away from your destination.<br />Avoid taking the elevator; climb the stairs instead.<br /><br />. . . the rest sounds like Bruce. The above statements, while certainly good advice, were not in the lexicon of Bruce's era. They came into being during the last decade or so. Moreover, these two statements do not sound like Lee. They sound like every modern fitness writer on the planet.<br /><br />This book is more than Bruce's fighting method, though it is that. It is inspiring and powerful. It is full of wisdom and inspiration and thoughtful advice and meditation.  Lee had a wide range of interests. He was a dancer. He was an artist. He took an interest in many things and many philosophies. He was not a good actor. His wife Linda often says that Bruce considered himself a martial artist first and an actor second. I'm not sure that's true. Lee took a keen interest in his acting career and the income he got from it. But like Elvis Presley, his ability to act was very limited. Yet he brought magic to the screen with his lovely body and outstanding skill. He didn't need to be a good actor.<br /><br />Much that we have heard about Bruce Lee is pure myth. But what is not myth is his martial arts greatness and his keen mind that absorbed information like a sponge, his ability to take what he needed from everything and discard the rest. He did not get attached to any one idea. He evolved in his thinking and adapted daily to his needs.<br /><br />There is much about Bruce Lee that is, and probably always will be, powerful motivation for millions. He was only 5' 8\\" and weighed about 140lbs, but he loomed large on the screen and in the hearts and minds of all who saw him or knew him.<br /><br />Whether or not you want to learn about Jeet Kune Do, you will gain much by reading this book.

B000000WFZ|4.0|I know Ennio Morricone's work from his 1960s western scores and his frightening music from films of Dario Argento. Hearing this ethereal religious music is quite a throw, this master composer working making high art that is not high art of pop culture.<br /><br />But you can't deny the sheer dark power of Marricone's orchestral sweep on the Mission. The coral work reminds a listener of 18th century church music from Europe, and the heavy arrangements along with huge modern production give this score quite the impact.<br /><br />And later in the album, the master does return to the dark shadows I know as his trademark. Does the known breed contempt--not in the least. Either way all the music on the Mission is flawless.

B000001FI7|5.0|There was a point in the 1990s when \\"eletronica\\" was on the top list as the \\"next big thing.\\" Suddenly, even grunge bands had that strange, digital drum click on their albums. It had no business being there, but like strings and horns after the Beatles Sgt Pepper, it felt mandatory. It also felt trendy.<br /><br />Portished did not. In 1994, grunge was still king, fueled by Kurt Cobain's death. \\"Electronica\\" was still an underground wave, and Dummy was one of the first albums to crack. It was also, and is sixteen years on, one of if not the best.<br /><br />Unlike the plugged in flannel boy trend mongers, Portishead had a damn good reason for every sample, every beep and blip, and for that matter every sound on Dummy. These were songs lovingly built from the ground up: songs that would have been great with guitar, bass and drums.<br /><br />But Portishead evened the score on every track, perfectly balanced the dozens of sounds, electronic and organic. Listen to the first few seconds of Dummy. \\"Mysterons\\" opens with 1960s creep soundtrack tremalo guitar, weird keyboard effects, and a marching beat. This, like the rest of Dummy, sounds small initially, but in the smallness is tons and tons of sound. Listen to the children's music that appears and vanishes on \\"Stangers,\\" completely out of context but essential once you hear it.<br /><br />Listen to the jazz sax sample on \\"Wondering Star.\\" So quick, so sneaky, so fighting for room in Portishead's texture ocean. Is it a wonder it took this band three years to make a follow up album, each sound in place<br /><br />All this is process, and would mean nothing if not for Portishead's shocking ability to create nuance. Dummy as a whole is a  dark, oppressive soundscape, lead by Beth Gibbons, who kept her voice just below the music, as if trapped, unable to escape her band's claustrophobia. A brilliant vocalist, under cellophane.<br /><br />The music is pure synergy: 1960s  shadow acid, spy soundtracks with the lights shot out. 1990s goth. Drowning  in black paint. If Dummy has one achievement over all its others, it is not in the production or the writing, but its ability to genuinely creep you out.<br /><br /> It is a masterpiece in nuance above all elsemmy has one achievement over all its others, it is not in the production or the writing, but its ability to genuinely creep you out.

0446402397|3.0|I am not qualified to properly review crime fiction novels as I hardly read them. In fact, I can't remember the last time I read about a gumshoe tracking a murderer. The James Patterson-phase missed me, and I'm grateful for it. However, my good friend Dave has been hounding me about Tom Rob Smith's Child 44 for over a year now, and I picked it up again last week after a couple of false starts.<br /><br />This was a fascinating story of a man in search of truth and of redemption from his dark past. Child 44 follows Leo Demidov, a disgraced agent of Stalin's Soviet State police, in 1953. A boy has been murdered, but the State covers it up as an accident. Soon Leo discovers that children are being ritualistically murdered all over Russia, and he and his wife Raisa try to close in on the killer while on the run from his former subordinate in the MGB, Vasili Nikitin.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of reading this novel was entering into the oppressive world of Stalin's Soviet Union. The denouncements, the secrecy, the totalitarian police force, and the removal of basic freedoms made this an especially compelling read.

0061714372|5.0|For decades, true Megadeth fans have always wondered why Dave Mustaine remained so bitter and so acidic toward all things Metallica despite achieving platinum success with Megadeth, a band many metal fans will say is more genuine.  It became clear to me that Dave's rancor went far beneath what we were able to see; his pain not quite so evident until you read between the lines.      This not-so-charmed, fairy tale life of Dave begins with him being born into a damaged marriage (his father being far, far older than most fathers, with previous children already approaching adulthood). Dave, the only boy in a family of girls, represented the last chance of a normal life in a family upheaval. He grew up dirt poor and this is where his personality's genesis began.    The books shows us how Lars Ulrich was a catalyst in creating this monster.  Living a hand-to-mouth existence (by selling drugs) Dave meets Lars, the only child of a well-to-do family living in a well-to-do neighborhood; a boy who wanted for nothing with the self-esteem of a champion.  Lars was really the answer to Dave's dreams.   It can be seen, but not obviously written, that Dave hoped that through Lars' resources (financial, musical, business) Dave could have a shot to pull himself up by his musical and economic bootstraps to escape the lower classes and ultimately achieve security, something Dave never had.    Mustaine found his talents early by writing music for Metallica and helping to direct the band toward stardom. This was his biggest mistake.   For although, Lars and James played on his obvious drug and alchohol escapades, the real reason Mustaine was kicked out (from my view) was that he was a threat to Lars.  Dave was slowly making the band his own because he was proud of their front-running status in Metal. He was *somebody* with Metallica, if they would have given it a few years, Metalllica would have turned into Megadeth, but not with Lars at the helm.  If I was Lars I would have kicked out Dave too.  It was a good business decision on Ulrich's part, which catapulted the band to infamy.    Imagine the pain of being humiliated, not to mention hungry, broke and ashamed; forced to go back into the music scene with the scrubs you *thought* you surpassed, while watching your former friends reach critical acclaim and get rich doing what you loved (with the music you wrote!).  Having to watch the story unfold year after year only to get angrier and angrier thanks to the drugs, the only loyal thing in your life.     The book goes on to describe how he really pulled himself up from nothing (a divine act of God if you ask me) and become the man who he is today.  There were some tender moments in the book about his family and some very descriptive recollections about former band members.   And at the end, Dave fondly reveals that, as James Hetfield remarked, not only does he have a horseshoe up his ass but that God has had his hand on the scruff of his neck the entire time; from the moment he was born until today.     The question the reader asks now is:  how does this story end?

Lush orchestration, vocal sounds that to me harken back to the '80s, and a lot of mid-tempo songs.  Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but this album (after about 5 listen-throughs) is just okay.  Like some reviewers on this site, I won't say \\"they suck\\" because they obviously are able to craft thoughtful songs with meaningful lyrics.  But I don't care too much for their sound and don't see myself listening much to this album.

0061922315|5.0|I loved the book but wanted to comment on a part of India that few tourists understand.  The author lightly mentions that there are snake charmers and performing monkeys in the Mumbai park. What few people know is that this is entirely illegal!  India's animal welfare act prohibits using wildlife in this manner.  Most likely the snake is tortured and will not live long under the cruel conditions in its box. The monkey might have been stolen away when he was a baby from his family. Think people - do you think its natural for animals to be \\"taught\\" to perform like this.  Please, if visiting India, do not support this by giving money or giving money to take photos.   To learn more about helping India's animals see my website search for \\"help animals india\\"    A note there as a mistake in the glossary - one lakh is 100 thousand rupees  (not 10 thousand as stated).

B00005JPAO|5.0|This is a wonderful film with stellar performances by Best Actress Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen. Mirren is surely at the height of her craft as she conveys a wealth of emotion with just a look of the eye or the slightest movement of her hand. Just taken on face value alone this movie is an intriguing peek behind the curtains of the British royal household. This movie, however, delivers much more than just an historical re-telling of a modern event that will certainly become legend in centuries to come.      Behind the obvious storyline of both the royal and governmental reaction to the outpouring of public grief over Princess Diana's death is a subtler look at the role of royalty in modern life. Are the people supposed to serve the Queen, or is the Queen there to serve the people? If the monarchy supplies stability and tradition, should it also adapt to modern times? When should royalty change and how? These questions and more are addressed with a very subtle hand in this excellent film.
B002N8A14M|5.0|This is a great product!  I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but it fits my nano perfectly.  Additionally, the case has a clip on it, so you can keep your nano on your belt loop if you don't want to use the arm band.  I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for something to protect their nano as well as a carrying case. Update - Oct 1, 2011: I was running with my nano in my hand this week and fell to the grown and landed directly on my nano with the case on it.  Amazingly the case did not crack!  The only suggestion I would make to improve this case is for there to be a notch in it where the earphones plug into it.  The way the case is designed it extends beyond the end of the nano and doesn't let the original headphone jack plug completely into the nano.  The next time I have access to a dremel I may cut a notch.

0785134352|3.0|Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr.'s \\"Kick-Ass\\" is hyper-violent, subtly humorous, and thoroughly enjoyable.  It's not quite as brilliant as Millar seems to think, but it's certainly a bloody good time.  The novel (or series, what-have-you) follows Dave Lizewski, a comic book fan who decides to don a crime-fighting costume.  It's not as simple as he thinks, however; when he meets Big Daddy and the ten-year-old Hit Girl, he realizes that real-life superheroes exist in a kill-or-die world, and there's a lot of blood, a lot of pain, a ton of lies and betrayal, and very few happy endings.<br /><br />The graphic novel is a little too self-aware at times, and Millar's writing is only so-so; some dialogue sticks out as memorably funny, but the rest gets buried beneath Romita's amazing illustrations, and the overall concept: What kind of person becomes a superhero?  The answer, of course, is that only screw-ups, only people who've lost everything or are mentally unbalanced become masked crime-fighters.  Millar never really explores this line of thought, but he gets kudos for presenting it, and that's really the point: we're left to create our own theories.<br /><br />Now, like a lot of people, I came to the novel via the movie, so I figured I should include a little bit about how they compare.  Truth be told (and as a fellow writer and a life-long reader, it pains me to say this), I preferred the movie.  The novel has a few things the movie doesn't (namely, the masterfully graphic illustrations), including a darker undertone about Big Daddy and Hit Girl's origins.  However, the movie capitalizes on the humor, which serves as a wonderful counterbalance to the violence.  This IS funny stuff.  Millar seems to realize that, but never fully explores it; he references it here and there, but the humor--just like any intelligent theories/concepts--takes a backseat to the violence.  Millar is out to shock you.  The film does so, but brings caries more fully-realized aspects of humor and concept.  That being said, fans of the film--and comics in general--will get a kick out of \\"Kick-Ass.\\"  There's certainly nothing else like it out there.t being said, fans of the film--and comics in general--will get a kick out of \\"Kick-Ass.\\"  There's certainly nothing else like it out there.
B000THGR0Q|5.0|Ian Anderson's Jethro Tull reach an apex of over the top perfection in this album. The group had been reaching for this sound from the beginning, but studio technology hadn't caught up to Ian's creativity until 1977. From the opening, an a capella chorus, you know this is not your ordinary Jethro Tull Album. The band romps trough a perfect blend of folk, rock, medieval ballad, jazz and blues, often within one song! The tempo changes are wonderful and Ian's flute sounds absolutely diabolical, with just the right touch of the blues, whirling over layers of folk,prog-rock and church organs! Ian sounds like the minster from hell when the band stops to let him sing over an acoustic guitar. The sounds coming out from the speaker conjure a latter day hunchbacked jester spewing spells. One of the best folk-prog album of the 1970's.     Max Milano    Author of \\"The Mechanicals of Recoleta\\"

I highly recommend picking it up.

B00003CXPD|5.0|I just finished watching this treasure for the eighth or ninth time.<br /><br />This time I focused on Billy's Dad who has to give up SO MUCH for his son's dream. It isn't just the pawning of his deceased wife's jewelry, the last possession of any value left in the house or how beholding he has to become to friend's and neighbors for their support, but it is how he has to put aside the beliefs that those in his class associate with manhood.<br /><br />His younger son, his Billy, is choosing the arts in a time when the Dad knows that there is no future in the mines for anyone. Even so, his son's choice runs so contrary to everything he believes makes a boy a man.<br /><br />There are so many powerful father/son moments that it is hard to even recall them all.<br /><br />I weep four or five times in this film every time. The moment of shock in a gymnasium where Billy was supposed to learn to box when he realizes that his boy not only can dance but desires to do so with his whole heart changes the direction of his life and he knows it.<br /><br />The wonderful moment when Billy cries because he was accepted and his Dad's moment of triumph is dimmed by the news that the union was forced to cave in reminds us that this is not a silly story told outside of time, but in the midst of very hard times.<br /><br />And the Dad and son wrestle in the grass and his Dad holds him close (much as he must have done when he was a baby) and they laugh shows how complex their relationship really is.<br /><br />I could go on. I could talk about his grandma, his brother, his dancing teacher, the boxing coach. Each and every one has his own story with Billy. And then there is Billy himself. If the young actor who plays him is remembered for only one film, then this will be enough.<br /><br />Maybe I will at some other time. For now. I am going for a walk. What a wonderful film.<br /><br />I cannot wait until someone realizes there is a market for an enhanced DVD with commentary and background and discussion and a feature on the Ballet.<br /><br />Wonderful, wonderful.l.

B001JNNDBA|2.0|I know now why i never watched this movie years ago, and i'm a HUGE fan of psychological horror. This i'm afraid is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen. For one i'm not a fan of Jake Gylenhall at all, for another this movie makes no sense even in the world of a demented mind. Seeing visions, time travel, jet engines falling on your room for no reason, doing something because you take medication for your troubles and an evil guy in a scarey bunny mask tells you to? Ok. Well it seems the general premise of the movie was to be clever, just like a lot of bands, and tv shows try to be, or speak cleverly to prove its something unique. This movie is a joke within itself, it contradicts itself, by trying to be serious and again by trying to be darkly funny. Well neither work and the movie just falls flat and you end up fast forwarding through the last 40 minutes or so. Anyways movies like this just make me wonder how people can try and come up with ideas, and i think to myself wow i could come up with something ten times more clever. But my ideas would never get heard, this movies is not demented, it just attempts to be.

By the time Christopher feared his father though, it was as if the novel did a total 360 turn; it became quite difficult to get through the pages and I found myself skimming through the rest of the book.  Christopher's character became very annoying and unlikeable to me, for he was obviously selfish, cold, and detached from the attempts of both parents to reach out to him.  I found myself sympathizing with his mother, since it becomes obvious that Christopher is quite a handful.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I bought this for my mom's birthday this year. I started watching it almost immediately, and liked it right away. This is truly a great movie. Orson Welles shines in the title role (and also directed this film), and this is a movie that he will always be identified with. The acting is superb and is wonderfully restored from the highest quality surviving elements. The movie starts out with a newsreel. The second disc contains a documentary titled The Battle over Citizen Kane, and that is definitely worth a look as well. Two thumbs up....WAY UP to Mr. Welles and the rest of the cast as well.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|This is basically a \\"Bush is a war criminal\\" murder fantasy, for the most part. Alan Lang, former British PM who suspiciously keeps making decisions that favor America, is going to be investigated by the Hague for turning over suspected terrorists to the CIA, under whose custody one of them dies. This makes Lang a \\"murderer\\" and potentially, in the bizarre world of the UN, where Iran and Libya are on human-rights councils, a war criminal.<br /><br />The whole film is basically a fantasy-cum-coverup expose, where his ghostwriter finds out the secret behind the demise of his predecessor. It's got touches of quirky humor here and there, and a sedate chase scene or two, but otherwise kind of a slow ride. Alan Lang is basically a stand-in for George W. Bush, whom many want to see prosecuted for \\"war crimes\\" in Iraq, etc. The whole film assumes that Lang's actions do in fact make him a war criminal, so be prepared for a liberal dose of that type of er, opinion. No pun intended. It's always fun, though, to watch Britishisms, which do come out in the course of conversation, well done in understated fashion by all around.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there are little touches of balance. The ghostwriter jokes that he is about to be killed by a peace protester, reminding us that most calls to violence today emanate from the compassionate American left (the compassionate, giving Left being a myth debunked by a surprised Arthur C. Brooks in [[ASIN:B001G8WGF2 Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism]]). Later, Lang makes a good point to the sanctimonious ghostwriter, who regards it as beneath him to work for a war criminal such as Lang. If Lang were still in power, he would make two lines at airports - one where everyone was security-checked, and one where no one was, and let's see which one his critics would put their kids on. I was shocked that this was included in the movie, but it helped make it slightly more palatable.<br /><br />Other than the political overtones, it's a watchable if somewhat bleak mystery movie. I've hidden a clue as to the outcome of the movie somewhere in this review, but it doesn't ruin much.watchable if somewhat bleak mystery movie.

B003L20ICE|2.0|Mark Ruffalo (and the kids) were the saving graces of this pretentious, boring film.  I am one of the few people I know who did not appreciate two of the most famously-straight women in Hollywood playing gay mothers.  Annette Bening (dumbed-down wife of Warren Beatty) chewed the scenery so voraciously, I wanted to throw up.  I don't believe that an irritating character should also irritate the audience so drastically. She looked like she was sucking lemons the whole time.  I think that is what she believes lesbians are like. Why didn't the casting people get real lesbians to play the parts, like Kathy Bates and Jodi Foster, or Ellen DeGeneris and her real-life partner, Portia deRossi? The comment is made early in the film that the reason some lesbians like to watch male porn is that most lesbian porn is portrayed by straight women.  This film makes the same mistake.  I felt no credibility whatsoever in the gay-ness of Bening and Moore, though Moore was a bit more natural-seeming. And why was Mark Ruffalo shunned at the end by the whole family?  I thought he was the least neurotic, most normal person in the movie, and he had a great influence on the kids.  The whole affair thing was seemingly blamed on him and the kids were not encouraged to forgive and forget.  After all, he begged to be part of their lives because he really liked them.  Strange.  The whole thing was a squeamish bore and we almost walked out. I would like to see more films with real lesbians about real lesbian situations. \\"Universal family\\" my butt.  This was just the same-old Hollywood Real Family farce: conservative, pat, sticky, elitist, dull. P.S. See Tom Ford's \\"A Single Man\\" for authenticity about homosexual experience. Of course, the director is gay, which may account for the incredibly sensitive and real way in which gay love and affection are depicted.
B002ZG983M|4.0|Most reviews in the press warned about some kind of ultraviolent, slice-and-dice flick. I was worried. But it's nowhere near as violent as, say, Kill Bill. Not many limbs getting hacked off. Nothing particularly disturbing, although there's implied violence such as a finger getting cut off. It's par for the course for any shoot-em-up these days. No bones breaking and poking through. So what's the real reason for their discomfort?<br /><br />Well, you do have a 10 or 11-year old girl mouthing obscenities. It is a little disturbing, but it's not plentiful, and it is within character - she's been trained by her ex-policeman Big Daddy. So yes, I wouldn't let kids watch this. She does plant blades and bullets into many baddies, but from the reviews I had expected her to routinely slice them in half. There's nary a beheading.<br /><br />It's a tale of ordinary folk trying to be superheroes. One doesn't do so well because he has no super powers to speak of - well, none of them do; Hit Girl and her dad do OK because of rigorous training. Kick Ass gets his ass kicked, though not as brutally as I was led to believe. Well, it's still painful. And there's a bittersweet friendship story in there as well, between Kick-Ass and Red Mist, son of the big bad guy.<br /><br />Underneath all this is a movie with humor, heart and an uplifting shootout at the end.

B000063DFQ|5.0|Piece of Mind (1983) is Iron Maiden approaching their prime. In some ways, it's a tune-up to their next album, Powerslave. The last track, TO TAME A LAND has bass parts that sound similar to RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER from Powerslave. This track, along with WHERE EAGLES DARE are the two best on the album. WHERE EAGLES DARE makes its presence known with a bold drum intro, and establishes drummer Nicko Mc Brain as Maiden's newest formidable force. The song has a very artistic middle section, in which the guitars really ring out a melodic echoey riff that's very catchy. This song alone is worth the price of the CD. Of course, THE TROOPER is a classic, and gets a lot of airtime compared to the rest of the songs. I've always liked the fact that Iron Maiden always has at least 5 super songs in their arsenal on each album. FLIGHT OF ICARUS is solid, as is REVELATIONS. I'm not crazy about QUEST FOR FIRE, as it's the weakest of the tracks, in my opinion. Another thing that stands out about this album is the more raw sound compared with its predecessor, Number of the Beast.I like the duller sound on this album. It works well. All in all, Piece of Mind is a must-have for Maiden fans, along with Powerslave and Number of the Beast. The honorable mention is Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. 9/10

I could tell you that I saw myself a lot in this book, and was equal parts delighted at the author's courage - her absolute pluckiness of spirit - and at the same time, envious that she had the insight and fortitude to know instinctively what she needed to do in order to survive after her divorce.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert's journey of self-discovery (how lame does that sound... anyway...) makes for an engrossing and entertaining read. I absorbed her story with ease, and now that I have finished, all I want to do is to pick it back up from the beginning.

Downloaded the soundtrack, and have been listening to it way too much over the past couple months.  Just received the comic series as a gift, it was (of course) also excellent.  Very interesting to see the story's original, darker vision.  The movie trades depressing plot points & scenes from the comic for a more mainstream Hollywood feel, but does it so well that it doesn't leave you feeling any sense of injustice to Mark Millar's material.  It tells a very similar story, in a different way.  Both are well worth your time!

On one hand, it's short, easy to read, and explains prison life. On the other, Kerman is annoying and never fully contrite about the miseries her drug dealing caused.    There's a lot to like in Orange. Kerman is a free spirit and her drug-dealing tales are fascinating. Also, the book has a great cast. Readers meet Piper's drug-dealing lover, her loyal fiancee, an incarcerated transsexual diva, and many others. Finally, Orange teaches about federal prisons, which are governed by a Kafka-esque logic.    Unfortunately, readers also endure Piper's self love, lack of contrition, and myopia. Kerman felt entitled to services that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) denied her. For example, the BOP refused to furlough her so that she could attend her grandmother's funeral. It is tragic that Kerman could not attend, but she ignores the fact that her drug dealing - not the BOP - prevented her attendance.     BOP personnel often asked Kerman why \\"someone like her\\" was in prison. Kerman's point in mentioning this is that these unenlightened people believed that well-off white women didn't go to prison. Kerman spends pages reiterating that - of course - she was above such attitudes. Another interpretation of the question is that few people with Kerman's opportunities and privileges make choices that put them behind bars.    Orange is the New Black is a decent read, but it could have been so much better.
1439153663|4.0|The Kitchen House is a book where you fall in love with the characters and you don't want to put it down.  It is not a true story, but there really was slavery and it is heart breaking to hear this story and think this kind of behavior really did happen.  The family dynamics and strong bond is incredible.  Loved it!
B002U0KHMY|4.0|If the pilot were representative of the whole show, this would be a 5-star review.  The pilot was well-written and laugh-out-loud funny.  After a couple of episodes, it was down to 3 stars.  By the end, the whole Kate music-box thing had rendered it almost unwatchable.  I am ok with suspending disbelief, but come on, suspending disbelief and suspending IQ aren't the same thing.  The woman is walking around playing clue games and someone is supposed to take this seriously, the fact that she is in serious jeopardy?  If this bit of boring dumb weren't the underpinning of so much of the show, it wouldn't have trashed the whole show, but it is and it does.<br /><br />P.S.  Took heed of the comments and yes, it did get better once Kate died!  Raised from two to four stars.

B002P5XXR0|3.0|I know that people criticize Horner for self-plagiarism a lot and I never really understood what the big deal was until I heard this score. Yes, there are some great moments in this score but many of the most emotional music moments here are almost identical to his other works. Titanic and Glory sequences run throughout this score. Thus, for me, the overall score is no where near to Horner's other masterpieces: Legends of the Fall, Glory, A Perfect Storm, etc.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Dave Lizewski (Johnson) can't help but wonder \\"Why has no one tried to become a superhero?\\" As a comic-book nut he decides to take his passion to the next level and become a real-life superhero. His journey begins where else, EBay! What do you expect when you are a high school dork with only a $200 budget? His next step, a name...Kick-Ass or as Big Daddy (Cage) says \\"more like Ass-Kick\\"! Of course Kick-Ass has no powers, no skills, no smarts and no cool gadgets but he still inspires NY'ers once his beating by 3 thugs becomes viral on YouTube. His life is now changed by having his own comic book and copy cats. It all seems pretty cool, until he is implicated as the vigilante that is taking down D'Amico's (Strong) drug empire! Now, he is hunted by violent criminals and meets up with a pair of real crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old weapons wielding dynamo, Hit Girl (Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy. Kick-Ass eventually learns that the duo have their own score to settle with D'Amico. As obsession turns into madness, Kick-Ass is forced to become a real hero or die!<br /><br />Kudos to everyone involved on this project (both the comic and the film)! Millar's story and Romita's drawings inspired Matt Vaughn's vision and the result is a cult classic that will be loved by comic fanboys and it's own subculture for decades. The true star of this movie is Hit-Girl played amazingly by Chloe Moretz. She absolutely steals the show. Fans of Leon the Professional will immediately pick up the relationship with Moretz and Cage as it is similar to Portman and Reno. The film is dark and although there is comedy, it can be uncomfortable. Ultimately, once the \\"Ass-Kickin'\\" starts, you will be cheering with every dead bad guy! A must see.<br /><br />BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful picture with outstanding sound. The colors pop and the blacks are rich. Blu-ray has made the home theatre experience so much better. SPECIAL FEATURES: Fantastic, although I would have loved deleted scenes. The two best features are long and include a making of and the origins of the comic book. FINAL THOUGHTS: I loved this movie. Comic book fans will jump all over it. Blu ray collectors should add this as well. Casual fans? Once you see it, you will love it too. A MUST OWN!features are long and include a making of and the origins of the comic book. FINAL THOUGHTS: I loved this movie. Comic book fans will jump all over it.

032147404X|5.0|Got this book and it is very interesting and fun to read.  The author doesn't go on and on, but makes it like a conversation that you would have with someone while you were out shooting.  Doesn't go into needless jargon that is useless, just gets right to it!<br />I have already learned a lot, and I just starting experimenting on manual mode.  Make the jump and get this book and get off auto mode already!  You can do it!
1605092762|5.0|This book is fantastic!  I agree that Polak could have been less repetitive at times and still gotten the same impact out of his intended message, but you will not find a better book out there that clearly explains the challenges of people living on a few dollars a day (much of the world's population) to less than 1 dollar a day.  After reading this book, I whole-heartedly believe that the argument for giving-based aid programs is dead and the only effective way forward for economic/community development is through entrepreneurial profit-oriented business models.  The bottom-line of Paul Polak's argument is that we cannot approach aid/development work through Western-institutionalized perspectives or simply give things away because these approaches have not worked in the past and they are certainly not working now!  We need to be pragmatists.  We need to do anything and everything that produces positive, measurable impacts and is sustainable.  If you haven't already read E.F. Schumacher's \\"Small is Beautiful\\" get that as well.  Simple yet groundbreaking ideas and wisdom from Polak and Schumacher.
1439153663|5.0|I don't regularly write reviews about the books I read, but this book moved me to such a degree I felt obliged to do so. I could not put this book down. I laughed, cried, was horrified and hopeful. The author skillfully told the tragic story of life in the south without the graphic details so freely used by the popular authors of today. Each individual character came alive and touched my heart.<br /><br />It was obvious the author respects her readers to imagine the fear, cruelty and devastation without making light of the terrible circumstances the characters endured. Hats off to Ms. Kathleen Grissom and thanks for sharing your gift.
B000002PCS|5.0|The 1980 romance \\"Somewhere In Time\\" is a well-crafted and perfectly cast time travel romance that, sadly, didn't get the premiere it so richly deserved upon its release and as a result, went largely unseen. The score for this movie is every bit as magnificent, beautiful, haunting and timeless as the movie itself. John Barry, known for his scores of the James Bond movies up to \\"The Living Daylights,\\" does a masterful job of composing a beautiful, haunting, magnificent and timeless music to this movie. Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour (a Bond Girl; she asked John Barry if he would write the music for this film and he agreed, when the director said he didn't know if they could afford to ask him because of their budget, as Ms. Seymour wanted Barry to write the music) nd Christopher Plummer star. \\"Beyond obsession, beyond time itself...he will find her.\\"
0399156577|3.0|At last, a Roberts book worth reading. The premise - Fiona is a successful dog trainer in a small East Coast town, and Simon is a man with a small puppy desperately in need of training. The find one another (in more ways than one) and end up pursuing a man from Fiona's past. Fiona was the sole survivor in a string of serial killings, and the man behind it all won't stop until she's is dead. Fiona and Simon grow closer through their shared love of Simon's new puppy, and their growing relationship. Simon is also part of a search and rescue team that uses dogs as their primary tool, so there is a lot of tracking and scenting going on. In fact, dogs play a very big role in this story and are main characters in their own right. While the writing and storyline are much better in this book than some of Roberts' others, I found Simon severely lacking as a character. Fiona was the one doing 100% of the pursuing and Simon didn't seem particularly interested in her. He was lacking in compassion, humor, and just overall niceness, and was a very difficult character to like. There is nothing romantic about their relationship and they're the type of characters that you can imagine will end up divorced quite soon after marriage. He was very similar to the male character in Hidden Riches (also by Roberts) - a real 'tough' guy who couldn't be bothered with the female in his life and doesn't appreciate her.
B002ZG9846|5.0|just an awesome flic-ranks up there in the movie heavens with 'kill bill' and 'watchmen'.  in a nutshell it's a cross between 'leon the professional' and 'watchmen'. some wanker dared to give this movie two stars!!  all i can figure is that that boy just shouldn't stray from the jane austen type of movie.  nuts.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Although I liked both movies Twilight and New Moon, I thought Eclipse was the best of the three movies so far. I can not wait to see New Dawn, if they make it close to the book, it should be the best of the four movies.      I loved the few one liners in New Moon, which I don't remember of hearing any in the first two movies. New Moon actually had a few \\"funny\\" parts in there, which I loved. To me all three movies were worth watching and buying, just as the books were well worth reading over and over. So this movie was a hit for me and I can't wait till the DVD comes out!
B003O85W3A|2.0|I loved the first two Arcade Fire albums, but Suburbs leaves me cold. I'm really trying to give it a chance and some tunes, like \\"Rococo\\" and \\"Modern Man,\\" are growing on me, but the sound is truly awful. Hyper compressed (dynamically) and harsh, Suburbs is most tolerable on only the crappiest of speakers or headphones. Or to put it another way, the better your speakers or headphones are, the worse Suburbs will sound.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I should start saying that i am not a big Dream Theater Fan, i like their music but there are lots of bands i like more... As probably lots of people, my attention was turned to the band as i heard things abuout the highly skilled musicians who are part of this band. Knowing not much more about DT i bought this DVD, and i have to say that this DVD is STUNNING, the production values are very high, and it it really fun to see them playing and hearing their solos and songs.    This is a DVD you will enjoy no matter if you are fan or not of DT, this is a DVD that every person who likes to see and hear playing outstanding musicians and instrumentalists will enjoy. Seeing and hearing this DVD makes you want to grab your instrument and practice!. Not one of my favourite bands, but, definitely, this is one of my favourite concert DVDs...
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|Here's what I like about this series, Lethal Weapon 1-4:<br /><br />1.  Mel Gibson plus Danny Glover (and in some, Joe Pesci), are a winning combination.<br /><br />2.  Less shelf space for 4 DVDs.<br /><br />3.  Less packaging waste for 4 DVDs.<br /><br />4.  INEXPENSIVE!<br /><br />You would be lucky to get these four DVDs separately for $40 total.  What a bargain!  The two-sided disks are only a minor inconvenience; you might have to spend 15 seconds turning a disk over to get the movie you want.
B002QW7ALM|3.0|There's nothing terribly new in PANDORUM.  It's 150 years in the future, and the earth is dangerously overpopulated, and have sent a gigantic spacecraft into space with 16,000 people in suspended animation, with the idea of reaching a new planet that looks suitable for human life and saving the human race.  But things haven't gone exactly right...a disease that causes madness (the titular Pandorum) has ravaged much of the crew and many of the people on the ship have evolved into super-tough but super-ugly mutants (they reminded me of the cavedwellers in THE DESCENT).    So a small (very small) rag-tag group tries to start the power back up on their ship while surviving the creatures, pandorum and each other.  Squishy mayhem ensues.    A few things distinguish PANDORUM.  The art direction is impeccable.  The spacecraft is a fully realized maze of cabling, containers, steel and mucky liquid.  With outstanding lighting design, we are often only able to see tiny bits of the ship at a time, forcing us to experience the dim hallways and gangways just as the frightened survivors do.  Again, the idea of a dark, cavernous ship can be traced directly back to ALIEN (and probably back from there)...but this setting still can create an excellent sense of claustrophobia.  And you never know where or when something will leap.    I also enjoyed the performance from Ben Foster as Corporal Bower.  Foster is an interesting actor, always adding a twist of craziness to his performances, from SIX FEET UNDER to 40 DAYS OF NIGHT to 3:10 Tor O YUMA.  Here he doesn't so much play crazy as frantic and scared.  But he brings more to his underwritten and uninspired role that most actors would manage.  He's just more fun to watch than most actors would be in this part.  I also liked Antje Traue in the even more underwritten role of \\"the tough fighting girl who works alongside our hero.\\"  She looks physically convincing enough, like a German Rhona Mitra.  Dennis Quaid is given top billing, but really has little to do for most of the film.  He's mostly collecting a paycheck here...not his fault though.  The script by Travis Milloy is strictly by the books.    The film holds a couple of modest surprises as it reaches its climax.  But they hardly turn the genre on its head either.  This is a film that looks good...but mostly that's it.  The fight scenes are appropriately bloody and noisy...but we've seen it all before.  The special effects are quite competent, but are hardly boundary stretching.  In the end, I'd say this is a film for fairly hard-core sci-fi action fans who don't mind an unoriginal story.  Or members of the Ben Foster fan club, if there is such a thing.
B001HN694K|1.0|movie was absolutely used! came w/ scratches on it...will not be purchasing movies anymore on Amazon, that's for sure...
B001AQO46E|1.0|Great film! Arguably the best film Arnie ever made - so why only one star?    Because This is a review of the Blu-Ray edition and there is no Blu-Ray edition.  Fox in their wisdom have failed to release the film in the format that it's fans are demanding.  All I can say is that despite these difficult financial times, the cofers at Fox must be overflowing and business must be good. Why else would they not release an obvious money spinner?
B003S897UK|4.0|I just got this release in the mail two days ago. Great looking package with cool photos/liner notes and great artwork. I pre-ordered it for the bonus disc but I must say, the bonus disc is a disapointment. Solid versions of some soundcheck songs but only 4 tracks total. Nothing special and just not worth it. But the official release itself is very good. I must admit, though, disc 1 is lackluster. I wasn't really impressed and was disappointed upon first listen UNTIL i popped in disc 2 which literally smokes. Little Milton belts out the grittiest, most soulful blues songs and Warren just scorches with his leads. Sitting back in my car at night hearing the opening notes of \\"When the Blues Come Knockin\\" was just fantastic! Disc 2 ends with Little Milton leaving and Audley Freed (of Cry of Love and more notoriously The Black Crowes) joins the band for a heavy hitting, thick, rich, sludgy \\"Power of Soul\\" which is absolutely the standout so far. Warren and Mr. Freed tear it up and it's great to hear some good old fashioned Woody basslines! Woody's rich and assertive but groovy bass lines make him one of my favorite low end riders. And of course Matt Abts reigns supreme behind the kit. Truly one of the greatest drummers in rock and roll today. I haven't listened to Disc 3 yet so this review is a little incomplete but I am excited for what's in store. Overall, definitely worth the money for a purchase: great package, great artwork, and a killer 2nd disc and a likely killer 3rd disc make this well worth the cash. Happy listening!
1847242537|4.0|This is the best book of the trilogy. But I'm not sure how it will translate into a movie since the book, if literally made into a movie would be a kind of S&M pornography mixed with romantic porn. Could be big. I suspect that this mixture of S&M with romantic sex is the reason for the book's success. The tale itself is good, but the way it is told is what keeps it going. I saw the Swedish version and unless I'm forced to, I won't see any more of the films.<br /><br />The two protagonists are Blomkvist, a middle aged guy in so-so physical shape who wanders around having women jump his bones wherever he goes. He never asks or pursues anyone, women make him cooperate with the inevitable. Poor baby. That is a fantasy character that lots of older men can like. :-)<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a fantasy woman for both men and women. I have heard women say they love Lisbeth because she can take care of herself and feels no problem with it. She's like a boy in a woman's body. For men, what middle aged guy is not going to like the idea of a girl like one of his daughter's punk-pierced girlfriends walking into his bedroom and insisting on humping him? In terms of fantasy, the weakest part of the book is for women who may wonder why these female characters all want to \\"boink the Blomkvist\\". He explains that women feel so comfortable they just can't resist. But hey, I'm no judge of what women want. Mostly, it seems women prefer the bad boys to the good boys.<br /><br />In the context of this frumpily middle aged sex god is a tangled intrigue of sadistic murder that is quite well done. It's a classic \\"locked room\\" story with lots of twists. I like how he ends the story long after an American author would have ended it.<br /><br />Yes, I liked the story. Wound up reading it through the night. The author makes excellent use of regular frame shifts to keep curiousity up.
1934030554|4.0|This book is probably the standard in power training. I'm getting ready to implement some of the training programs. Very detailed on power analysis.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|I've always had an appreciation for The Roots as one of the more talented and original hip-hop groups that never became totally embraced by the mainstream though they've seen some degree of success and fame nonetheless. The other reviews that say this album can be listened to from begining to end without skipping a single track are totally right. Texturally this album is jazzy with a dose of funk to make you bounce intertwined with impressive lyricism to make you think. Black Thought proves his lyrical prowess with many impressive and thoughtful verses. The guest emcees bring the fire aswell not once lowering the intergity of the album or standing in Black Thoughts shadow. The songs consist mostly of catchy and melodic sung hooks, some sampled, some not, with rapped verses. When it comes to favorite tracks I honestly would have to narrow it down to the few songs I don't love rather then narrow it down to a few favorites. The album is just THAT GOOD.    Some of the more recent Roots albums, while being good, have left something to be desired. I can't help but feel The Roots struck the perfect balance of style and substance on this album. It's refreshing in our current golden age of style over substance to see a hip-hop album heavy on soul and light on filler. This is exactly what a good album should be. Memorable. Succinct. With the perfect balance of style and substance. I'd recomend you purchase (yes, purchase) this album right now if you haven't already. This is certainly my favorite hip-hop album of this year and one of the best overall.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|The blues: That elusive genre of music that, despite my enormous music collection, I have failed to investigate thoroughly. Like country and rap, reggae and jazz, I have skirted the blues for as long as I have been listening to music. I don't know why, since it is the foundation to most of the rock and roll that I have been enjoying all these years.<br /><br />\\"Memphis Blues\\" is lost on me in terms of being familiar with the original versions of these songs by the original artists. In fact, most of these songs I have never heard of before. In that sense, Lauper has done her job, she has introduced me further to the blues. Now, I'm not saying I have anything against the greats like Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Louis Jordan, John Lee Hooker and B.B. King, but none of them have been able to get me to buy the blues for some reason or another.<br /><br />I have been listening to Cyndi Lauper since I first saw her video for \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" as an 11 year old back in December 1983. I have stuck with her through thick and thin, through the million sellers and the complete duds. \\"Memphis Blues\\" is not true blues in the sense that Cyndi is truly a pop singer, not a blues singer, but she has selected true blues songs and refashioned them to suit her. She does not possess a truly whiskey-soaked voice for the blues, but she does a serviceable job.<br /><br />\\"Memphis Blues\\" contains 11 tracks, and none of them are bad. None of them are super-fantastic either, though. But listening to this album repeatedly all week long, I felt it was enjoyable, never dull or boring, and just the right length. My favorites are definitely \\"Crossroads\\", \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", \\"Early In The Mornin'\\" and \\"Just Your Fool\\". I like how she selected \\"How Blue Can You Get?\\" which was sampled by Primitive Radio Gods' 1996 smash hit \\"Standing Outside A Broken Phone Booth With Money In My Hand\\" from their album \\"Rocket\\".<br /><br />Lauper really shines when she duets with B.B. King, Ann Peebles and Jonny Lang. I really liked \\"Crossroads\\", and I think that might be the best track here. The rest of the tracks are all good, and the album as a whole is actually one of her stronger albums.<br /><br />As a diversion from her usual music, this is worth it because she does a decent job of it. Rod Stewart should tear a page from the Lauper playbook. Instead of doing boring standards (which Lauper failed miserably at too), Mr. Stewart has the perfect vocals for the blues (are you reading Rod?)<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that it is most bizarre that this album his her highest charting album on the Billboard Top 200 behind \\"She's So Unusual\\" and \\"True Colors\\". I can only attribute this to her appearance on Donald Trump's \\"Celebrity Apprentice\\" earlier this year where she even performed one track from this album. To me, though, this is a travesty, because Lauper did some good stuff that never got any attention.<br /><br />Now, I don't want to say this, but I am glad Lauper did a blues album, but it's time to get back to the basics again, and give us something experimental, quirky and eccentric, but totally melodic and memorable.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Memphis Blues\\" compares to Cyndi Lauper's previous work:<br /><br />1980 Blue Angel: Two Stars<br />1983 She's So Unusual: Five Stars<br />1986 True Colors: Five Stars<br />1989 A Night To Remember: Three and a Half Stars<br />1993 Hat Full Of Stars: Five Stars<br />1996 Sisters Of Avalon: Four Stars<br />2001 Shine (full Japanese import): Three and a Half Stars<br />2003 At Last: One Star<br />2005 The Body Acoustic: Three Stars<br />2008 Bring Ya To The Brink: Four Stars<br />2010 Memphis Blues: Four StarsCrossroads\\", and I think that might be the best track here.

0393072231|4.0|Every tragedy has a tale. This tale of greed is told through the eyes of outsiders who bet against Wall Street's greed, and won. Ironically, so did Wall Street. There lies the tragedy.<br /><br />Told by retracing the path taken by a few contrarian outsiders - Steve Eisman, Michael Burry, Greg Lipmann, Howie Hubler, and others - who saw the house of cards built by a grotesque mix of greedy and sometimes outright stupid Wall Street bankers, and stamped with the authority of incompetent, \\"brain-dead\\" employees of the ratings agencies - S&P, Moody's, Fitch. While the book does a great job of sort of peering from behind the shoulders of these people as they go about trying to figure the market and its players, it does not do that good a job of putting together the historical context and the big picture - in that respect it seems a bit hurried.<br /><br />****** Burry said, \\"... I also immediately internalized the idea that no school could teach someone how to be a great investor. If it were true, it'd be the most popular school in the world, with an impossibly high tuition. So it must not be true.\\" [page 35]<br /><br />Steve Eisman is a second-generation Wall Street fellow (his parents worked on Wall Street), who is marked by an almost complete lack of social grace (he does try and develop some inter-personal skills after the collapse of Wall Street though).<br /><br />****** \\"The single greatest line I ever wrote as an analyst,\\" says Eisman, \\"was after Lomas said they were hedged.\\" He recited the line from memory: \\"The Lomas Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial institution: it loses money in every conceivable interest rate environment.' I enjoyed writing that sentence more than any sentence I ever wrote.\\" A few months after he published that line, the Lomas Financial Corporation returned to bankruptcy. [page 3]<br /><br />It doesn't end here. Steve Eisman was plain blunt when it came to voicing his opinions. There doesn't seem to be a shade of gray here - things for him were either black or white, never anything in-between.<br /><br />****** Once, he got himself invited to a meeting with the CEO of Bank of America, Ken Lewis. \\"I was sitting there listening to him. I had an epiphany. I said to myself, 'Oh my God, he's dumb!' A lighbulb went off. The guy running one of the biggest banks in the world is dumb!\\" They shorted Bank of America, along with UBS, Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, and a few others. They weren't allowed to short Morgan Stanley because they were owned by Morgan Stanley, but if they could have, they would have. [page 174]<br /><br />...<br /><br />****** \\"We have a thesis,\\" said Eisman. \\"There is going to be a calamity, and whenever there is a calamity, Merrill is there.\\" When it came time to bankrupt Orange County with bad advice, Merrill was there. When the Internet went bust, Merrill was there. Way back in the 1908s, when the first bond trader was let off his leash and lost hundreds of millions of dollars, Merrill was there to take the hit. [page 175]<br /><br />A prominent theme of Barry Ritholtz's book, Bailout Nation, was that the ratings agencies were, if not outright hand-in-glove with the investment firms in the ratings fraud that was the subprime mortgage bonds, at best outright incompetent. Michael Lewis comes to the same conclusion, pretty much, but it is much more devastating an indictment when delivered through the words of an insider - yes an insider.<br /><br />****** But everyone on Wall Street knew that the people who ran the models were ripe for exploitation. \\"Guys who can't get a job on Wall Street get a job at Moody's,\\" as one Goldman Sachs trader-turned-hedge fund manager put it. Inside the rating agency there was another hierarchy, even less flattering to the subprime mortgage bond raters. \\"At the ratings agencies the corporate credit people are the least bad,\\" says a quant who engineered mortgage bonds for Morgan Stanley. \\"Next are the prime mortgage people.\\" Then you have theasset-backed people, who are basically brain-dead.\\"<br /><br />So you have greed, a willing accomplice in the ratings agencies. Now you need to cover your theft in a cloak of incomprehensibility. I.e., to be able to pull off a fraud, you first have to not call it a fraud. In the world of finance, in the esoteric world of asset-backed securities, you began the process of dissemination by calling them anything but junk.<br /><br />****** It's too much to expect that the people who run big Wall Street firms to speak plain English, since so much of their livelihood depends on people believing that what they do cannot be translated into plain English. [page 218]<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />****** Bond market terminology was designed less to convey meaning than to bewilder outsiders. Overpriced bonds were not \\"expensive\\"; overpriced bonds were \\"rich,\\", which almost made them sound like something you should buy. The floors of subprime mortgages bonds were not called floor - or anything else that might lead the bond buyer to form any sort of concrete image in his mind - but tranches. The bottom tranche - the risky ground floor - was not called the ground floor by the mezzanine, or the mezz, which made it sound less like a dangerous investment and more like a highly prized seat in a doomed stadium. A CDO composed of nothing but the riskiest, mezzanine layer of subprime mortgages was not called a subprime-backed CDO but a \\"structured finance CDO.\\" [pages 126, 127]<br /><br />  ...<br /><br />****** To wipe out any triple-B bond - the ground floor of the building - all that was needed was a 7 percent loss in the underlying pool of home loans. That same 7 percent loss would thus wipe out, entirely, any CDO made up of tripe-B bonds, no matter what rating was assigned it. [page 129]<br /><br />****** Eisman  had long subscribed to a newsletter famous in Wall Street circles and obscure outside them, Grant's Interest Rate Observer. ... In late 2006 Grant decided to investigate these strange Wall Street creations known as CDOs. ... In early 2007, Grant wrote a series of pieces suggesting that that the rating agencies had abandoned their posts - that they were almost surely rating these CDOs without themselves knowing exactly what was inside them. ... For his troubles, Grant and his trusted assistant, was called into the S&P for a dressing-down. \\"We were actually summoned to the rating agency and told, 'You guys just don't get it,'\\" says Gertner. \\"Jim used the term 'alchemy' and they didn't like that term.\\" [page 177]<br /><br />Michael Burry was perhaps the first to buy a credit default swap on these sub-prime mortgage bonds. He had what people called an anti-social personality. It was only later, much later, that he learned that he had Asperger's Syndrome, and that too because his wife took their son to a doctor, who diagnosed their son with Asperger's.<br /><br />****** When he thought of it that way, he realized that complex modern financial markets were as good as designed to reward a person with Asperger's who took an interest in them. \\"Only someone with Asperger's would read a subprime mortgage bond prospectus,\\" he said.

In the ensuing two weeks, the publicly traded index of triple-B-rated subprime mortgage bonds fell by nearly 20 percent. ... On Friday, June 15, Burry's Goldman Sachs saleswoman, Veronica Grinstein, vanished.

B001AEF6D6|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen, it tries to be funny but never once did i even come close to laughing, there are many scenes that are just worthless to the movie - like all the scenes with Julianne Moore (a good actress) who is given a bunch of ridiculous dialogue for a character the movie easily could have done without, Peter Stormare is also wasted in more garbage scenes as a German who's after Bridges, John Goodman (Bridges best friend) is embarrassing as a fat loud mouth psycho who plays his part over the top, Steve Buscemi is also wasted as a bowling partner of Bridges and Goodman, he practically has nothing to do but utter a few incoherent sentences while Goodman immediately responds by telling him to \\"shut up Donny\\". I have liked some of the Coen brothers movies but this film is truly awful and an embarrassment for everyone involved.
B001TH16DI|5.0|My only issue with these films is that they are the original Theatrical versions. That's fine but they already released them on regular DVD. Why on earth would Paramount not release the Special Edition or Directors Cut versions on Blu-Ray and take advantage of the extra space these discs have?     Anyway, overall I am very happy with the films picture and audio quality.

B002IFOY5C|5.0|Only once in a blue moon do we get to have this amazing cast in one film. Cop Land has it. I mean Stallone, De Niro, Kitel, Liotta in one movie? But it is really beyond that. It is a movie that really shows the great abilities that all these actors have. Sylvester Stallone in particular, gives a truly amazing performance. He gains a lot of weight to play the role of Sherrif Freddy. This is one thing that not many actors can do. I really admire Sylvester Stallone for what he did in order to play this role and he did a very good job. Just the intensity and the interactions that we see from all these great actors, will keep you on the edge of your seat. Totally recommended.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I do not think it has a \\"pop sound\\" ....don't know why others say that.  IMO if you compare it to most rappers out there, he sounds way LESS \\"pop\\" than the others do.   -This is tight, sick and gets better each time I listen.  Speaking of comparisons to others, if what you like is that ridiculous auto tune crap .......then don't bother with this. Recovery is , just like Eminem's other music, completely his own- He dances to the beat of his OWN drum. Much respect for that.  This is personal for him and for me, as I am in recovery myself and even so I am amazed that he can do this sober and pull it off ; and the result is stronger than any previous album.  I would say the whole album is comparable to the title song of   8 Mile.....Yes, it is THAT GOOD..Glad to see the corny gimmicks from the past are not here. Just damn good flows and no fillers.  Just great intense flows and power.  No victim mentality here.
B002Q9VP4I|5.0|After reading several of the reviews on here, it is abundantly clear that a majority of the reviewers missed the point of the film entirely.  Scream is Wes Craven's attempt to pay homage and occasionally lampoon the genre he had been apart of for a quarter of a century, when Scream was released in the mid nineties.  As a horror fan, the film was revolutionary to the genre, because it infused fun and comedy into horror.  If you are a horror fan, all the winks and references to seminal horror of the late seventies and eighties (ie Halloween and Friday the 13th) should be very enjoyable.  This film might well be responsible for bringing horror back to the big screen, as it seemed destined for straight to video at the time, with it's humor, wit, and pacing.  If you're a teen reading this, skip it and go text through the entire crappy remake of whatever classic film Rob Zombie is ruining this week, because I'm sure you've never seen the original, or wait for Scream 4 to be released watch it and then realize their might actually be some good horror out there that doesn't have Hannah Montana in it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I have never owned a portable recorder before so I have limited experience.  Having said that, I am astonished at this little jewel's capabilities.  I read reviews which said that it is hard to use, but if you can read and follow simple directions, I see no problem there.  In fact I would say that it is quite easy to use.  The onboard speaker is not great but plugging it in to a good set of speakers solves that problem.  It is so much fun to play with.  I would highly recommend it.
B001JNND9W|3.0|I received the Blu-ray DVD and even with firmware updates on my Panasonic BDP-121 Blu-ray the DVD would not play.  I suspect it is because it has a dual US and UK format that the Panasonic can not handle.  I don't want to condemn the DVD but the problem is unclear and may well be the Blu-rau firmware and not the DVD.
006123141X|4.0|The Doomsday Key  is one of James Rollins's Sigma Force novels. You don't have to have read them all to enjoy one of the series, but it helps. Sigma Force is a special unit within the US government that deals with deadly, often complex threats, typically based in both science and history. The Sigma Force novels are for people who enjoy plenty of wild action--bombs going off, bullets flying, sex, romance; not to mention the exploration of some of the great mysteries of history, such as the pyramids, Merlin, religious miracles, prophecies of doom and destruction, Atlantis, etc. Add on top of that a hefty dose of cutting-edge science--in this case the genetic engineering of crops--and you've got a heady mix that some will find too over-the-top while others revel in the fun.<br /><br />Rollins writes guilty-pleasure adventure books. They have something of a case of kitchen-sink-itis (i.e., he throws everything into his series but the kitchen sink). However, this doesn't keep his novels from being a whole lot of fun. He ties all those wild historical references and theories together quite skillfully (and he's gotten noticeably better at it over time). Let's face it--it's fun to read about fascinating religious theories, scary (or awesome) new scientific developments, and dangerous conspiracies. His character development in particular has become much more skillful over time. My only mild annoyance there, in this case, was that while yes, his female characters are strong, it's kind of annoying to have both major female leads want or need the male lead to \\"save\\" them in some manner.<br /><br />Rollins includes a write-up at the end detailing which bits of history and science in the book he took from real-world events and theories, and which he made up himself. If anything, I find this to be one of the most fascinating parts of the book. Sometimes the reality of things can be just as wacky and weird as the fiction.<br /><br />[NOTE: review book provided by Harper-Collins]
1433503808|5.0|I am a Christian who spent her college years in a secular religious studies program. I have heard a lot of arguments against the innerancy of the bible, and I've heard a lot of professors teach liberal views on authorship and dating of scripture. One of the greatest things about this bible is that the notes and articles address all of these fallacies that are being taught in the academic world. I feel like many study bibles pretend that the way they present things is the only way that anyone interprets them, but this bible gracefully acknowledges discrepancies, and intelligently presents a biblical point of view.  The notes are extremely insightful and thought provoking, and reading in ESV is a great change of pace for me, though I never feel like the translation is forsaking the original meaning of the text for stylistic purposes.    I love the page layout in this bible too. The text is not in columns, so it reads more like a regular book, which is neat, and when the text is poetry, you only have one column, so you can read the poetry with only original line breaks.  I also love the big margins in the poetry; there is plenty of space for my notes in Proverbs or Isaiah!  This bible is beautiful and great for personal, academic, or theological study. I highly recommend it!
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Charlie Bronson/Michael Peterson is quite a character.  I'm told that the events and details in this film stray a little here and there from the truth, but all in all it makes for a quite entertaining look at one of the most violent prisoners in the UK's history.  Actor Tom Hardy, who got amazingly buffed-up for this role, brings the right amount of humor, pathos, and dangerous zaniness to the title role.<br /><br />You can't help but cheer for Charlie Bronson, though you will be glad you are doing it from a safe distance.<br /><br />Bronson the man has quite a story.  \\"Bronson\\" the movie is a tour-de-force of bravura and playful acting by Tom Hardy, and deserving of all its accolades.  No one I have spoken with who saw this movie failed to be entertained by it.<br /><br />Buy it, rent it, I don't care.  Just watch it.  [Big grin]

In the beginning you start out not liking any of the characters and not really caring what happens, after awhile though you really start to care about the characters and it's surprising how much you want it all to turn out well!! Any movie that has me cheering along with the characters and crying with them is a good one in my book. BTW it doesn't hurt that the main guy character is not hard to look at in the least!!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who like old movies or even just romances. Hope you like it.

B00005JL0I|2.0|British comedy of the 1960s is pretty cheesy at the best of times, think 'Carry On...' but this one, Casono Royale, is just mindless pap. Sellers, Niven, Wells and Andress do nothing to uplift this trash for me. And oh dear, as that Woody Allen? It's so awful, it makes Austin Powers look GOOD! Long, overplayed sequences and gags so devoid of humour, they sound as though they were lifted directly out of 'The Goon Show.' But there is one redeeming feature, hence the two stars for my review: I love the theme tune! I'd buy that on MP3 but leave the movie well alone, and go and watch the new version instead!
B002QFYJF4|5.0|This might be the best film ever made. I have now seen it at least a dozen times and it literally gets better every time.

Saw detail I never knew existed.

In short, get this now if you don't have it already. It is by far the most darkly complex, emotionally charged and action-filled DC animated film ever. I was blown away!
B002ZG980U|5.0|NEVER listen to the critics, they must not be smart enough to understand this movie.    It's one of the most interesting movies I have seen. It's about dreams. Yup, dreams. Dreams in dreams in dreams in dreams. People losing thier grip on reality sometimes because they think thier dream is real. Do I have your attention?    It's confusing but not impossible to understand. It has a much deeper story especially in the main character, whos name escapes me right now.    Anyways it's relay inventive and different. And It's done well. Tons of combat, twists, eplosions, and even emotional moments. And I got a count of 2 funny moments.    When a movie is confusing and hard to follow, it's interesting. This is a very interesting and some of the things that happen are just plain AWESOME. Like losing gravity or gravity shifting. And even the idea of the whole dream thing.    Also, great voice acters and epic special effects.    Highly reccomended you see it in theaters. Great ending, too. I'm buying it when it comes out.

0743454537|5.0|I must say, I was very hesitant to read this novel because of how much I disliked the film adaptation, but I am SO glad I gave it a chance. I loved this book! From the very first chapter, I was hooked. Jodi Picoult has quickly become one of my favorite authors. She has an amazing grasp of the language and I feel like she \\"gets\\" her characters, makes them real which is something that so many authors just cannot do. I found myself changing opinions about a few of the characters as the book went on, they all felt so real and I felt sympathy for each of them in some way. The situation that the central family is in is something unimaginable. I can see things from both sides, from the mother's point of view and from Anna's point of view. I can't imagine how difficult some of these decisions would be to make. I'm not sure there is a right choice in some instances, maybe just the lesser of two evils. I cried a lot while reading this book. I had been warned to keep a box of tissues nearby, but kind of took that with a grain of salt. Boy, I sure wish I had had some around (I ended up using my sleeve to wipe away tears quite a bit). This is such a powerful novel, I was seriously blown away by it. I highly recommend this one to everyone. Actually, I recommend most of Ms. Picoult's novels. She is an amazing talent. I think this one ranks as my second favorite of her novels thus far. The ending to this novel was so much better than the ending that was given in the film, it is very different. I personally think the book's ending is way more plausable and I felt it more, hope that sounds right. Just go out and read this, I cannot say enough good things about it. Loved it!
B000FA57US|2.0|The title of the film seems rather nonsensical. Who is Michael Myers getting revenge on? The people who tried to kill him? Michael's target is still his niece, and she didn't really do anything to him aside from running away and screaming. Is he getting revenge on the police who gunned him down? Then why doesn't he target them instead of picking off horny teenagers? Not only is the title bad, but the slug line is dumb too. \\"Michael lives. And this time, they're ready!\\" No, they're not! Everyone but Dr. Loomis and Jamie act like Michael is dead and gone, even as people get picked off one by one. And when the cops finally hatch a plan to catch him late in the film, Michael outsmarts them!     Halloween 4 brought back the unkillable masked murderer Michael Myers, and the fans responded by making The Return of Michael Myers a huge success. So the producers, Trancas International, decided to strike again while the iron was still hot, and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers quickly went into production.    Released in 1989, a year after Halloween 4's release, Halloween 5 picks up a year after the the events of the previous film. Michael Myers was left for dead, and his niece Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) has seemingly taken on the evil force that possessed Michael. But rather than run with the premise of a little girl as an evil killer, Halloween 5 takes a different route. We find out that Jamie has spent the last year in Haddonfield's Children's Hospital, unable to speak and plagued with telepathic visions of her uncle. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) believes that Michael is still alive and that Jamie's visions will lead him and the police to Michael so they can kill him once and for all.    And where has Michael been all this time? Why, comatose in a hermit's cabin, of course! Yes, really. Did the hermit feed him all this time? Does Michael even need to eat at all? And wouldn't even a hermit do something with an unconscious body, be it let the cops know, abandon the body somewhere, or even bury it? And what happened with Michael's mask? It has completely changed from the mask he wore in Halloween 4. Did they even try to make a similar mask? Doesn't look like they even bothered.    Unfortunately, Jamie's adopted sister and protector, Rachel (Ellie Cornell) is dealt with very early in this film, and Halloween 5 introduces us to a fresh crop of fun-seeking teens for Michael to slaughter. Unlike Halloween 4's love triangle involving Rachel, Brady, and Kelly, these kids have little to do with the actual story. We meet Tina (Wendy Kaplan), an incredibly annoying party girl and Rachel's friend, who almost takes up the role as Jamie's protector, but it's never really all that believable since she's merely a friend instead of a relative, and spends most of the movie acting like life is a neverending party, totally oblivious to the threat to Jamie's life. Her character never comes off as sympathetic either, since Tina's character type is always the one who seems to get killed first in these movies, so the audience finds themselves begging Michael to kill her just to be rid of her. We also meet Tina's friends whose names aren't even all that important since their deaths come of little consequence to anyone. They're merely there to give Michael someone to slice and dice.     We're also introduced to a mysterious Man in Black, and no it isn't Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones. The Man in Black possesses the same strange triangular symbol on his wrist that Michael does and he seems to have an interest in the killer, but his connection to Michael is never truly explored until the following movie. The film ends on a cliffhanger, but it's nowhere near as shocking as Halloween 4's ending.     You get the sense that the script could have used more than a few rewrites and a more inspired choice for director than Dominique Othenin-Gerard. He doesn't seem to know how to build suspense or atmosphere, just seemingly bouncing from kill to kill without any reason to care about those in Michael's crosshairs. For these reasons, Halloween 5: The Revenge of MIchael Myers is easily one of the worst in the franchise.
B002ZG983M|4.0|I was expecting a family movie where some kids were super heroes and it would be cute.    WOW was I wrong!! Don't let kids watch it!    Kids have decided to stop watching cimes and do something about it.    The kids curse, ALOT!! Almost to the point where it's over-extensive. And the kids beat-up....no KILL evil guys. With blood and everything.    The main kid is not a very good hero. But the little girl owns everyone with knives and guns.    If you want to see a little girl kill people with knifes and have pleanty laughs in an adult movie, go for it.
0071636080|2.0|This book promised to not be a book about Steve Jobs, but to really take you through the \\"secrets\\" of his presentations. I found it very difficult to read, difficult to get in to. I know the book is about his style, but it seemed to be mostly about how good he is.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|I've had Within Temptation on my wish list ever since I heard Sharon on the Avantasia \\"Metal Opera\\" album.  I finally ordered Mother Earth, Silent Force, and The Heart of Everything.  I come from a power metal background, but I have fallen in love with all of these albums.    Silent Force is completely original and different than anything I've ever heard.  Even the wimpy slow tracks are awesome, because her voice is so beautiful and captivating.  I can't listen to anything else at the moment.  Stand out tracks are Angels, It's the Fear, and Stand My Ground.  The bonus tracks are worth the extra dough, they are not extra filler.  I recommend the expanded edition with extra's Jane Doe, Destroyed, and Say My Name.  All great songs.    If you're just checking out Within Temptation for the first time this is a good starter, all though I prefer The Heart of Everything.    I'm totally sold on this band, and I just wish that I had bought these sooner.
B0030MM68O|1.0|Having served in the military i had thought it may have good performances, action scenes and so on.  I soon realized very quickly that this is another failed attempt by a Frenchman that wishes he could direct and produce a military drama out of a documentary.  Since the movie was released worldwide sooner than it opened in the states it was leaked onto torrent sites.  Many people downloaded it but found out that it was just another poor foreign film.  The producer, Nicolas Chartier claims he lost revenue to people downloading it so he is suing his fans that actually liked the film.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|FANTASTIC ALBUM............EACH SONG HAS KYLIES BLEND OF GREAT POP AND CATCHY TUNES.....I LOVE get out of my way......there is an added bonus of a dvd with 3 tracks live from US TOUR.....BEHIND THE SCENES OF ALL THE LOVERS VIDEO SHOOT....PHOTO GALLERY...AND MORE..........ALSO THERES EXTRA STUFF FOR YOUR PC........AND KYLIE STICKER AND GREAT BOOKLET........I GIVE THIS 10 OUT OF 10...............GREAT

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Between the impeccable video/audio transfer quality and the heap of features, this is a must-own for any sci-fi blu ray enthusiasts!
B0035V35P8|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie about an abandoned boy who is picked up by ninjas and lives with them for his pre adult years. He goes through intense training involving strict punishment. Eventually he becomes fed up with his master for being so brutal and merciless and goes rogue. He ends up in a city in the US and defends a women against the same ninjas who he was in class with. Pretty decent film, but in no way is it like an Ong Bak or Undisputed when it comes to martial arts. This movie does use a lot of CGI whereas those other series mentioned do not.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The Matrix Triology is a great set and to have it on Blu-ray just makes it even better. A must have!
B001Q8FRVC|5.0|The Offspring was one of the first bands that I really got into and this was the album that hooked me way back in high school. This album is still just as good if not better than the first time I heard it. I just recently started buying vinyl records simply because I love that crackling sound you get and this was one album that I had to have for my collection. Highly recommended.
B001HN6940|5.0|Personally, I thought this film was just \\"alright\\" after I saw it in theaters. But I think that was because I simply had a bad theatre experience (crap theater, horrible projector, annoying crowd) and now after having seen it a few times on blu ray, it's simply fantastic. It is definitely DEMO quality in terms of showing off what your blu ray can do on your HDTV. Burton's odd style fits perfectly with this universe and the entire cast delivers great performances. A very different Alice tale, but one that is definitely worth a watch!
B00009RGBS|5.0|Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger make this movie a hit. It is the best musical I have ever seen.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|I don't usually review movies - this is the first time. I just saw that this movie had a 3.5 star rating and had to do something about it. While it's not the best movie ever made, it is very very good. The cast performs exceptionally - especially WIlliams as Ruth. The plot keeps the viewer involved, and there is always a suspenseful feel. Highly recommended.
B000095K7A|5.0|Out of the thousand of albums I own this is one of my favorite albums in my collection. Ben Gibbard is one of the best songwriters of his generation and teamed up with Jimmy Tamborello the two of them create wonderful indie pop music. From the opening track \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" to the final track \\"Natural Anthem\\" I can't imagine this album being any better. When you have an amazing song like \\"Such Great Heights\\" and it isn't even the best song on the album you know that you've got a winner.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|After viewing the live concert on blu-Ray, I instantly purchased all four albums. I'm the newest victim ( killers fan club ). Video quality and sound quality are top notch. If you like any of the killers songs I would highly recommend this video. Don't miss out!!!!!!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|This movie is Clint Eastwoods best. One of the best movies I have ever seen.
0307271862|5.0|I have read all of Mankell's Swedish novels, and liked them all.    But I liked this one the best.    It is huge, sprawling, epic, breathtaking.    It starts as usual--though with a bang--with a bloody, inexplicable massacre of the elderly (and one boy) in a remote Swedish village.    This plot quickly widens to include a staid, overworked but unflappable judge in a much larger town.    And this, amazingly, swells to encompass an enormous plot spanning Europe, the United States, and China.  And not only is the plot vast in space, it is stunning in time: from 1863 in China and the U.S., to the present in China, England, Africa, and Sweden.    The characters, as always with Mankell, are quirky, only partly likable, believable, and endlessly interesting.    And also as always, Mankell freely engages in political, economic, and historical editorializing throughout.  Many find this intrusive or worse, but it is one of the things I like best about him.    While every component is fascinating, the thing I found most amazing was the rollercoaster, horrible, odyssey of San, from poverty (near starvation) in 1863 China, to betrayal, transportation to the U.S., enslavement working on the transcontinental railroad, escape and reenslavement, and finally, painfully, release, but only after more betrayal and humiliation back in China.    An amazing book.  Not just a profound mystery but a profound novel.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|Vampire Diaries may be another mushy CW teen drama, but it's at least engaging and very violent. It's about a normal High School girl Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) that drawers the attention of two vampire brothers Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder). Elena looks a lot like the vampire woman that they once loved. Stefan gets with her, which leads Damon to be jealous, but he's still protective of Elena.<br /><br />  Damon is both good and bad, you never know when he'll kill an innocent or help them, he's unpredictable which is why I like the show. Damon always makes things more interesting and Ian may not be the best actor around, but he's probably at least the best actor on the show. Damon is at least the best character that's making it to season 2.<br /><br />  Some fans complain that the more likable characters in the show die, when the annoying ones live on. I won't mention names, but a certain vampire girl that I loved was killed off, so I kind of agree that the show kills off some of the better characters. Damn, she was mad cute too and she wasn't whiny or annoying like some of the other girl characters can be.<br /><br />  I rolled my eyes the first time I saw a commercial for Vampire Diaries, I was expecting a Twilight rip-off. Hell I was thinking True Blood was one too. But it turns out that the Vampire Diaries and True Blood books have been around longer. So, sorry Twilight fans, Twilight didn't invent vampire and human couples. I'm sorry but Let the Right One In (or the American version Let Me In) book has also been around longer than Twilight as well. Hell, Buffy the Vampire Slayer did it long before Twilight too. My point is that...Twilight isn't as original as you think. I know that doesn't have much to do with my review, but I wanted to get that off my chest lol.
0140277447|4.0|On the one hand, it's a must read.  So many people have no idea how brutal and barbaric the Japanese were.  Or, for that matter, how brutal war really is.      On the other hand, to tell the story from the point of view of the Japanese and then retell it from the point of view of the Chinese was somewhat tedious and redundant, as if a professor were writing it to fill a semester's worth of study and tests, rather than to chronicle the story of Nanking.      My other complaint is the incessant call for reparations at the end of the book.  If everyone in history got reparations for \\"man's inhumanity to man\\", we'd all be paying each other and we'd be right back where we started.  It was okay to point it out in the book, I guess, but it seems to deserve the description of \\"incessant.\\"
B001G70M6S|5.0|I recently discovered an old polaroid land camera in my closet that was in need of some film.

B002ZG9846|4.0|Teenage comic geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) asks the question \\"why hasn't anyone ever tried to be a super hero ?\\" to his friends. Which leads to him giving it a try and calling himself Kick-Ass. He gets hurt bad the first time, which doesn't stop him from trying it again. After his second attempt is a success and he becomes a hit with the public, a dangerous criminal leader Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a hit on Kick-Ass.<br /><br />  D'Amico thinks that Kick-Ass is the super hero that's getting in the way of his business, when it's in-fact Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his sidekick daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz). To get his father's approval, Chris D'Aico (Christoper Mintz Plasse) volunteers to disguise himself as a super hero named Red Mist and become friends with Kick-Ass and gain his trust.<br /><br />  Oh no! There's an 8 year old that curses her head off! I should be a big wuss and hate the movie like some of the dumb critics out there. Sue me though, I loved Kick-Ass. Critics who hated the film mostly due to Moretz's potty mouth annoy me. I mean Roger Ebert for one, loved the Exorcist and Orphan and didn't those films have young girls saying horribly disturbing things ? So that's just a poor excuse to hate on the film. It's still incredibly entertaining and easily the best comic based movie since the Dark Knight.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I have so many bitter and wonderful memories about this movie.  This movie is about understanding our desires in relationships.  I read a few reviews saying there were no likable characters in this film, and while I don't think there are any cookie cutter good guys, I don't think that is true.    Spoilers  The movie starts with a romance between Jude Law and Natlie Portman.  Its almost purely physical it seems, and after a while because of the lack of tension he finds attraction with Julia Roberts.  Because he can't have Julia, because she doesn't want to cheat on Natalie, Jude pretends to be her on a sex chat with Clive Owen, in what may be the performance of his career.  He wants to have control over her since he can't exert that in a relationship.  He is not being honest with his partner.  Taking away control from her for selfish reasons.  Julia and Clive really do fall in love and get married, and eventually she runs accross Jude again.  They begin an affair and fall in love each dumping their partners.  In order to get the divorce from Clive, Julia sleeps with him, and Jude dumps her because he can't take the knowledge and the control taken away from him.  Jude eventually wisens up and goes back to face Clive, who tells him there is no way he is getting Julia back, but he knows where Natalie is and he should go back there.  But before Jude leaves, he has to exert control, and tells him the reason he knows where she is, is because he slept with her after Julia dumped him.  Jude and Natalie get back together, but Natalie denies sleeping with Clive.  Time passes and Jude begs for the truth because it is eating him up, and Natalie admits to it, before breaking up with him.  That was her control in the relationship, and having to give that up again is too painful, and she leaves.  It is revealed ingeniously that she had more control that thought because she did love him, and she had to protect herself, where as she did not with Clive because it was just sex.  its about protecting our emotions in an oversexed world.  A lot of people don't like Clive and Natalie because they had sex, but they were both single and consenting adults, but Natalie is pure enough to get away.  Its about honesty and power games in relationships, and how vulnerable we are willing to be.  How well we know people, and how we are different people with different people because we are never ourselves with them.  Great film
B001OQCV6A|1.0|Sadly, I bought this instead of renting it!  I so loved Jeremy Brett, (died at 51) as the ultimate Sherlock, that Robert Downey,Jr, never had much of a chance!  That aside, it was a big snooze fest and my husband walked away after only 15 minutes into the movie! a lot of smoke and mirrors and a very weak plot. We waited several months for this to hit the DVD market. Big disappointment!
B0013FFMOK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0013FFMOK I Am Legend (Full-Screen Edition)]]  Great movie!  After a disease wipes out the inhabitants of New York, Will Smith portrays Dr. Robert Nevil who is the last person alive who is not infected.  He desperately searches for a cure for this disease so that he can cure the people who remain infected.  The first time I watched this movie, I didn't really like it.  But after watching it a few times, it kindof grew on me, and now I can't stop watching it.  I hightly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure.
0671775308|4.0|This book was very good.  It was very eye opening and showed what habits millionaires live by.  It definitely is repetitive and at times a little hard to read or stay focused but the author drives his point across.  Would definitely recommend it especially to young people.
B002ZG9800|5.0|I simply couldn't wait any longer for this film to open in America, so I bought the DVD from AmazonUK (yes, I have a region free DVD player).<br /><br />  OMG this is one of the best films I've seen this year.  Jim Carrey gives a performance worthy of year end award consideration in this funny, absurd and poignant romantic comedy about a gay con-artist.  This is the Carrey of The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and Eternal Sunshine, and he shines in an often challenging role.  Ewan MacGregor is equally affecting in the role of Carrey's love interest.  There are some broad and outrageous moments; this is a comedy after all.  However, there are an equal number of lovely, tender moments of romance and passion.<br /><br />  This film has been in some legal battles and so the American distribution has been held up.  I hope these problems get resolved and this finds its way to a theatre near you.  Don't miss it.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This show rocks so hard it hurts.  Wizards, magical swords, hot girls in skintightleather, and a wonderful love story, what more could you ask for.  Bridget, Craig and Bruce are amazing, portraying loveable, believeable, timeless charactersa and though the series does not exactly follow the books by Terry Goodkind it is still awesome.  Definitely a must see for everyone out there.  If you love true love and skin tight leather you'll love Seeker.
B003L20ICE|4.0|The Kids Are All Right is a thoroughly entertaining slice-of-life domestic drama about two kids who look up their sperm-donor father, causing cataclysmic changes in the family dynamic.  Not a unique premise save that the parents of the kids happen to be lesbians.<br /><br />  The entire cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for this film is to show straight America how \\"normal\\" gay families are and that they shouldn't be afraid of \\"gay marriage\\" or \\"gay parenting,\\" thus it doesn't delve too deep or wander too far off topic.  Political film making is a tricky business.  You'll remember the Tom Hanks drama Philadelphia was maligned by the LGBT activist fringe for all the issues it didn't address; to which my answer has always been: it's a two hour film, if you add too many spicy issues you're left with an unpalatable polemic.<br /><br />  The script and direction by Lisa Cholodenko (High Art) are tight, well focused and only occasionally heavy-handed.  Her characters are fresh, while being stereotypically familiar to pre-conditioned movie-goers.  These are folks we know, people we work with and/or live in our neighborhood: \\"normal\\" people.  Is it perfect?  No; there an almost fatally flawed plot contrivance that seems only there to provide the filmmaker an all too easy source of conflict.<br /><br />  What elevates the film above the run-of-mill movie-of-the-week domestic drama is the acting.  Annette Benning is staggeringly good as the head of her household - the alpha female in this case.  Her performance is embarrassingly rich; she presents a myriad of conflicting emotions, each one immediately recognizable, true and never over played.  Julianne Moore turns in a lovely portrait of the less-successful, less self-assured partner.  Mark Ruffalo is a revelation as a forty-something man finally approaching adulthood; a free-spirit, still capable of making disastrously foolish decisions in his pursuit to find personal fulfillment.  Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are always on target as the kids, conveying the perfect blend of angst and innocence.<br /><br />  Just as they did with Juno and Little Miss Sunshine, the film community is falling all over themselves hyping this.  Like those films, The Kids Are All Right is an entertaining, socially relevant effort and deserving of quantified praise; but don't be mislead, it's not Citizen Kane.ing the perfect blend of angst and innocence.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|If the first season was awesome you have to make up a new word to describe the epicness of the second season.  The addition of Tabbrett Bethell took the show over the top.  Every scowl, every glare will make you love her even more.      If you thought fighting a tyrannical dictator wasn't epic enough how about fighting the keeper of the underworld himself.  Zombies, a more powerful Kahlan, sisters of the dark and light, striving to save the world of the living from death itself, and even more hot girls in skintight leather.      This second season just kept getting better and I can't wait to get it.  Why ABC/Disney did not renew is beyond any kind of reason.      Join the fight to Save Our Seeker!!! [....]
031606792X|5.0|I have now read this book 9 times and it continues to give me an escape from the daily routine and keep me balanced between the things I must do and the things I wish I could do.  It is also a very lovely reminder of the relationship I have had with my husband until he got sick and bedridden.  I find joy in taking care of him now but the Twilight Sage Breaking Dawn as long the the others gives me a HAPPY place to go every so often for balance.  I could probably talk for three days about teh content of the book going into extreme detail about about every small detail as I have always believed that Bella's strength shows up in the details and how she hangs onto what she truely wnats.  She is an awe character.  In the end through the power of LOVE she brings together 3 diverse groups to fight for the same goal adn these are groups who in the beginning where not blendalbe, Humans, Vampires and Werewolves.  Imagin LOVE being able to do that!  Maybe it truely is the key to diversity comeing together as one.  LOVE is a powerful thing.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This film has incredible imagery, and great story line. Cantica plays an endearing and curious little girl that almost anyone can resonate with. Don't mind the negative reviews, obviously it's not for kids (it's rated R), and it isn't Hollywood with happiness all around.

B002ZG997C|5.0|In the end, this movie is all about the power of Jehovah God, the power of his Word (the Bible), and the power of faith (the faith of Eli, played by Denzel Washington).  Furthermore, there is a good bit of theological symbolism thrown in as well, all of which makes it an unusual movie to come out of Hollywood.  Christian fundamentalists may find it doesn't fit their strict ideas very well, and on the other side of the spectrum those who are actively non-JudeoChristian may well be offended when confronted with the message of the movie, which is the gospel.  I, however, would highly recommend it as representing the very core of what it means to have a relationship with God.

He provided such ridiculous details that offered nothing to the story that I found myself barely reading some pages..I didnt like the fact that he would introduce a scene between the characters then fast forward to a different year and leave you wanting those details...If I could get my money back I would.

1439153663|5.0|This is one of the better books I've read this summer.  I read the first chapter and wasn't sure I'd continue, but then quickly got sucked in.  A complex story, I found the characters believable, and the situations true to the era.  While tragic in many ways, ultimately it is a story of love and family and bonds that can never be broken.  If you are looking for a good read for book club, look no further.  This is it.
0385736002|2.0|I'm not a young adult.  I should state that up front, since that may qualify my review.  I am 3/4ths of the way through the last book of the series, and truthfully, I'm not sure I'm going to finish it.  I no longer care about any of the protagonists.  The teens who are central to the story don't show any signs of character development, and no real inherent redeeming characteristics.  I'm almost to the end of the series and I still don't have much insight into the motivations of the adults, John Dee excepted.  It's one big dysfunctional family, slogging their way through one book's worth of plot spread over four books.  With historical figures name-dropped in all higgledy-piggly.  When Virginia Dare and Billy the Kid showed up I started getting embarrassed for the author.  I wish I could recommend this.  I like the premise, name-dropping aside, but I really truly can't.
B003TZ9EGO|2.0|How many more versions of the same songs are we going to promote for this artist? Really now. Different outfits on the cover and some clever marketing, gives us the impression that we are running out of real talented artists. I already have ONE version of his CD THAT IS ENOUGH Don't waste you money.
0525423842|4.0|Thirteen-year-old Theo Boone is the only child of two lawyers (divorce and real estate) and the nephew of a disbarred attorney. He has spent his childhood hanging out at the courthouse and at his parents' legal practice, where he even has his own \\"office\\". The other students at his school come to him with their legal problems, which range from an escaped dog in the clink to an older brother also in trouble with the law. When Theo arranges for his class to visit opening arguments for an exciting murder trial, he's not expecting to find himself right in the middle of the investigation. Can Theo help see justice done?<br /><br />Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer is John Grisham's first book for young readers, and it reads like classic Grisham mixed with the children's books that I read as a kid. Theo Boone is a wise-beyond-his-years teen who is more comfortable with adults than with other students, and so the book is more successful when Theo is hanging with his favorite judge at the courthouse than when he is with his classmates. This book is often more an adult's idea of what childhood was than a kid's description of what childhood is.<br /><br />With that said, there's a reason that Grisham has sold as many books as he has. His books are compulsively readable, and Grisham knows how to put together a sound legal mystery. He also brings together an interesting mix of characters, and I liked Theo's relationship with his parents.<br /><br />The true test, of course, will be whether my students like this, and I'm interested to hear their response. I'm also interested to see improvement in future titles. The ending of this book is terrible, and it's clear that Grisham is still adjusting to writing for a younger audience. I look forward to the next adventure of Theo Boone.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000C5RQF Mozart - Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute) / Keenlyside, Roschmann, Hartmann, Damrau, Selig, Allen, Sir Colin Davis, Covent Garden]]  I read some comments about Simon Keenlyside being one of the best Papaguino in our days as well as Diana Damrau in the character of Queen of the Night, and knowing that both were part of this cast I had to buy this production. Beside I was very impressed with Simon Keenlyside in the role of Hamlet for his qualities as a singer-actor.  I didn't know about the rest of the cast, but I have to agree that all of them are very good.  The quality of the DVD was outstanding. The sound, light effect was very successful.  The scenery, although plane was very effective enhancing the argument very successfully.  I highly recommend this production.
B000HIVOFU|5.0|The reason I purchased this CD was primarily because of its sound quality, not the songs. However, I did listen to a preview of all of them to make sure there was nothing objectionable on the album like rap or electronic music. All of the songs on here are pretty good, although my favorites are Spanish Harlem and Fever.<br /><br />The sound quality on this CD is indeed of high quality.  If you like the style of the artists on this compilation and want to see how good your audio system can sound, I highly recommend this disc. Very natural, good dynamic range, very well recorded.  I am happy I purchased it.

6302763835|3.0|Although there were notable exceptions, in the 1950s most horror films were little more than drive-in dreck--and then, in 1955, came THEM! The movie had a new story line: atomic testing had mutated insects that grew to enormous size and threatened the existence of human race.  It also had a good script, good cast, good special effects, and exceptional atmosphere.  When it became a big hit everyone rushed to cash in, and TARANTULA! was among the first mimics.<br /><br />TARANTULA! isn't in the same class as THEM! but it is several steps ahead of most \\"big bug\\" movies.  Professor Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) is working with atomically bonded nutrients that have the effect of making animals grow much larger than normal.  Among his subjects is a tarantula, and when his assistant wrecks the lab the creature escapes into the countryside, where it continues to grow while munching on cattle and the occasional human.  Soon local doctor Matt Hastings (John Agar) and Deemer's newest lab worker Stephanie Clayton (Mara Corday)--not to mention the entire population of their small town--are on the run.<br /><br />The film's special effects mixed tarantula models, shots of a live tarantula on minature sets, and lots of rear projection, and while it wasn't quite as \\"state of the art\\" as some would have you believe, it was still pretty up-scale.  Unfortunately, the script and performances are ho-hum and the pace seems rather slow.  Fans of 1950s \\"B\\" horror will find it entertaining, and it might do as popcorn-thrower for a family night, but beyond that TARANTULA! doesn't deserve the exclamation point.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B003PBB4ME|5.0|like many who purchase this, i film skateboarding. i have a nikon d5000. for a dslr, this helps a lot with stabilization because you have to hold a dslr differently than a camcorder. i recommend this if you have one. also id your camera has bad sound quality you should buy an external mic and put it on top.also obviously a good fisheye with a wide angle close to 180 degrees. its very high quality and worth themoney i definately recommend buying it for a dslr

2070360024|5.0|I read this masterpiece in French, but would not insult the crystalline clarity of Camus' prose by attempting a review in the same tongue. Indeed, a review of such a classic is pointless; all that is possible is a personal reaction.<br /><br />I found myself held in horrified fascination as Meursault sleepwalks through the burial of his mother, his job in Algiers, his girlfriend's embraces, and his neighbor's scheme to teach his own mistress a lesson, all under the heat of the desert sun. Even had I not known in advance, I could feel that something bad was about to happen, and it was almost a relief when it did. At least then there would be time to seek some meaning in such a barren life.<br /><br />The meaning comes in the penultimate paragraph when Meursault rails at the priest who visits him in his condemned cell. In a long diatribe, filled with a passion that had been missing in the book so far, the young man proclaims that, compared to the uncertainties of religion, he at least has lived in the surety that the life he has lived from moment to moment has been his and his alone, and that the one validating certainty is the death that comes to us all. Dark though it may be, this comes across as a triumphant cry of self-possession. Camus has written that Meursault is the man who can only tell the truth, who has never mastered the little lies that the rest of us use daily to simplify our social lives. Unwilling to play the game, he remains the outsider, the Stranger. The last word in the book is \\"haine\\" -- the hatred he expects from those come to watch his execution; Meursault wears it as a medal of honor.<br /><br />All the way through my reading, I felt my intellectual responses kicking in. The simple style of short declarative sentences, which I gather Camus based on American writers like Hemingway, also seemed to presage the obsessive detail of the nouveau roman. The succession of almost-random events looks forward to the theatre of the absurd. The many similarities to JMG Le Cl&eacute;zio's first novel, [[ASIN:0828837074 LE PROC&Egrave;S VERBAL]], only underlined the fact that while the later author is full of emotion, Camus describes even love-making in a manner bleached of all emotive content.<br /><br />But all this was a smokescreen to hide my sense of being there with Meursault and hating being there. I somehow missed reading Camus when my college friends were doing so in the late 1950s, so I am astonished to see how totally he captures the spirit of that time that was not even his own. Or perhaps it is a young man's thing, this living for the moment, making choices on a whim, and above all this inability to feel emotion. At any rate, I was there then, and Camus makes me live it all again. At the time, however, it was not self-possession but anomie. It sent me to mental hospital, but also made possible a long search for deeper meaning in how I lived. Camus' terrible masterpiece takes me right back, but at least now I can watch with the knowledge that death is NOT all there is to life.first novel, [[ASIN:0828837074 LE PROCÈS VERBAL]], only underlined the fact that while the later author is full of emotion, Camus describes even love-making in a manner bleached of all emotive content.

B000W91RUG|1.0|My husband and I love the Big Bang Theory, but we never saw the first season, so I decided to buy it. This was my first try at buying a used DVD- my husband said \\"They are not subject to wear in use, so it should be fine.\\"   The First Season set is three discs- the first two discs would show us most of the first episodes, then freeze or jump back to the menu. We only saw one or two episodes to the end. The third disc would not \\"Load\\" properly and displayed only error messages. Disc 1 had some visible marks, so we tried to clean it, but it did not help.   Through Amazon, I sent an e-mail to the seller \\"The Hills\\" on July 28, explaining the problems and asking for a refund. That was 10 days ago, with no reply from the seller.   I am upset with the seller and will probably never buy used DVD's again.
0345495004|4.0|Loving Frank follows the story and love affair between architect Frank Lloyd Wright and his mistress, Mamah Borthwick Cheney. When they were both living in Oak Park, IL (a suburb of Chicago) Wright met Mamah while building a house for her and her family (which included a husband and two children). They fell in love and set the stage for one of the most scandalous love affairs of the turn of the century. Mamah left her family to follow Wright to Germany, and Wright left his wife and six kids to have a relationship with Mamah as well. The press were all over their affair, likening Mamah to the Whore of Babylon and Mrs. Wright the angelic victim who never lost faith in her husband.<br /><br />This book tells the story from Mamah's point of view, and paints a strong woman in search of herself and her place in the world. While both of their actions were incredibly selfish in respect to their families, the book goes to lengths to describe what they meant to each other, spouting Ellen Key's philosophies of the importance of not sacrificing yourself to a loveless marriage. Mamah is a very intelligent woman, who set herself up as a translator of the same Ellen Key's works for America and went through the world with her eyes wide open. The character portrayed by Horan acknowledges the fact that Mamah knew what she was doing to her kids, and Wright's kids, but that she really believed she was doing the right thing for them all long term. Reading this book I was able to understand the point of view of the 'other woman', even though I don't necessarily agree with her actions.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful glimpse into Chicago in the early 1900s and a good characterization of Frank Lloyd Wright. It also sheds light on Mamah, who in the passage of time has become more of a caricature than a real person. I highly recommend it to all historical fiction fans and lovers of Wright's amazing architecture.<br /><br />Chicago in Wright's Time:<br />Frank Lloyd Wright spent the first 20 years of his 70-year career in Oak Park,IL building numerous homes in the community, including his own. He lived and worked in the area between 1889 and 1909. One can find Wright's earliest work there, like the Winslow House in neighboring River Forest, Illinois. There are also examples of the first prairie-style houses in Oak Park. He also designed Unity Temple, a Unitarian church, which was built between 1905 and 1908. Oak Park had just become its own city in 1902, and was vastly underdeveloped at the time of Wright's residence, surrounded by a prairie, which probably served as the inspiration for Wright's Prairie School of architecture. All of Wright's houses that he built in Oak Park still stand, and most of them are still lived in. If you ever take a trip to Chicago, go a little further west to Oak Park to see these houses, and Wright's home and studio, which has been modified into a museum. A must see for any lover of architecture.<br /><br />About the Author:<br /><br />Nancy Horan is a writer and journalist whose work has appeared in numerous publications. Loving Frank is her first novel. She lived most of her life in Oak Park, IL, until her recent move to an island in Puget Sound. She was awarded the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction in 2009.<br /><br />Similar books to consider:<br />Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson, Dragonwyck by Anya Setoneer in Oak Park,IL building numerous homes in the community, including his own.

144233620X|1.0|Please note that this review is for the audiobook version only.      If you like audiobooks and appreciate the more talented readers, this book will be a huge disappointment for you.      Unfortunately, Lisa Genova's reading of her own book is essentially uninspired and monotonous, and does not do justice to the excellent printed version.  She makes no attempt whatsoever to personify the characters by altering her voice in the slightest degree, as most audiobook readers do when they're rendering different character types and genders.  There is very little inflection. The vocal pacing is identical everywhere, regardless of the pacing of the written content.  Listening to this audiobook is every bit like hearing someone read a technical journal aloud.    Normally I avoid audiobooks read by their own authors, because as a rule authors make terrible readers. I made an exception with this book because I saw one or two reviews that gave the audio version a thumbs-up.  One reviewer even called the reading \\"illuminating\\".  Good grief.    It's too bad.  The subject material deserved better.    UpRight Ape
0786166835|5.0|An amazing story, well narrated by the reader.  While parts of the story may seam a little stretched, I sensed that the basic elements are true.  All consistent with what I have read about the gulags.
0451228375|5.0|I so loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" I couldn't wait to read this book.  I wasn't disappointed.  If anything, I enjoyed this novel even more.  Follett's writing puts you right in the story, where you are experiencing life in 14th century England, from royal intrigue and battles with France, to the struggle for power by lords, and the church, to the fight for more independence by the men and women who worked the land. You'll find yourself benefiting from Follett's intense research while enjoying the fascinating characters as the story unwinds.  The \\"bad\\" guys are really bad and the good not perfect, which makes this book just about perfect to me.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is my favorite vampire film since Blade I suppose, and is a really artful production.  The film is about how a beautiful teenage swede, in the most troubled teenage years and with a backdrop of neglectful and perhaps alcoholic parents, finds his only friend in a young girl who's very pretty and, it turns out, undead and quite bloodthirsty.  He asks her to be his girlfriend, it's really sweet.  She is also quite lonely and their teenage sense of loneliness in the big city, is monumental and convincing.      SPOILER ALERT:     And BTW, since usually vampire stories have at least overtones of some kind of morals tale, such as the Ann Rice's film version of \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" where there was much conjecture that Lestat's vampirism was a veiled metaphor for a deviant sexuality.  Or in the \\"Blade\\" franchise, where vampires are merely a more blatant example of corporate greed, etc.  Oskar's interaction with Eli, and their final scene most especially, is portent of a most special kind of relationship, not necessarily a healthy one.   My personal interpretation is that the dark side of Oskar's childhood; the neglect and broken home, manifest in his relationship with a creature of the shadows, that only he can communicate with, and using only Morse code.  Which is an awesome metaphor for any number of modern conditions and for my teenage years also in a sense.  Eli's ambiguous sexual identity is suitable, because it's Oskar's soul that is lonely, not his body.
1451539347|4.0|Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth were happily in love and ready to be married - until Anne's friend Lady Russel persuades her that Captain Wentworth, a poor man in the army, is not the man for her. Eight years later, however, society brings them together again. Anne still loves him, and she must divulge if he still loves her, a hard task considering all the lovely young women who would do anything to marry the handsome and now wealthy Captain. Persuasion is a story filled with jealousy and uncertainty, as well as passion, simple joy, and a powerful, unconditional love.<br /><br />Persuasion is my third Austen novel (the first being Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility); I loved it. It kept me up late at night - midnight and later. I finished it in four days, which is a record for me as I do not read classics very quickly.<br /><br />In one word, I would say this is a simple book, in the best sense. It is written well and the way the events of the story are played out build the characters' personalities, their way of living. The story progresses in just a way that mirrors Anne's feelings for Wentworth... In the beginning, there is no word of a Captain Wentworth, and Anne's life is happy. At least, on the outside. As everything falls into place, however, Anne becomes more and more unnerved and unable to conceal her love, the love she's had all along. The tension between the Captain and Anne Elliot was substantial and realistic. I was very impressed and am every excited to read and re-read all of Austen's wonderful novels. They're sitting on my shelf...waiting!
B00003CXXS|3.0|Spielberg bailed. He was too busy bringing AI: Artificial Intelligence to the screen. Joe Johnston, a more than capable director himself, stepped in delivered a decent timewaster, but failed to give us anything new and didn't even bother to attempt an epic.<br /><br />Above and beyond all things, what cripples Jurassic Park 3 the most is the brief running time. The film fades out at the 84-minute mark, which is just unacceptable. The previous films were epics and both clocked in at over 2 hours. Why on earth did Universal take their biggest franchise at the time and cut it down to this? It beggars belief. The film feels like a TV pilot more than it does a cinematic event.<br /><br />Strange since the budget was $30 million higher than Jurassic Park in 1993. But the effects have improved drastically in that 8 year gap. I was never too keen or impressed with the CGI in the first film. The dinosaurs just didn't look right, but if you dared to criticize the film at the time you would have been shouted down.<br /><br />A lot of story concepts came and went before they, unimaginatively, settled on a \\"same again\\" scenario with yet another extended chase on Isla Sorna. Some of the scenes are even recycled unused sequences that never made the final script edit in the first two. At least they brought back Sam Neill as Alan Grant and had a small role for Laura Dern. William H. Macy provides great support too. It's good to see him do action for a change. And the kid in this one is far, far, far less aggravating than those annoying brats in the original film.<br /><br />John Williams didn't return, instead leaving the scoring chore Don Davis who made an adequate, if hardly memorable, attempt. All the good stuff is Williams' themes from the other movies. And since he made a few themes for this one I will assume that any noteworthy cues within were actually Williams' contributions, and not Davis', who I have never really liked.<br /><br />The action IS brilliantly done though, and the Spinosaurus, the new villain is quite scary. But just as it builds up to a big showdown,the film just...stops. What were they thinking? There's no payoff, no defining money shot. It just ends! That is my biggest problem with JP3. The familiar plot, and the lack of originality are forgivable, but rolling the credits at 84 minutes is a joke.<br /><br />I still recommend it for the action, sound design and effect alone.<br /><br />It's strange how these films are not on Blu Ray yet. Even on DVD the DTS sound design is unbelievably aggressive and powerful. Think of how good it would be in DTS HD-MA. And imagine the dinosaurs in 1080p. Come on Universal, get working on it!te scary. But just as it builds up to a big showdown,the film just...stops. What were they thinking? There's no payoff, no defining money shot. It just ends!

B003O85W3A|5.0|Most music I listen to is either danceable or emotional.  Arcade Fire has undoubtedly dominated the emotional realm and I am supremely grateful.  I associate their albums with fictional events, just because it suits me:    Funeral sends me to that moment when I hear the ice cream truck coming. I'm at the top of the big hill with my $2 in quarters in my pocket and my 4 speed bike under my feet, and just then a big smile spreads across my face.  I lean into my handle bars, and rush down as quick as I can, met by all my best friends as I race through the Neighborhood, and its pure bliss.    Neon Bible is more like lying on the roof of my apartment, contemplating what I'm really doing in life, when it hits me- it doesn't matter, I'm just a miniscule part of this big machine called 'existence'- and with that I'm freed but also met with the sad beauty of life being 'insignificant'.  Nearly tearful as I leave the rooftop, I appreciate the world more than ever.    The Suburbs being a little longer kind of evolves.  I'm at school walking through the halls like I know what's cool, slapping hands with my buds, catching a few glances of the old faces, friends or not, when I get to the door to history class and remember what my grades have been recently.  I know I'm doing alright but it won't be good enough for me to be a doctor like I'd hoped, but life isn't over, there's something out there.  Just as I'm feeling a little lost with how overwhleming things have been lately, my girl pops up and gives me a peck on the cheek.  I know life is big and when I look into her eyes, my worries don't disappear, but it gives me hope.  Graduation is quickly approaching, and it's scary, but I know I'll give everything I got to give my girl and I, a happy life.    An unorothodox review for an unorthodox band.  I highly suggest all of these albums, as evident by the 5 stars.  I can see why people value Funeral over the others but I think every album is beautiful and sincere.  Personally, I'd say The Suburbs is the most accessible and evokes a subtler range of emotions.  The tracks are all lovely and if you enjoy the experience I've had, then maybe you'll enjoy something similar on your listen through.  Tracks of note: Empty Room, Deep Blue, Sprawl II, Suburban War    Cheers Mates!!
B00066FED6|1.0|I bought this movie years ago and was so excited to start a classic movie library.  I am not usually a harsh critic, but this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.  I threw it in the trash.  Years later, before the Andrew Davies version came out, I had forgotten how bad it was and figured I had overreacted in my judgement.  So, I bought it again.....and threw it in trash again.  Thankfully, a new version came out with Felicity Jones as Catherine and JJ Feild as Henry Tilney.  This version really accomplished what I wanted to see.  Andrew Davies screenplay.  Who could ask for more?  I would suggest they never reissue this version again.  I would then encourage anyone wanting to see this well-written, well acted and totally engrossing story to run out and buy the Andrew Davies version and enjoy!
044661758X|2.0|I am reading all of Connelly's novels in the order they were published. The Concrete Blonde is his third published novel, © 1994. I was very impressed and entertained with Black Echo, his first published novel. Black Ice was okay, but not as interesting as his first. The Concrete Blonde was a huge disappointment. I know this review conflicts with most other reviewers' opinions. Oh well, I've been known to disagree with the majority before.    The courtroom drama just didn't connect with me. Maybe I'm just not the type of mystery fan who enjoys courtroom drama. Lengthy narrative about testimony and all the tricks of the trade that trial lawyers use are things that I can read about in other novels by authors who actually were lawyers. Connelly's narrative seemed the result of notes taken from interviews with lawyers rather than having an intimate understanding of the process and providing a unique point of view. The whole courtroom drama seemed cliché to me, like I had read it all many times before in somebody else's novel.    Because of the whole courtroom thing--a cliche judge and two cliched attorneys--I quickly grew impatient with the story. I fully read Chapters 1 thru 5, then skimmed 6, 7, and 8 and then jumped all the way to Chapter 22. My disappointment was that I didn't miss a beat in the story by not reading over 100 pages. I thoroughly enjoyed the last 90 pages, but even then I found myself skimming a lot of paragraphs. Connelly likes to include a lot of narrative detail about place, setting and non-suspense activities, and for the most part I'm okay with that, but sometimes I think he goes too deep and stalls the momentum of the story.    I'm a murder mystery fan, which means I will continue to read Connelly's novels. I just hope they get better than The Concrete Blonde as he refines his craft.

B000O78KW4|4.0|The first one was spectacular, the second one was a bit more flawed but still entertaining, and the third is just the same as the second but probably a little better. Now, we all know that the first Die Hard can't be outmatched by its sequels. But hey, the sequels are still entertaining (except maybe the last one). Die Hard with a Vengeance, being the third in the series, is a bit better than the last one, and still has plenty of action, adventure, humor, and drama. Not only does it star Bruce Willis as McClane, but Samuel L. Jackson & Jeremy Irons (as the main villain) also appear, so you KNOW it's going to be good. I won't spoil anything in the story (which isn't really original, but who cares?), but I will say that there are plenty of twists. The action isn't first-rate, but it still delivers: it has as much explosions as in the first two).<br /><br />Again, Die Hard with a Vengeance isn't as great as the original, but it's still pretty exciting and spectacular. It's a must-see for all Die Hard fans.<br /><br />Grade: B

B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick-Ass was an awesome movie. It has become one of my favorites movies, it could be a classic. First of all HIT GIRL just stole the movie and if it's true about a sequel, I cant  wait to see where they will take her character and how can they top the original.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|\\"Ghost Rider\\" is an action movie starring Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, a good guy who by mistake sells his soul to the Devil (called Mephistopheles in the movie). With the help of supernatural powers, Blaze morphs into Ghost Rider, the Devil's own bounty hunter. Strangely, he can use the devilish powers for good ends, something that eventually enables him to turn on Mephistopheles himself.<br /><br />The movie is quite weak, as movies based on comics tend to be. The plot is illogical at times. \\"Ghost Rider\\" is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, where Johnny Blaze confronts Blackheart, a fallen angel who has come to create Hell on Earth.<br /><br />Most of \\"Ghost Rider\\" only deserves two stars, but because of the ending, I give it three.<br /><br />A weird fact: when I watched this film on Swedish TV, all cable channels suddenly went off line in my neighbourhood, immediately before the rider's last stand with Blackheart! Creepy. Is Mephisto watching us, or...?

1439153663|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. Was sad to have finished The Help and was delighted to find another similarly wonderful story.  I was also sorry to come to the end of this book. From the very beginning it was hard to put this book down. A wonderful story line with memorable characters, who you really care about. The author did a superb job of telling the story through the two main characters and their experiences of the events. Will be looking forward to reading more from this author. If you like books about the South this book is highly recommended
B000NU2CY4|5.0|As you've probably read from other reviews, there's a new Blu-ray transfer of this film, which originated in Europe (first released in the Netherlands I believe?). By demand, and perhaps under pressure from Universal in Europe, Paramount are slowly putting out the new transfer in the United States.    However, they seem afraid to admit their mistake, and so the whole thing is pretty secretive. So far, there's no new release with \\"remastered\\" or any such phrasing on the cover, nor is there a way to tell which discs have the new transfer save for one little detail (which may not even be 100%, but most people who've brought home these copies are reporting they have the new transfer, as do I):    On the back of the case, NOT on the slipcover, normally there would be the words \\"2-DISC SET\\" above the Paramount logo in the lower right corner. If on the case itself the text isn't there, and it's just a blank space, chances are it's the new transfer. BUT KEEP IN MIND that it doesn't matter if that space is vacant on the slipcover; I made the mistake of bringing home a copy that had no text above the logo on the slipcover, and it was the old, shoddy transfer, and \\"2-DISC SET\\" was above the logo on the actual case itself.    There is another thing to look out for which may not apply all across, but people have been reporting that the new transfers don't have a white title sticker on the top of the case like most releases do. Mine didn't. So if the \\"2-DISC SET\\" text is missing on the case, and there is no title sticker, it should be a definite thing that you're getting the new disc (but no promises).    As for the transfer itself, it's really quite astounding--one of the best, most detailed, most richly filmic Blu-ray transfers I've seen yet. For fans of the film, or even if you're not too keen on the film but are an HD enthusiast and just want to behold the capabilities of the Blu-ray format, I suggest this Blu-ray--the new, \\"remastered\\" one. The old one really is a pile of dung, with loads of digital noise reduction to wipe out the grain and all detail with it, and tons of edge enhancement to try and compensate for the eradicated detail, causing figures to \\"pop out.\\" It's a mess of a video master done for DVD ten years ago; this kind of thing was done on the DVD format so that the film could be \\"most visible\\" on small standard definition TVs. It does not pass in the high definition realm.    Very highly recommended--if you can find the new transfer. Hopefully Paramount will start making it more obvious which copies of the Blu-ray have this new transfer, with a yellow UPC bar or something, or a new release altogether, promoting the new, greatly refined video master.    (Apparently there is an exchange program going on for those with the old disc who wish to have the new, both in the US and the UK. Look up The Digital Bits' daily column to get information on that.)
0316098337|5.0|Locked away in a garden shed since she was 19 years old, \\"Ma\\", now a 26 year old, is freed by Plan B executed by her 5-year-old son, Jack.  We never know Ma's name, but she is the life and breath of our narrator, Jack. Jack was locked in Room his whole life; he has never been to the Outside.<br /><br />His Ma tells him of the Outside during their captivity but she is also an ingenious mother who brings a normalcy to her son in their hovel.  She has taught him about life through crafts, games, exercise with endless repetition which only a prisoner could learn to endure.  Old Nick is the captor, abductor and father of Jack and visits them in the Room.  During these visits, Jack goes into the Wardrobe and has to listen to the number of creaks as Old Nick once again rapes \\"Ma.\\"  This horrific act is never discussed between mother and son.<br /><br />When Jack reaches 5 years old, Ma believes he can become a conceivable ally in their escape to freedom.  Playing dead in Rug, Jack manages to survive through the curiosity of a Good Samaritan dog-walker and an astute policewoman.  This kindness and fast moving police work is the only part of the novel that was hard for me to believe.  Abduction and rape was easier to accept which is I know is a sad commentary.<br /><br />The second half of the book deals with Jack's arrival Outside.  He meets doctors, nurses, his Grandma, the media and other children.  Donoghue's portrayal of Jack's introduction to stairs, distance, sunlight and separation anxiety was quite a challenge but she was able to give us a compelling storyline narrated by a pre-schooler.  Her characterization of Grandma was unusual; on one level, this woman was wise and patient, on another level, she was rather crude and lacked insight.  Thinking that he daughter was dead, her life changed, her husband left and she re-married.  Ma's biological father had a most dishonorable reaction to his daughter and grandson.  Their interactions and Ma's depression made this unnatural tale more realistic.  All movement, fears and progress is provided with Jack's voice.<br /><br />This book reminded me of the 5 year old who was freed from an Austrian dungeon when his mother, Elizabeth, was held captive by her father, who also was the father of her child.  I guess this real story helped me accept this scenario of the strength and creativity of a mother.  I highly recommend this original tour de force.c.

0312370849|4.0|Like many other reviewers, I felt the beginning of this book was wonderful, educational and insightful.  The book took a turn in the middle of the book.  I was wishy washy on the lengths that this woman would go through to find this other family.  I couldn't help but wonder \\"where is Zoe when she's doing all of this?  Zoe at 10 years old is often with babysitters or in another country.  i couldn't help but think, that girl is going to need some therapy later on:)      The beginning grabbed me enough to finish and I read it in 3 days.
0517122707|5.0|\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is far from a perfect book.  In reality, it probably is not a finished product.  John Kennedy Toole perfectly captured the character of the morbidly obese hemorrhoid of man that is fly in the soup of so many people.  Though the story meanders at times, it is a wildly entertaining, fast-paced read.    A virtual vagrant in his mother's house, Ignatius Reilly is sucked into the mire of New Orleans when he is forced to leave the comforts of his own room.  Feasting on snack cakes, the frustrated scholar sees himself as being above the fray.  Ignatius fails to notice that he contributes to the problem as much as anybody.  His misadventures take him into unique situations, creating laughable scenarios.  Still, no part of the book is as hilarious as the vile diatribes against perceived offensive elements of society.    The supporting charcters are often stereotypical and often slow the progress of the story.  This is also the case when Ignatius hurdles into one of his proselytizing letters.  The reader is eager to get back to the misadventure of Ignatius.  Still, it is remarkable how it all ties together in the conclusion.    Many have failed to find the humor in this book because they know an Ignatius J. Reilly-type and empathize with the character in the book.  No humorous attempt will get an consensus response.  I can not imagine disliking this work.

B002JVWR4A|4.0|This is not a review on the dvd as it doesn't come out until Oct.  I got my husband hooked as we watched all Bones dvd series and hated when season 4 ended. i had watched most on tv except some years they kept moving it around and I lost track of when it was on. that said i could watch episodes over and over.  Season 5, I watched all episodes on tv. This is mostly comments on the Booth and Bones relationship. All the episodes before the big break were excellent and satisfying.  David especially has absolutely portrayed  spot on Booth's love for Temperance. (have loved David B. since Angel--he has grown so much as an actor). All these episodes built up to the fact that Booth and Bones were in love. Booth knew it.  It was a relief when Sweets had Booth admit it.  On the other hand, Bones was given subtle hints and you thought she was going to \\"get\\" it.  The episode with Ralph Waite as Booth's grandfather was very touching and enjoyable.  Now after the break, the first episode after was so boring I thought they lost the momentum built up before the break (sorry dont know the name) and the episode telling how they first met---i thought it was bs.  it was done to show booth and bones were attracted to each other at the beginning--- that's not what i remember from season 1.  I personally did not like it-- too exaggerated and extreme -- esp Angela.s character.   But thankfully after that the rest of the episodes were excellent.  Except for one thing-----Tempe should have said more to Booth about her feelings.  I agree with one poster who said this is wearing thin.  You have to get the characters together and use your writing skill to keep the show as good as it is now.  You can't keep going with their friendship knowing that Booth is so in love with Tempe and she is too afraid to have that even though we all know she loves him.  It won't work. I hope season 6 recognizes this.        I too find Daisy annoying--do not know why Sweets and Daisy getting engaged was a big deal.it wasn't.    I too want Zach back.  He was part of that team.  And I'm glad they brought back Ryan O'Neal as Tempe's dad for a few episodes---love that character.

B002ZG983M|4.0|The concept of an average, every day comic book geek donning spandex attire and becoming a super-hero is one that I find quite interesting. I'm sure there are a few crazy people in the world who have contemplated or even attempted just that, but in the comic world, the only character I've been familiar with becoming a super-hero with no particular superpower is Batman. When this was first released and up to the point of me seeing it, I wasn't familiar that this was also made into a comic book, but I was intrigued by the concept and motive behind why the kid in this film wanted to take the leap of faith in becoming a superhero. I gave it a go, and I must say I loved it. Don't expect a full blown comedy, as it's more of a serious action flick, but an enjoyable one nonetheless.<br /><br />Starring Aaron Johnson in the title role of Dave Lizewski, the film tells of how Dave has always wondered why nobody has tried being a superhero (except that one guy at the start of the film who ends up dead). Dave decides to stop wondering and buys himself a green and yellow spandex suit and calls himself Kick-Ass. Life as a super-hero doesn't start very well as he's almost killed in his first attempt at heroics, but he's soon back in action and becomes a viral hit as he's filmed saving a lonely stranger from being beaten up. This gets him some unwanted attention from Mob boss, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and his son Chris/Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Passe) as he's mistaken as being the man behind a number of mob deaths which were actually committed by the mysterious Father/Daughter team of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage [sigh]).<br /><br />The films tone is something that is a lot more serious and brutal than you can possibly guess when first going into it as it starts off quite goofy and funny, but when he puts on his hero suit, the film takes a more serious turn. There are some bad points to the film, but thankfully they are outweighed by a plethora of good points; most importantly the character of Hit-Girl. There are two ways you can look at this character; you can be very disturbed by the fact that an 11 year old girl can call someone a f***er then proceed with blowing an enemies head off, or you can watch that exact scene and think \\"that is \\"f***ing awesome!\\" I chose to go with the latter as she was truly magnificent. Nick Cage, on the other hand, was far from magnificent.<br /><br />I know Cage has a devoted following of fans, but I think he's just awful. I can't take the man seriously in any role he plays, and in my eyes every moment he was on screen was just the pits (unless he was supported by other cast members). I could have easily given this film a 5 star rating had Cage's character been played by someone a lot more fitting for the role. I would've preferred someone along the lines of Michael Keaton or Kevin Costner, an old school actor that you can still appreciate today and not want to place your palm on your forehead in disappointment the moment they appear on screen.<br /><br />The look of the film and style of the film overall is brilliantly done. The fact that the film was released shortly before the comic and it was a project that came together collaboratively with Mark Miller working on the comic and Matthew Vaughn working on the movie, when I check the comic out, there will definitely be cool similarities.

0545123283|4.0|Linger is book 2 in a series by Maggie Stiefvater, book 1 is Shiver.  Do not read this review unless you have already read Shiver as there will be spoilers in here for that book.<br /><br />Linger is the continuing story of Sam and Grace.  In the end of Shiver we see that Sam has turned back into a human and returned to Grace because of the 'cure' that they thought up of infecting Sam with bacterial meningitis to give him a high fever and \\"kill the wolf\\" within him.  Now, Sam is back working full time at the book store, Grace is in school and still friends with Rachel but is closer to Isabel after all they have been through.  Olivia is still lost to the woods as a wolf and presumed to have run away.  New to the story are the newly infected wolves that Beck brought into the picture.  Grace's parents have decided to become parents finally, but it may be too little too late for this family.  Sam has now taken over Beck's role in his family and has to keep track of the pack and whoever may shift back to human form.  He doesn't really want this responsibility but this is what he must do, especially with new shifters running loose like Cole St. Clair.  People that are unpredictable and have nothing to lose are hard to control and teach rules to.  Sam and Grace have their work cut out for them in this second installment that is filled with romance, suspense and plenty of new drama.<br /><br />Ok, so one of my biggest concerns with Shiver was the lack of parental guidance and intervention in Grace's life.  Circumstances come around that cause Mr and Mrs Brisbane to go into parental overkill in Linger and that turns out to be even more disasterous than no parents at all.  Their change in parenting was sudden and extreme and although it fit the actions of the story it still irritated me that they would decide now, at 17 1/2 years old, that they would become parents to Grace.<br /><br />Isabel is a much bigger part of the story this time which I really enjoyed.  I like her attitude and I loved getting a little deeper into her mind.  Cole is a very interesting addition, he added a lot of spunk to this book and so much personality too.<br /><br />This book was very well written and Stiefvater did a wonderful job of introducing new characters into an already known storyline and having them meld right in like they always belonged there.  It's hard to imagine Cole not being a part of the story now.  This story goes a different direction than Shiver did.  Shiver was so immersed in the love story between Sam and Grace and the desperation to keep Sam human.  Linger continues the love between the two of them but builds on other areas and adds more points of view.  Rather than back and forth between Sam and Grace, we are entertained by the minds of Isabel and Cole as well.  I found myself flipping back every now and then to remember which character's mind I was reading through although it flowed well and didn't happen often.  It actually really worked for me and I enjoyed the change of view in mid conversation to see first person from several views in one setting.  Sounds complicated to read, but it really wasn't.  Once again, just like Shiver, I'd rate this 3.5 stars for a regular read... 4 if you're a YA fan.ing a little deeper into her mind.

0307346617|5.0|Very good read.  There could have been a few details that were described better, such as what exactly the 'lobo' looks like....but other then that, you really get the feeling that it's been a decade since the zombie war.  Rather then delve deeply into a few particular stories, Max gives every aspect of the Z war a medium depth overview.  Enough for you to understand and relate to each aspect:  the front line soldiers, the doctors, dog handlers, homefront, the aftermath, the clean-up operations.....You get a taste of every aspect of the Z war.    This is a worthy addition to anyone's zombie collection.
0786715103|5.0|While researching for a project about the UN Security Council and the Rwandan Genocide, I found myself at my local library in search of information about genocides in general.  The librarian directed me to this book, as well as other generic genocide information books.  After reading the brief synopsis on the back, I immediately checked out the book and took it home and began to read.  I read the book, and, in short, this is one of the best reads I've ever had in my life (hence why I purchased it).  General Dallaire takes his feelings and the scene around him and puts it into a written form that is nearly indescribeable in its description of the days leading up to the genocide and the weeks of the genocide.  While this book does have its moments where it is difficult to continue reading while withholding the urge to cry, this is something I hope everyone would read in their lifetimes, to prevent something as horrific as the Rwandan Genocide from ever happening again!  If you're looking for a read that will absolutely blow your mind and make you question humanity to the fullest extent, I urge you to buy this book and prepare yourself for an experience that will make you feel anger, anguish, sadness, and everything in between.
B002VECMAE|3.0|\\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" just didn't do it for me. I had extremely high expectations for a film with such a wonderful cast, and although the acting was top-notch, the movie as a whole was not. There are definitely some funny moments here, but the story just isn't up to par. As much as I adore George Clooney with every fiber of my being, this is one Clooney DVD that I will not be purchasing.

There are many descriptors one can apply to Lee and the Expressions:  soul, funk, blues, jazz.  It's all in there. He's got a very soulful voice and the band is tight.  Don't pass it up.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Really wanted to find this movie and it wasn't in any stores that we went to. Was excited to find it at such an affordable price and the quality and processing time were excellent. The movie arrived fairly quickly and we watched it that day and the quality was perfect. It was great to get a reasonably priced DVD that was also in perfect condition.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Not only it give the events of what happen doing World War II, it gives the who's, what's and why's.  It give both sides of the story and some very interesting feed back that you would not find anywhere else.  A must have if you are into World War II history.
B000FC10MU|3.0|Ancient gods that have long been abandoned and forgotten by their followers are living everyday lives in America. The new gods of technology have risen to power. A battle is coming unbeknownst to the masses, and an ex-con named Shadow finds himself in a world he didn't know existed.<br /><br />American Gods is an original idea backed up with excellent storytelling from the author. The main story branches off into several different directions without losing its focus. The only problem - the ending.<br /><br />Despite the strong narrative in the first two-thirds of the book, the ending is less interesting than the original premise. American Gods is still recommended as a good read.
0345457692|4.0|Wow.  Somehow I managed to miss the insanely talented Richard K. Morgan for all these years.  I finally decided to give his novels a try after he joined my discussion group.  His posts and opinions were frank and harsh, generally commonsensical and, amazingly, just about about as negative and dark and cynical as my own.  Or to quote the author:  \\"Society is, always has been and always will be a structure for the exploitation and oppression of the majority through systems of political force dictated by an élite, enforced by thugs, uniformed or not, and upheld by a willful ignorance and stupidity on the part of the very majority whom the system oppresses.\\"   The main reason I never tried his works before is some very negative feedback from my group's members when we read and discussed his first novel \\"Altered Carbon\\".  The negative feedback was mainly because of the fact that the novel contains lots of harsh violence and, to a lesser degree, some explicit sex scenes.  Yep, well, that's all true.  The novel is dark, gritty, violent, harsh, dark, negative, dystopian, cynical, did I mention dark?  It's also utterly excellent.  It's got the same noir sensibility as William Gibson's first novels, but it's more extreme.   In the future, it has become possible to store personalities digitally and download them into new bodies.  As a result, very rich people can practically live forever, \\"resleeving\\" into new bodies as needed.  In the absence of faster-than-light travel, it's now also possible to have your personality transmitted to another world to find life in another body.  Because the cost is prohibitive for most, this privilege is reserved for the rich and powerful.  The novel's fascinating protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, is a former UN Envoy (combination of Navy Seal and uber-spy), who is revived from imprisonment to try and solve the murder of Laurens Bancroft, one of the very rich and powerful on Earth.  The resulting story, technically a very complicated whodunnit, isone of the tightest and most exciting SF novels I've read in a while.  Morgan's writing style is an interesting blend of traditional noir and ultra-realistic action movie.  His descriptions of violence are somehow both semi-detached and painfully intense, resulting in a strange, harsh clarity that really drives the power of the events home.  The world-building is subtle, resulting in some pleasant disorientation at first (similar to being resleeved?), but also hinting at big chunks of history that can still be revealed in later novels.  There are two more novels featuring Takeshi Kovacs, both of which are already on my TBR pile.  \\"Altered Carbon\\" gets 4 stars and a strong recommendation for anyone who enjoyed early William Gibson and dark, dystopian SF in general.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|I thought the movie was OK. But it was no Harry Potter. My 9 year old grandson loved it and wanted to borrow it to take it home and watch it over and over. He thought it was great and maybe that the only review that matters.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|After Relapse came out, I was so excited, and was really liking it so I came on here and gave it 5 stars. That was not a 5 star CD. So with Recovery, I listened to it for a solid 6 weeks and let it all sink in, and now I know, this is MUCH better than Relapse. Thank god. I was really doubting that Em would ever put out anything good again. Encore was awful from the start, Relapse was better, but still pretty lame. Recovery is what we've all been waiting for. No more stupid voices, no skits, no more stuff about mom, just Em talking about his life, and all his struggles. Coming out of drug addictions, dealing with Proof's death, its all in there. There's some more typical stuff in there too. He makes a couple choice celebrity-jabs like he's know for (the line with Ben Roethlisberger, lol), WTP sounds like something that could have been on Relapse. But the really great songs shine through! Most Eminem fans should really like this one. I did. It would have been worthy of following up \\"The Eminem Show\\"

B003O85W3A|5.0|I love albums that draw you in....you listen through once, a few songs hit you.  You find yourself playing them in your head all day long.  You listen again, different songs start to come to life.  Soon, it becomes a go-to listen in the car, at home, during a walk on the iPod.  There are different things to find, but there is depth, complexity, and always more to discover.    Well, this appears to be such a piece of music.  When the first two teaser songs appeared on some websites - The Suburbs and Month of May - because they were out of context, it was hard to make sense of what was about to be released.  But that first song actually sets up a remarkable experience - in a way, I consider this to be one 60 minute song with different episodes and moods and tempos, but an overall meaning.      Rather than repeat some of the excellent reviews already posted - the song-by-song analyses, and the very insightful review that equates the different songs to different periods in recent rock music history (a brilliant analysis), I will just say that this is the best 3.99 I've spent in a long, long time.  All of the songs have merit, and some are positively infectious.  It is clear that great care was put into the instrumentation - nothing is out of place, and just near everything works.  Some of the songs are easy to connect to immediately - Ready to Start, Empty Room, Suburban War, and Sprawl II are near perfect and amongst the best works Arcade Fire have created.  But even what appears at first listen to be a bit of a throwaway song like Month of May fits perfectly in the track order, and builds and adds touches throughout.      This music from Arcade Fire is a gift to us all - to all of us who have the patience to listen, wait, then be amazed.  And to a fifty something like me, there are so many touches of nostalgia in different genres of rock I experienced that this music brings great joy and meaning to me.  Bravo!      .....So, now I've spent over a month with this CD.  Initially I gave it five stars and thought that it would age very well.  My current feeling is that this is a remarkable album, even better than I realized, and it only grows in its profoundness with time.  The songs I initially loved are now joined by those that took a bit more time - and listening to this entire album in one sitting is an amazing experience.  It has joined albums like REM's Automatic for the People and Radiohead's OK Computer in music that will always be welcome to my ears, no matter how familiar the notes.    One more thing - there are a few YouTube channels that are dedicated to live Arcade Fire performances....I just hope I can see them in concert some day!    one more edit - because we did see them....small venue in Charlottesville, VA, before their Bonaroo show.  So a few things - The Suburbs hasn't faded with time.  There is still more to discover, even after countless listenings.  What emerges now is nostalgia and wistfulness - this music reaches in and deeply grabs you.  And about the live show - the energy they create is just unbelievable...on a sweltering summer night, they had a few thousand people on their feet and moving and dancing for nearly two hours.  It was an experience my wife and I will never forget.
0783231202|1.0|I received Amistad last year (2009) and put it in recently (7/2010) to watch it.  My husband and I were VERY DISAPPOINTED to find that the movie would freeze at a specific point in the movie.  We tried it in another DVD player we have and the same thing happened.    Unfortunately, it's past the returns limit, so we're stuck with it.

Amazon, como me conoce tan bien, me ofreci&oacute; \\"Switch\\" de los hermanos Heath en un trato muy seductor como para negarme.<br /><br />Cuento corto, le&iacute; primero \\"Switch\\" y les vengo a contar de que trata.<br /><br />\\"Switch\\" parte de la premisa que siempre es dif&iacute;cil cambiar si no tenemos las condiciones necesarias para propiciar aquel cambio. No s&oacute;lo en nuestras vidas, sino dentro de nuestra comunidad o en nuestro trabajo. El conflicto principal -de acuerdo a los Heath - radica en un conflicto que se genera en nuestros cerebros: Ah&iacute; hay dos lados, el racional (elefante) y el anal&iacute;tico (el jinete). Cada uno se encarga de distintas funciones y potencia (o restringe) cambios en nuestra vida.<br /><br />El m&eacute;rito del libro, radica en explicar como personas comunes y corrientes pueden aplicar principios muy sencillos para gatillar cambios profundos.<br /><br />Duplica los puntos altos: En los procesos, siempre pasa algo bueno. Identif&iacute;calo y haz que vuelva a suceder. Clona los puntos altos.<br />Crea una postal del futuro: Establece una meta clara, y haz lo que tengas que hacer para llegar ah&iacute;.<br />Fragmenta el problema: No lo abordes todo desde un principio.

De un momento a otro, debieses poder lidiar con ellos de manera natural.<br />Viraliza el cambio: Las costumbres se aprenden y se imitan de acuerdo a lo que sucede dentro de la tribu; por lo tanto, t&uacute; puedes generar el cambio.<br /><br />Insisto, lo mejor del libro es como aborda procesos bastante sencillos y l&oacute;gicos pero en los cuales no pensamos nunca. Por ejemplo, yo siempre he sido partidario de \\"quebrar\\" los problemas grandes en varios menores. As&iacute; empiezo a moverme y tengo la sensaci&oacute;n de avance.

B002VPE1Z2|1.0|This item was ridiculously large for the suggested camera (a Panasonic Lumix FH-20) and also looked cheaply made. I had to return it.
B002JVWRAY|4.0|This was the lead up to the big showdown with Lucifer. It was a breath-taking ride, and I would have given it five stars but for the final ep itself. Can't really talk about what I didn't like too much without spoilers, but I'll go for vague ones and say I found Dean's storyline wrap up awkward and the choice of destination lackluster given previous encounters with other 'victims-of-the-week' which had far more chemistry. Yes, he was tired and beaten down, but turning his 'dream' into a less whine-ridden version of Sam's didn't fit the character at all.    Also, I was less than thrilled that the end of the Righteous Man prophecy boiled down to it all being about Sam again.    The season itself was solid entertainment -- especially the addition of the wonderful Crowley to the semi-regular mix. Hopefully, he'll return. OTHO, some older semi-regulars were lost, much to my regret. And I'm hoping at least a few of them will be resurrected and return.    No, two ways about it, if you're a fan of the show, this is a must have. If you aren't, it is perhaps too grim of a season to change your mind.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|Where Do I Begin? Yes, Like \\"love story\\" I love love love \\"Ugly Betty\\"! Now I am not to taken by many tv shows, most I find annoying or Silly or dreadful....When a freind suggested I watch \\"Ugly\\" 4 years ago I thought \\"sure\\"..ok.....I did Like Vanessa Williams but hardly thought that be enough to make me enjoy the show.  Well, I was wrong....  I had the show on in the background (as most of my Tv watching) and by 15 mintues I was dead center in front of the Tv and was laughing and crying and Loving every single of this show. That Love Affair would go on to the end, and While I could pin point a few \\"flaws\\" in some plots I never lost my love for \\"Betty\\". I am still bitter that ABC moved it around and alas the show ended sooner than it Should Have.  Anyway here in all it's glory is Season 4, maybe the best season since the first. While I am said the only show I really loved won't be back in the fall, I am very happy that I had 4 wonderful years.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I have to admit that my initial reaction to this album was disappointment. As one of my all-time favorite bands, I wasn't expecting it to live up to \\"Funeral,\\" but I also wasn't expecting the jaunty parlor piano on the opening tracks or some of the other strange departures from \\"classic\\" Arcade Fire on this album. By the time I got through the first 6 tracks, the only one that immediately stood out was \\"Rococo,\\" easily the closest song on the album to their earlier records.<br /><br />After listening to the whole album, it became obvious that the last half is the stronger. \\"We Used to Wait,\\" \\"Sprawl I,\\" and \\"Sprawl II\\" are an incredible close to the album. I started listening to this last half of the album exclusively... and when I returned to the first half of the album, it all suddenly sounded amazingly good and authentically Arcade Fire.<br /><br />I think the important thing here is that you have to get used to the sound of this album (especially if you're coming in to it as a huge fan of their earlier work), and when you do, it all falls in to place and the genius of it all reveals itself.<br /><br />If you're not loving it yet, keep listening to it, especially the second half. But don't give up on this album, because it doesn't sound just like \\"Funeral.\\" I don't think there will ever be another \\"Funeral,\\" by this band or any other.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is just another evolutionary stage of what will be the best indie rock band of the last decade and the one to come. When you consider their three records all together, they have probably done themselves a favor by not trying to recreate anything they have previously done and instead have created a beautiful collection of growingly diverse and brilliant styles.
6305736650|5.0|It is the early years of World War II.  Casablanca, in what was then French Morocco, is crowded with refugees.  Some have legitimate papers, and others do not.  Transit visas that allow departure on the night plane to Lisbon, Portugal, are highly prized and sell at a high price on the black market.  Rick's is a meeting place where people may conduct a little illicit business.<br /><br />There is an old expression, \\"if you love someone, you let them go.\\"  Rick is faces that problem when the real love of his life is committed to another person.<br /><br />The motion picture has a boatload of stars from that era.  Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre play a couple of heavies, and had similar roles in other films with Humphrey Bogart who has the lead role as Rick.  Ingrid Bergman is the leading lady.  If you are a fan of films from that era, you will recognize other cast members.  The film remains a classic.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Being a great fan of fantasy movies / books , I started watching episodes of Legend of Seeker on Netflix and could not stop writing a review of it on amazon. The most flawless fantasy film which has a strong story line with a awesome quality of animation. All in HD , yes. it is truely a wonderful creation in which Richard Cypher being the leading character undergoes a quest to save the world with a wizard and 2 beatiful, powerful females. All the chosen actors suits the characters they play . It has very entertaining experience in all of the its moments.<br /><br />Few things which attract me are the the HD video with highest quality animation inside with which is supported by actors like Tabrett Bethel and Bridget Regan. I would compare this with Lord of the Rings and would rate both equally. If you really like fantasy this is a must watch.. Enjoy...
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Still it's a riveting thriller. And the acting is almost believable .. how many times can you say that about a recent movie?    You can read about the plot and its holes in other reviews.    Addendum: My BIG question about the movie is:  If you hire a Ghost-writer who finds out about your sordid past and has to be bumped-off, why bother hiring a 2nd writer, who also discovers the same .. why not just drop the memoirs?
B000IOM0X8|4.0|This movie is a feel good, save the world movie with an archeology twist.  I think that Matthew McConaughey steals the spotlight in this movie as he tries to in every movie.   But, for me Rainn Wilson is always a big draw.  With the office turning me on to his career, he seems to bright a funny yet serious role in all his films.  Of course Penelope Cruz and the rest of the cast are great with amazing chemistry.    The sound and video quality is better on blu-ray as always.  This makes it a good buy for me at the low cost I got it for.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|If you don't see the ending coming, then it's a nice twist. If you do, then I can see that this would be drawn-out.    I didn't. Did think that the explanation of the elaborate ploy was a little unbelieveable, especially since the patient is supposed to be extremely violent.    Some of the flashbacks were overdone and could have shortened (perhaps less graphic).    Still, great acting, settings, cinematography (like the way it looked like it was shot in the 50s) and a nice storyline, if you don't try to work out the end in advance.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|...instead, remind yourself that Sylvester Stallone is largely responsible for creating at least two of the best-known characters in the history of U.S. and world cinema:  Rambo and Rocky.  These characters are probably as well-known throughout the world as any U.S. President, Chairman Mao, or Jesus Christ.  Name someone else with a comparable accomplishment.  That could take a moment, so take a moment and have another look at Rambo.    When I go back and look at this film, I have to admit, Stallone's forays into verbal expression aside, I really like this movie.  Relatively low budget, fairly realistic action, and with the usual solid performances from Crenna and Dennehy, who play a Special Forces Colonel and a small-town Sheriff, respectively.  But the real winner is the script, which had the audacity to express the thoughts and feelings of the much maligned and disregarded Vietnam veteran.  This film is not really an action flick, or a movie about a loner.  Stallone portrays a veteran just back from the war, who, while passing through a small town, just wants to mind his own business but is hassled by the local sheriff (Dennehy).  After being arrested and treated with disdain, Rambo responds with finely tuned violence.  From his perspective, he is doing no more than demanding his rights and just due.    Like a lot of veterans at the time, he has difficulty reconciling the sacrifices he and his fellow servicemen made in Vietnam on behalf of what seems to be an ungrateful nation (in my mind, this film is also in sympathy with the even more neglected Korean War veterans).  It seems that Stallone was expressing, however crudely, the rarely spoken sentiments of many at the time.  It also seems to me that the story is not a new one, but one that has and will play out time and again all over the world.  But the fact remains that Stallone's version is quite memorable...name recognition alone speaks to the impact of the film.    So I urge you to have another look at how the movie was made, and put the plot and whatever message you derive from it into historical perspective...I daresay that an honest look will make it more difficult to condescend to Mr. Stallone, let alone veterans of Vietnam, Korea, and, alas, the GWOT.  Peace out.
B00005JKTF|4.0|2001's \\"Charlotte Gray\\" stars Cate Blanchett as Charlotte, a young Scotswoman whose RAF boyfriend goes missing in action over France during the Second World War.  The stricken but suddenly steely Charlotte volunteers for duty with the British Specials Operations Executive, and is soon parachuted into France for dangerous work with the French Resistance.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is quite solid as Charlotte and as Dominique, her undercover Resistance personna.  Rupert Penry-Jones is Peter, her wartime romance who goes missing.  Billy Crudup is complex and emotional as Julien, Charlotte's Resistance point of contact.  The location shooting in Scotland, England, and especially France, is authentic and atmospheric.<br /><br />\\"Charlotte Gray\\" is entertaining but the plot is a rather confusing mix of unconventional romance and a gritty story of betrayal.  Charlotte's original mission of rescuing her boyfriend gets lost in a morally gray struggle between the Resistance, the Germans, and French collaborators, setting up a not entirely satisfying ending.<br /><br />\\"Charlotte Gray\\" is highly recommended to fans of Cate Blanchett.
B00005JNEW|4.0|...this film brought back memories of my high school experience and reminded me once again that God ranks a sad second to Football in Texas.  The film is based on a season in the life of the Odessa Permian Panthers, a powerhouse team that has appeared with frequency in the Texas State Championship over the last 50 years.  A little bit of research revealed that the film is not historically accurate, but that is not the point of the film.  This film is about the about the pressure to win put on the high school players by the citizens of Odessa, including friends and family.<br /><br />The most visible role is played by Billy Bob Thornton, who plays the recently arrived head coach, Gary Gaines, but the other actors play their parts well, too.  For me, the film accurately portrays life in Texas high schools with a mixture of Anglo (read \\"White\\"), Black, and Hispanics, all living side-by-side, taking a boy's game with the seriousness of adults.  Some of it was over the top, but hey, it's a movie.  The memories it evoked had special significance for me and I believe many people will identify in some way with the coming-of-age story.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|If you read my review on Relapse then you know that I wasn't feeling Eminem the last few years, but Recovery is a great turn around and come back from Relapse and Encore. Relapse to me being the worse album of his career and grabage. Eminem even talks about this saying that Relapse is in the trash can, but anyhow moving on. With guest spots from Kobe, P!nk, Lil Wayne and Rihanna that adds to the album. It seem kinda odd to me that 50 didn't have an appearance? Not that I care! He finally talks about the death of Proof which we were all expecting on Relapse. Now you probably asking why I only gave the album four stars instead of five. Is because even through Recovery is a great comeback from his last couple of albums. It doesn't surpass The Marshall Mathers and Slim Shady LP. Not that I'm expecting it too. That's probably another problem we expect Em to be this great lyrical monster that he was when he first drop ten years ago, and that isn't really fair. But lets face facts that's Hip-Hop. Very few artists never surpass their first album. Again let me qoute \\"very few\\". Anyhow if you was waiting for a Marshall comeback this is probably the album for you.
B003JYOFIW|4.0|LIVE too!  Just saw them at Ohio State Fair and they had the tween girls whipped up to a frenzy!  (LOVED the frowning faces on the Troopers... just classic stuff!)    Anyway this album's balance of beat drive, syntho-whirlwind and Jihad Jerry's string-stretching gives me a feeling much like _Freedom of Choice_... a good thing.  Really good thing!    I'd honestly call it a little spotty compared to that piece of absolute pop perfection, but it DOES have some unbelievable gems that (if you like ANYTHING by Devo) you just gotta hear.  I know of Nobody else pushing 60 that could craft up a**-kicking concoctions like \\"Something For Everybody\\", \\"Step Up\\", and \\"Don't Shoot- I'm a Man.\\"  Many reviewers here are commenting about how they want to listen repeatedly... and that's the mark of ANY undeniably catchy song.  And there are good half-dozen of them sprinkled around on this disc!    a more-than-worthy addition to the Legend of De-volution...  Awesome ride tunes too!  -Ole Troll
B001MW0J2O|3.0|At times, Merriweather Post Pavilion is a joy (the oft-mentioned 'My Girls'), but it is pretty much a plodding affair that hasn't got much to say musically. I bought this when it first came out and, surprisingly, has aged quite badly despite its stately production values. Whereas the robust Strawberry Jam still excites, MPP is simply a case of critics getting too far ahead of themselves.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I have many microphones under $30 for my karaoke setup using a Behringer 802 8-input mixer. There was distortion when I hooked up with a second microphone. I purchased this microphone and a XLR male to XLR female cable and it solved the problem. The sound was best among all microphones I have and no distortion. The only minus is that this microphone does not have an on/off button but not a big deal.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|One of the stops in Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour was at Buenos Aires, Argentina. This DVD features the show held there as well as a short documentary on the tour.<br /><br />The way the concert was edited for this DVD is interesting. A lot of \\"tricks\\" were used to make the visuals much more exciting... like imposing the background screen images over what was going on on stage, also using effects like slow-mo at just the right moments. Had we had one still camera looking at Madonna things wouldn't have seemed as fun. Still though, the editing is welcome for entertainment purposes.<br /><br />Also considering Madonna is not exactly known to have the best live voice ever, it's rather suspicious that all along the concert she maintains a perfect pitch. The cool kids call it \\"re-mastering\\" nowadays. Oh well.<br /><br />But hey, that put aside, this is just a fun concert to watch. The 2 hour show focuses mostly on the songs from Hard Candy, Madonna's R&B influenced album met with mixed reviews. See the Queen of Pop shake her white bootay to Candy Shop, The Beat Goes On, 4 Minutes, Give it 2 Me, Spanish Lesson and more with a crew of phenomenal dancers, lighting effects, and a bunch of energy consuming stuff going on. Also many of Madonna's big hits from all times took a new spin here which was a nice surprise. Songs like Music, Hung Up, Ray of Light, Borderline, Into the Groove, Like a Prayer and Vogue all were here and took some sort of welcome new spin to them.<br /><br />Madonna seemed to enjoy herself a lot during the show, and at her 50s she is still jumping around like a schoolgirl which says quiet a bit about her physical condition. It's a joy to see this woman on stage and while some would regard that her previous tour was better, which I can't deny, this show is just too fun to dismiss.<br /><br />This pack also includes a CD which has some tracks from the concert. The selection for the CD is rather weird. They omitted many good tracks. But I guess it's a nice bonus.
B001NLKT60|4.0|If you're a teenager, this review is for you.<br /><br />You should read my review about The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo first because much of the stuff i said applies in this second installment. I really like the story line but it was kind of confusing because I'm only fourteen and I dont know a whole lot about the Swedish government and if I did maybe it would help me understand more. Never the less, I found that I still understood the end of the story even without that knowledge so I wouldnt fret about it. I would leave this book to the 15+ year olds just for violence and sexual content also.It was suspensful and I am currently in the process of reading the third book.<br /><br />I liked the first book better than this one and I've found that I reallly like the third one too but I would not advise you to skip the second one because the third one is alllll about the second one (if that makes ANY sense at all). Look for my review of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest coming soon.
B00004TA41|5.0|As if on the trail of unraveling the truth behind the short-lived Atenist revolution of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, the set of duets by John Coltrane (tenor sax/bells) and drummer Rashied Ali boldly challenge the listener to cast aside convention for a very special and spiritual journey.<br /><br />Recorded in February 1967 at the Van Gelder Recording Studio, the original four album tracks - Mars (10:41), Venus (8:28), Jupiter (5:22), Saturn (11:33) - are bolstered by a pair of bonus tracks that previously appeared on the anthology \\"Jupiter Variation\\" - Leo (10:53), Jupiter Variation (6:44) - and rehearsal fragments. Mars is incredibly powerful, though each track seems to announce that Coltrane - within the studio - has found a perfect venue to fully express himself at this point in his artistic maturation. That \\"Trane\\" passed away five months later at the age of 40 makes his vision incomplete, but clearly shows that a creative fire was building in this unique lineup which would have been unleashed on audiences at some point in the near future.<br /><br />Set the controls for the heart of the sun, indeed.

1595141715|1.0|I had high hopes for this novel. The title and premise intrigued me, and I began it excited for an honest look at suicide. By the end, I was angry, sad, and upset--but not because of the tribulations of the main character. I was outraged at her behavior and the motives given for her suicide.    Spoiler alert, I suppose: the reason she kills herself? It's because someone started a rumor about her, and it was just too much for her to take. So she kills herself. The end? Nope. She then turns around and records, well, a novel, and sends it to the thirteen (fourteen?) people she deems responsible for her death.    This novel is utterly reprehensible. So someone started some rumors about her. Boo-hoo. It was completely possible for her to get over the rumors made about her. It's called making friends, and then telling them how full of crap that guy was. Girls would believe that he was making it up. It's pretty widely known that high-school boys lie about their sexual escapades. But no, instead she throws herself a pity party and feels oh-so-sad about it.    I mean, seriously? Someone making up rumors about you is NOT a good reason to kill yourself. It wasn't the end of the world. She just decided to act like it was.    You want to hear a story? Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Starting when she was 6, that little girl's stepmother would beat her with a belt until she was bleeding. This happened almost every day for 11 years. One day, the girl called the cops, because she was scared that her stepmother was very near to killing her. The cops showed up at her house 30 minutes after she called them, and then said that she was a terrible, horrible person. She should be ashamed of herself for lying, they said. That night was the closest she had ever come to killing herself. But she didn't. And then when she was 18 she read a book called \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" and was so disgusted by it that she wrote a review of it. The end.    This book is NOT about suicide. It's about a whiny little brat who wants attention. She cuts her hair, records a novel to send to people, reveals the fact that a girl was raped in a room she was in while she did nothing to fourteen people, and kills herself--all to get attention. Recording a novel to the people you deem responsible for making you commit suicide is simply awful. Not only was she getting even more attention for herself, she was also sending people on guilt-trips that they probably didn't deserve. Not to mention that she is all like, \\"Hey, by the way, this girl was raped and I will tell all of you instead of telling just her. Please pay attention to me.\\" She's just...utterly pathetic.    People making up rumors about you does not mean that you should go and kill yourself. I survived 11 years of physical, verbal, and sexual abuse and I'm still kicking. This book makes a complete mockery of people with real problems and struggles who have attempted or committed suicide.
B000002KOO|5.0|For anyone really interested in true classic underground rock and roll, look no further than the late 60's/early 70's Fleetwood Mac, of course this is pre Nicks/Buckingham era stuff. The original band with Peter Green, Danny Kirwin and Jeremy Spencer were one one of the greatest bands of all time, cranking out a mini catalogue of albums that ranged from classic to plain great. The bands debut in '67 established them as the new up and coming band in England with Black Magic Woman, and Mr Perfect and English Rose continued the barn burning blues format. Of course like any great band they kept furthering the formula, expanding upon and thus, perfecting it, which leaves us with Then Play On. Peter Green was a genius at this time, rock of the era knows few better bands than what he was doing with Mac at this time.    The Cuban style Coming Your Way, and the moody Closing My Eyes are already signs of the bands appetite to ingest new blood into their sound. The beautiful instrumental My Dream takes the surf music style, slows it down and really makes it what its title suggests. Underway is another great atmospheric, more slightly jazzier piece of blues/rock.  Although The Sun Is Shining shows the more melodic approach that might predate the Rumors era stuff. Of course by the middle of the album, it transforms into one of those early 70's free for all rock n roll jams with the slightly progressive Searching For Madge/Fighthing For Madge. Though the band hasn't totally given up on blues, check out Show-Biz Blues, showing Green's inner feelings towards success. The band kicks it into high gear with the dirty blues romp Rattlesnake Shake, truely a highlight for stomping boogie enthusiasts. the whole record contains a magic feel about it, firmly putting it in place with 'of the time' classics like The Move's Shazam, Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, Mahavishnu Orchestra's Inner Mounting Flame, and John Mayall/Jeff Beck records.     The most amazing thing about Then Play On, must besaved for last, it gets it's on section and that would be the magnum opus Oh Well, there might be a few average radio/hard rock/classic rock fans who will slightly recognize the opening riff because its been covered by Tom Petty, Jimmy Page and probably a few others but for most it will be unfamilar. The song itself was Green's masterpiece composition, you wont hear anything like it. Starting out with one of the most vicious guitar riffs and silent/spoke-sing lyric breakdowns it purges into a full blown rocker that most metal and punk bands could never hope to reach the velocity of. But its just a shortlived run through as the small lyric break comes in again and once again the band takes another short burst of energy. Shakers and a slight touch of percussion touch it up and really transform it into a helluva mighty piece of rock n roll. The song then takes shape into something entirely different and becomes one of the most majestic pieces of music you'll ever hear. An multi layered acoustic instrumental piece with some slight orchestral backings, its hard to get across in words. The whistle/croon will send chills. The piece might remind some of Ennio Morricone's music in The Good The Bad The Ugly, whatever it was inspired from stands as one of the most awe inspired pieces of music ever recorded. Taking the album to a new height of genius.     Because the most avaliable issue of the album has almost no remastering job, you may wanna seek out a different version of it but which ever you get, no rock collection is complete without Then Play On.
0553573411|4.0|Hobb's \\"Royal Assassin\\" is significantly better than the first book in the trilogy.  Hobb spends much of \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\" setting the scene and developing the major characters. It moves much too slowly in my opinion, with very few plot developments. I wasn't planning on picking up the second Farseer book, but my library had little else to offer, so I took it up.  I'm glad I did, because in \\"Royal Assassin,\\" things move along at brisker pace. (Although Hobb's work can never be described as \\"action packed.\\" Sword fights, battles, and yes, even assassinations, are just not her M.O.).      The strength of The Farseer Trilogy is its well-developed characters.  Hobb is very good at getting the reader emotionally attached to the characters.  You'll love the good guys and hate the bad guys with equal conviction.  Although the characters are pretty much strictly good or evil, they are complex in other ways.  The depth to which she develops the good guys creates and attachment to the characters which will keep you reading on the edge of your seat.      Other reviewers have called these books \\"gut wrenching.\\" I can't think of a better term.  You'll care so much for the fate of Fitz, Burrich, Kettricken, Molly, Verity, etc, that a knot will form in your gut when they're put through their many arduous trials.  And let me tell you, without giving too much away, things seem pretty bleak for the good guys. As some other readers note, reading this book can be depressing and put you in a melancholy mood.  I'm thinking (and desperately hoping) that Hobb is showing despair and sadness so that you can be more uplifted when the good guys get some breaks. Regardless of the conclusion, this makes for suspenseful reading and you won't want to put this book down.
B002ZG9846|4.0|I read alot of reviews about this film, why some loved it and some hated it. Just do not take all the violence and language by the young actors especially the young actor who plays \\"Hit Girl\\" to seriously. The action is top notch but most of it involves a young man getting almost beaten to death and a very young girl beating everybody to death. To get to the point if you enjoyed the Kill Bill films you will probably enjoy the action in Kick Ass even with the younger actors.

B003XU02QG|5.0|I enjoyed the story, as well as the characters on both sides.  The violence was graphic, but at a level that was appropriate for the story.  Over all, a solid film that captured and held my attention from start to finish.    I'll be watching it again tomorrow, thanks to the 48 hr. rental :)

6305736650|4.0|This movie is about World War 2 and how people were trying to get to the Americas by way of Lisbon thru Casablanca, the free French territory. This is a place where everybody tends to gather and has the atmosphere of excitement and familiarity. Rick owns this cafe with its separate gaming quarters. Humphrey plays this character, he owns his space with wit and flat affect, which seems common in his acting. He has been duped in love and is reserved and withholds emotion towards people in general. He finds out that a man who is quite respected in speaking out against the Nazis is coming to his establishment. What surprises him is who this man brings with him. It is the old flame who he loved and crumbled his defenses with her elegance and style. This is played by Bergman, Ilsa. She is married to the famous speaker and writer and Rick is taken aback. They are trying to escape to America. The things I liked about this film are the plush feel to the Cafe and the black and white eloquence of how it was filmed. The bazaar and exciting culture glimpsed with the set of Morroco. The dialog which is known by many, Heres Looking at you Kid and Play it again Sam. The words and how they are said. Bergman reminds me of Nicole Kidman. She is so feminine and respectable to me. I like the way she talks and how she comes across on film. The ending is different than the norm and you wonder if Ilsa was acting somewhat with Rick to save her husband. It seems like it wasn't acting she just was so strong in not running back to Rick on the last scene of their parting. He doesn't reflect his pain on her departure which is too bad, I think his emotional self could have been displayed a little more in this ending shot of his leaving with the constable, even though his character is quite guarded with armor. I liked the drives that Rick and Ilsa took in France, their leisure and intimate togetherness in cafes. Roulette is fun. This is in his small casino. Champagne and caviar, which is eaten on toast points and luscious bubbly swilled. An elegant film all in all.
0778320448|3.0|I wanted to like this book.  My mom liked this book (and the whole series), but I just couldn't get over a few things.  For one, I'm the same age as Lydia's character and I don't think the author has a realistic idea of what 20-somethings and 30-somethings are really like.<br /><br />Secondly, the characters are all truly stereotypical cliches.  Example:  Alix.  She's dark, she's moody, obviously she must have purple hair, wear black leather, and naturally she has an awful family life where her parents end up in jail and her brother does drugs and dies.  Then miraculously she meets an old friend from her past who is (of course) a youth pastor and she suddenly wants to turn her life around and knit him a sweater. SERIOUSLY?  And what's with the drug dealer named T-Bone..... SERIOUSLY?  It's almost like the author watched some awful 1980s after-school special with the \\"drugs are bad\\" message and too many old-school rap videos and then, since that wasn't enough, threw in some emo & goth tendancies, and Voil&agrave;!: Alix's character!  And don't even get me started on Jacqueline.<br /><br />Moving on..... another thing that bothered me was the absolutely ridiculous event that occurs at the end of the book with Laurel.  That was another moment where I had to stop reading and just think..... SERIOUSLY?<br /><br />And this yarn shop Lydia opens - with an apartment above that she lives in - is located on Blossom Street which is undergoing some construction and renovations... yet apparently the alley right behind her shop (and her apartment, mind you) is so dangerous that you could be jumped and have a knife pulled on you if you dare park your car there or walk through the back.  SERIOUSLY?<br /><br />Ok - I did like some things about the book - I liked Lydia's story - I just wish she stood up for herself more.... and the story did keep me turning the pages to see what would happen, so there's that.<br /><br />It's definitely more geared towards an older set of readers who think all kids who wear dark clothes and don't attend church regularly are \\"hoodlums.\\"  But be warned - it provides a really warped, unrealistic, and distorted view of young adults today.nd don't attend church regularly are \\"hoodlums.\\"  But be warned - it provides a really warped, unrealistic, and distorted view of young adults today.

B002WUWHRA|5.0|I liked the story line of this book a lot. Was not read too well though. The reader was not quite able to articulate different tones very well.<br /><br />Would definitely read vs. listen

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I love this little case.  I can rest easy knowing that my headset is protected and secure when it's bouncing around in my purse.  After spending that much on a headset, what's another $10 (incl. shipping)?  Well worth it.
0345441184|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is a beautiful, enchanting, dare I say majestic, retelling of the Arthurian legend. Most know the legend of King Arthur, but The Mists of Avalon with it's strong feminine perspective looks at the story in a whole other light.<br /><br />The Mists of Avalon follows Morgaine, Arthur's half sister - more commonly know in these types of stories as the evil Morgan Le Fey and Gwenhwyfar, Arthur's queen - usually known to be the innocent and easily swayed by true love Guinevere. We see a lot of religious struggle as the old ways of the Druid priestesses clash with the new Christianity.<br /><br />The Mists of Avalon depicts the women as the power behind he men. While Arthur is the leader, Gwenhwyfar is the one who plants ideas in his head. The Priestesses are powerful in their own right and while that is known, they must still hide away in Avalon.<br /><br />The book is long, telling an epic story - one that spans Morgaine's entire life. A variety of unseemly, even disturbing, topics are touched upon. There are no sugary happy endings here, just vivid emotions and a deep look at both religion and feminism without preachiness coming into play.<br /><br />I absolutely love this book. The Mists of Avalon is epic fantasy at it's finest. Truly a modern classic.
B002ZG983M|5.0|to tell the truth the perview for the movie did look stupid but i thought well it might have potental. and it delivered for sure    the movie is about a teenager played by aaron johnson(can not remember his name in the film) who decides to become a real life superhero. even though his first attempt almost killed him. his second try at do gooding got him some natioal prasie and made kick ass the name he gave his persona famous without anyone knowing he is really is of course.it also attacts the attation of hit girl(chloe grace moretz) and big daddy(NICOLAS CAGE)vigilaties who actally know what they are doing Unfortanly also the attation of the local crime boss than he finds himself way over his head.    the movie has great performaces all a round espically moretz who i will give props foe being a cute little killing machine.also johnson and cage( as always) also do a good job. and the action is relentleess and unforgiving which is rare in a major release. desevers its r rating(in fact mathew vaughn who dircted the movie had to fund it with help from indepent investors cause the major studios would take it if he removed hit girl and softed the movie to a pg-13 rating).     so all in all it is kinda like superbad metts the punsiher. it is worth the money
0316067938|1.0|Trust me, if you are a Jacob fan, do not read this book. If you are an Edward fan, you might be slightly entertained.    The first three books were pleasant, easy reads with characters you either wanted to love or hate.  Some people chose the cool, marble-like skin, serious vampire, while others chose the warm, cuddly werewolf with a sense of humor.    I chose the latter, and book four destroyed the character I'd had grown to love. Jacob went from a hulking, brave warrior with a heart of gold willing to make any sacrifice for his beloved, including surrendering her for her own happiness, into a sniveling babysitter with creepy pedophilia-like qualities.     Though the author does make the point that werewolf 'imprinting' has nothing to do with age or sexuality, there is still something intrinsically wrong with a muscle-bound young man making a soul-mate connection with a newborn girl.    The first three books were good. This one just leaves a bad taste in my mouth that will probably take weeks to recover from.     Jacob fans, save yourselves. Leave the saga at book three and fantasize your own happy ending. Book four isn't it.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Ingenious story plot, engaging story line and top notch action.  Each installment can stand on it's own, but all three need to be watched as one long movie. The suspence is wonderful and the twists captivating.  I watch this triliogy a few times a year and it never gets old.  On the run action, action, action
B003539QKO|4.0|I don't have some indepth review but I just want to say I went into this album just listening to the samples and liking the Rock/Rap sound.  I like Lil Wayne, he's got a unique voice and combined with some cool guitar and good beats make this, in my opinion, a really good album.  Rock on man..
B001C08RHA|4.0|I never followed Iron Man in the comics, so the idea of this character as a movie intrigued me.  The story and character build is one that keeps the viewer interested quite apart from any \\"superhero\\" quality.  It is not as far fetched as the imagination would recommend rather quite feasible in technoloy although some of the action takes it further than a rational story.  actors/actresses are well cast for the most part.
B003X7MBOA|5.0|This sounds so good remastered. I have had an audience recording of it for a few years now and while it sounded ok there is no comparison to the official release. Fantastic playing throughout, just the Mule on disc 1 , then  on disc 2 with Warren trading licks with Little Milton and then Audley Freed.   The fun continues on disc 3 with more Audley and other friends of the band.   One of the highlights for me is the cover version of 21st Century Schizoid Man, outstanding.   Grab this one if you love the classic era Gov't Mule, there will never be another Alan Woody.
0451228731|5.0|This is a fantastic book and a must read for any geek who has ever been annoyed by books that mess up technical details.  This is a can't put it down mystery that gets the technical facts right and is a compelling story!  Daniel Suarez weaves a tale that grabs you and won't let go from the first page to the very end.  I can't wait to read more of his books.  I would order a copy or download to your Kindle e-reader and start reading it today!
1423101472|5.0|Rick Riordan has taken me on one heck of a ride!  What a fantastic series.  And the way he manages to weave everything from the previous books together?  Flawless.  Every single thing that happened before was just pulled together beautifully.  I just can't say enough good things about this final entry.  Everything was so unexpected and I love that.  I hate being able to predict what's going to happen in a book, especially the end of a series.  Just when it looked like there was no possible way out of a situation there would be this amazing turn of events.  There was action, loss, heartbreak and hope.  I can't wait for the new series The Lost Hero.  I hope we get to hear a little about Percy, Annabeth and Grover.  But if that doesn't happen I know that Rick Riordan will be well on his way to telling another fantastic story.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|There is one reason to watch this silly, inane, dreary, ridiculous movie.  Exactly one:<br /><br />The race to the airport while the world caves in beneath the wheels of the car, the freeway collapses, the sky falls, and the Southern California coastline heaves, buckles, and plonks smack-dab into the Pacific Ocean.  Great special effects, Roland -- I gotta hand it to ya.<br /><br />There's also a nifty shot of the State of Hawaii turned into one massive erupting volcano, nixing any chance of a refueling during a trans-oceanic flight across the Pacific to China.  Oops.<br /><br />Other than that, this movie is a multi-gazillion-dollar exercise in silliness.  No coherent plot, the acting is from hunger, characterization is a joke, and the entire basic premise is off the wall.  Mutating neutrinos (whatever the heck that means) cause the earth's crust to destabilize and the whole world first blows itself to smithereenies and then falls into the drink -- all except for Africa, the cradle of civilization, and its regenesis.  About as subtle as a rampaging rhinoceros.<br /><br />Jeez Louise, even The Day After Tomorrow was better than this mess.  And that is saying a lot.<br /><br />Judy Lind
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I was excited about getting some decent PS3 gaming headset but instead I got the worst headset piece ever. The hissing sound is very loud and very annoying.( I tried every remedy I could find on the net but no luck. The headphones are making same hissing sound on PS3/PC/Mac/Some other laptop plugged in or on battery) The guys from turtle beach were nice about return it but was to much of hassle to do it. The company was ok but I can not believe they are allowed to sell defective headphones( I consider that loud hissing a design defect).
0743298039|4.0|Lovely book cover, and intriguing, captivating, very very entertaining story.  Just delicious, fast read with interesting layers of mysteries that made me keep guessing and missing and wanting more.  Is this a deep philosophical book? No.  but it is like a  piece of delicious, high quality chocolate lava cake, and why not enjoy it once in a while?
B002T9H2LA|1.0|I'm not a big Tarantino fan to begin with, but my one star is not because of his direction. It's simply not as good as the original made in 1978 staring Bo Svenson. If you haven't seen this version, do so, you'll probably agree with me. I can't knock the other reviewers who gave it high praise because everyone is entitled to their opinion. I say, to each his/her own.
B0029XZODY|4.0|Dexter season 3 was fantastic. i JUST finished it (8/8/10) and am eagerly awaiting season 4.<br /><br />in this season dexter gets a best friend in assistent DA Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) and teaches him his craft. Unfortunately Miguel doesn't have the Code of Harry to guide him and he takes Dexter's newly taught craft and distorts it.<br /><br />through out this season Dexter's dad shows up as a Jimminy Cricket sort of conscience to show dexter his errors. Most of the time Dex decides not to follow his advice.<br /><br />This was a great season, as the previous two, but really Dexter was never in danger of getting caught and sent to the electric chair. The edge of season two wasn't there. don't get me wrong, i love this show. and i am sorry I had to find it here and not on Showtime. THIS is the show i wish all shows could be. there is very dark humor in it, just enough suspence too keep you coming back.<br /><br />Season four comes out in a couple weeks (less actually) and i will be watching it with antisipation, I can't wait.
1416972250|2.0|City of Glass.  I didn't love it.  I didn't hate it.<br /><br />There are sure to be some SPOILERS, so read on at your own risk ;)<br /><br />The writing seemed a little off in this book.  It didn't read like the first two books did.  I really really liked the first two books.  But this one felt like it dragged on in places and more than once I thought \\"is this conversation ever going to get to the point?\\" or \\"is this book ever going to end?\\"<br />There were things I did like.  Sebastians character I thought was well done.  I liked most of the main returning characters.  Isabelle got annoying in this book, as did Clary and Jace at times.  There must have been some channeling of Bella Swan here, because I guess I needed to hear about Jace's curling hair and how it curls against his temple or about his battle scars/marks every other time Clary looks at him.  The repetition got old.  I like Simon and Luke the most this time around.<br /><br />It was kind of predictable.<br />SPOILERS HERE, SPOILERS HERE, SPOILERS HERE..............<br />(I never believed that Jace and Clary were siblings, and was happy to be proven right.  It was kind of easy to figure it out when Clary felt like she knew Sebastian even though having never met him before.  That was kind of the dead giveaway, to me.  But I was super happy that Clary and Jace got the ending that they wanted.)<br />...............END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />Boy, I wish Amazon would get spoiler tags.  That would make keeping spoilers from being spoiled a lot easier.<br /><br />The ending battle was a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />It was nice to finish the story and see how it all played out and get all the answers, but after finishing this trilogy, I have a hard time thinking that I'll try Clare's new series, 'Clockwork Angel'.....at least not for a long while.
B002ZG9846|3.0|The movie moved kinda slow and the way it progressed was a bit odd at times, yes it had some cool action scenes but a bit over the top especially with the little girl. People do take their kids to see these movies and expect the little girl to play with Barbie dolls, fall in love, or save a kitten out of a tree. Kind of like when I went to see Avatar and parents brought their little kids thinking it was a Disney or Pixar flik or something and then realized it was a bit too deep for the little ones! Don't know why people made such a big deal about this movie or why IGN gave it a 5 star rating saying \\"wished they made all super hero movies like this\\". Can't figure it out for the life of me.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I've been a huge Rush fan since the late Seventies, and this documentary put a huge smile on my face. It's a delight for hardcore fans like myself, but it's very engaging and entertaining even for those who only know \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and the other songs played on classic rock radio.
1401201911|3.0|What if Superman had landed in communist Russia and had become a Russian hero during the Cold War?<br />That's the question this book tries to answer, as we see Superman going from working class hero to strategic asset (much like Doctor Manhattan in the much more relevant Watchmen book), then to Soviet president.<br />This Superman is nearly omnipotent and, despite being raised by normal folks, absorbs enough Soviet propaganda to become a benign (in intent, at least...) but very strict dictator, going as far as lobotomising defeated rebels. This oddly reminded me of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but not entirely in a good way, since Kesey's masterpiece is on an entirely different level and much, much more subtle too, especially when compared to Millar's typical in-your-face approach.<br />In any case, this different attitude is well portrayed, although oversimplifed.<br />Much as I enjoyed this book and much as I enjoy the work of both its creators, this has failed to impress me as other works by them have.<br />Trying to compress 60 years of history in 160 pages while at the same time re-inventing al main DC Universe heroes in addition to the title character might have bee too much for Millarto handle. It apparently was for main artist Dave Johnson too, who had to be replaced by Killian Plunkett in issue 3. It must be said that Johnson does an astounding job of channelling Soviet propaganda posters in his absolutely marvellous covers, which possibly are the real highlight of the book. And the Russian Batman wearing a pelt hat...? A classic! Funny as hell, and so blatantly practical it makes you chuckle.<br />However, my guess is that Millar wrote it years before ad that it suffered from the artist's slowness, as the writing here is more reminiscent of some of Millar's less succesfull early efforts.<br />Nonetheless, Millar shows a deep and thorough understandng of what makes Luthor such a cool villain and why one might root for him instead of the all too perfect alien God he faces.<br />Luthor's \\"inhumanity\\"is often played upon, but eventually he's the one saving and reforming the world to reach the Utopia Superman himself couldn't achieve. Luthor finally beat Superman, using layer upon layer of carefully orchestrated plans and incredible discoveries and inventions that are born in a phrase and never expanded at all (thus sounding cool while not having to withstand closer examination, or further development). This is even above the average the likes of Millar and Morrison usually manage in their high concept-crammed but still much better books.<br />If you are really interested I'd recommend waiting for a decent price, and steering clear of the uselessly more expensive hardcover re-release!'s \\"inhumanity\\"is often played upon, but eventually he's the one saving and reforming the world to reach the Utopia Superman himself couldn't achieve.

0689878451|1.0|This book is not good for kids. It's very dull, boring and poorly written. My child loves penguins and all kinds of different animals, but this book is painfully a chore to read. Bad writing, uninspired illustrations and dreadfully slow pacing make this book a prime example of F class efforts.
B000003R7G|5.0|Probably like many in fall, 1997, I was eagerly awaiting the release of a new Portishead album. 1994s [[ASIN:B000001FI7 Dummy]] was so inventive, you wondered what the band would do next. I got the album.<br /><br />Then, I made a big mistake. I listened to Portishead, the album, and though liking it, dismissed it as a copy of the first. Is it?<br /><br />No! But the lesson I learned is when a band has a rich, deep sound, it pays to listen again and again and again. The rewards are all in the subtleties.<br /><br />That axiom maxes out on this Portishead album. It turns out I was half right. In terms of songwriting, there is not a lot of difference between the two albums. But what changed is how much more dense the complications are on the second.<br /><br />Portishead is like a small piece of iron. Pick it up and there is more weight than you can imagine. That holds more true on this album. Listen to the horns, clustered short and deep on \\"All Mine,\\" amongst the fuzz guitar and  booming drums and pulsing bass. There is more instrumentation here than on Dummy, thicker than you would ever think. The ability of Potishead to pack so much into little space is uncanny.<br /><br />And so much into so dark a space: if Dummy had a despairing tone, this is downright depression--black insanity. Check out \\"Half Day Closing\\" with its plodding bass line, forward slowly in its minor blues torment. Vocalist Beth Gibbons whispers and whales, flangers popping on and off her voice. It is truly frightening.<br /><br />So is most of this album, which is a quicksand of goth fear, samples, 1960s soundtrack allusions, all packed under your most painful finger nail. Listen once, listen a hundred times. The coil will unwind, slowly. Darkly
3548261949|4.0|I have many codes by which I live, but the most important to me is to \\"never see a movie before reading the book\\" (if there is a book of course). That is why I was so disappointed in myself when Shutter Island was in theaters and I had yet to crack it open. Sadly, it took me this long to get around to it but I am glad that I finally did! I had read Dennis Lehane's Mystic River and absolutely fell in love with the movie, so I knew I was in good hands. Though I almost never read thrillers or mysteries, I have a soft spot for Lehane's psychological thrillers and Shutter Island does not disappoint!<br /><br />The reader meets U. S Marshal Teddy Daniels while on a boat to Shutter Island, an island located off of Boston Harbor on which there is a hospital for the criminally insane. Also on the boat, is his partner Charlie Aul both of whom are sent to the island to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando. Solando is a patient who was sent to the hospital because she drown her three children and then sat them around the dinner table until a neighbor discovered the scene. Teddy and Charlie have never met before but they immediately hit it off and become fast friends. Teddy is clearly the serious leader while Charlie is much more happy-go-lucky and pleased to be the follower. As Teddy and Charlie spend a couple of days on the island, Teddy begins to think that nothing is as it seems and that they may possibly never get off the island again. Teddy must also confront his own past and the death of his wife before it is too late.<br /><br />As with Mystic River, the most enthralling aspect of this story are the relationships between characters. Though there is a good mystery and some great drama, Lehane draws such vivid characters that the reader is completely absorbed. Of course there are chases, codes that must be broken, and blind alleys all of which make you fly through the novel. Yet, the true heart is with the people in the story. I was sad when the novel was over, but felt that it was complete. Now it's time for me to sit down and watch the movie and possibly pick up the new graphic novel!<br /><br />Specifically the audiobook is wonderful! The reader is a man with a strong voice that is pleasant to listen but also sets the perfect tone for the novel. His reading is not over-emotional or over-acted. It was just perfection.was complete.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Best movie I have ever seen. Good story and good morals. I highly recommend this movie.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Perhaps some were turned off by the ending of the series, but taken as a whole, I found it terrific.  The show was always about characters and characterization rather than the mechanical ins and outs of the island.  The island was the mystery and the backdrop for the drama between the people on and off the island.  From the pilot episode all the way to the addendum of the show with the postscript, I have been hooked on 'Lost'.  Over the years the show offered so much food for thought and so many discussions amongst my friends about the meaning of the show and the meaning of actions of the characters that those things cannot be taken away...they were wonderful moments.<br />Anyone who has not watched this show at all should do so if they are interested in: science fiction, mystery, drama, romance, adventure, action, and so many other genres that this show was able to encapsulate at different times.
0061714372|1.0|I am a huge Megadeth fan. I actually prefer this band to Metallica because their songs seemed more cerebral and real; Metallica (with some VERY notable exceptions) seemed more manufactured and prepackaged. Also Saint Anger just sucks on every level; this cannot be said for any Megadeth album, even Risk. Megadeth kept releasing pertient and heavy albums through the years, and even on albums that went more mainstream, there were good songs (plural).    So you can imagine how happy I was when the book came out and Dave was dropping by my town to do a book signing! I bought the book the day it came out and started reading. In the first few chapters, talking about his crappy childhood, I thought he was writing on a second grade reading level (plus frequent profanity of course) in an attempt to show how he felt. And that after the account, he would reflect on it a bit more... no. The book consists of Dave whining about his lot in life, and though he does admit some guilt and a change in attitude, he lacks real reflection in the prose other than saying God is now important in his life and how far reaching an effect his crappy childhood - esp his experience with the Jehovas witnesses - had on him long term.     Compare this with autobiographies as varied as Marilyn Manson and George Carlin, who write in such a way where you get insight into their head and their process rather than a narrative of various ways in which their life sucks!    I appreciated knowing what was going on in the band during the creation of the various albums, but I was really hoping to get to know how he thought - not whom he hated. I thought he could do SO much better. I wish the book was written 1 /10 as well as the lyrics to his songs.     There is one point in the book, where he talks about a suit against him by his bassist. And he describes the divide of people taking sides - DE is whiny and unappreciative vs DM is greedy and egomaniacal. Listening to him through the book. I would say that Dave iswhiny and unappreciative of his career. So WHAT if he got booted from Metallica! It sucks that your songs/ likeness got used against your will, but if it could have been proven, charges would have been pressed. Now the songs.. beginner's mistake but as for the likeness on \\"some kind of monster\\", he knew legalities well enough by then. He is a multimillionaire who abuses everyone around him - and then is whining that the people around him only care about money! When Metallica can't stand to be around you because of toxicity.. wow. I think he remains unappreciative of his music as an entity separate from a pissing contest with Metallica. And of COURSE he's a greedy egomaniac! He's a rock star with an attitude, tempered with age and religion but still there. Otherwise he would not have written this book.     This book disappointed me in so many ways that I could write a book about it; in any case, I don't know if the first book I have in my house signed by an author is this one. This book is SO bad that I am seriously thinking about passing up the opportunity to see Dave Mustaine the artist in the setting of a signing for this piece of \\"literature\\".    Even worse, my opinion of Dave as an artist is decreased as a result of reading this. I thought there was meaning behind these lyrics, but apparently it was all just frustration, anger, and images out of graphic novels. The little bit of politics that DID make it in was largely influenced by other members of the band and he outright denies any political lean. \\"Party of Clint Eastwood\\". Either he really is that non committal and the lyrics were empty or he wasn't man enough to take a stand in his own autobiography. Either way, it left me disappointed.
0446693804|4.0|I was told to watch the movie by a friend I did and absolutely loved it so I picked up the book ,and while I really liked the book I was disappointed to find it completely different from the movie only a few things from the movie happened in the book, so just wanted to let everyone know cause the book is great on its own and so is the movie but to let everyone know they are pretty much two different things! I am now a fan of mr. sparks but i will read the book before I watch the other movies so I am not disappointed like that again ... don't get me wrong the book is amazing
B0001CCY7E|4.0|Having seen and enjoyed the movie, the soundtrack brings everything back. It is most enjoyable if you have seen the movie.
B003MX5P20|4.0|Euphoria, is a really good album. I think Enrique is a talented writer and vocalist.      Euphoria, is a pleasant, romantic and moving listening experience. I like the mix of English and Spanish speaking songs. Some songs are mellow and some are danceable. It's a good balance of both. I was touched by what he wrote in the booklet and his album dedication to, Grammy.    Outstanding tracks include; Heartbeat, I Like It and Cuando Me Enamoro    The Deluxe Edition, offers a different track listing and includes three bonus tracks. Why Not Me?, Heartbreaker and Coming Home are truly great songs (especially, Coming Home). They should have been included on the standard release.

B002Y5FKUE|5.0|If you enjoy great bel canto singing, it doesn't come greater than this.To add to the joy, Dessay, Florez and Pertusi not only sing their roles to perfection, they look their parts and act them superbly as well - and entire supporting cast do too.  I have watched this video at least a dozen times over the past few months, and it only grows more delightful with each viewing.
B00275EHJG|4.0|This movie was a very clever, amusing and a little scary. I think however, the good part of the movie is the toys. Without the toys this movie would not be very magnificent! The story is the best of the three and I left the theater with a happy smile on my face! Thank you Pixar for making my day and I hope you folks reading this have the sense to buy this healthy and humorous DVD! It will definatly become a favorite with your small ones!
0307474712|3.0|David Nicholls' \\"One Day\\" is a quick and easy read and is rather reminiscent of the fine movie \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".  It reads like a screenplay with good banter between interesting, but not terribly likable characters.  This novel puts the reader on St. Swithin's Day (July 15) from 1988 though 2007.  We're given glimpses into the relationship between Dex (a boorish tv host) and Em (a writer) one day at a time through 20 years.  It's an interesting premise/approach and at times works well (it enables the author to cover 20 years in 400 or so pages) and at others is a bit disjointed (it's annoying to get into the story and then find it suddenly end and jump a year forward on the next page, often with no resolution).  This is a good read if you're looking for a quick summer book that contains some humor and screenplay style dialogue (i.e., no long poetic passages).

0307387178|5.0|I just finished reading this book, i loved it.  I felt it was well written, so easy to read and very difficult to put it down.  The biography of this young man alexander supertramp is tragic story, but having read this book i found out a lot more than i ever knew about him.
0061122416|4.0|I thought this was a very good, brief read about a spiritual journey with a flair for irony. As a huge fan of irony, I truly enjoyed the pilgrimage of Santiago. The character development is brief, but full of life.  The story is hope-filled and really well-done in its brevity.    The book could have been longer; perhaps more descriptive, but I believe it would have taken away from the simple, inspirational message that was being delivered.  The book is a book about hope and can be read by anyone.  For most, it would be an easy, quick read, affording a simple positive message over a short period of time.
B000E33VWW|3.0|This movie... was frightening.  Not so much because of the murders it depicts or the events leading to a conclusion, but rather it becomes a horrific look at how destiny lead a man to greatness and simultaneously dissolution.  Truman Capote was one of America's finest authors in his day.  He desirously rushes into the trap of creative epiphany only to have himself shattered as he faces himself as he relates to two murderers caught, convicted, and set to die.  All the while Truman is writing his masterpiece on their undead bodies.    Amazing subject matter.    Amazing performances.    Technically masterful.    In terms of pacing and story, an utter disaster.  If film is a visual language, this was a run-on sentence until about 2/3rd through.  It's slow and laborious without any relation to what is connecting characters together or the central plot to the characters.  Words are said, sure, but the shot choice and editing of the scenes and choice of dialog stifles the story.  Finally Capote gets the gem he searches for: the descriptive confession of the murder, and the film comes together and rockets to an ending where the viewer grips the chair arm as the movie's situation grips the viewer.    Philip Seymour Hoffman could play a mute in a potato sack on a toilet behind a locked door for two hours and he'd fascinate an audience.  The rest of the cast were excellent.  Pity the film had so much going for it and was so easily defeated by editing of script and film, but with a film dealing with such deep issues framed with such a simple rung of events, every shot, every word, every creative choice has to be close to perfect for the film to thrive.    It's still a great film, but definitely not for a matinee audience, and can only be enjoyed by the older, artsier, or more intellectual crowd.  So I think.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Many musical scores do not stand alone...Hans Zimmer's \\"The Last Samurai\\" is an outstanding example of those that do.  The insturmentation is classical at moments yet unique to the theme at other times...it keeps you captivated and is great background or stand out alone music in your home, work or car.    I have always enjoyed most of Mr Zinner's music but find that this is one of his best leaving you wanting more...
B001GKJ2DO|2.0|Being a fan of ABBA, I was looking forward to seeing the movie. However, I found the pacing of the movie incredibly slow compared to the stage play. It was, in a word, boring. To add to the disappointment, the leads (Streep and Brosnan) were not up to the vocal requirements of the score (especially Brosnan). While I enjoy them as actors, they needed to have their voices dubbed or at least their performances improved.   The other disappointment was the change of the script towards the end adding the reference about families being of all types. That was not in the original as I remember. That could have been left out. Also, the producers could have left off the tacky ending with the cast parading around in those horrid suits. True, the stage play has that addition but it comes off much better on stage than on screen.     If you are a fan of the stage play, I believe you will be disappointed with this version.
1400034779|5.0|The reviewers who wrote this off as a series of short stories without much plot missed the point.  It was clearly never intended to be \\"Agatha Christie meets southern Africa.\\" It is instead a lovely, thought-provoking story of a woman and her country, told by unpealing the layers (some humorous, some more weighty) of their lives, and revealing how they have both come through darkness to find quiet, justifiable happiness and dignity.    I expected this to be a lightweight, mindless summer afternoon read. And true, it was a great choice for an idle summer day.  But it was not mindless (or painless).  The author, having been born in neighboring Zimbabwe, and taught at the University of Botswana, gives us enough glimpses into the history and culture of this little neighbor of South Africa, that I found myself online for the next week seeking more info on this uniquely stable and successful diamond-rich African democracy, wondering how they have managed to sustain peace and wide-spread prosperity surrounded as they are by countries ravaged by greed-driven violence. My sense is that this reaction on my part was not the least of the author's motives in writing this first of his series.
B00004SA8A|5.0|I am rather bewildered that this Kempff set is receiving such mixed reviews. In fact this was one of the first CD´s I bought since it was not easily available on vintage vinyls which I used to buy in early 90´s. Since then I listen to it periodically and I never felt the urge to acquire another complete version of Schubert´s sonatas (I own lots of individual recordings by different pianists).  The sound: true, this is not the best 1960´s quality and sometimes you notice the difference between various venues they used. But it is never worse than good.  The interpretation: Typical Kempff in studio - always reliable, often splendid. In the overall the level of inspiration of Kempff´s playing here exactly corresponds to the quality of the composition - listen e.g. to the opening of D664 - what lyricism and elevation without ever being forced. But let´s admit it - Schubert is not always at his best in his sonatas. Kempff should not be blamed for it. His remains the reference complete set.

B000NA1OXY|2.0|Let's face it, Avril Lavigne has never been an extraordinary musician. Or songwriter. She's never had any truly profound or breathtaking songs. What she has been is catchy and smart. Her music may not be the high point of most music collections, but it's the kind of music you can sing along to in your car or while you're cleaning the house. And with Under My Skin she was starting to sound like she could someday make music that had a little more staying power. The Best Damn Thing, however, is not that music. The music on certain tracks (When You're Gone, Everything Back But You, Hot) isn't bad. It's her lyrics and, sometimes, vocals that make this album the most frustrating thing she's done so far. Avril souded less like a bratty 12 year old when she was 18 than she does now, at 23. She's aging backwards in the worst possible way.   However, the album is not a total loss, and that's why it gets 3 stars instead of 1. Like I mentioned earlier, the backing music on some of the tracks is still worth listening to. And some of the lyrics don't suck as bad as the rest.     Girlfriend - 2/5  I Can Do Better - 1/5  Runaway - 2/5  The Best Damn Thing - 3/5 (The chorus makes this not totally unbearable)  When You're Gone - 4/5  Everything Back But You - 4/5  Hot - 4/5  Innocence - 2/5  I Don't Have to Try - 1/5  One of Those Girls - 1/5  Contagious - 5/5  Keep Holding On - 4/5

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Never have I been so excited over a new artist in quite some time, but Janelle Monae is worthy of such praise.   \\"The ArchAndroid\\" continues it's concept theme from the EP of \\"Metropolis\\", and covers such topics of love, loss, joy & growth.    Musically, Monae has truly understood the music of the past and incorporated that understanding with the direction of the future.  Spanning different styles, classical, jazz, soul, folk, and so much more, into a lush, dazzling work of art.  Well worthy of Grammy nomination.    If Monae continues to craft cd such as this, in time she will become legendary!  A must have!!

B003ELOQCK|4.0|How can I not love this product when I was there? Well, I did not give 5 stars for one reason. The filming of this concert is moving all around the place which make me dizzy after a while, but it is a good memory for me even if it is not my preferred rock band (I went there because I was invited). You got a long taping for your buck and you get also 2 CDs with a lot of extra footage. If you like U2 and a shaking filming does not bother you much, buy it.
0790743523|4.0|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948 film    A man checks his lottery ticket - a loser. [Symbolism?] He takes a job doing construction on an oil rig. They will get paid when the job ends. But this is a fraud to cheat the men out of their pay. An old man talks about the price of gold, its cost in human labor, and what it does to men's souls. Dobbs and Curtin find Pat the contractor, who has an excuse for not paying the men. A fight in a bar convinces him to pay some of his just debts. Can they search for gold instead? Dobbs has a winning lottery ticket for 200 pesos ($100). They now have enough for supplies, tools, and guns for hunting. They take a train into the country. Bandits attack! [They had the right to keep and bear arms then.] They will visit a mountain where no man has been before. The old man knows minerals, and finds traces of gold dust. They have to hide the find so nobody will take it.    A sluice is used to separate the gold from the dirt. This means hauling water from far away. The old man knows what gold will do to men. A cave-in creates drama. [Dobbs' bad luck?] Howard plans to buy a grocery store and retire as a small business owner. [The dream of many, then.] Curtin plans to buy a peach ranch. Dobbs plans to live it up in luxury. Will they set a limit on what they will take out of the mine? Will they grow suspicious? Does Dobbs have a problem? The Federales are searching for the bandits that robbed the train. An American asks questions; is he too curious? There is danger from the bandits, they are after their guns and ammunition. The miners defend themselves. The bandits flee when the Federales arrive. The gold harvest begins to diminish, its time to go back to civilization. Each man has his share on his burro. Curtin thinks about Cody's widow in Texas. Four men arrive at their camp. They ask for help, Howard goes with them to treat a young boy who fell into the water. The boy is revived. A miracle?    How did the Indians know they were there? Howard will stay with the Indians as a medicine man. Curtin and Dobbs head for Durango. \\"Its all ours to keep\\" says Dobbs. Curtin is honest, but Dobbs doesn't believe him. Their conflict is finally resolved. [Why didn't Curtin tie up Dobbs?] Can Curtin be rescued? Dobbs' talk tells his thoughts. But those bandits find Dobbs with an empty gun. The burros run off, but the bandits catch them, dump the sacks, and take them into town for sale. A bad career move. Can Howard and Curtin find their goods? Will a Norther blow sand over their goods? Only the empty sacks remain. Howard has the last laugh over their loss. What next? Curtin has plans for his future.    Did the praise of critics mean anything if the movie doesn't do well at the box office? Was this film \\"too cynical\\"? The death of the star may have gone against the expectations of the audience. [Bogart didn't play a villain since \\"High Sierra\\".] You could consider this a parable of the \\"pump and dump\\" scam in the stock market. The value of a stock rises to far above the IPO or book value only to come crashing down in huge losses (like the High-Tech stock scams in the late 1990s). The losses and impoverishment lead to a depression, as in the 1920s when this novel was written. Gold was $20 an ounce before 1933 when it was revalued to $35 an ounce. Nixon revalued gold in 1971 to cause economic turmoil ever since. Devaluing the currency was one way to impoverish most people while making the economic royalists richer.

0385523904|5.0|This book was an eye opener for me.  The bravado that I read in the news does not match the day to day struggles that the North Koreans face.  Sometimes the author writes hearsay into the descriptions, but she admitted that facts are hard to come by and tried to back up as much as possible.  I'm glad she compiled and linked the stories, and I am glad that I read it.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This political thriller should appeal to most men and women. Our story opens when a retired polictician (Pierce Brosnan) hires a ghost writer (Ewan McGregor) to do his memoirs. As McGregor starts to do his research he not only finds the previous ghost wrtier died under mysterious circumstances, but the man he is working for may have been an agent with the CIA with a dark past.

1594481717|4.0|While the notion of left-brain vs. right-brain wasn't new, Daniel Pink explores in depth, the implications of the differences. I particularly liked this book because it put a new perspective on many things that I used to find irrational or random. Rather, I see these as reality and logical progressions now. This in turn, has provided me with a broad framework within which to connect dots that I would have otherwise dismissed as arbitrary because they were not on the same plane.    It's kind of left me with a whole new mind. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has to constantly deal with different individuals and personalities - whether at work, home or in social contexts.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|When the tragic deaths of Clyde Shelton's (Gerald Butler) wife and daughter go unpunished for one and a quick painless death for the other, he decides to take the law into his own hands. But not only does he plan to kill the criminals involved in a painful way, he plans to take out their attorney (Jamie Foxx), and everyone else with even the slightist involvement with the case.

As they start to recall the reactor on the ship is going critical and they must reset it. There is only one problem, they aren't alone and in addition to psychotic crew aboard there are creatures that like the taste of human flesh.

B002SG8A56|4.0|I have always been a fan of satire, sarcasm and droll humor, and these guys got it right the first time. Their regular meetings with their manager, in which he takes roll of all three present, including himself, is reminiscent of \\"The Office\\" at its best. The ever-changing New Zealand posters on his wall, which generally try to distinguish their country from Australia, are always amusing and sometimes hilarious. And the jokes at Australia's expense are some of their best. Their music is all over the place in terms of style, but always very good and funny. \\"Too Many Dicks on the Dance Floor\\" may be my favorite for its overall presentation. Their TV musical career is not taking off any time soon since they play to audiences as small as one.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This is a work-in-progress of the finished product Zack Snyder promised fans just before the theatrical release of \\"Watchmen\\". [[ASIN:B002Q9VPFM Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut]] contains everything - which is to say that it features the Black Freighter comic in animated form, and a few blink-and-you'll-miss-it transitional segments with the kid who's reading it. Honestly, I never really liked the Black Freighter interludes in the book, and in the Ultimate Cut, I found that it interrupts the flow terribly. So with that said, THIS director's cut is much better in comparison, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the film. The extended scenes (described in previous reviews) are wonderful elaborations, and of course, Hollis Mason's death scene is heart-wrenching. You don't want to miss this.
B003O86MY8|5.0|I highly recommend this album.  I grew up in the 80's as a fan of rock and heavy metal.  I also play violin so I have a deep appreciation for classical music.   David Garrett has pulled all of these styles together for an awesome album.  This kind of music is the only thing that will keep future generations interested in classical music.  Keep up the great work!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic series.    Before you go reading the 1 star reviews on here, just realize those are people unhappy with the ending of the entire series.  It's completely their right to have a negative opinion, but what's comical is how they are trying to make their opinions facts.    The series was ALWAYS about the characters, and in the end we got a resolution of their stories.  The sci-fi, mysteries, and questions all were second place to some fantastic character creation and story arcs throught the six seasons.    Are there mysteries on the show which will capture your imagination?  You bet!  Do those mysteries take a backseat to the characters and their development?  You bet!    Are there questions on this show that will never be answered?  You bet!    You see... Lost... like life... DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE ANSWER TO EVERY QUESTION!!!  And it shouldn't!    Don't knock a series because your expectations are to be spoon fed every answer to everything.  I guess it's a shame that the writers/creators of Lost didn't expain why the grass was green or the ocean was blue on the show too.  Oh yeah, and how did the birds we see on the series actually fly again?  I guess we need those answers too, or the series was horrible.    Just because YOU thought you deserved an answer to a particular question doesn't mean all of America was thinking the same thing.     Go back and watch the series again, and this time ACTUALLY RELAX and let yourself be taken on the journey.      ONLY THEN will you understand the destination of the ending...        GREAT SERIES!  5 STARS!!!!
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Like most yanks I had never heard of the notorious English criminal, Michael Gordon Peterson--aka Charlie Bronson, before seeing this film. Since I read up on him I now have a hard time believing there is such a major movement to demand his release though. I am not sure what his psychiatric diagnosis is but am certain that his mental illness is not one that will disappear with age. Yet Tom Hardy's acting was superlative. He's probably more Charles Bronson than Mr. Peterson himself. Hardy is completely believable in this role. The movie is not a total depiction of his life but emphasizes the proper highlights--er, I mean lowlights. What motivates a man like this is beyond most of our comprehension, but men such as these are definitely ones of whom we should be informed.
0307454541|5.0|Excellent author. I bought two of his books on a whim based on the positive reviews, and I couldn't be more pleased. The writing keeps you entertained and makes you not want to put the book down. There are some spots where the translation wasn't done perfectly, but they do not deter from the book at all; I just wanted to mention it as those are the only \\"flaws\\" I have found. Great books, would highly recommend, and I'm getting ready to buy the third in the series.
B0030Y11XS|3.0|Let me take the moment to give you TWO THINGS about this movie that made me take TWO STARS away from the five-star review it could of received...but first, let me make a disclaimer about Mr. Moore:<br /><br />The last time I considered myself a \\"liberal\\" was for about a semester in college when I was interning under a \\"liberal\\" professor.  Prior to that I was always conservative-minded...and pretty much still am, every college student goes through some sort of liberal phase.  That being said, I think Michael Moore has always made great movies.  Even though I don't agree with gun control, universal health care, or socialism, I still feel his films have provided an education on government and corporate corruption that a mass audience can enjoy while being enlightened.  Moore's solutions are always a little too idealistic for my tastes, but I'm glad he has been there for 20+ years to be an agent of critical thinking to the general public.<br /><br />That being said, here is what I DISLIKED about \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\".  (I am not going to talk about what I liked or agreed with in the film, because that was pretty much everything except for what I am about to mention).<br /><br />First, I take a star away because this film seems to try to be anti-capitalism when it's real target is NOT capitalism but corruption WITHIN capitalism.  Wal-Mart taking out life insurance policies on employees, privatized penal systems, and job-loss due to outsourcing are not default results of capitalism.  These are examples of the greed and violation that occurs when capitalism leads to single entities having too much power.  However, if it were not for capitalism, well, lets just say Michael Moore might have to show his movies after midnight in very private places to very select audiences.<br /><br />Next, and this is the BIGGEST flaw of \\"Capitalism\\", I take a star away because of the severe [...]that Barrack Obama gets in the last third of this movie.  I am not sure what the future holds for President Obama's legacy, but I do know that it is absolutely ludicrous to call a guy a saint before he has done a single thing.  Also, take a look at guys like Paulson and Geitner...they still have jobs under Obama, don't they?  In fact, aren't they more powerful under Obama?  Read the news, day after day you'll see that Mr. Obama is putting more and more power in the hands of Wall Street cronies and the Federal Reserve.<br /><br />I feel that Michael Moore is terribly mistaken in putting so much trust into the man who would be president.  The reality is that Barrack Obama and the Democratic party are a different face to the same beast that employed George Bush and Bill Clinton.  Powerful bankers, corrupt judges, lobbyists, greedy globalists...the presidents have carried out the bidding of these schmuck's since Kennedy was assassinated.  Obama is no savior to the ailments of capitalism, he is just another sap who sold his soul to the evil machine.but I do know that it is absolutely ludicrous to call a guy a saint before he has done a single thing.

B002VPE1OS|5.0|I used the Amazon iPhone screen protector when my \\"name brand\\" protector finally wore out.  The Amazon screen protector is every bit as effective as anything else I have tried at higher prices.  Clarity if fine, if not a bit better than the previous protector I used.  Installation follows the Speck product approach of having two pieces of film to remove, which helps with bubbles.  The included bubble squeegee card wasn't rigid enough for me to get the few bubble out, so I did need to resort to a credit card.  Overall, great value and highly recommended.
B0026P3G12|5.0|When I received this item i was so excited and wasn't disappointed. The item was delivered as stated by seller. I would purchase from the seller again.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Ever since I heard her sing on Britain's Got Talent, I knew an album like this would be made. Her voice is beautiful, the song choices are great, and I really like the way she made a great song by Madonna even better.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This was an excellent film. If you watch it only for the splendor of it all, then it will still be worth watching and owning.
B001992NW4|5.0|I have the VHS tape, the original DVD, the 25th anniversary DVD, The 25th anniversary box (with book, lobby cards and actual frame from the film),the extended version DVD, the anthology box set with all the films in the series, the paperback, 2 hard covers, and the audio book read by the author. I also have an excellent book on the making of the film. Needless to say I am an expert on the film as I have been revisiting it since I first saw it on tv in the 70's.<br /><br />I am psyched for the Blue-ray release. I am about to turn 41, and have yet to see a movie that scares me as much as The Exorcist. The Omen came close, Texas chainsaw was cool. Amityville was great, but let's face it. The Exorcist was so well written, expertly researched (based on a true story), and brilliantly directed.<br /><br />Linda Blair was 14 years old, playing a 12 year old. She never matured into a great actress, but what a job she did in this film, and she was only 14! The movie was so well cast. Even some of the priests were real priests! It doesn't scare me any more due to the hundreds of times I've seen it, but I still revisit it because it is an achievement beyond any other film. There were no computers back then, so you can't really compare the effects to a Star Wars, or a Titanic. The job these guys did with what they had is beyond words.<br /><br />The scares don't come from a Freddy, Jason or Michael Myers jumping out of a dark corner. The true fright comes from the fact that the movie makes you feel like you might actually be looking directly into the eyes of a demon, if not Satan himself. The mind games that the demon plays with Father Karras, while Karras is trying to prove genuine possession are riveting.<br /><br />If you've never owned it I demand that you purchase the Blue-ray edition. If you own it already, you may not want to shell out the extra cash for an upgrade unless you are a fanatic like me. I highly recommend the original novel. I also recommend the book on the actual TRUE case this story is based on. It's called Possessed: The True Story of an Exorcism by Thomas B. Allen.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** The Blu-ray is phenominal! You'll see things in great detail for the first time. The colors in Regan's eys are unbelievable. The Blu-ray comes with both the original version and the updated 2000 version with added scenes, and a booklet. Even if you have the dvd I still recommend the upgrade to Blu-ray.<br /><br />Fans of the film are welcome to e-mail me at NolanKevin7@aol.com.ed on.

B003PIUC02|1.0|When I first heard this was coming to Starz I was really looking forward to watching. I wanted to like this program.<br /><br />I had been a big fan of the HBO series Rome. I would rate that show as a 5 and own both season one and two.<br /><br />I watched the first episode of Spartacus and was so disappointed. It was like a bad cartoon without engaging characters. The splating blood was annoying. From a visual aspect, it was 300 on a cheap budget. The stab, cut to a limb flying - fight scenes were cheesy. I own video games with better quality fights.<br /><br />One of the things that Rome had was the beautiful cinematography. It was visually stunning to watch. I didn't care for the comic book style approach that Spartacus uses. I am a fan of the movie 300. The story was engaging enough that I didn't mind the visual style of the movie. 300 could get away with that style, no problem. Spartacus can't pull off that style because of the other problems it has. Spartacus lacked the beautiful costumes that HBO's Rome had. It lacks the characters that you WANT to watch. The story it's self was poor. Maybe it was over shadowed by the cheap use of too many naked people. I don't mind it, when it's used correctly, and not every three to four minutes because they couldn't think of anything else to film. It just didn't add anything to the story.<br /><br />But still I continued to watch hoping that the story and characters would develop. That didn't happen. I made it to episode 7 or 8 and gave up.<br /><br />In the end, save your money. Don't buy Spartacus. Or if you are looking for a good series you might want to check out HBO's Rome. Amazon carries the DVD and Blu-ray versions of the show.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|This movie is a creep-fest from the get-go, with a mind-bending conclusion to boot. Some viewers want to see blood, guts, and torture porn like in the \\"Saw\\" series, but the \\"Saw\\" movies are a sick batch of movies aimed at a massively dumbed-down movie-watching audience. This film lies somewhere between Hitchcock and the Shining. And Melissa George is one talented actress. It'll make you think AND jump a few times.
B002ZG997M|4.0|I was sure this movie was going to be a sleeper all the way through, but by half way through I wanted to know what came next.   The ending was very good.  I will watch it again.
B001GZLLQA|1.0|I love Jennifer Hudson, but was dismayed as i listened to track after track of tuneless, uninspiring songs, which even her wondrous voice couldn't rescue.  The only good song is \\"Spotlight.\\"  The rest are so bad, I threw the whole 2-part package out.      \\"Spotlight\\" is the only song on the video, and it's beautiful.  It also appears twice on the cd.  The producers know when they've got a good thing.  Why were the rest so poor?    I hope her other cds are more promising.                  Alice
B002ZG97RY|4.0|I would watch this movie over and over and not get bored.  It helps to bring to life what really happened in Iraq.
B003ELOQD4|3.0|Overall the disc is great, but I'm surprised on how poor the quality of the video.  Sound quality and performance are great.  The video picture is over saturated and makes the picture not feel right; hard to believe this was intentional.  All I can say is that next time they make a recording of their concert, please give us a no thrills manipulation of the picture.  Film it, edit it, but don't muck with the video picture to make it unpleasant to watch!  If your a U2 fan, it's worth getting the disc... after awhile the video quality numbs your overall negative about the picture quality.  It's not my favorite video for U2 because of the picture quality, so it will not see as much airplay on my TV as it should, but I will play it for the sound on my stereo.
030726999X|5.0|Excellent end of a brilliant trilogy. Mr Larsson brings his vivid characters full circle without missing a beat. After reading the first two novels of the series, I was impatient to have the last book and Amazon did not disappoint.  I recommend all three books and of course you can't go wrong using Amazon to procure them.
B0035TMUTM|5.0|There is a major mistake on the song list! Voyageur and Turn Around are mixed up! The titles are all wrong! I cannot believe Mr. Cretu did not realize this mistake iTunes and Amazon have made. Hopefully to be corrected soon.<br /><br />Of course this is a great album...there is no need to comment on that. The mistake in the wording was just pissing me off, so I thought to go public about this.<br /><br />-I M Papuc
0061714372|5.0|The title I gave for this review pretty much sums it up.  This book is a very candid look at the life of Megadeth's heart and soul, Dave Mustaine.  The bizarre extremities of his life and collection of interesting stories makes it hard to put down; I got the book a day after it came out, started reading it last night and finisihed it a few minutes ago.  Yes, its that interesting.  The book has a unique flavor because its written almost in the same way that Dave Mustaine talks; cynical yet slightly humorous, and it will no doubt please fans of the band.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|A great thriller. Leo and Ben are outstanding. Lots of twists and plot twists. Worht the look. Great value.
B000BVD460|5.0|CD came in new looking condition, all inserts were included in jewel case. Great seller.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I've always been a fan of Rush's older stuff, when they got into the 80's keyboeard phase they lost me. Fortunately, they don't show a lot of that in the film, in conversations they do address it and how they started moving away from it. How these guys are not in the hall of fame is beyond me, but what a fantastic compilation of classic footage, the story of any interviews with the band as well as BRIEF interviews and outtakes with other rock celebrities.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I have not been ale to watch the movie. The seller clearly posted this as HD, but I was too dumb to know the difference. I have no way to play this disc but that's all on me. The seller posted it correctly. I was just to hurried and did not pay attention. Since it's my error, I never asked about returning it. I'll try to resell it or just donate it if I have too.
B0036TGSRG|5.0|A ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) is hired to replace a previous writer that was found waterlogged. His job is to go to a remote island and organize the memoirs of an ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan.) He suspects not all is well but it takes a few discoveries to determine that there is more to the memoirs than just names and dates.  He may not be an invective reporter but he is too nosy to let it go. What he cannot let go of could very well mean his life. Then again, maybe it will all work out for the best. We get to discover the layers of mystery together with the ghostwriter. We also get to tell him to \\"stay in the car\\" but does he ever listen.<br /><br />The movie is formula and politically charged. Yet we get to enjoy the suspense without a lot of blood and gore, no excess of explicative's or over cranked chase scenes. Roman Polanski seems to have mellowed out in his old age. Watching the movie, a second time will reveal the clues that were not blatant or masked.<br /><br />I like the review of old actors in this presentation. I was surprised to see Eli Wallach. Aside from Kim Cattrall's accent, she was believable.  Once Pierce Brosnan left those bond movies he also has become pretty good and fit the part in this film. I first became aware of Ewan McGregor from \\"Angels & Demons\\" then I remember seeing him around in a retroactive since; He can make expressions that speak better than words.<br /><br />I only saw the Blue-Ray version so I cannot comment on other versions. I did find the documentary: The Ghost Writer: Fiction or Reality. Useful in sorting out the writer from the director, from the book.
B000002KHB|4.0|I'm very happy with this cd and believe it or not used to listen to the 8-track of this music. Viet Nam was going strong and the country was in an uproar. this album reflects that in it's music. Thanks for bringing it back to an old rocker.
B00000DOYL|4.0|Bonham died, so this is how the recording career of Led Zeppelin ended.  I think this album was the most un-Zeppelin like of all their albums, even more so than Led Zeppelin III (which I like).  This album was kind of transitional in the sense that it was hard rock, yet new areas were being explored at the same time that pointed toward the mellow, poppish side.<br /><br />The album starts out well, with In The Evening.  I like John Paul Jones' work on this song, especially the very beginning of the song.  Then we get poppish with South Bound Saurez, then Fool In The Rain.  We get even more experimental with Hot Dog.  Wow.  Then another experimental song follows, the ten-minute-plus Carouselambra.  This is a great song that has a unique and fast carousel sound to it and the middle section is cool with the heavy guitar work of Jimmy Page.  We get even more poppish (and mellow) with All My Love.  The seventh and final track is the slow-moving, yet hard I'm Gonna Crawl.  Robert Plant's vocals are great on this song.<br /><br />My two favorite songs are In The Evening and the ten-minute Carouselambra.<br /><br />Overall, a solid album but certainly not Zep's best and not vintage Led Zeppelin.
1603420398|5.0|I am a crocheting newbie. I find a pattern and always get stuck at one small command and can't finish.

B0039TD7PY|5.0|I was totally satisfied.    Great service, price and delivery.    The only improvement would have been if there was no shipping charge.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|The photography in this series is, as everyone on earth has noted, spectacular, and many scenes capture things not seen before or rarely depicted. But the glory of the images only shows by contrast how weak the script is. In fact, calling it \\"weak\\" is being too kind. It's moronic. Each episode takes on some huge topic, thereby ensuring that only the most broad statements can be applied. We learn, for example, that rivers flow into lakes or the ocean--something that my daughters knew when they were four years old. Except for very rare instances, there are very few sections that are focused or detailed enough to provide any substantial information. Worse still, such information as there is is riddled with errors. In just one episode--on fresh water--the film claims that the Grand Canyon has been formed by the carving action of the Colorado River, when in fact much of the canyon's formation was from other rivers, rain, and wind. In the same episode, it claims that the fresh water seals of Lake Baikal are the only ones in the world, when in fact there are several others, including one species in Canada. And then there's the more indirect issue of how predators are presented: always as evil, frightening creatures, rather than seeing them as a necessary and natural part of the larger system. It's a shame, really, because photography this ravishing deserves a script and narration of equal quality. I would still recommend this series to people for that photography, but I would recommend either watching with the sound off, or, if you want to watch with your kids, use it as an exercise in fact checking and research--have them double-check everything the film says; that way, they might actually learn something.
0385504225|1.0|Very disappointing.  I've read all of Dan Brown's books, and while The Lost Symbol wasn't the worst of them, it definitely wasn't anywhere near the best, either.  It lacks the cohesiveness of The Da Vinci Code, and the drama feels forced.  He's great at pulling together random and esoteric bits of information into a probable explanation, but this time too much of his information is not only improbable, it's patently false.<br />Save your money and go read The Da Vinci Code again.
B002Q4TKAO|5.0|As a pretty killers fan I can tell you that this an awesome DVD. I've been to a concert and although it wasn't the one on the DVD it reminded me of the amazing time that I had. You will be singing along and having a great time jamming out to all the songs. I highly recommend this DVD. LONG LIVE THE KILLERS!
B002ITB3PM|5.0|This is funny stuff and both my husband and I enjoy watching it.  You love the charactors and the funny, odd things that happens within each episode.  It is fairly clean, original, clever, and of course, awesome!
B000062XFG|4.0|Who doesn't like Star Trek TNG. Any Sci-fi fan loves the series as much as they love the other great sci-fi series. This item is the complete second season DVD set. It contains all the episodes plus some extras on the last disk such as development, episode ideas, cast comments, and many other things.     The complete second series dvd box is compact and tight, fitting in any DVD case with similiar products. I did   have a slight problem with the layout of the second season box. Its a dual foldout box, strangely designed and not   that sturdy. It holds the dvd's in with the basic plastic center plug (its not a sleave box) and they are tight and secure. The design of the dual foldout box makes simply picking a episode dvd annoying. Instead of just opening the   box and picking your dvd, you have to unfold it all the way first then pick it, then fold it back. Bad design.     But overall who cares about the box. The episodes are great, the show is great, and the quality of the episodes were great.     As a last note, when you want to buy the seasons or complete seasons of Star Trek TNG, make sure to do your homework with pricing. Many times the individual seasons are cheaper than the complete set, and sometimes they are not. When I purchaced the individual seasons seperately they were 35 dollars each, about 100 dollars cheaper than   buying the complete boxed set. And I see currently the individual seasons are 50 dollars each. So watch your prices and buy smart.

0765356147|3.0|The finale just stretched on and on, and then it ended rather ridiculously. I wasn't satisfied at all. Not a terrible book, but the worst of all the Sanderson books I've read so far.
068485743X|5.0|This book was exactly what I needed and couldn't find elsewhere.   Generalisations about certain author backgrounds aside, (journalist- and academic-turned novelists), Mr Lukeman explains in a step by step, easy to understand format how to produce excellent novels.    He uses the premise that each writer has certain failings that have been preventing them from success. Never does he claim that every failing outlined in the book is made by every writer. With that in mind, you can skim through some chapters with the happy feeling that yes, at least you are getting that part right. Then just when you think that, wow, your writing is pretty good actually, he hits on another topic that you realise you need to work at.    The book is produced in the USA for an American audience. I therefore ignored some of his comments about literary agents which don't really apply to small markets that have few, if any, agents around.    The examples he uses are unashamedly hyperbolic. Some reviews have criticised these. I am of two minds about them. They really drum in the point, so you are in no doubt as to what he means. Isn't that the purpose of examples? On the other hand, a more subtle example, would in each case be more comparable to realistic manuscripts, and indeed help us work out if our own work is nearly there or not.    Mr Lukeman has also written the excellent book, \\"The Plot Thickens\\", which delves heavily into characterisation, and is in a workbook style. In \\"The First Five Pages\\", he shows that he is also a king of dialogue.    If you use the advice given, to polish the first five pages of your manuscript, then you may get a second look from the publishers. It would be a mistake to stop there though. The advice in this book follows through to the very last page of your manuscript. This is not a book on how to write. It is a book on how to rewrite.
0393075966|1.0|Don't expect the adage \\"From Whom is Given Much, Much is Expected\\" to apply to the content of this book.  A Noble prise does not confirm that a good book is written.    Dr. Stiglitz starts by blaming the Bush administration, moves on to praising the Obama campaign since they relied on his policies, and then to the failure of the Obama administration for not following his recommendations.  This alone is enough to indicate that we are dealing with ego rather than rational thinking.    He touts Keynesian policies where spending government money generates more private industrial revenue and resulting taxes to more than offset government spending.  Even as late as 7/10, this hasn't happened.  This theory does not translate into practice.      He blames most everything on 'big bad banks' while not acknowledging the small businesses taking mortgage applications with little regard for ethics, and he doesn't lay any responsibility on government mandates that insist on providing loans to those who can't repaid the loans.  These mandates are created to be 'fair', but the result is anything but fair to our society.    Net, do not expect this book to provide a balanced view on reality.  If you have a 'progressive' view and want to support your position then by all means read this book.  For all the others at the center of the spectrum, don't bother wasting your time with this book.

0393072231|4.0|With \\"The Big Short\\", Michael Lewis returns to Wall Street 21 years after [[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]], his hilarious memoir of bond-trading at Salmon Brothers in the 1980s. Lewis captured the aggressive culture of bond trading 25 years ago, and he tries to do it again for the culture of arcane, opaque derivatives run amok in the 2000s. \\"The Big Short\\" isn't as good as \\"Liar's Poker\\", perhaps because Lewis was not present himself this time, and perhaps because books that educate, satirize, and philosophize about the financial industry are no longer new. But I laughed out loud a few times, and \\"The Big Short\\" is better-written than Gregory Zuckerman's \\"The Greatest Trade Ever\\", which covers similar territory. Both books chronicle the experiences of a few of the fewer than 20 funds or individuals who managed to short the housing bubble using credit default swaps (CDS).<br /><br />Michael Lewis got the scoop on crusading hedge fund manager Steve Eisman of FrontPoint Partners, hedge fund manager Mike Burry of Scion Capital, the first to short subprime mortgages, and the trio of Charlie Ledley, Jamie Mai, and Ben Hockett, who call themselves Cornwall Capital and trade their own money. [[ASIN:0385529910 The Greatest Trade Ever]] follows the strategies of John Paulson and his analyst Paolo Pelligrini, Mike Burry, hedge fund upstart Andrew Lahde, Jeffrey Greene, and Greg Lippman of Deutsche Bank, the man who standardized the CDS contract and encouraged everyone who would listen to short subprime mortgage bonds. \\"The Big Short\\" talks about Lippman tangentially, but I don't think Lewis actually interviewed him. So the two books are redundant on Mike Burry and some of the background of CDOs and CDS contracts.<br /><br />Burry was an exceptionally talented stock-picker with one eye and some neurological issues who won his bets but suffered personally from the subprime CDS ordeal, so he makes a good story. It's not surprising that two books have told it or that he would not give any author exclusivity. But \\"The Big Short\\" is the more polished and enjoyable read, and I found it clearer on some of the finer points of CDS contracts, such as why, ultimately, it was so cheap to insure CDOs that were virtually guaranteed to be worthless. \\"The Big Short\\" is not comedic on the whole, but Lewis' talent for absurdist humor comes through in his description of the Cornwall Capital guys' adventures at the 2007 American Securities Forum in Las Vegas. There is also some good stuff on why Morgan Stanley got caught holding the bag and the origins of the CDS contract. If you love great trading stories, read Zuckerman's book too, but I rate \\"The Big Short\\" a little higher.exclusivity.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|We were all waiting for secrets to be revealed, but they weren't.  The ones they did reveal were lame.  This was the worst finale I have ever watched.  It ranked up there with the final episode of Seinfeld.      I'm hoping this was all just a sick joke and the real final episode will be coming out soon.  I can't wait to see it.
B003HKN51Q|4.0|I am a fan and wondered when a Elvis concert blue-ray was going to be released. Unless you want the book I would buy the DVD. The blue-ray looks about the same as the DVD. There are no extras. It's just the movie. Not impressed. I bought both movies. This is still worth buying. I enjoyed it. It's just the quality isn't there.
B003O85W3A|3.0|I love the first two Arcade Fire albums but I think they slipped a little here. This album seems to lack the passion and brilliance of their first two records. Most of the album just drones away without any real spark or excitement. The song The Suburbs is a great catchy song with some thoughtful lyrics and it's almost too bad that they put it at the top of the album.<br />For any average band this would a fairly good album but for a great band like Arcade Fire it just doesn't cut it.
B002ZG9846|4.0|great movie, alot better than i expected.  visual quality for blu-ray in 1080p (on ps3) is very poor, so much grain it distracted me from the flick, over and over. got half-way thru movie, did a ps3 firmware update, not any better, lowered my sharpness setting to 0, became tolerable. too bad, too, i would call this movie a triumph for all involved. not too different from the comics, except to see its now a screenplay/script, and its truly kick-ass.   insert from lionsgate in bd pack says a firmware update may be needed, and they manufacture their bd's to the highest quality standards, in short, its your blu-ray players fault this movie looks crappy, not ours, thanks lionsgate. why warn me, unless the problem came from your end? i did my firmware update, and it still looks crappy. in the end, great movie, it looks like a budget flick rushed to blu-ray tho. what a shame.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|This cd/dvd combo is great.     The Cant be Tamed CD is way way better than the critics will have you believe.     Before  its release Miley described the Cant be tamed album as a pop record and summer music and a bit of everything which is exactly what it is. If you don't like Cant be Tamed as a single you will find a lot more tracks on this cd to like as Cant be tamed is really not typical of the other tracks.    Standout tracks are Liberty walk,  Who owns my heart, Permanent December, Every Rose has its thorn, Robot and My heart beats for love but all the tracks are good and what you like most at each listening will depend on your mood.    For those of us that missed the O2 concert, the DVD is great and you can watch it or listen to the cd and dvd many times and still come back for more. You get all the Miley classics (Breakout, 7 things, Fly on the wall, Start all over, See you again), some Hannah Montana The Movie stuff (Hoedown Throwdown, Let's get Crazy, The Climb) plus many tracks from the Time of our Lives cd and the best song of the concert - I love rock and roll.    So the verdict is: Great work Miley - really good - 5 stars. How about a Rock in Rio concert dvd next?
0143118420|5.0|I have to admit, when I first started reading this book I did not like it.  I wondered what the big deal was.  I found the beginning to be overly repetative and negative.  But, once I got to Italy, I started to fall in love with the book.  India was my favorite chapter.  Bali just sounded beautiful.  For me this book entered my life at a critical time and I found comfort in what Elizabeth Gilbert was sharing.  I found this book to be enocuraging and inspiring.  When I finished the book I was dissapointed because I no longer had it to read.  I strongly recommend this book.
B003O85W3A|3.0|Oh Arcade Fire, how you disappoint me. After the fantastic Neon Bible, you have given us The Suburbs. For me it's not lyrically where this album fails, it's musically. The majority of the songs tend to have the same tempo and sound to them, with a few exceptions of course, one being The Sprawl II, which is fantastic(and possibly one of the best songs this year. Some other key tracks are Half light II, Suburban War and We Used To Wait. All these songs I love, and wish the rest of the album would have followed suit. And than we have The Month of May, which for me seems completley out of place on this album. It sounds like Arcade Fire covering Queens Of The Stoneage, who I love, but it just doesn't work for me on this album. Don't get me wrong I don't hate this album, it's just that they are capable of so much more, and hopefully that will be delivered on their fourth album.

B002ZG997M|5.0|This is a remarkable film. I thought the casting was excellent. Denzel, again, does an amazing job. Gary Oldman is creepy/scary/funny and crazy as always. As I read in another review, it does seem like Jennifer Beals hasn't aged a day since Flashdance. The way the Hughes Bros (Dead Presidents, From Hell) shot this film was very entertaining. Made you feel like you were there. It does have a spiritual meaning in it as well, but if you aren't very spititual yourself, it isn't overwhelming, and you can still really enjoy this film. The sound editing and special effects are pretty awesome. All in all, a very well done film.
B003L45JLW|3.0|Musically, this is great and the DTS sound is excellent. The frustation is that it should have been better. They could have added some video content to each song's page, at least lyrics that come in the booklet. Perhaps audio commentary from Petty on the song's creation, maybe some live video of the band in the studio recording it. Something other than a static screen of who plays what on the tune. Considering that all you get is excellent audio, this is severly lacking in extras and is expensive to boot, almost twice as much as the regular audio disc. If the Blu Ray audio format is going to survive, it has to be priced reasonably and include more than just good audio to justify the extra dollars.
B002MHTHQ2|5.0|This album puts all the gutsy Ray Charles big band work onto one disc,a lot of loud exciting jazz
B00000637V|5.0|Reed takes on a journey through a love relationship that starts our wonderfully before turning into a nightmare. It's depressing yet beautifully done. Not a CD one listens to a lot, but when you're in the right mood, it is easy to appreciate how excellently it captures what real life can really be like.
B001E95ZI8|5.0|This is  a \\"Feel Good\\" comedy. It came on HBO one morning that I happened to be off work and I was bored so I decided to give it a shot. I didn't have any expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was awesome !!! My boyfriend and I both loved it. Our kind of humor, great cast and story line. It had us laughing out loud. It's great for teens and adults of any age. We're between 30 and 40 (:  We both felt great and even found ourselves laughing the next day thinking about scenes from the movie. I'm buying it today so the rest of my family including my son can watch it because I know they will LOVE IT !!!
B000I0QKDS|5.0|I saw Beck perform this album live with his \\"new singer\\" (Rod Stewart) in 1968 or 1969 at the Fillmore West. My friend and I were high on acid at the time, and thus when Stewart came out looking like he does and sounding like he does, we were both convinced it was Phyllis Diller! It was hilariously stupid of us, but after a couple songs, we didn't care who was singing as the music was so great.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is Beck's best album ever. I'm not a real fan of Stewart, liking him only here and there, but on this CD, his voice brilliantly compliments Beck's raging guitar work. Their egos were not clashing at that point, After this CD, they did \\"Beck-Ola,\\" which is good but a bit disappointing after \\"Truth.\\"<br /><br />The remastering on this CD is surprisingly good.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie was highly recommended by two teenagers, respectively 18 and 20 years old, so we decided to watch it together.    The movie is about a diverse group of high school students who have committed infractions and are brought together to serve an 8 hour - Saturday detention.     Featured are: Emilio Estevez who plays the role of the athlete, Jud Nelson who plays a troubled young man, Ally Sheedy as a rather strange young woman, beautiful and popular girl played by Molly Ringwald and a rather intelligent \\"nerd\\" played by Anthony Michael Hall.    As the day unfolds, these young people start communicating, breaking the social barriers that set them apart and we see how the personalities surface as they share the issues of each particular family.    The movie is excellent. It made us consider how dissimilar people brought together can identify similarities and become, if not friends, accepting of each other. Would highly recommend watching with teenagers as the movie works these personalities through the age where transformation into adulthood is taking place.     After the movie we discussed this drama and gained insight on how the play was perceived by the group.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Dont listen to the haters, and ask yourself why you invested 6 years of your life on Lost.  Was it because you REALLY needed to know how the Hanso Foundation got a hold of the ship log of the Black Rock that Charles Widmore procured at the auction in S4?  Or was it because the writers of Lost created an amazing group of compelling yet flawed characters that we wanted to see redeemed?  Look, I get it; half the show was the mystery and mythology of this strange place, the Island.  What WAS it?  The Garden of Eden, complete with a snake-like smoke monster?  The Cradle of Life?   A fulcrum in space-time?  The fact is the build up was always going to bigger than any tangible explanation the writers could offer, so in a way, the mystery of this amazing place will endure as an allegorical construct to which each viewer will interpret their own way.   Any moderately capable writer could set up a relatively intriguing premise to catch your interests, but without great character writing or amazing casting...this initial interest would quickly evaporate (\\"V\\" and \\"Fast Forward\\" quickly come to mind.)  The story was ALWAYS about the characters.  In the finale, the characters' resolution was more emotionally poignant that I could've imagined.  Ending where it began, with Jack and Vincent, with the mantra of the show echoing in my head,  \\"Live Together or Die Alone\\"......brilliant!    To all the sci-fi haters pissed that every little wormhole or flux-capacitor wasn't  explained, and who never understood that this first and foremost was a story about lost souls taking a  journey of redemption....look on the bright side; I hear there's a new Starcraft game for you to geek-out on.
1573229725|5.0|Wonderful book, delivered on time and no bends scratches or tears at all. One of the best lesbian fiction stories there are out there. Good to buy someone who is discovering who they are, help them get over that hump. Thank you!
B003OF3R0S|3.0|City Of Evil's success has led to the sad downfall of another group with so much potential. Now they are merely what their label wants them to be and that's not metal, like they were on City Of Evil or before. Yeah there are some heavy tracks on here still, like \\"Nightmare\\", \\"Welcome To The Family\\", \\"Natural Born Killer\\", and \\"God Hates Us\\". Even of the best track on the disc, \\"Save Me\\" has some heaviness to it. \\"Dangerline\\" starts out alright, but ends horribly. However, the rest of the disc suffers from the groups alter ego, which reared its ugly head on their last cd. I don't mind some mellower music. In fact most of what I own is mellower than what Avenged Sevenfold USE to be. However the mix of the two styles here, just doesn't do it for me. If you want to throw in a slow track for good measure, fine, but when half the disc is slow and depressing, it's hard to stay interested. Especially when this is suppose to be a metal group. Overall, if the four slow songs had been more like the tracks mentioned, and then \\"Buried Alive\\" been the sole slower track, the cd would have been great. It's not though, therefore it's only OK. Hopefully this isn't how these guys stay, but I have a feeling it will be and that means I won't be buying the full version of their next disc, only the heavier tracks.

0894803123|5.0|Great book!  I was surprised to find out that it was published in 1987 but the recipes are timeless.  I was also surprised to find that it includes an interesting and enjoyable history of how Ben & Jerry came to be such successful ice cream makers!  An average cookbook will just list ingredients and how to mix and process them. This book goes way beyond that and should be on the shelf of anyone who wants to make GREAT home-made ice cream!
1400064287|4.0|Excellent, well-researched examples of what really makes an idea stick. I read a copy from 2008 and the concepts of what makes an idea stick is as relevant now as it was 2 years ago--and it will continue to be a worth-while read years from now. Made to Stick isn't just a compilation of opinion; it's backed with the years of post-grad research that both Heath brothers produced from their work in the last 10-15 years.

0061914177|3.0|I got a copy via Wishlist Products promotion and it's a good, down-to-earth and fast read. Gary is a enthusiastic and practical guy who gets to the nitty gritty FAST. Vaynerchuk fans will appreciate that. I found the writing style (written with a ghostwriter) to more like a one-sided conversation -- it sounds like book was dictated and transcribed. He has an interesting story, but this book doesn't have any new, eye-opening concepts. Considering Gary's style, the audiobook may be a better, more entertaining option as he records it himself.
0375846735|2.0|I enjoyed both the first and second books. By comparison, the \\"Amber Spyglass\\" is inferior - almost amateurish in its storytelling. There are several story lines that are not resolved satisfactorily. The conclusion is hardly as epic as the earlier story hyped it up to be. The connections to Eve and rebirth are tenuous at best. One can sort of see what Pullman was attempting, but it just did not work out. It's almost as if a different author wrote this book.    If this had been the first book, I would have given up reading the rest of the trilogy on the spot.
193413712X|3.0|The conceit of the book is the stream of consciousness that passes through the head of a somewhat (but not entirely) delirious old man who is dying of kidney failure. In author Paul Harding's hands, the tale that results is both fascinating and problematic. The same thing that makes it fascinating, makes it problematic. The dying man, George, remembers his father, Howard. Fine. But then, George reminisces about his grandfather, a man who went off the deep end and vanished into an asylum when Howard was a youngster. What George reminisces about is Howard's early memories. Howard himself had fled from George's household when George was a youngster. The reminiscences are certainly fascinating but the logical disconnect that these thoughts could not be in George's head in the first place is hard to get over.    The other problem that I found in this book is that, on occasion, I found it very overwritten. I found myself wanting to say: \\"Knock it off, already!\\" Such sections had little to do with George's stream of consciousness, frequently serving more as a diversion from and impediment to the flow of the book.    When I finished the book, I thought back on Harding's unusual mechanism for constructing this tale and concluded that somewhere through the creation process, he became much more interested in Howard than George but had the awkward commitment to George. Howard might well have made a better book.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This movie was way better then I expected.  I definitely see this as the next cult favorite along the lines of Army of Darkness.    Watch it.
0060527986|5.0|The saying should be, possibly could be, if you read one Cohello, you will read them all. Not true. Not yet anyway.        I have just started back reading his books recently. I started with \\"By The River Piedra I Sat and Wept\\", a story of forgiveness and now reading again, as with this story, Warrior of the Light, I am mesmorized. His writing is trememdous. A person who wants to write would do well to read Cohello as a good example. Simple, artistic and easy to understand and digest. I highly recomend Warrior of the Light as a guide to face each day by. Spiritual, yet non preachy, guiding, but not dragging you into a lifestyle you wouldn't wish for anyway. Wonderful words of wisdom. So far I reccomend both these stories as must reads.
0762434279|3.0|I did not expect the book to be that miniature.  It really is.  It will make a perfect gift for a 2 year old that can actually read.  I like the fact that the book summarizes the CRITICAL POINTS and in short the take home message.  If you just want to skip over the many details then buy this.
B0000029LG|5.0|As another reviewer has stated, Amazon editorialist Steven Mirkin is way off the mark. Disc 2 (Side 2) is an amazing album within itself. Michael's song writing was stronger than ever during this period and he's absolutely at the very top of his game.. I totally recommend this album for any pop music fan.. essential and will most definitely go down in history!
B000002AHM|5.0|I saw them on tour in Chicago in the most amazing concert ever. The cd brings back great memories of these virtuosos. Wow. 10 stars.
B003F5WOEC|4.0|This album is simultaneously classic and modern, mellow and intense, rock and blues.  Even the packaging maintains this contradictory pattern being both the simplest album artwork I have ever seen and the coolest.  The music is beautiful swampy blues-rock and showcases some of the best songwriting and musicianship I've heard from a modern band.  Like another reviewer wrote, this album is mellow, but it also has an undeniable soulful intensity. It's also worth mentioning that this album rewards vinyl lovers with great packaging including a poster and a copy of the CD -- the mp3 crowd will definitely miss some of the charm of this album.  So, why only 4-stars?  The songs, and the packaging are both definitively 5-star, but the album looses a star for offering no journey and limited variety: it's a collection of great songs, but unlike Blond on Blond, Dark Side of the Moon, and Music from Big Pink, for example, this music doesn't gain anything from full-album listening.  If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.  But, you should get this album and get it on vinyl -- this is one of the rare modern releases that feels like it was made to be heard on vinyl.
B002ZG983M|1.0|First, let me say that I had seen the movie and liked it so much so that I decided to buy the DVD for my collection. Unfortunately the disk would freeze for 3-15 minutes every time it changed chapters. I tried polishing the disk but to no avail. It was simply unwatchable. The disk (not the movie) doesn't even deserve the single star I gave it. If I can give you one piece of advice it would be to not make the mistake I did: I tossed the box so I could store the disk in my DVD wallet, rendering it non-returnable.     Please, if anyone else has had a similar problem with this disk please speak up. This is too good a movie to be treated so shoddily.
B002BWP4A6|2.0|A pretentious film from the haughty but occasionally interesting Austrian art filmmaker Michael Haneke (Hidden/Cache, for instance, was a fine if unsubtle movie about the profound guilt that westerners should feel for being successful, a common theme from the director). Filmed in a delicate black and white, The White Ribbon takes place in a small German town in the immediate period before World War I. Through a number of mysterious violent acts occurring in the village, Haneke wants to show the hypocrisy of a society rigidly stratified by class. Haneke refuses either to give a clear explanation of these acts (though they turn out to be carried out by children of the community) or to follow a clear narrative line. These make the movie more irritating than surprising (though there always will be snobs that will claim that we are in front of a masterpiece), Some reviewers have claimed the movie to be some sort of metaphor for the birth of National Socialism (with the children supposedly turning into Nazis 25 years later), but there is really nothing here about this. Boring and disappointing.
0679809015|5.0|We've been reading this book to our 9 month old for nearly 3 months now & he loves it.  It's often the first book he'll pick up when he digs into his books.  He'll sit & look at it by himself for long periods of time & it keeps his attention the entire time we read it to him.    I was a little unsure of it when we first got it because it is so small, but it's the perfect size for his little hands.  He is not yet able to open the flaps himself, but loves to push them up when we release them for him.    A must have!
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|I usually like Brit humor, but this movie just wasn't funny at all.  Very bad script.  I found it tedious and boring.  A lot of scenes went on for too long. (I fast-forwarded through some of them.)  The gross-out stuff is better left to Americans.  It seemed like the actors were uncomfortable with the material and I felt sorry for them.  I lasted maybe an hour and gave up.  I'm sorry I wasted a Netflix rental on crap like this.  I think I'll skip the USA remake.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|After seeing how the cows and other animals are treated on mass production farms, better conditions are needed.  Conditions need to get better not only because the current method of production is inhumane, but also we need more more wholesome and safer food.    However, grass-fed ribeye steak is currently $19.99 - $27.99 per pound.  How can I afford that?    So there's a balance between mass production food and price.  Nevertheless, I'll be eating organic grass-fed beef, and if I can only afford grass-fed ground beef, so be it.  But we need to vote for healthier and more humane food through our purchases.    By the way, most people only think of \\"organic\\".  There's a few more things that we need to think about as consumers of food:    1.  Organic (this only means that non-organic pesticides and fertilizers are **reduced**)  2.  Locally grown  3.  Non-GMO   4.  Non-irradiated  5.  Grass or pasture fed, if meat  6.  Country of origin (food from some countries is allowed to be labelled as \\"organic\\" based solely on the farmer's word, without independant third party certification!)
1579128149|5.0|Could there be a book whose cover is strikingly more brilliantly colorful than its jacket? \\"The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe,\\" by Theodore Gray and Nick Mann, is such a book. And the cover is but the beginning, as one shall see.<br /><br />Author Gray's epigraph is telling, and very much surprising in that the quotation is by Lucretius, from \\"De Rerum Natura,\\" in 50 B.C.: \\"There is not anything which returns to nothing, but all things return dissolved into their elements.\\" And Lucretius couldn't possibly have known even the half of it.<br /><br />Gray is light-hearted and approachable for the beginner, while at the same time able to be appreciated by the scientist and advanced technician. The book is good-sized. Right off the bat, Gray likeably says, \\"If you have a foot, please don't drop this book on it.\\" More seriously, he adds, \\"This property of indivisibility is what makes an element an element.\\"<br /><br />He also presents more serious cautions as to what one might or might not try to do with certain of the elements. You wouldn't want to blow yourself up! He says that chemistry is \\"powerful enough to do great things in the world, but also dangerous enough to do terrible things just as easily. If you don't respect it, chemistry bites.\\"<br /><br />The book shows a sample of successive elements on the even-numbered pages, in beautifully printed 10-inch by 10-inch full-color photographs, against black backgrounds. The facing odd-numbered pages have in each instance more color photos, interesting write-ups, and technical details.<br /><br />Since the elements are known in part by their abbreviations, atomic numbers, and places in the Periodic Table, Mr. Gray clearly discusses the Table on his first few pages, explaining the columns, rows, and groupings, before advancing to the left-right pairs of pages devoted to the individual elements. As a preface, he says that \\"we're ready to start our journey through the wild, beautiful, up-and-down, fun, and terrifying world of the elements.\\"<br /><br />He closes the book with words about his joy in collecting elements, a picture of himself with a small fraction of his collection, a helpful index, along with a full-color fold-out (actually a removable poster) of the elements and their photos. Mr. Gray is seated at his Wooden Periodic Table Table (a clever name play), which he himself crafted, since he is also a highly accomplished woodworker. His website gives access to many more photos of his collections and of his woodworking shop and projects. A most interesting fellow.<br /><br />Theodore Gray's \\"The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe\\" presents the entire Periodic Table. Appropriately enough, it is far pretty enough to find a place on anyone's Coffee Table. Beyond a feast for the eyes, the book is also a feast for the mind.

B00005QGAV|5.0|If Michael Jackson wasn't great before this album he was after making this. Like Thriller and Bad it's full of hits and brilliant songs. They all well written and up there with the best albums around, because there's no album fillers. Like all top class album's all songs could be singles, of which most off them are top 10 hits. It is different to his previous albums but is the change of direction his career needed and with that he ended up with another great album.
B001HN69B8|1.0|This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It is truly unfortunate that the great Heath Ledger will always be remembered as having this turd for his last role rather than the outstanding Joker.<br /><br />I had wandered into this film hoping for something in the line of the brilliant Stardust.  Unfortunately, this is more on a par with Death Race, if it was directed by Uwe Boll, that is.  There are several ugly and distasteful characters thrown at you from the start, but fortunately they are left completely undeveloped so we are spared their story.  It appears that the film is more based upon trippy visuals than any kind of actual story line.<br /><br />There is some muddled bit about bets with the devil to steal souls, or something like that.  I found I didn't care for long, and you likely won't either.<br /><br />After 41 minutes of this utter crap, we gave up.<br /><br />As a side note, the disk is extraordinarily annoying.  It INSISTS on running with BD Live, so you can access behind the scenes info while teh movie drones on.  You have to actually allow it to do this, then cancel and re-start the movie to get out of it.  STUPID!
0393072231|5.0|Whether it is baseball, high school football or Wall Street - Michael Lewis is able to string together a compelling non-fiction narrative. He is probably among the best and most consistent non-fiction writers working today. He was able to take a very dry and very complex financial discussion and elevate it into a page-turner that kept me reading late into the night. As with every book of his I came away with a feeling of understanding and knowledge which I otherwise wouldn't have gained.<br /><br />His strength is layering facts, people and emotions into a tale that makes complete sense when read but in real life wasn't nearly so tidy. Definitely worth your time - read it sooner rather than later. You won't be disappointed.

068484267X|4.0|I'm an avid reader, and after much critical and popular acclaim, I read Angela's Ashes, and was not disappointed.  By now most people know what the story is about.  I for one didn't love the style in which it was written, almost as a stream of consciousness, with not much use for puncutation and I found that distracting at first.  It written in the first person present tense, which I agree with other reviews gives the reader the notion that this is happening now, and the events are described to you through the eyes and voice of this child.    I came away with the impression that Angela is the reluctant hero in the boy's eyes.  She was not, it seemed to be, a mother who moved mountains with her sheer will and determination for her family, but rather she did what had to be done, knowing there was noone else who would do it besides her, since her husband was an alcoholic who could not keep down a job for very long and drank what little money he made.  I found curious the comment that young Frankie made about how they may not have had enough money to buy a little food, but that \\"Mam always had her\\" cigarettes.  I also found it interesting that Frankie didn't make similar comments about his father.  He speaks of his father as if he understands he is a broken man, and that he doesn't mean to disappoint his family, that he doesn't intentionally do the things he does.  Frankie reminisces fondly of the time he spends with his father on his lap, listeneing to his very imaginative stories, or spending time with him early in the morning before everyone else gets up, so he has his father all to himself.  He never speaks of his mother that way, and I wonder why.  Is it because he knows his mother is too consumed with misery and worry over where their next barely adequate meal will come from, where the rent money will come from, to be able to enjoy such moments with her children?  I suppose that's what we are meant to infer.  I didn't appreciate the ending, the not knowing what happens to his mother and his brothers after Frankie leaves for America.  It seemed rather abrupt the way the novel ended, with him saving enough money for his boat trip to America.  We don't know what becomes of him afterwards, but i suppose that's so we will buy the next book 'Tis.    All in all, I did enjoy this memoir.  It is an uplifting story, one that should make 90% of us in this country hug our children closer and thank God in Heaven that we didn't share Frank McCourt's background.

0307454541|2.0|I'm sorry but I gotta go with the negative reviewers on this one. This is a real mess of a book. It's greatest failing isn't that it's central, most interesting character, Lisbeth Salander, is relegated to a supporting role next to Mikael Blomkvist, the world's most boring sleuth since Jack Webb in the old Dragnet series. No, its worst failing is that it is over two thirds of the way through. It often happens that authors begin stories they have no idea how to finish. So they end up tacking on a conclusion that more times than not fails all that precedes it.<br /><br />Here, the mystery is solved, the murderer identified (He's is a real snoozer too by the way) only to be discarded along with the entire murder mystery plot of the first two thirds of the book just so the author can bring forward the Blomkvist vindication subplot with its attendant back-story baggage which had been dragging the story down from the beginning. By that time I'd had it with the annoying little milksop and didn't much care if he got vindicated or not.<br /><br />Where is Lisbeth, I kept asking?  Well, the pathologically introverted though brilliant sociopath - never comfortable with unfamiliar places or unfamiliar people - suddenly turns super con woman and hatches an elaborate bank fraud scam that has her jetting across Europe in designer clothes, speaking perfect Oxford English. Yeah, she's really smart and all. I get it. But come on. This isn't an ending. It's an underdeveloped hacker short story loosely stapled to the end of an unfinished mystery novel. Hackneyed is not too strong a word for this. Neither is anticlimactic, incongruous, or hamfisted.<br /><br />If you are interested in this book, take my advice. Skip it and rent the movie - the Swedish one. Yes, the movie shares many of the book's shortcomings, pig's ears being what they are and all. But Noomi Rapace makes an absolutely great Lisbeth. It's in Swedish but that doesn't matter because, trust me, reading English subtitles is less painful than reading Stieg Larrson's prose.less painful than reading Stieg Larrson's prose.

B00275EGX8|5.0|The ratings of this movie are surprisingly all over the place, so I read many reviews to try to understand why.  It appears that a major area of contention is whether this movie is sufficiently realistic.  A number of people with military experience, including some with experience in Iraq, argue that the movie is too unrealistic, but their complaints often focus on technicalities which, though not always trivial, perhaps aren't too important for the typical non-military viewer.  And there are also a number of military people who find the movie quite realistic, so it seems that the experiences of military people vary substantially.  Considering all of this, my sense is that the movie reasonably faithfully portrays at least the essence of the experiences of at least some military people, so it's accurate enough for its purpose.<br /><br />If so, I found this movie to be a powerful and riveting depiction of why \\"war is hell,\\" including \\"war\\" which is actually occupation.  On the American side, our troops face a situation where they often can't tell friend from foe, they can die very unexpectedly and suddenly, and they're constant witness to destruction and death, including the death of people who become their friends.  On the Iraqi side, they have the natural resentment, bitterness, and defiance of people who are being occupied by a foreign power.  Never before have I had a such a clear sense of why war must be avoided unless there's truly no other reasonable option.<br /><br />This leads to the issue of whether the movie has a political message.  Many reviewers have argued that it doesn't overtly have such a message, and I agree. But, at the same time, by depicting how pointless and detrimental the occupation of Iraq is, with suffering on all sides, the movie does help to clarify why we never should have gone into Iraq in the first place, and why we need to get out ASAP.  Let's remember that inspectors had already failed to find any WMDs after extensive searching, there was never any credible link between Iraq and 9/11, and there was never any credible evidence or argument showing that Iraq posed a genuine threat to the US.  By going in there, all we've done is destabilize Iraq and open the floodgates of civil war, cause a huge loss of life on all sides, expend many billions of dollars (which we obviously can't afford), and make America LESS safe.  The only parties which seem to have benefitted are the defense contractors who have made tons of money at the expense of the American public (you and me).  If we really want to \\"support our troops,\\" we need to get them out of harms way and bring them home to their families, rather than asking them to endure enormous hardships and risk their lives for a conflict which makes no sense.<br /><br />Anyway, getting back to the movie, my point is that the movie vividly illustrates the basis for my comments.  Very highly recommended.re was never any credible link between Iraq and 9/11, and there was never any credible evidence or argument showing that Iraq posed a genuine threat to the US.

B001UV4XWY|5.0|I watched Donnie Darko many years ago and I loved it. When Southland Tales came out I saw it, thought it was very well done but the story was a bit too much. This movie, The Box, has the same kind of atsmosphere and dark sci-fi surreal story as those 2 movies and the story is thought provoking. I loved it. I don,t get the bad reviews at all. If you liked Richard Kelly's previous movies, surely you will like this one too. Also recommended for fans of David Lynch.

I still ended up buying it, hoping the story would be worth it. It very much was.  Out of all my comics/graphic novels, I have read this one the most. The art is great, and the story is so good, it was written into continuity, even though it really wasn't supposed to. The hardcover also includes a quick story which is ok, but overall kind of forgetable. Definately pick this one up. You'll want to read it over and over.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|One of the best movies of 2009, \\"Invictus,\\" written by Anthony Peckham and directed by Clint Eastwood, takes us to a fascinating moment in modern history.<br /><br />It's the mid-1990s; the racist and repressive system known as Apartheid has recently been overturned in South Africa, and former political prisoner Nelson Mandela has just been elected the nation's first black president.  Tensions are running high among the Afrikaners, who fear that the majority blacks will use their new-found power to exact revenge on the white minority.  Many of the blacks, on the other hand, find it difficult and distasteful to work in tandem with a people who had degraded, oppressed and even imprisoned them for so long.<br /><br />Into this quagmire steps Mr. Mandela, a true believer in the power of redemption and reconciliation to change hearts and influence policy, who hits upon a scheme to unite the two factions through their mutual love of rugby, rallying the nation behind the team known as the Springboks, which, for the blacks, once represented all the things they despised about the Apartheid regime.  Against massive odds of both history and human nature, this amazing man manages to heal old wounds and forge a new nation based on equality and respect for all.<br /><br />Derived from the novel \\"Playing the Enemy\\" by John Carlin, \\"Invictus\\" (the title of a Victorian poem Mandela uses as a guide for his own life) could easily have been just another self-congratulatory exercise in \\"do-gooder\\" drama - but its heartfelt honesty, its accomplished direction and its world-class acting make it so much more.  Morgan Freeman gives a towering, yet carefully understated, performance as the near-saintly Mandela, a role he was clearly born to play, bringing true conviction to the moral strength, innate compassion and basic decency of a man who suffered so much at the hands of others, yet who refused to allow personal bitterness and a desire for revenge to determine the course his life - or his nation - would take.  Instead, Mandela, at great personal risk to his own popularity, used his experience to build bridges and to set his nation on a path towards healing that would allow it to take its rightful place in a modern, more enlightened world where every man is equal and where citizens work together for a common good.  Indeed, Mandela is probably the greatest argument for the Great Men Theory of history the past half century has had to offer.<br /><br />And Matt Damon, boasting a flawless South African accent, has probably never been better than he is here, playing Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springboks, who is so impressed with Mandela's continued faith in the human race despite all he's been through that he rallies his own team members (most of them white) to join with the president in playing for the glory of the new South Africa - an effort that led them to winning the Rugby World Cup in 1995.<br /><br />The beauty of \\"Invictus\\" is that it doesn't find it necessary to over-dramatize the racial tension or to indulge in ginned-up  melodramatics to get its message across.  The racism here is often of a more subtle kind - a careless word here, a thoughtless put-down there - and the movie does an expert job conveying that fact.<br /><br />Recently, I wrote that I couldn't imagine seeing a more inspiring and uplifting film than \\"Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.\\"  Well, now I've just seen one.  It's called \\"Invictus\\" - and it is not to be missed.Instead, Mandela, at great personal risk to his own popularity, used his experience to build bridges and to set his nation on a path towards healing that would allow it to take its rightful place in a modern, more enlightened world where every man is equal and where citizens work together for a common good.

Colin Firth is wonderfully cast as George, and to observe his transformation during the day of his story is a glimpse of all of as we hide behind our masks and struggle to be our real selves.

0805091742|5.0|Great read, if a bit frightening in what it reveals about the worldwide medical establishment!<br /><br />Medicine aside, Gawande's highly intelligent handling of the issue of how to address the challenges of complex work without \\"dumbing it down\\" is an important point in eliminating the causes of incredibly common yet mundane errors in many industries.<br /><br />Anyone in the business of improving performance must read this book to get the valuable insights and validation from around the world on how to best craft and use checklists.  Even people who believe they're already familiar with checklists (like myself) will learn something new -- whether it's a better way to view the role of checklists or merely a useful way to introduce the idea to users.<br /><br />The book provides clear examples of what happens when checklists don't work and why as well as what happens when checklists do work and how to make them work.  There is no room for arrogance when getting things done right equals lives on the line.  There is also no room for worrying about \\"compliance\\" when what's important is results.<br /><br />Not using checklists could mean the difference between life and death (literally).  Using checklists poorly can still cost lives and more commonly, business losses.<br /><br />This is a business book as much as it is one about \\"getting things right\\".  Getting things right is an early step in the path towards excellence.  In fact, it's one of the first steps.  And, you can't get things right if you do the \\"easy\\" stuff poorly.

0312370849|5.0|A fantastic historical fiction novel, set during the occupation of France in the earlier days of WWII.  You will be captivated from page one and experience an immediate connection with the characters and the suffering they went through during the Nazi decreed roundup of Jews in France.  While most, to this day, believe this was carried out by the Nazis, it was actually carried out by the French Vichy police.  This appalling event is a huge dark spot in France's history, and thus, not well-known, even by WWII history buffs.  With this event as the backdrop, you are drawn into the terror, panic and despair of over 13,000 Jews were arrested, packed into a stadium in the summer heat, with no food, water or adequate facilities to accommodate that many people.  Many died in that stadium and many became aware of what their ultimate fate would be, begging for the nightmare to just come to an end.  While reading about the main character's experience and that of her family and those in her community, you sense the psychological passage through the stages of grief as it becomes clear that escape from this atrocity will only be through death.  Shock of being forcibly removed from their homes; Anger at being targeted because of their religious beliefs and betrayal by their own Government's civil servants; Denial that life will not return to normal for the victims in that stadium; Acceptance that what was ahead of them was a destiny they could not change.  Though not on the scale of the Vel' d'Hiv, I couldn't help but draw upon the images of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, huddled in masses, with an inadequate supply of food, water and restroom facilities, while the Government was so slow to respond and send aid to it's desperate citizens.   This event, not one of America's finest moments.      An outstanding and a definite must read and a recommendation of  [[ASIN:0307279251 Bad Faith: A Forgotten History of Family, Fatherland and Vichy France (Vintage)]] if you want to read more about this infamous event in France's history.

0307716988|3.0|I read this book in one sitting. It's an easy read. MJ talks mostly about his professional work and the people who worked with him (Berry Gordy, Quincy Jones, etc...) and it is done in a fairly factual way.  MJ is always gracious and is generous in giving credit to everyone who helped him -- even his father.     But I didn't feel he talked about anything else.  At the end of the book, he adds some personal likes and dislikes. He touches on the effects of fame on his life.   His great friendship with Liz Taylor takes up 5 lines.  His friendship with Brooke Shields takes up less than 2 lines -- so I dont know where all the noise about how he said this and that about their relationship comes from.  Clearly, he doesnt want to reveal anything that does not have to do with his work.     So, I am glad I read it, but I didn't come away with much more information about MJ.      But I will say, that there is a gentleness that comes through in what he says and in the way it was written.        Would I recommend buying the book ?  hmmm, not so much.  Get it from the library.    And I SOOO wish MJ was still with us.
B003O85W3A|5.0|Most bands write dozens of new songs and pick the very best ones to be on their new album.  Arcade Fire is no different.  A problem I had with 'Neon Bible' is that (while it had great songs selected) musically, it lacked a unifying thread/theme--I liked to hear songs from it, but I had a hard time listening to it as one piece of work.  'Best Of' Records suffer from this...as does 'Sam's Town' but not 'Day and Age' (See Killers).  Really loved some of the B-sides from that era, like 'Broken Window'--I really think it was good enough to be on 'Neon Bible'.  IMHO 'Intervention' and 'Antichrist Television Blues' would have served better as a CD single/7\\" to tide us over during the 3 year wait between records.  (Those two just didn't seem to fit musically, even though lyrically, they do fit.)      'Suburbs'?  I love it.  Mainly for the same reasons I love 'Funeral', only I have to say that 'Suburbs' slightly surpasses 'Funeral'-- it's another mature work that ebbs and breathes, rocks and wanders with absolute balance and precision.  It repeats itself, not as in an annoying chorus over and over repetition-- the theme is reinforced by slipping the a repeated phrase into multiple songs, giving the phrase multiple contexts and conjuring different facets of meaning.  \\"First they built the road and then they built the town.\\"    What the 'White Album' had in eclecticism and style, 'Suburbs' has in theme, writing and complex beauty.  I sincerely hope it goes #1 everywhere, it's just so easy to love.    Also, if listening to 'Empty Room' doesn't absolutely thrill you, then congratulations, you must a very dulled musical palate from too much Merzbow in the 90's.  (Just kidding.)
0783225547|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3D7I3995KNLEO]]I have just two words: Pyroclastic Flow.<br /><br />  Pyroclastic flows are fluidized masses of rock fragments and gases that move rapidly in response to gravity. Pyroclastic flows can form in several different ways. They can form when an eruption column collapses, or as the result of gravitational collapse or explosion on a lava dome or lava flow (Francis, 1993 and Scott, 1989). These flows are more dense than pyroclastic surges and can contain as much as 80 % unconsolidated material. The flow is fluidized because it contains water and gas from the eruption, water vapor from melted snow and ice, and air from the flow overriding air as it moves downslope (Scott, 1989). The image on the right shows the formation of pyroclastic flows during a 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens (photo courtesy of J.M. Vallance).<br /><br />  Ignimbrites and nuees ardentes are two types of pyroclastic flows. An ignimbite contains mostly vesiculated material whereas a nuee ardente contains denser material (Francis, 1993). Nuee ardente means glowing cloud and was named for the pyroclastic flows seen at Mount Pelee. These flows were often accompanied by a cloud of ash elutriated from the flow. When the incadescent ash particles are observed at night, the flow looks like a glowing cloud moving away from the volcano.<br /><br />  Pyroclastic flows can move very fast. Small pyroclastic flows can move as fast as 10 to 30 m/s while larger flows can move at rates of 200 m/s (Bryant, 1991). Nuees ardentes have been known to extend 50 kilometers from their source and Ignimbrites, because of the lighter weight material that they carry, can extend 200 km from their source (Bryant, 1991 and Scott, 1989). At Mount Pinatubo in the Philipines, pyroclastic flow deposits were 220 m thick in some valleys but averaged 30 to 50 m thick in others (Wolfe, 1992). Pyroclastic flows have been known to top ridges 1000 m high (Bryant, 1991).<br /><br />  Pyroclastic flows can be very hot. In fact, pyroclastic flows from Mount Pelee had temperatures as high as 1075 degrees C (Bryant, 1991)! Some Pyroclastic flows from Pinatubo had temperatures of 750 degrees C and pyroclastic flows from Mount St. Helens had temperatures of 350 degrees C ( Bryant, 1991). Such high temperature flows can burn manmade structures, vegetation, and, for those unlikely enough to be caught by then, human skin.<br /><br />  Pyroclastic flows and lahars are the greatest volcanic hazards. More people have died due to these hazards than any other volcanic hazard (Chester, 1993). Pyroclastic flows can incinerate, burn, and asphyxiate people. Gases within a pyroclastic flow can explode and cause ash to rain down on nearby areas as shown in this image near Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines (photo by M.T. Dolan). Pyroclastic flows travel long distances so their threat is far reaching. What is worse is they also can transform into lahars which travel even farther distances from the volcano and can produce even greater hazards.<br /><br />  Scientists recognize the hazards of pyroclastic flows, and so there is currently a lot of research going on in this area. Important research with regard to hazards prevention is the study of past pyroclastic flow deposits. Areas that have old pyroclastic flow deposits are likely to receive new pyroclastic flow deposits if the volcano erupts again. People living near the summit of an active volcano, especially those in valley areas, are most likely to be in danger from a pyroclastic flow. The best course of action for these people to take when a volcano erupts is to evacuate valley areas and head for higher ground away from the volcano. Of course, if the volcano gives ample warning that it is going to erupt, then the best thing to do is evacuate the area and get as far away from the volcano as possible.<br />  [...]<br /><br />This knowledge alone requires the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" factor to be so incredibly high as to make this movie nearly unwatchable.
B000669GAI|4.0|In this album you'll find the best songs Pearl Jam has sung up until 2003, including YELLOW LEDBETTER, BETTERMAN, ALIVE, JEREMY, BLACK, DISSIDENT, and REARVIEW MIRROR. The two CDs actually contain two different styles of music. While the first is rock and metal, the second is mostly like country. Both CDs have good music and bad, but that's only my opinion. This album is for anyone who enjoys Pearl Jams music or anyone who wants a little of this and a little of that. My only negatives are that some of the lyrics make absolutely no sense, some are pretty spiteful, and some of the songs are downright depressing. Other than that, buy this album and rock on!
0312382464|3.0|I'll admit from the start that I read Falls the Shadow soon after The Sunne in Splendour; this book, while not bad, suffered by comparison. Besides, I can't read too much of one author too quickly without becoming annoyed by her quirks. That said, Falls the Shadow was something of a disappointment.<br /><br />First the good. As always with Penman's books, I learned a lot. I knew little about the time period and this book brought it to life. The major players are excellently drawn: Henry III, Simon de Montfort, and Nell (Henry's sister and Simon's wife) in particular. (I especially liked Nell, who's more spirited than Penman's previous heroines.) An author who's both renowned for historical accuracy and skilled at creating real people and interesting scenes out of history is a rare treasure. Finally, tics of dialogue that irked some readers in previous books (think \\"I do be tired\\" and overuse of character names) are much reduced here.<br /><br />Speaking of tics, though, brings me to the problems. Penman seems to have taken a personal dislike to the word \\"and,\\" and her preferred sentence structure began to grate on me (\\"He made a jest, laughed loudly\\"). More importantly, while Penman's books always span decades, here I really felt like it hurt the story. The Sunne in Splendour spans 27 years (not counting the six-years-later epilogue) in over 900 pages; Falls the Shadow has 575 pages to cover 36 years. Only toward the end does the story focus in enough to have several chapters set in the same year, with the result that for most of the book it's hard to keep track of the characters. Simon spends years on crusade and makes a name for himself there, but we never see a single scene of it; Simon and Nell go from meeting to declaring their undying love in all of three scenes together.<br /><br />Even worse, while Simon fought to defend the Oxford Provisions and there's much talk about his belief that kings should be responsible to the people, I still have no idea how the Provisions were meant to accomplish that. A bit more discussion of the specifics (as Welsh law is discussed in Here Be Dragons) would have helped immensely for those of us lacking extensive prior knowledge of the period. The provision that's repeatedly mentioned is keeping foreigners off the king's council; I don't know why this was important, especially to the foreign-born Simon. Thus, it was hard to care as much as I should have about the ideals he was fighting for.<br /><br />I'm of two minds when it comes to Penman's take on anti-Semitism here. On the one hand, it's to her credit that she deals honestly with a problem that's almost always ignored in medieval fiction. There are a couple of sympathetic Jewish characters, but Penman doesn't whitewash the Christian nobility, many of whom seem incapable of interacting with non-Christians without becoming violent. Still, I'm uncomfortable with Penman's use of the two token Jewish characters; besides telling us how much their lives suck, their primary purpose in the story seems to be praising London's (Christian) mayor.<br /><br />Finally, Falls the Shadow suffers from being the middle book in a trilogy, if a nontraditional one. There are scenes with Llewelyn Fawr, Joanna, and Elen which add little and seem to be present mostly due to the characters' prominence in the last book. And there are more scenes with Llewelyn the younger which also add little; we meet him as a kid and then he gains great renown off-screen, but Penman's main concern seems to be keeping track of him long enough for him to star in The Reckoning. Overall, it's not a cohesive book.<br /><br />I don't mean to discourage Penman lovers: this isn't a bad book by any means. Still, it's not her best.accomplish that.

It's bad enough that the writer's voice is a monotone, but she also sounds as though she's barely past her teen years. Not necessarily a bad thing -- except when it's being used to speak for a middle aged woman.<br /><br />What IS it with writers who refuse to relinquish control over any aspect of the book?  Don't they realize an amateurish version, even if it DOES come from the heart, dilutes or silences the message they're attempting to present?
B001UV4XWY|1.0|I rarely write movie reviews, but having just finished watching this one I felt compelled to do so. The central theme was basically stolen from a Star Trek Next Generation episode that featured a super advanced being named \\"Q\\", who decided to test the crew. Based on the test results, Q was to decide if the entire human species was to survive. Well, the idea is the same here, but the execution is simply horrible. The whole plot makes little sense, and the only part of the movie that gets the viewer's attention is the first 10 minutes. Afterwards the plot degenerates into a series of completely implausible, boring, and repetitive events. I hope that if one day we are to be \\"evaluated\\" by some whimsical supreme being, that he does not get a hold of a copy of \\"The Box\\". If he does, it will surely result in the annihilation of our species!
B003N11PZC|5.0|As a glee devotee' I was a bit disappointed w/some of the spring episodes of Season 1 -- except for this one.  Neil Patrick Harris as Shu's nemesis is a great theme, and the plot and vocals in this episode are superb.  The one disappointing thing is that their bar room rendition of Piano Man (B. Joel) is not on the CD(!), which is all the more reason to own the DVD. Enjoy.
6305531374|4.0|For twenty years, the unstoppable Michael Myers has carved his way through promiscuous teenagers for audiences' thrills and enjoyment in the Halloween franchise, though some installments were more effective at frightening its audiences than others. After Jamie Lee Curtis left the franchise to further her career, the franchise tried to make do without her. Halloween III was a failed effort to turn the series into The Twilight Zone, while Halloween 4, 5, and 6 featured Michael stalking a new familial target while killing more teenagers along the way, and they even dared to give some kind of mystical explanation to Michael's immortality. It seemed like the series had hit rock bottom.<br /><br />But then Jamie Lee Curtis, the original \\"Scream Queen\\", decided to return for a 20th anniversary film, hence the title \\"Halloween H20\\" (though some thought the title implied that Michael Myers would be stalking people underwater or on a cruise ship). Jamie thought it would be interesting to get everyone back together for one more hurrah. However, Donald Pleasence, who had lived in the role of Dr. Loomis for years, had passed away after the completion of Halloween 6, and John Carpenter declined to be involved, having washed his hands of the series long ago. Director Steve Miner, helmer of Friday the 13th Part 2, was tapped to direct instead.<br /><br />As eariler stated, Halloween H20 takes place in 1998, 20 years after Michael Myers first tried to kill his sister Laurie Strode, and the film acts as if all the sequels after Halloween II never happened, effectively becoming \\"Halloween III\\" in a sense. To avoid future attacks from her unkillable brother, Laurie changed her named and moved out to California, where she started a new life. Headmistress of a private school and the overprotective mother of a teenage son John (Josh Hartnett), Laurie is still haunted by nightmares and hallucinations of Michael. But her nightmares come true, as Michael returns once again, and Laurie must not only find the courage to protect her son, but find the strength to confront her demons and face her brother once and for all in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the film doesn't take place in Haddonfield, Illinois, but in the very summery, un-Halloween location of the Northern California hills instead, but it makes a lot more sense that Laurie would flee to the other side of the country to hide from Michael. And I would move out of Haddonfield too, especially before late October rolls around, since lots of people tend to die there around that time.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis elevates this film, giving us a protagonist not often seen in slasher films of this kind, mostly because few protagonists ever survive long enough to reach Laurie Strode's level of psychological damage and world weariness. Though I still miss the late, great Donald Pleasence in this film, Laurie Strode no longer needs Dr. Loomis' protection. Rather than telling the story of a timid young woman facing a threat she doesn't understand, Halloween H20 is the story of the survivor struggling with the aftermath, and a mature woman who knows exactly what she's up against and must summon the will to see the situation to its unavoidable end, for the good or the bad. It's the best possible resolution for one of horror's quintessential survivors.<br /><br />Being the seventh (!) installment in the franchise, it isn't without its homages. Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis' mother, a horror icon in her own right, famous for her shower death scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho) plays a rather motherly supporting role, and drives away in the same car she drove in Hitchcock's classic. One character is killed the exact same way one of the nurses is killed in Halloween II, and the film's finale is reminiscent of the finale of Halloween 4.<br /><br />This should have been the end of the franchise, a fitting swan song for an iconic movie monster who terrorized audiences for two decades and thecap to a story of one of cinema's most memorable protagonists coming full circle and finally getting the revenge and closure she deserves. Hollywood seems allergic to finality, always leaving room for the next sequel to make money off of. Halloween looked to be one of the rare exceptions when H20 was released, knowing that it had run its course and that it had an opportunity few of its contemporaries ever get - to say goodbye the right way. But like Michael Myers himself, the franchise never seems to die, no matter how many beatings it takes. H20 would be followed up with Halloween: Resurrection and later with Rob Zombie's own retread of the Halloween story, once again plunging the series into the gutter H20 had salvaged it from.<br /><br />TRIVIA: Your eyes aren't playing tricks on you if you think Michael Myers' signature white mask keeps changing throughout the course of the film. Apparently during production, Dimension Films never seemed satsified with the look of the mask, so it was repeatedly redesigned. Effects companies KNB and Stan WInston both worked on the mask, and even George Lucas' Indusrial Light & Magic had to be brought in to digitally correct the mask with a \\"CGI mask\\" during scenes that couldn't be reshot.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|I love this film.  I did not read the book on which it was based so I can't comment on its transfer to film but I can say that as an atmospheric, edge of your seat thriller this film is superb.  It is not perfect by any means.  The first time I watched it I was enthralled till the ending which sort of left me perplexed and made me unsure of the whole experience.  But this film is one where when they say it must be viewed twice they mean it.  Knowing the ending actually made a repeat viewing even better than the first.  I must note that after the first viewing I did enjoy it enough to purchase it.  I have now viewed it three times.  Of course we have two masters here - Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.  In less talented hands than Scorsese this film could have turned into a regular B horror film.  But Scorsese treats the slightly flawed script with respect and the directing, music, photography, editing and most of all acting make this a grade A film all the way.  Leonardo DiCaprio is now proving film after film just what a skilled actor he is.  For me this was the best performance of his career and shows him to be one of the best actors of this deacade.  And perfect performances are elicited from Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as well.  Actually this film was made with such precise decisions that even all the supporting roles down to the smallest ones are pitch perfect.  Of most note are Michelle Williams and Patricia Clarkson.<br /><br />The film begins with Leonardo DiCaprio as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels going with his new partner played by Ruffalo to Shutter Island which is an asylum for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate.  But no one is actually as they seem and truths about the island start to appear to Teddy and he realizes that things are sinister and there are many secrets here.  Then we get twists and turns galore that build to a very dramatic ending.  This is a film that must be viewed for it is cinema at its best.  We have the master director Scorsese turning an ok script into a suspense masterpiece.  From the beginning boat ride with the spooky atmospheric music you can sit back knowing you are going to have a super suspenseful ride.  Let the grade A directing and flawless acting bring you to another world.  I can't give this film 5 stars for the script is slightly flawed but I will view it over and over for the superb piece of film making it is.  And it makes a brilliant showing on blu ray.  The picture is very crisp and clarity superb.  Colors are brilliant and the whole experience will make you feel as if you are there.  Good film making still exists and here is a perfect example.e the master director Scorsese turning an ok script into a suspense masterpiece.

0307454541|4.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. Since I had already seen the movie, I thought the tension of trying to solve the mystery along with the main characters would not be there. However, there were several mysteries within the main mystery that weren't revealed in the movie, so there was still the excitement of \\"discovery\\" throughout the novel. Larsson's character development was excellent. His protagonists were unique but still very believable.<br /><br />Larsson's pacing was steady and slow, but the reader is rewarded with minor revelations often enough to keep even people who prefer a faster pace satisfied.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was a very satisfying read.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I am still learning how to use this watch to it's utmost!  On an almost daily basis I use the GPS, heartrate monitor and timer/pace settings.  I love the online tracking service through Garmin.  This is a great watch.  Each week I go online and watch another video on how to use the watch.  There is always something new I hadn't thought of yet.  I can't wait to try the course upload so I can follow the predetermined coordinates using my watch as my guide.  Just what I need to keep me interested in my daily runs.      I am a bigger guy and my only complaint is the watch band is almost too small.  I have to use it on the second to last hole on the band so the end keeper is useless.  The velcro band is not a better option.  I know, that doesn't really have anything to do with the function of the watch.  Just thought I would mention it.
B003DT194G|4.0|This is a phenomenal film.  An epic spaghetti western with incredible cinematography, a great musical score, and some wonderful performances.  The film rates a full five stars.  I've come to talk about the DVD.    The DVD I purchased is the 2010 single-disc release, with the cover featuring Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, and Henry Fonda, with Claudia Cardinale lying on the ground in front.    This barebones DVD comes in a black plastic keepcase (one of those ones with the cut-out \\"recycle\\" sign on the inside) and has no booklet insert.  The only bonus feature on the disc to complement to 165-minute film is an audio commentary featuring several Hollywood directors, film historians, cast, and crew.  In fact, it is the exact same disc released previously with a different cover.  The disc itself says \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" at the top and \\"Disc 1 - Feature and Commentary\\" at the bottom, apparently coming from an old 2-disc set.    I was fortunate enough to find this DVD at a popular retailer for a very agreeable bargain price.  I love the film and would like to someday see a nice 2-disc set loaded with extras.  (The film deserves it.)  But all I've been able to find are these no-frills one-disc DVDs.    This DVD was released (new cover art and all) in 2010 by Paramount Pictures.  (It says so on the back.)  So I doubt we'll see a proper \\"special edition\\" release on DVD in the near future.  (Blu-ray might still be a possibility...)  But if a better set should come out, I'd have no problems double-dipping since this DVD only cost me pocket change.    So if you can find this single-disc DVD for, say, five bucks, it can be a nice impulse buy.  I don't know if there are any better versions in the works, so if you love this movie (and don't already own it) I'd say just grab it if you have the chance.  I wouldn't hold out for a better version if the price is right for this one.
B000002KNY|5.0|Fear of Music is amazing for a variety of reasons.  First off, it's probably the Talking Heads best album because it features the most diversity of the bands early albums, which means unlike More Songs About Buildings & Food, *now* I can hear a remarkable difference in each song.      Secondly, Fear of Music arguably includes the best songwriting the band ever put down on record.  Each and every golden moment is truly astonishing thanks to a creative edge and extra attention to detail involving the vocal melodies (and just melody in general).  Every single song stands apart in a way that a band like the Beatles were able to master.    Third, Brian Eno's contributions really started to take effect by this point.  At least half of these songs are just flat out WEIRD but created in a really tasteful and melodic kind of way.  Yup, that's Brian Eno for you.  A true genius.  Both his solo career and with Roxy Music's early days respectively display his talents nicely.      Robert Fripp is among the guest musicians as well.  We all know how good HE is as part of the legendary prog rockers King Crimson.    All these extremely talented musicians contributing to an album by a band already pretty talented themselves adds up to a masterpiece waiting to happen... and sure enough!!    Let me describe some of the tunes for you.  \\"I Zimbra\\" is a funky dance number created with melody in mind.  I don't know if those chants are actual lyrics or just total nonsense, but it doesn't matter- this is the PERFECT way to introduce someone to the Talking Heads.  The lyrics in \\"Mind\\" are just absolutely terrific.  They make me think.  The fact it includes a really strong and almost psychedelic-sounding vocal melody allows me to pay attention to the lyrics even more.   This could very well be the very best song on Fear of Music, however... we're just getting started!      \\"Paper\\" is another really funky track, and that chorus sure seems bluesy.  I love it.  \\"Cities\\" reminds me of the experimental late 70's period of David Bowie with none other than, you guessed it, a collaboration with Brian Eno.  Amazing.  I simply love the lyrics about London and the darkness.      We all know \\"Life During Wartime\\".  All I can add is that in the context of hearing it on the album it appears on (instead of radio stations) I now appreciate the song even more.  I'm paying extra attention to the lyrics and those are *definitely* some really strange lyrics, haha.  Though I must say, it's kinda weird how the song suddenly fades away while the lead singer is still delivering more creative lyrics.  The song should have been about a minute longer.    \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" features an explosive and anthemic chorus, and I love it.  \\"Air\\" is a REALLY bizarre song.  That vocal melody feels like it's about 10 years older than it really is.  By that I mean, a song like this would fit in perfectly on an early Pink Floyd album.  \\"Heaven\\" is one of those ballad-like songs that's almost TOO normal for this bands standards, haha.  I guess it's not a true ballad though, because the lyrics don't quite match the flow of the rhythm or the quiet tone of the vocal melody.    I absolutely love \\"Animals\\".  These lyrics really touch upon the subject of trying to understand animals.  Seriously!  The way the lead singer describes how animals think, how they react... it's just a bit too unusual for any band to write a song like this, but in the whacky land of the Talking Heads, it's perfectly normal.      Now THAT'S what I call strange!  Yup, I'm talking about the verse melody you hear during \\"Electic Guitar\\".  Quite possibly the coolest way to write a vocal melody I've ever heard.  It certainly sounds like Brian Eno had a lot of fun coming up with some experimental tricks to give \\"Drugs\\" some much needed life.  Otherwise it would just be a fairly typical Talking Heads song.      I love this album to pieces.  I think it's one of the best albums of 1979 along with Neil Young's Rust Never Sleeps.  A must own.
0670034711|1.0|Initially I wasn't even going to give this \\"novel\\" one star, but, since it turned out to be the perfect width to stabilize my wobbly photo basket, I decided it wasn't totally worthless. I can't believe this made the NY Times Best Seller list. I'm astonished that someone thought it would make a good movie.
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|It's about all you could ask for in an inexpensive case.  It's not elegant, but it's able to hold my fairly large compact camera plus a spare battery.  It's also well padded enough so I don't worry about the occasional bump.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It is a sad thing to only see a show long after it has been discarded by it's creators. Firefly ran in 2002 for only a season. If it had ran longer one can only think that it would of spawned a star trek type following. the characters grow and evolve in the season.When I finished the last disk I was left wondering that's it how could they stop.Checking the actors after the shows untimely ending,I was gratified to see they all kept working. Talent such as theirs would truly be a crime to loose. Great show well worth the time to watch. Think ill go watch it again.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|I think I'm completely confused.  Something doesn't seem quite right with the Box.  The storyline in the beginning is about an old man who drops off a mysterious box in front of a families house real early in the morning.    Later on, the old man returns and explains to the couple (the wife specifically) what exactly will happens when she presses this button connected to the box.  Someone will then die.  It will be someone the wife doesn't know, but someone WILL in fact die.  However, the family will then receive 1 million bucks just for simply pressing the button.    It brings up an interesting question- would *you* push that button knowing how much money you'd receive, and considering how bad the economy is right now?  You could use it!    So the next 30 minutes is about the wife and husband asking each other whether they should press the button or not.  A good moment of detail is when the husband asks his wife if she believes she will feel any remorse for someone being killed that they don't even know.      The wife apparently has no sympathy whatsoever and doesn't care either way- she just wants the money because of all the problems the family is going through at the current time.      Anyway, what completely confuses me is just WHAT the heck happened?   The storyline seemed to point to a movie being about a crazy murderer on the loose and threatening random people around town... but then -to my total shock- the Box actually turns into a sci-fi???    Yup, that old man with a huge gash on the side of his face is actually someone who got strike by lightning, was killed, came back from the dead and turned into an alien.  I guess.  He has these amazing abilities that nobody else on the planet has, and considering so much of the storyline focus was about the planet Mars, I assume he was some kind of alien.      He sure loved giving people nosebleeds.  It seemed like everyone had a nosebleed at some point.    Oh well, the point is- the storyline shows absolutely NO signs of turning into a weird sci-fi flick, but that's exactly what the second half is about.  Oh sure, before the second half everyone was walking around acting a bit quiet and strange, but there's plenty of non-alien reasons for that!    I feel disappointed.  However, the fact that the storyline actually has some rather terrifying moments and tells a fairly easy to understand story makes me reconsider my initial reaction of giving it 3 stars.  It's actually a good movie, but it's not at ALL what I expected.  Keep that in mind.    Later on the storyline gets even better when the old man returns and put the wife and husband in *another* tricky situation with another life-changing decision.   What will they do?  How will they answer the question?  You'll have to watch it to find out.      I don't think I quite got the ending, but whatever.  We can't expect perfecton *all* the time!
0802130208|5.0|Although the \\"protagonist\\" of this novel is a uniquely obnoxious guy-you-love-to-hate, I found myself growing quite fond of the pompous, over-educated, under-achiever, Ignatius J. Reilly less than half way through the book. In fact, all the characters that populate Ignatius' world are extremely flawed but somehow likable. Make no mistake, you would probably not want to have any of these folks as friends or family, but they are certainly fun to \\"watch\\". Ignatius is totally oblivious to the wave of chaos he creates everywhere he goes. Sometimes I felt it would be more appropriate to cry at the situations Ignatius created, but I always wound up laughing instead. Indeed, I laughed out loud almost the entire time I was reading this book. Love, love, LOVED it! Definitely a \\"read again\\" (and again and again) selection
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is worth every penny, it tells the story of Rush vary wll, I have been a Rush fan since 1975, they are one of the most talented bands in history.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I never was a fan of Rod Stewart until he started recording these albums.  Have 2 now and can't wait to order the other 2.  I'm definitely a fan now.  Love to hear all of the songs I grew up singing.
B000EZ913I|2.0|This release in a word \\"pointless\\". Being pleased with most mofi releases i was ecstatic to see Notorious Byrd Brothers was getting \\"the treatment\\". I was expecting THE DEFINITIVE digital version! but alas , upon an A/B listen with the columbia redbook stereo remaster. To my ears the redbook is superior sonically not to mention the intended stereo mix. I was really hoping to be blown away hearing one of my favorites on sacd. Stick with the six dollar standard reissue.
0385121679|5.0|I read \\"The Shining\\" when it was first released. It was the first time I read a book that I just couldn't put down. I was practically hypnotized by this scary yet clever horror story about a haunted hotel. But, after reading it a second time 30 years later, I find the book is even better than I remembered. The first time I read \\"The Shining\\", I focused on the supernatural events and didn't appreciate the slow and steady reveal of the back story and the subtle nuances of the character development. Now I realize \\"The Shining\\" is so much more than a horror story about a haunted hotel. It is also a story about dysfunctional family dynamics, love, determination, loyalty, and much, much more. An exciting yet meaningful story with complex characters.
B003RGTIIY|5.0|While Vince Neil did have a couple of cover versions under his belt already as a member of Motley Crue, this \\"soundtrack\\" to his forthcoming memoirs ends up shedding a brighter, positive light on his distinctive yet underrated vocals. The covers of The Sex Pistols' \\"No Feelings\\" and Cheap Trick's \\"He's A Whore\\" alone are worth the price of the entire CD alone - and also underline the fact that Vince's vocal stylings are the ultimate crossing of Robin Zander and Johnny Rotten. Vince's cover of \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\" also allows him to explore the lower reaches of his vocals, something we don't normally get to hear him do in Motley Crue.     Although I'm of similar age/generation to Vince, I can't compare every song he covers here to their originals (I'm not familiar with the original versions of Sweet's \\"AC/DC\\" and the Scorpions' \\"Another Piece of Meat\\", to be honest), but Vince is in fine voice throughout the album and his solo backup band isn't exactly sleepwalking through these songs (although, given that ten of the twelve songs are covers, it's more than likely that the recording sessions for them weren't as taxing as the two originals and were probably a lot more fun to do). It's not a groundbreaking album, but as both a fun summer/car ride listen and an insight into Vince Neil as a vocalist, it's perfect.

B003HKN51Q|5.0|This blue-raye edition of Elvis On Tour, which has never been available even on a dvd format and has been pretty much kept under wraps by MGM for several decades, is quite a revelation both with regards to its superior sound and picture quality as well as showcasing a very robust and physical performance from Elvis himselfish. Superior camaera direction by noted cimematographer Lucien Ballaed, who also handled the same duties on Elvis Thats The Way It Is which came out two years before this Golden Globe winning documentary and featured his return to live performance in Las Vegas and was probably captured at the peek of his physicality as a performer and showed an amazingly goodlooking and charismatic vocalist who could pretty much out-sing anybody in the business this side of Roy Orbison or Charlie Rich, is one of the many talanted people who was involved in the making of this superior film.    Some fans will note that Elvis is not quite as tan or fit as in the previous documentary, and he would look and sound even better a year later in the Aloha From Hawaii concert special also highly recommended in its deluxe format though not yet available in Blue-ray format, still features amazingly great sound and majestic vocals by Presley. What this film does capture is the frantic excitment and thrill of the Elvis mystic as he powers through 15 concerts in 15 days while Elvis's own words serve as an occassional naration to the hysteria and raw excitment of his fandom.    Elvis uses and demonstrate his love for karate which he lets flow naturally, but forcefully through his various bodily gyrations timed perfectly to the rhythem of Ronnie Tutt's stellar drum work, especially during Polk Salad Annie and Proud Mary. Elvis' voice reaches new highs and crescendos on American Triology and his absolutely majestic version of Bridge Over Troubled Water.     The split screen photography, which I thought I might find annoying or distracting, really makes you feel like you are there live in the arena with the King. No less a figure than famed director Martin Scorsese over saw much of the montage technique that was used in several parts of the film. This is a superior concert film which captures Elvis in some surprising and intimate moments backstage with his backing singers doing what he really loved best, singing spirituals into the wee hours of the morning, not for money or acclaim, but because he needed to and wanted to!

0446567337|3.0|I had only read one other Nicholas Sparks novel before this one ('The Notebook', which I loved), and I had not seen the movie adaptation before reading this novel (now I have, didn't care for it). I thought this was an okay book, it felt kind of empty to me though. I felt like there wasn't enough character development in this book, I really didn't care what happened to either of the two main characters. The thing that I was most interested in was the relationship between John and his father. I liked that story and would have enjoyed a longer story based on that alone. I was just disappointed in this book. I had had high hopes for it, had heard very good things about it. I was let down, unfortunately. I did not like the ending at all. I can't get into it on here without giving away too much, but I will say that I didn't find it believable at all. I don't see that situation ever happening in real life, ever. It was put in to seem romantic and selfless, but it backfired.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Just watched this movie and all I can say is...amazing!! It has a great blend of story, fighting, and history. I would rank it up there with Fearless, Drunken Master, The Protector, Ong Bak, and Enter The Dragon. If your a martial arts movie buff, this movie is for you.
B003H6KRIE|3.0|These play just like the original ones, but their cases are not like usual slim-profile blu-rays. Hence, it takes half inch of more space in the shelve. I just couldn't resist from saying it :-)  If I knew that it would be coming out in this thick package, I wouldn't buy it LoL.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|As the old saying goes: \\"don't judge a book by its cover.\\"    I've been waiting to Clash of Titans for a long time now; ever since I saw the amazing trailer I couldn't wait. Recently, it came out on PPV so I ordered it of course. Seeing that it starred Sam Worthington (Avatar) and Liam Neeson (Batman Begins), I figured I was in for an awesome movie that I'd watch a few times over.    Boy was I wrong.    Spoilers herein:    The main problem that I had with the movie is that it moved too fast. Now, being 2 hrs long, you'd think that would leave enough time for character development and other things the director looked over. Guess not. The main character, named Perseus, has so few lines I was startled; you don't get to hear much from him and sadly the only lines he has are rather cringe-worthy and just downright cheesy.    The movie stops every 40 minutes to have him deliver some rallying speech to the people he's taken with him to kill the Medusa/Kraken/Hades and that was rather annoying; considering the \\"speech\\" is about twenty words or so. I didn't feel inspired like I usually would at that kind of point in a movie.    Not to mention in about 10 minutes all the people he's taken with him die. I was so disturbed at that point I nearly turned it over. One death after the other. I couldn't really be sad about them dying because the movie didn't even let you get to know them, but I kept wondering who the hell wrote the script, who decided it was a good idea to just kill off everyone.    Oh, but there's one more person alive! Perseus makes his way out of the place with Medusa's head to find his love standing there! But all of a sudden a bad man comes and kills her.    Damn.    Clearly not phased at all (seriously look at Worthington's face, it's absolute stone) he gets up and Pegasus comes to take him off into the sunset.    Well.    The last bit is just downright disenchanting; all Perseus does is point the Medusa's head at the Kraken and it's gone. Talk about anti-climatic. Not to mention that he didn't even kill Hades, only sent him to the Underworld. Pointless.    The acting is bad. Sam Worthington's voice is flat and Liam Neeson doesn't deliver like I know he can. They both don't fit the roles. The guy who played Draco was okay, I guess. Otherwise the emotionless voices are terrible and a real throw-off especially during certain scenes.    The good things in this movie:    CGI is spectacular. This is definitely a movie made for 3D. The flying demon things are very fluid and the scorpions are cool looking as well as the Kraken. The Djinn were fantastic and I have to say the one they took with them was my favorite character (who they killed off as well).    Pegasus was a treat to look at and when Hades comes and the darkness moves around him like big black wings it will take your breath away.    The action scenes are nice and long but aren't boring. The violence is kept to a minimum and most of it is just acrobatics and finesse (check out the backwards flips!).    Visually, the movie is astounding; but the terrible acting as well as the too-fast pace will make it a one-time viewing.
B0026P40NU|1.0|I cannot believe anyone who cared for the Pre-Raphaelites had anything to do with this production. After the first two episodes, I considered it passable, though I thought John Ruskin was treated shabbily. After that, it all went downhill. I finally threw up my hands and howled at the protrayals of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones; it was evident that the script writer knew NOTHING about the two men, who were made to look like imbiciles, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum in matching purple waistcoats. William Morris was a true polymath: father of the arts and crafts movement, socialist, medievalist, calligraphist, printer, and early environmentalist, and to dismiss him, as this travesty does, as a loutish, stammering fool, is unforgivable.    Though some critics have praised the set design, no one has pointed out the ham-fisted attempts to reproduce some of the artists' paintings used in the production. You did not need a book to hand to see how wretched Rossetti's \\"Bocca Baciata\\" was rendered. And whilst on the subject -- why on earth would you have a script that went beyond the original PRB? Jane Morris was so striking as to be impossible to cast. Only a credulous fool could suspend disbelief long enough to credit that the actress playing the role could inspire the lust Rossetti feels when they first meet. She looks NOTHING like Jane Morris.    If anyone out there wants to know a little about Rossetti, Morris, Ruskin, and Burne-Jones, they ought to read:  Oswald Doughty's and Jan Marsh's biographies of Rossetti  Fiona MacCarthy's magisterial biography of William Morris  Tim Hilton's exhaustive biography of John Ruskin  Lady Burne-Jones's Memorials of her husband (and the forthcoming biography of Burne-Jones, by Fiona MacCarthy).    \\"Desperate Remedies\\" is a desperate, rubbish treatment of these four men, in particular.    Give this a miss.
